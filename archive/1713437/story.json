You sure were lucky that you won that sweepstakes back home. The one that got you this vacation. The sea is a crystal blue, the sun is shining, the fish are jumping, the clouds are thundering.......Wait, clouds? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes and see some dark clouds on the horizon to the west. You can hear their booming thunder from here. You lay back in your chair, not worrying about it. It'll probably pass right over you, you think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKATHOOM!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLightning flashes through the sky, as rain pounds on the ships deck. You were caught unaware by the storm, and try desperatley to get to your cabin. You run across the deck, slipping on the rain soaked surface. You are drenched, it'll take you weeks to get dry again. The storm churns the sea, waves rock the ship back and forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawl across the deck on your belly, trying to get back to your feet. Suddenly, a massive wave rams into the side of the ship, splashing over the deck, sweeping you away with it, across the deck, into the sea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waves toss you around through the water like a rag doll. You open your mouth to yell for help, but it is filled with salty water. There is no hope for you now. Your vision begins to fade, as you sink below the waves. You stare at the rippling surface of the water as everything goes black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you can breathe again! You open your eyes. You're laying face down on an island beach. You lift your face out of the sand, staring at your surroundings. You have no idea where you could be. You didn't even know there were any islands nearby. On the edge of the beach is a thick jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wobbly get onto your feet and trudge across the beach, still soaking wet. The jungle is lush and humid, with many different animal calls sounding in the distance. You make your way through the jungle, pushing branches and brush aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as you step on a pile of palm leaves,you hear a loud cracking sound, as the leaves crumble beneath you, and you fall into a pit. Spilntered bamboo and leaves lay all around you as you look up to the top. The pit is at least ten feet deep, and there is nothing you can use as footholds to climb out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit at the bottom of the pit for over an hour, hoping someone comes and finds you. Then you hear voices. \"Hey! We caught something!\" Staring down at you, is the strangest creature you've ever seen. It is at least ten feet tall, and appears to be female. It was dressed in a a grass skirt, and a leather bra. But the strangest thing, was that it appeared to be a skunk! Or at least, a skunk with a humanoid body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother one of the creatures appeared beside it, this one was a fox. They both carried long spears, with golden spearheads. \"What is it?\" The fox asked to the skunk. \"Whatever it is, it isn't one of us. Therefore, we should take it to our ruler, and let her decide what to do with it.\" The skunk reaches down and grabs you by the wrist. She single handedly pulls you out of the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey tie a think vine around your wrists, and pull you along with them. You forcefully follow them through the jungle, dreading what might become of you. Suddenly, the jungle breaks, opening into an Aztec-like city. They continue to drag you though the city streets, which are populated by more of these anthro beings, who stare at you, as though they're never seen a human before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey bring you to the steps of an enormous, grand palace, big enough to be a city on it's own. They drag you inside, to an elaborate throne room. They force you onto your knees, facing the floor. \"My empress.\" Says the skunk. \"We captured this man in the jungle. What shall we do with him?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring him to me.\" You hear another voice say. You are forcefully shoved towards the massive throne. You stumble as you gaze up at the biggest thing you've ever seen. It's another anthro, at least three football fields high! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, what anthro is it?                        </span></div></div>",

She was dressed in a long white silk skirt that went down to her ankles, a white top with gold lining, and a gold tiara on her head, that went well with her red hair that went down to her shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here.\" She said. Her voice sounded gentle, but you weren't sure you could trust her. You timidly took a step toward her. She reached down with one huge,black furred hand and picked you up between her fingers. You legs ran in the air as you were lifted off the floor, and dropped into her palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to see two giant blue eyes staring at you. \"What is your name?\" She asked. \"J....j......Jake.\" You stutter. \"Don't be afraid.\" She said kindly. \"I won't hurt you. Now, how did you get here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell here your story, wondering what will become of you when you are done. She listens intently, then pauses after you finish, deep in thought. \"Let me fill you in.\" She says. \"You are on the island of Anthromia. I am their ruler, Mihal. We have long been hidden from your kind, and we want to keep it that way. So, I'm afraid we can't let you leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" You exclaim. \"Now now, don't fret.\" She says. \"While your here, you'll be my guest. Don't worry, me and my servants will take good care of you.\" She places your on her shoulder and gets up from her throne. You keep you balance by holding on to the fur on her neck. Now you see why this palace is so huge! Her head nearly touches the ceiling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walks through the halls of her palace. \"Your lucky you got here when you did.\" She says. \"Your just in time to join me for.......\"   </span></div></div>",

You see, every month we each set aside a small portion of whatever food we've harvested. By the end of the year, this pool of food will have grown into a grand feast. It's our way of celebrating another year of hard work. And luckily for you, you've arrived just in time to take part in it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're inviting me to be a part of your special tradition?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! Like I said, you shall be our guest here from now on! It's only fair that you get to experience everything that our kind has to offer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Well, thank you very much Your Majesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there is no need for such formalities Jake. Please, just call me Mihal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, Mihal. I'd be honored to join you for your feast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then smile at the 200 foot tall vixen with great joy. Mihal simply giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jake, you're so cute. I think that I might really enjoy having you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihal then begins walking. Finally, you and the massive fox queen arrive in an enormous banquet hall. There is are several tables lined up in the room that seemed to be around twice as big as a normal, human sized table, but these were all still dwarfed by Mihal's massive stature nonetheless. There was then one massive table that seemed to be designed for her. Your eyes then focused on an incredible sight: In the center of the room, an enormous pile of various fruits, vegetables, meats, and other foods was gathered on a tray the size of a baseball field! There was so much food piled on the tray that the stack came all the way up to Mihal's waist! It may have only been half her size, but staring at a 100 foot tall pile of food was an amazing sight to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear the sound of a gong being rung. Like clockwork, the entire banquet hall was quickly flooded by at least 100 different anthro girls! Mihal then spoke out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings and congratulations, girls, for another successful year of hard work! You should all be very proud of yourselves for what you have done. May our village continue to prosper in everlasting peace!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe various amazons around the room let out cheers as their ruler finished her speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now girls, before we begin our feast, I have one more announcement to make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cheers turned to confused murmurs, as the girls didn't have any idea what could be on their queen's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, we have a new guest here on our island.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihal plucks you from her shoulder and sets you down amongst the other villagers before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His name is Jake, and he will be staying with us from now on. I expect that you shall all treat our guest with the utmost respect. As far as I'm concerned, he's one of us now. Please try to show him the ropes and aid his integration into our society... That will be all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amazons glance around at each other in confusion once more before all resting their eyes on Jake. Their attitude toward him is...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'm the queen you can't decline my invitation\" she says still walking, she picks you up for a second and looks at you \"are you saying you don't think me beautiful?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the problem\" you say, you were kind of a furry fan but even if you weren't Mihal looked absolutely gorgeous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then why do you not wish to bathe with me\" Mihal says putting you back on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you have a problem with someone you barely know seeing you naked?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure are an interesting one\" Mihal says. \"No I do not mind being seen by one of you're race\" she says turning around a corner and you can feel the air get warmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the queen, it is an honor to be able to see me naked\" Mihal says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, whatever\" you say resigning to yourself to what was to come. Mihal walks into a stone room with a square basin in the center which is being fed by what you can only assume is a nearby hot spring as the water was steaming. She puts you down on the edge of the basin and you have to flail you're arms a bit to keep you're balance, you hear her clothes land near you and you take that as a cue to get undressed. You slip into the water as it was nice and warm and you feel more then see Mihal enter next to you. You just float for a bit until you feel her poke you, \"excuse me Jake but I have an itch would you scratch it?\" she asks pointing to a place on her back. She leans against the side of the basin and you climb up and walk over to her back. You reach over and start scratching the spot she indicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh that feels heavenly\" Mihal says leaning forward, however you put some of you're weight on her so when she leaned too far forward you fall in, not really hurt but a bit suprised. She pulls you out of the water and smiles at you \"you just showed up and you are already proving useful to me, I'm very glad I made you my guest\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, can you put me back into the water?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I don't think I will\" Mihal says smiling, \"a queen can't owe a favour to anyone\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look think nothing of it, if you really want to feel better you can think of putting me down as repayment\" you say. She brings you up to her eye and stares at you for a bit, \"you know for a human you're not half bad looking\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but can you put me down it's kind of cold\" you say. Finally she puts you down in the water and it felt heavenly after being surrounded by the cold air, but the part of you Mihal was holding felt very warm. You swim for a bit trying to figure out just how big this basin you were in really was and you estimate it was about 10 times Mihal's size so about 30 football fields long and 9 wide. You look up and notice Mihal is staring at you, \"is there something wrong you're majesty?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, nothing is wrong, just for some reason I can't stop staring at you, have you cursed me, is this human magic?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I haven't cursed you, if I had this whole place would be under my control already\" you say jokingly but she just stares at you stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a joke, humans are no more capable of sorcery then you are\" you say. You however are corrected a second later as a small blue flame appears on Mihals finger, she twirls it and the flame follows. \"Ok I stand corrected I guess you can use sorcery\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm so someone small enough not to disobey and can't use sorcery to try to overthrow me you just keep looking better and better\" Mihal says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In what way?\" you ask confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a canidate to be my king, you will then have no reason to leave and you won't try to betray me\" Mihal says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah woah woah, shouldn't that kind of thing be decided on ya know love\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see what mating has to do with it\" Mihal says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No the feeling of love, you know the feeling you get when you truly care about someone and you want to protect them no matter what\" you say. Mihal stares at you confused. You sigh and swim up next to her, \"you're majesty can I give you a hug?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you may\" she replies. You swim up and hug her breast which was about you're size. You swim back a bit, \"did you feel anything?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strange, when you hugged me my body felt warmer then the water, are you sure you don't know sorcery\" Mihal says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's the beginning of love, not sure why you'd feel it about me\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you are pretty cute for a human, easy to manage, there's just one more thing\" Mihal says. She stands up and sits on the edge of the basin, she picks you up and puts you on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um what are you doing?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to scratch my ears\" she says. You shrug and reach over and scratch one of her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh that feels great, you are definitley worth keeping around little one, never have I received such a pleasing ear scratch\" Mihal says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" you say scratching harder and apparently well enough to have Mihal sink into the basin and lay there sighing. You stop after a minute and you feel yourself picked up and Mihal holds you in front of her face. \"You are definitley worth watching little one\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Jack not little one\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Jack, you have piqued my interest, so not only will you stay as a guest you will stay as my personal guest\" Mihal says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means the queen herself will watch over you, you should feel honored\" Mihal says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I do\" you say. Mihal places you down near you're clothes and throws you a towel which you use to cover yourself and your clothes as Mihal shakes herself dry. You quickly dry yourself off and you see Mihal looking down at you. She picks you up and places you down on her shoulder and starts walking with a purpose. You can tell she's heading somewhere but you aren't really sure where. She seems to loop around the whole castle before coming up to a kitchen, she grabs a few slices of meat cut from you really weren't sure what and a mug full of again you really weren't sure what before walking back to her throne room. She sits down and the food and drink in front of her before putting you down in front of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this for me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, you must be hungry\" Mihal says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I am kind of hungry\" you say smelling the meat. It didn't smell weird so you ripped off a small bit, it didn't taste bad, heck it tasted like chicken. You start eating and you quickly eat you're fill, you try to drink from the mug but it was bigger then you were. \"A little help?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I think you should figure out how to drink it yourself\" Mihal says through giggles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\" you say, you climb onto the handle of the mug and you're just able to keep you're balance while you drink you're fill, Mihal however gives you a small push so you fall into the mug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh now where'd Jack go\" Mihal says picking up the mug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey that wasn't necesscary\" you say as Mihal brings the mug up to her mouth. You're given a very god look at the inside as Mihal tilts the mug and you're just able to hold onto the sides, falling onto her muzzle as she shuts it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh there you are\" Mihal says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not very nice to try to kill you're guests\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't going to kill you, you have too much to offer to kill\" Mihal says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but please never do that again\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a request?\" Mihal asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\" Mihal says you were sure smiling but considering you were laying on top of her muzzle you couldn't see. She picks you off and puts you on her shoulder. The same skunk anthro that found you before walks in and bows \"You're majesty it's time for\"</span></div></div>",

Mihal stands up and exits the room walking through halls with ornate marble pillars that would have probably taken normal people 10s if not 100s of years to carve. \"Wow who made all the beautiful architecture?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me!\" Mihal replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're really talented\" you say admiring another pillar as you pass it. You enter an ornate dining hall with a table that well you really weren't sure how long it was, all along it were raised chairs with small ladders on them so everyone would sit at a level height with Mihal. Mihal heads to her seat and puts you down on the table \"you can sit here, right next to me\" Mihal says. A Cobra anthro sits in the chair next to where you were and this is when you notice all probable 500 individuals at the table seemed to be anthros, and they were all female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a joyous occasion for our island, I have finally found our king\" Mihal says lifting you up. The applause from the girls was deafening, \"now it is time for a feast\" Mihal says. Some people left to go get food, and soon the table was filled with all sorts of fruit as well as that weird pigish meat thing you saw before. Everyone begins eating except the cobra who leans over to you. \"Sssooo you are to be our king, will you have a concubine?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...what? No I will not\" you whisper back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come now it'ssss very important for usss to have assss many children as possssible\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, i'm going to be Mihal's and hers alone\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All it would take issss the act of child-rearing and you're part would be done\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the last time in no way am I going to fuck you all\" you yell, problem is the room had gone deathly quiet. You slowly turn to see everyone staring at you and there's an eruption of applause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh what did I do?\" you ask Mihal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just said you'd give children to everyone didn't you?\" Mihal says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...uh...\" you turn to see the cobra girl smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....I guess so\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, well then everyone if you wouldn't mind i'll be his first\" Mihal says picking you up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what about the feast?\" you ask as she gets up and starts walking with a purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can wait\" Mihal says. Mihal quickly enters her chambers and strips before you, you had already seen everything once but this time for some reason you stood there transfixed. \"Take em off or I rip em off\" Mihal says a primal urge entering her voice. Needless to say you stripped, the next 5-6 hours you were poked, prodded, shoved, squeezed, massaged, bruised, licked, and inserted. You really weren't sure how many times you had released into Mihal but it had to be atleast 10, as for how many times she had, well you were easily soaked enough to prove she had done it a lot. You were lifted up from her nether regions and Mihal smiled down at you \"never have I received such pleasure before, you are definitely my king\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh thanks\" you say. Mihal licks you for a bit cleaning any leftover juices off of you before snuggling you into her chest. \"Mmmm I am very glad that you ended up here\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too I guess\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is wrong, you sound displeased, was I not good enough?\" Mihal asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the problem\" you say laying down, \"this is just a bit much for me to take in, I mean in less than a day I went from vacationing. to being stranded on an island with giant animal women, to becoming a king and having to give all those women children\" you say. \"That and I think i'm falling in love with their queen\" you say. Mihal smiles down at you, \"so what is the trouble then?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I only want to make love with one fox, namely you\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will only make love with me, the rest are just for the purpose of child-rearing\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mihal\" you say burying yourself in her fur, \"You're welcome Jack\" she replies. You fall asleep next to her and you weren't expecting that to be the last time in a while. You spent the next 2 months child-rearing as they called it with about 3 different girls a night. Some took it more gently with you like a mouse girl named Jasmine and a dog girl named Elizabeth. Some however just went totally primal like Tyra the tigress or Keira the cobra who you met at the dinner table. Luckily for you a week after the last woman had been reared everyone including Mihal were walking around with more pronounced bellies telling you that it had been a success. All of the girls you passed said hi and most either smiled or waved as well. You headed to Mihal's chamber and you found her propped up on the bed eating what looked like a giant apple. \"Hello my king\" she says as you enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi\" you reply as you walk up and scale up the side of the huge bed. You walk over and lay up against her pronounced stomach, \"you're child's getting bigger\" Mihal says happily rubbing her stomach. \"Yeah, only a few more months and i'll be a father\" you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will and there will be a celebration across the island and everyone will attend\" Mihal says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah..... i'm really not sure if i'm ready to be a parent\" you say laying back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Mihal asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well judging from you're size, the kid's probably gonna be as big or bigger then I am to start off with\" you say \"and it'll just grow bigger making my job that much harder\" you say sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be a wonderful father\" Mihal says, \"just like you're a wonderful lover\" she continues picking you up and nuzzling against you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mihal\" you say hugging her cheek. She smiles and lays you down near her, \"so have you come up with a name yet?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a few months till it's born I think a name can wait\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want one now\" Mihal says whining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, how about we come up for one if it's a boy and one for if it's a girl\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mihal if it's a girl and Casey if it's a boy\" Mihal says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"nah, how about Kelly if it's a girl, and Jim if it's a boy\" you reply. Mihal shakes her head. \"Fine\" you say. You bounce ideas off each other for a good 20 minutes before both agreeing upon the names Kevin and Yasmin. You lay out on Mihal's chest and she strokes you're back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Jack\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For what?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've given me a child, and you've made me so happy\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well same for me\" you say snuggling up. You feel Mihal drape a hand over you and you fall asleep content to just lay atop her stomach. You're woken up a few hours later to the feeling of something kicking; 1,2,3,4 there were 4 kicks, no way could a kid kick that fast unless. \"Oh great she's pregnant with twins\" you think to yourself as you fall back asleep higher up on her body so the kicking won't disturb you. You fall asleep again and wake up to the sound of birds chirping and light streaming in. You stretch and yawn and you feel a long wet surface slide over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning\" Mihal says finishing her lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good \"blech\" morning\" you say wiping her spit off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I thought you'd like to be licked awake\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, but just a simple light shake or a kiss would work better\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright\" Mihal says leaning down and kisses you, trapping you under her hand before she lets go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" you say as you try to get up but she keeps you pinned under her. \"Hey Mihal you can let me up\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until you tell me what you learned last night, I can tell you know something just not what\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you're pregnant with twins not a single kid\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"EEEE\" Mihal squeals and sits up rapidly. \"Do you know how good that news is?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, why?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've always reproduced one child, to one mother, always needing the help of some wandering male or an outsider to reproduce\" Mihal says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's a boy then we can finally sustain our own population\" Mihal says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's excellent\" you say. The next few months fly by as everyone heard the news and waited for Mihal's birth. The day finally arrives and.....</span></div></div>",

On the other side you hear voices and yells coming from Mihal. \"You're almost there my queen! Push!\" You hear a voice say. Another cry of pain comes from inside. You feel really sorry for Mihal, her having to go through this. But she said so herself, this would be a joyous occasion for the island. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the door opens, and a cheetah anthro steps out. \"It's done.\" She says smiling. \"Congratulations! You're a father!\" She leads you into the room. She lifts you up and places you on the bed at Mihal's feet. There she lay, holding the twins in her arms, a huge smile on her face, tears of joy in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my King!\" She says as you walk toward her. The twins are wrapped in wool blankets, both of them sound asleep. \"It's just as we had hoped!\" She says excitedly. \"One of them is a male! Say hello to Kevin and Yasmin.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a look at your new children. They are both red foxes like their mother, except there is a major difference with the Kevin. He has the head of a fox, and the body of a human! \"He looks just like you!\" Says Mihal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile. \"Except he has your eyes. And nose. and ears.\" You both laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe news of the new princess and the first prince in the island's history quickly spread, and there is to be a grand celebration. Mihal walks through the streets, a baby in each arm, and you on her shoulder. The other anthros throw confetti around and cheer. Later, and feast is held. You sit next to Mihal, eating a particularly good piece of that strange meat, as the other amazons come up and congratulate the both of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the feast, some amazons begin playing music on wooden flutes and drums, and there was much dancing. Mihal held you in her palm while she slowly stepped about, dancing with you as best as she could. \"I love you.\" She says. \"I love you too.\" You say back. She holds you to her breast and hugs you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you think, \"Now I'm a father, and a king. And there are many more children on the way.

You had a slight headache, due to having a little too much wine at the celebration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it.\u201d You said to Mihal. \u201cI didn\u2019t drink anywhere near as much as you. How come I have a headache, and you\u2019re completely fine?\u201d Mihal giggled. \u201cCould be our wine is different then what you have where you come from. Or maybe because I\u2019m much larger than you, and can handle more than you can.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay back on top of Mihal and sigh. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Asks Mihal. \u201cWell.\u201d You say. \u201cI always told myself I would never have kids. That I never wanted to fall in love.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d Asks Mihal. \u201cBecause I never really trusted women.\u201d You say. \u201cYou trust me don\u2019t you?\u201d Asks Mihal. \u201cOf course.\u201d You say. \u201cUntil I met you, I had never been in love with anyone. Yet here I am, in love with giant fox, and with children.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihal smiled. \u201cThen I guess we were just meant to be.\u201d She holds her hand out and you climb into her palm. She holds you to her cheek and nuzzles you. You hug back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have something for you.\u201d Says Mihal as she sets you down on her chest. \u201cSomething very special. I can only give it to someone I can absolutely trust, and I think you fit that description.\u201d She puts her hand over her mouth and begins coughing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d You ask. She nods as she coughs again, and something lands in her hand. She grips the object between her fingers and holds it out to you. It is a large spherical ruby, that seems to glow with a bright red light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake it.\u201d Says Mihal. You reaches out and touch the ruby. It istantly shrinks to a small down to the size of your fist, as you hold it in your palm. \u201cThat is the Orabos Stone.\u201d Says Mihal. \u201cIt is an artifact of ghreat power. It will grant its\u2019 owner  nearly any desire\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou had this in your stomach?\u201d You ask, a little bit grossed out. \u201cI had to keep it in a safe place.\u201d Says Mihal. \u201cI thought there would be no safer place than in there.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn the glowing red orb over in your hands. \u201cHow does it work?\u201d You ask. \u201cJust hold it, and concentrate on what you want. Of course it does have certain limitations.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike what?\u201d You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFor starters, it glows because it is full of magical energy. With each wish you make, the glow will get dimmer and dimmer. Eventually, it will go dead. It takes a hundred years for it to fully charge again, so wish wisely.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you just use this to bring back the males population of the island?\u201d You ask. \u201cThat\u2019s another limit it has.\u201d Says Mihal. \u201cIt can\u2019t create living beings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare into the glow of the stone. It feels warm in your hands, like a flame. \u201cThank you Mihal.\u201d You say, kissing her on the nose. \u201cI promise I will use this for good. I only wish I had something for you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have already given me a gift.\u201d Says Mihal. \u201cYou have given me love, and you have given me children.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven so.\u201d You say. \u201cThere\u2019s something I want to do for you.\u201d You hold the stone in your hands and concentrate. The gem\u2019s glow becomes a little dimmer, as you feel the energy surge within the jewel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA violin and bow appear at your feet. You set the stone down and pick them up. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d Asks Mihal. \u201cIt\u2019s called a violin.\u201d you say. \u201cIt\u2019s a musical instrument. This is my gift for you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pull the bow across the strings, playing a melodious tune. The flow of music you create is almost enchanting. It\u2019s hard to believe you\u2019re just making up the whole thing as you go. When you finish, Mihal hugs you to her cheek again. \u201cThat was beautiful.\u201d She says. \u201cBut you\u2019re even more beautiful.\u201d You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihal giggles. \u201cI will always love you.\u201d She says, kissing you. \u201cLikewise.\u201d You say.    </span></div></div>",

Mihal is always there when they want to play, to make sure they don\u2019t end up hurting you. They are starting to teethe, and are at the stage where they like to chew on things, including you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihal has already had to pull you out of their mouths twice. You still have some teeth marks on you from them. You hated to admit it, but you were kind of afraid of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would often go on walks through the city, just to get away from them for a while. It was sad, but what else could you do? On one such walk, you were approached by a mysterious figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was covered from head to toe in a brown cloak. Her face was shrouded in shadow from her hood. The strange thing was that she was shorter than the other anthros, about your size. \u201cMy liege.\u201d She said. \u201cYou must come with me at once, there is a terrible emergency!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat got your attention. \u201cLead the way.\u201d You say. She turns and jogs ahead of you. you follow her through the city streets, out into the jungle. She leads you through the tall grass and ferns to a small clearing surrounded by trees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly stops. \u201cSo, what\u2019s the emergency?\u201d You say, catching your breath. \u201cThere is no emergency.\u201d She says, not turning around. \u201cWhat? You brought me here for nothing?\u201d You say, irritated. \u201cWho do you think you are. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath her hood, the figure smirks. \u201cDo you not recognize me?\u201d You\u2019re getting really annoyed now. \u201cNo! How can I recognize you if I can\u2019t even see your face?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure turns and lets her cloak slide off of her to the ground. She is a black panther, with glowing yellow eyes, and long black hair down to her waist. She is dressed in a long, blood red skirt and sleeveless top that exposes her trim her belly. She wears two golden bracers on her forearms, and a gold circlet around her head. At her side is a golden sword, sheathed in a black scabbard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAm I familiar now?\u201d She asks, grinning. Now you do recognize her. You have seen images of her painted on the palace walls. \u201cI\u2019ve seen you before.\u201d You say. \u201cBut I do not know your name.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am Morgana, Goddess of War.\u201d You jaw nearly hits the ground. \u201cYou\u2019re a goddess?\u201d You say, in awe. \u201cIndeed I am.\u201d She says. \u201cWhy did you bring me here?\u201d You ask. She grins. \u201cSo I can have you all to myself.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to back away in fear as she steps toward you. \u201c Now, now, don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d She says. \u201cI\u2019m about to make you an offer you won\u2019t be able to resist.\u201d You back into a tree, and she presses herself against you. \u201cWhat do you say we take this someplace more\u2026\u2026..comfortable?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world around you begin to fade and waver, like a mirage. Everything is being distorted. Suddenly, you find yourself in a green field with an orange sky, a golden sun setting on the horizon. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d You ask, looking around at the sudden change of scenery. <br>\r\n\u201cThis is Nirvala, the home of the gods.\u201d says Morgana. \u201cCome with me, I\u2019ll take you to my palace.\u201d She leads you through the field to a building. made of black marble and gold, designed like a Greek temple. guarding the entrance is two anthros in golden armor and red capes, In their hands the hold spears and large round shields with strange symbols painted on them. They bow as Morgana passes, leading you through a long, black marble hall, illuminated by glowing white crystals in the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are they?\u201d You ask. \u201cMy personal guards, the Furkuries. Mortals given the honor of serving me in the afterlife. I based them off of my favorite warriors, the ones you people call Spartans.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c You know about human warriors?\u201d You ask. \u201cOf course.\u201d She says. \u201c I admire humans rather fondly. Mainly because you are always at war with each other. It\u2019s amazing your kind aren\u2019t extinct, especially with the amazing weapons you create. Although, I prefer fighting your enemy close and personal. Killing them from a distance is cowardly if you ask me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leads you to her throne room. Two servants, a fox and a skunk, dressed in purple gowns, run up to her. \u201cMistress Morgana, who is this?\u201d Says the skunk, indicating you. \u201cHe is my guest. I want you to bring me a bottle of my special wine.\u201d Unknown to you, when she says \u201cspecial\u201d She winks to the skunk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, mistress.\u201d Says the skunk, bowing before running off. Morgana points to the fox. \u201cYou, prepare us dinner.\u201d The fox bows as well and heads for the kitchens. You notice that Morgana is shorter than her servants. \u201cWhy are you my size, instead ten feet tall like the others?\u201d You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can be any size I want.\u201d Says Morgana as she leads you to the dining room. \u201cI just thought you would be more comfortable around me if I were down to your level.\u201d You both sit at a table carved from black marble like everything else in the palace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you want with me?\u201d You ask. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you after the meal.\u201d The servants bring out a large roasted bird, though you couldn\u2019t tell what bird it was. As you eat, the skunk from earlier brings you crystal bottle of red wine. You drink it and enjoy in immensely. As you drink, Morgana thinks to herself \u201cThat potion should kick in any time now. Then, he will be like clay in my hands.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the meal, Morgana leads you to her personal hot springs. She removes her clothes, revealing her amazing body. \u201cCome on.\u201d she says. Slightly intoxicated from the wine, you strip down  and get in the spring with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough delays, Morgana. Tell me why you brought me here.\u201d You say. Morgana grabs a hold of you and pulls you close to her. she stares into your eyes and giggles. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re good looking, so I won\u2019t eviscerate you for daring to give me orders.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe places her hands on your head and holds you face up to hers. \u201cThe reason I brought you here, is this.\u201d She presses her lips to yours, sliding her tongue into your mouth. For a moment you kiss back, but suddenly realize, \u201cWhat the f&amp;%^$ am I doing!?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly push her away and get out of the spring, drying off with a towel and putting your clothes back on. \u201cHow dare you reject me!\u201d Says Morgana, angered. \u201cHow dare you try to steal me!\u201d You retort back. \u201cI have a wife, a family! Now send me back to the island!\u201d Morgana scowls. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid of your own family. Wouldn\u2019t you rather have me? I can make your every fantasy come alive. What do you like? Wealth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you\u2019re no longer in the hotsprings. You are in a room filled with mountains of gold and jewels. \u201cWomen?\u201d The piles of treasure disappear, and you are surrounded by scantily clad anthro females, all of them winking or flirting with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d You say. The crowd of females vanishes, and you are in the springs again. \u201cI love Mihal, and only Mihal. I will not abandon her or my children for anything that you can offer.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana snarls. \u201cThen begone! But mark my words, mortal, you just made the biggest mistake of your life!\u201d she waves a hand and you vanish back to the island. \u201cFoolish mortal.\u201d Says Morgana with a half sneer, half evil smile. \u201cI\u2019m not only the Goddess of War, I\u2019m also the goddess of Revenge.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Morgana unleashes a terrible plague upon the island, infecting hundreds of citizens. The only way she will end it, is if you submit to her<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: Morgana curses you with bad luck. You continually have one misfortune after another, scoring several injuries as well.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The good news was that your children were finally starting be more gentle with you. You discovered that they liked the sound of music. When they were getting fussy, or wouldn\u2019t go to sleep, you would play them a soothing tune on your violin, and it would calm them down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had also started to speak. They could already say \u201cMommy\u201d, \u201cDaddy\u201d, and \u201cUp\u201d whenever they wanted to be held. You were sitting on Mihals shoulder as she sat on her bed indian style with Yasmin in her lap. Kevin was sleeping on the pillow behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihal was tickling Yasmin\u2019s belly while she giggled. \u201cShe\u2019s so much like you.\u201d You commented to Mihal. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Asked Mihal. \u201cWell, she has your eyes, your nose, your hair, she\u2019s sweet, cute, and beautiful.

It\u2019s an emergency!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihal instantly sets Yasmin down on the bed next to her brother and is heading out the door, with you on her shoulder. \u201cStay here and watch the children.\u201d She commands to the panda as she exits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihal strides through the halls to the throne room, Where two anthro cats are holding a fox in a stretcher of leaves and bamboo. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d Asks Mihal. \u201cShe has some sort of disease.\u201d Says one of the cats. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing it, we only know that it is very contagious, at least fifty others on the island have it already.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihal leans down to get a better look, and is horrified by what she sees. The fox on the stretcher is completely bald, all her fur is gone. Her bare skin is covered with open sores. Her eyes are bloodshot and red. Blood stains her mouth as she constantly drools the crimson fluid. You can see that her body is stiff as a board, her muscles tight and cramped. She is covered in sweat, as her body overheats. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Mihal are both horrified. \u201cTake everyone who has been infected, and quarantine them.\u201d Mihal orders. \u201cWhere?\u201d Asks one of the cats. \u201cAnywhere!\u201d Says Mihal. \u201cJust keep them away from everyone else!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was decided that the infected would be kept outside the city, in an arboretum in the jungle. Over the course of a week, despite the citizen\u2019s best efforts, over half the island had been infected with the mysterious plague. Sadly, over half of those who were infected had already died. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihal was in despair, which put you in despair. She sat on her bed, her face buried in her hands, crying. Yasmin crawled up to you and hugged you close to her. \u201cDaddy.\u201d She said in a scared voice. You began rubbing her belly, in an attempt to calm her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay sweetie.\u201d You say in a soothing voice. \u201cEverything will be O\u2026\u2026.\u201d You stop mid-sentence as some of Yasmin\u2019s fur comes off in your hands. \u201cOh-no.\u201d The news that the prince and princess had been infected spread rabidly across the island. By now, Mihal was a miserable wreck. Her own her started falling out, but you didn\u2019t know if it was from the plague, or from stress. Then, one day, as Mihal was in her throne room with you on her shoulder, an anthro bee came into the room, carrying a large jar under her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour highness!\u201d She said. \u201cI think I may have found a solution to our problem.\u201d Miahl\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d The bee held up the jar. \u201cIn this jar is some of my own special honey. I gave some to some citizens who had been infected. It seems to lessen the effects of the plague!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihal told the bee to follow her to her room, where Kevin and Yasmin were kept. they had to be kept in a pen in the corner of the room, to keep them from infecting you and Mihal. Over half their fur had fallen out, and their eyes were turning red, and they both had a ragin fever. The bee gave them both three spoonfuls of honey.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihal felt their foreheads and their fevers were gone. \u201cHow long will this last?\u201d She asked. The bee sighed. \u201cI\u2019m not sure. But I know that it won\u2019t cure the plague, only keep it at bay.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn that case.\u201d Said Mihal. \u201cI hear by commission you and all the bees on the island to begin production of as much honey as possible.\u201d The bee bowed. \u201cIt would be an honor to serve you, in our time of need, my queen.\u201d then she flew off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few days, the bees had made hundreds of jars full of honey. The problem was that wasn\u2019t enough. The island\u2019s healers tried every spell the could, but the plague seemed to be unaffected by magic, or any medicine they had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arboretum was becoming overcrowded, and homes were converted into makeshift hospitals. The honey had eased the infected\u2019s pain, but they had to continually take it every day. Soon, the honey began to run low, and as a result, the flowers and plants of the island began to wither from no pollenation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihal say on her throne, sobbing. \u201cWhat did we do the envoke this?\u201d She said. \u201cWhy have the gods cursed us so?\u201d You tried to comfort her. \u201cThere, there.\u201d You say, stroking her cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s not your fault.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d Says a voice from nowhere, a voice that is all too familiar to you. \u201cIt\u2019s yours.\u201d A pillar of fire shot up from the floor in the center of the throne room. After it dissipated, there stood Morgana, this time as big as Mihal. She laughed evilly, then stared at you. \u201cSo, ready to submit to me?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou caused this!?\u201d You exclaim angrily. \u201cYes.\u201d She says, grinning. \u201cAfter you so rudely dumped me, I decided I would make you pay by making those you love, and everyone around you suffer.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Asked Mihal, confused. \u201cName\u2019s Morgana. I tried to seduce your little friend there, and he rejected me. So, I figured this would be the best way to get revenge.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could you do this!?\u201d Snarls Mihal. \u201cI\u2019m the Goddess of War, I can do whatever I want.\u201d Says Morgana non-chalantly. Mihal stood up from her throne, angrily striding over to Morgana, until she was staring her straight in the eyes. \u201cYou killed my people!\u201d She snarled. \u201cYou hurt my children! You tried to steal my husband!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d Said Morgana, smirking. \u201cI would have had him too, if he hadn\u2019t somehow resisted that love potion I put in his wine. What are you gonna do about it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Mihal challenges Morgana to a duel. If she wins, Morgana must cure the plague. If Morgana wins, she gets you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: The other gods are displeased with Morgana\u2019s actions, and you are transported to Nirvala, where she is to stand trial before the other gods.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even through her fur, you could see Mihal turning red with fury. She was now nose to nose with Morgana, her teeth bared in a snarl. .\u201dGo ahead.\u201d Said Morgana in a calm voice. \u201cMake one move. It\u2019ll be your last, mortal.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next, you would never have expected in a trillion years. Mihal clenched her fist, and swung it upwards, delivering an uppercut to the underside of Morgana\u2019s jaw, knocking her across the throne room and landing on her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Morgana stared wide eyed at Mihal in shock, the mere notion that a mortal would dare to strike her was incredible to say the least. You too had your jaw hanging agape in amazement. This was a side of Mihal you had never seen before. In all the time you had known her, Mihal had always been so kind and gentle. She would never hurt a fly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now, you had just seen her sucker punch a god! After she had recovered from her shock, Morgana got back on her feet. \u201cYou dare strike a Divine?!\u201d She said, her very voice causing the room to tremble. \u201cFor that, you will suffer far worse than what your people have endured!\u201d Morgana curved her arm back behind her head. As she swung forward, a whip of solid flame materialized in her fist. The blazing cord came lashing down towards Mihal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn enormous golden shield appeared in front of you and Mihal, hovering in midair. As the burning whip struck it, a shower of sparks filled the air. It had been so long since Mihal had shown you her magic, you had forgotten she could use it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whip dissipated in Morgana\u2019s hand, as did Mihal\u2019s shield. \u201cI challenge you to Akratai!\u201d Said Mihal, pointing at Morgana. An Akratai was how Anthronians would settle disputes between each other, with a duel, sometimes to the death. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana grinned. She may have been bold enough to have struck her, but there was no way this mortal could defeat her, the Goddess of Battle, in an Akratai. Hell, it had been Morgana who had invented the Akratai to begin with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI accept.\u201d Said Morgana with an evil smile. \u201cName the stakes.\u201d \u201cIf I win,\u201d Said Mihal. \u201cYou must cure this plague upon my people, and never bother us again.\u201d \u201cFine.\u201d says Morgana with a sneer. \u201cIf I win, your husband will become mine, and I get to do with you as I please.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMihal, what are you doing?\u201d You say into Mihal\u2019s ear. \u201cI\u2019m going to fight her, to the death if need be.\u201d You beg her to reconsider, but she refuses. \u201cChoose your weapon.\u201d Says Morgana. A long, thin sword with a curved blade and ivory handle appears in Mihal\u2019s hand. She picks you up in her other hand a places you on the armrest of her throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d She says. \u201cI\u2019m much tougher than I look. I can handle her.\u201d She turns to face Morgana. \u201cWell?\u201d she says with a sneer. \u201cWhat\u2019s your weapon going to be?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana grinned and held up her hands, palms outward. As she curled her fingers, her claws sprang from their tips. Her claws were wickedly sharp and were made of gold. She pointed to Mihal with one golden tipped claw, and drew it across her throat with an evil smile on her face. \u201cReady?\u201d Mihal raises her sword over her head and charged towards Morgana. There was a blindly flash of light that forced you to shield your eyes.  When your sight returns, Mihal and Morgana are gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou guess they must have teleported to Morgana\u2019s realm to fight. For hours you sit on the armrest of Mihal\u2019s throne, praying that Mihal will come through. She wasn\u2019t kidding about being tougher than she looked if they had been fighting this long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOccasionally the ground would shake, or there would be a boom of thunder from outside, and you knew it was from the force of their fight. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, another bright flash filled the room. When your vision cleared, your heart sank. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mihal stood in the center of the throne room, Morgana laying unconscious at her feet. You would have been filled with relief at this sight, if not for the fact that Mihal was also covered in several bleeding gashes. But that wasn't the worst part. The worst part was that you could see Mihal clutching her stomach with one hand, no doubt covering a grievous wound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MIHAL!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My king...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihal drops her sword and clumsily makes her way over to you, stumbling every few steps, woozy from blood loss. When she finally reaches you, she picks you up and holds you to her chest. \"My king...I did it...our children...our people...are saved.\" Mihal collapses to her knees, then falls back, laying flat out on the floor. You bury yourself in her chest fur, comforting her as best you can. \"Mihal...it's okay...everything's going to be alright.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel Mihal's body begin to move, but she wasn't standing up. You look up to see that her body was shrinking! \"Mihal! What's going on!?\" Mihal raises her head very slowly, rapidly losing strength, the light fading from her eyes. \"An empress is granted great size to symbolize her status as supreme ruler of Anthronia. She only loses that size when... when...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dreaded the end of that sentence. You quickly run up to Mihal's shrinking face and hug her nose. \"Please Mihal don't do this! How will I, our children, the people live with out you!?\" As Mihal reaches average Anthronian height, you climb off of her chest and cradle her head in your arms. Her breaths become more and more shallow, as she looks up at you with pleading eyes. She weakly tries to lift her head again, but has lost the strength to do it. You lean down towards her, as she gives you one final kiss on the lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her last breath, Mihal whispers in your ear \"I love you.\" With those words, her body went limp in your arms, and she departed this life. All at once, a tsunami of emotions come crashing down on you. Despair, loss, anger, but most of all, hate. Hatred for Morgana, for being the cause of all this. Hatred for the gods, for allowing this to happen. But most of all, hatred for yourself, for rejecting Morgana's advances and beginning this entire disaster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned around to attack Morgana in a fit of blind fury, but to your shock, she had disappeared, without a trace. That same evening, a funeral proccession was held for Mihal, as her body was carried in a grand sarcophagus, through the streets filled with the surviving citizens. Everyone present held a torch of blue flame in the air, to symbolize their mourning of the loss of their beloved leader. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihal was laid to rest in the ancient underground city of the dead, in the royal crypt, the final resting place for the rulers of Anthronai's past. Morgana was as good as her word, and the plague had vanished the moment she had been defeated. The fact that your children would live to see another day helped ease your grief, but only slightly. With Mihal gone, how would you raise them? How would you rule as the King of Anthronia by yourself? these and several other question raced through your mind as you sat alone in the throne room. You had ordered to not b3 disturbed while you sat alone to grieve. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sat in the center of the room, your face buried in your hands, when a blinding flash fills the room. You look up to see a tall lioness of unearthly beauty staring down at you with a sympathetic face. \"Who are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the Goddess of Love, Mushana.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word \"Goddess\" instantly caused you to turn around and walk away. \"Do not bear a grudge against all the gods for the sins of just one, Jacob.\" You keep walking away, a deep scowl on your face, when there is another blinding flash, and Mushana is standing directly in front of you.\"Please, listen to me. The gods have been watching what has happened with you, this isl;and, and Morgana. As Goddess of Love, I cannot just sit by, and allow my sister to go unpunished for ruining a love such as yours and Mihal's. The Pantheon has agreed that she must be punished, and I am here to offer you a choice.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of choice?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know that you must long for revenge against Morgana, after what she has done. So it would only be fitting that you should be the one to deliver the sword of justice to her. Or, you may speak to Thanatra, the Goddess of Death, and convince her to allow Mihal to rejoin you in the mortal world. You cannot do both, so make your decision wisely.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what will you choose?</span></div></div>",

From the looks of it, they had both put up quite a fight. Mihal\u2019s clothes had been torn to shreds by Morgana\u2019s claws, so much of her body was exposed, with only tatters covering what little of her was still clothed. Her body was covered in several still bleeding cuts, especially across her torso and face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Morgana hadn\u2019t come away from the fight unscathed either. She had two visible scars, one that went from her right hip, across her stomach, to her ribs. The second was across her left eye, but neither of them bled. You noticed her right hand was missing, severed by Mihal\u2019s blade. Speaking of which, you saw Mihal\u2019s sword had been inserted between Morgana\u2019s breasts all the way to the hilt, straight through her heart. The blade protruded out through her back. Yet there wasn\u2019t a drop of blood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana grinned wickedly. \u201cI win.\u201d She said. You call out to Mihal, praying that she isn\u2019t dead. She stirs, raising her head to look up at you, a look of shame and sadness on her face. \u201cMy king\u2026\u2026.\u201d she said, barely audible. \u201cForgive me\u2026\u2026.. I have failed.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana strides over to the throne, picking you up in her remaining hand and holding you in her palm. \u201cYou\u2019re all mine now.\u201d She says. \u201cWhy!?\u201d You yell at her, half angry, half sad. \u201cWhy did you do this!? Why did you have to have me!?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I desired a mate worthy of me as their wife. You were the only male on the island other than the children you have sired. Plus, you\u2019re a human, the most violent, war mongering species on the planet. So who better than to be my husband, than you?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe said all this as casually as if you had asked her the time of day. She also didn\u2019t seem to be bothered by the fact she was missing a hand, and was impaled on a sword. \u201cWhy are you still alive?\u201d You ask. Morgana laughed. \u201cI\u2019m the Goddess of War! As long as there is war and bloodshed in the world, I can never die.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe places you on her shoulder, and uses her good hand to pull the sword from her chest. She takes a moment to look at her reflection in the flat of the blade. Then the blade instantly begins to rust until it disintegrates in her grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana looks down at Mihal. \u201cNow, what shall I do to punish you?\u201d She says, putting a finger to her chin. \u201cYou have struck me, insulted me, taken my hand, I can just replace it, but still.\u201d <br>\r\nthen she gets an idea. \u201cI\u2019ve got it!\u201d Morgana lifted Mihal up by her neck and sat her on her throne. Mihal just sat there, her head hung low in defeat. At first, Morgan a just stood there staring at her. Then, you saw Mihal\u2019s feet had turned white and smooth like marble. It spread up her legs to her body. She was turning to stone! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMihal! NO!\u201d You cried out. Mihal raised her head to get one last look at you as her entire body except her head was now stone. \u201cI love you.\u201d were her last meek words before she hung her head once more and became totally petrified. She sat there frozen on her throne, white as snow and smooth as silk. Her face had a look of sorrow on it, as a single tear rolled down her cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell to your knees and covered your face with your hands, sobbing. When you opened your eyes again, you were back in Morgana\u2019s black marble palace. She was your size again, and stood in front of you, looking down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou bitch!\u201d You yell. You launch yourself at her, grabbing at her throat. She simply swats you out of the air like a fly, sending you rolling on the floor. \u201cCalm yourself down.\u201d she says. \u201cYou will find me a much better wife than she ever was.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I won\u2019t!\u201d You scream, getting back on your feet. \u201c I loved her! Did you ever even think of the lives you\u2019ve ruined doing this!? How many people you\u2019ve killed with you\u2019re plague? Including my children!?\u201d \u201cRelax.\u201d Says Morgana, as though it were no big deal. \u201cI ceased the plague on the island. Once I had you, there was no further need for it. Everyone who had it has been cured.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat at least eased some of your anger. At least Kevin and Yasmin would live. \u201cBut what of the island?\u201d You ask. \u201cWith Mihal petrified and our children only infants, who will lead the people?\u201d \u201cThe affairs of mortals are no concern to me.\u201d Says Morgana, waving a hand. \u201cLet them figure it out.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks up to you and puts a hand on your shoulder. \u201cIt is no concern of yours either. Here, you will have your every desire and fantasy fulfilled. You won\u2018t even age a day while you\u2018re here.\u201d You notice the hand on your shoulder is the one that was missing from her wrist earlier. Her scars are also gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have two gifts for you.\u201d says Morgana, producing a black silken robe and a small mirror from behind her back. she drapes the robe over your shoulders. \u201cI made this from my own hair,\u201d says Morgana. \u201cIt will protect the wearer from any weapon.\u201d She hands you the mirror. \u201cThis is so you may still watch the mortal world if you wish.\u201d She says. \u201cJust concentrate on what you want to see, and it will appear in the mirror.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the mirror and stare into it\u2019s reflective surface. \u201cHow do I know you won\u2019t try to kill me like you did Mihal?\u201d You ask with contempt. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about that little love tap I gave you, that was only because you tried to strangle me.\u201d says Morgana. \u201cTry to hurt me, even though you can\u2019t, and I will punish you. Secondly, your precious mortal queen isn\u2019t dead. Her soul still inhabits her body. She is merely trapped in a state of suspension. And she will remain so. Such is the punishment for daring to challenge me.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe claps her hands twice, and two servants, a skunk and a wolf, come running to her side. \u201cTake my new husband to my chambers and get him ready while I freshen up.\u201d The servants bow and lead you by your arms through the halls of Morgana\u2019s palace. \u201cI think I have an idea of what she\u2019s freshening up for.\u201d you think to yourself. \u201cand I get a feeling that I\u2019m not going to like it.\u201d The two servants push you inside two black stone doors, and quickly shut them behind you. The room you stood in was completely colored blood red. The walls, the lighting, the rug, even the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt came as no surprise to you. Being the goddess of bloodshed, red was clearly Morgana\u2019s favorite color. You also had a good hunch that she wasn\u2019t going to be gentle with you in what was about to happen for that same reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor what felt seemed like hours you just stood there. In that time you had used the mirror Morgana had given you to check on Kevin and Yasmin. Morgana wasn\u2019t lying. Their fur had grown anew, and their sores were healed. She at least kept her word. They were still in their pen, with no knowledge of what has become of their mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the doors behind you open. You turn to see Morgana there dressed in something resembling a belly-dancer\u2019s outfit, with a transparent skirt and veil, red of course. She wore no bra, leaving her breasts bare. Under the veil, you could see her grinning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow then.\u201d She says. \u201cLet\u2019s seal this deal.\u201d You back away as she seductively walks towards you, until she pushes you and you fall back onto her velvet bed. \u201cWait a minute!\u201d You say. \u201cI barely even know you, and you want to lay with me as soon as you get me in your room?\u201d Morgana smiled slyly. \u201cSo? That sure didn\u2019t seem to bother you when you reared that fox queen and her subjects.\u201d You blush at the thought that she knew about that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides, the queen was the one you did it with first, was it not?\u201d You nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s how you became her king. In doing so, you became engaged to her. That\u2019s the how it works here. None of your silly human customs of \u201cdating\u201d or \u201cweddings\u201d. Seeing as your previous wife has been turned to stone, that engagement is now void. Now, you will be engaged to me, right here, right now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly leaps at you with full force, pinning you to the bed with her on top of you. \u201cI should warn you.\u201d She says as she slides the robe from your shoulders and slices off your shirt with one of her golden claws. \u201cI tend to get a little, shall we say, aggressive.\u201d You gulp. somehow you knew she was going to say that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Sorry, folks, but you\u2019ll just have to imagine what happens here. I don\u2019t write hardcore stuff like that.) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay beneath the velvet sheets of Morgana\u2019s bed, breathing heavily, with the goddess herself curled tightly against you, with one arm wrapped around you. your clothes and her outfit lay strewn across the floor. She was purring softly in her sleep. You guess she must be satisfied with you. She wasn\u2019t kidding when she said she got \u201caggressive\u201d. Your back had eight long vertical cuts, from Morgana digging her claws into your back. Your torso was also covered in several smaller cuts, some of them still bleeding. There were also many bite marks and hickeys on your neck and shoulders from Morgana\u2019s little \u201cLove Bites\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was done. You now belong to Morgana. \u201cMihal\u2026\u2026\u2026forgive me.\u201d You whisper these words just before you pass out, from blood loss or exhaustion, you couldn\u2019t tell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You slowly woke up, everything was the same as it had been for the last 15 years. Morgana was holding onto you tightly half your body clutched against hers while her one of her arms possesively held onto over the other half. You reached over and began gently stroking behind her ears, despite her...nature she seemed to very much enjoy the small attention and she had shown you her....displeasure in waking up without you attending to her after that first day. You just lay there for a few moments casting off the last throes of sleep and observing the goddess who had claimed you 15 years prior, you carefully looked yourself over \"no scratches, that's good\" you mutter to yourself, although you were sure Morgana wasn't gentler, your skin was just stronger. After a minute you finally felt Morgana start to stir, her arms tensing for a second as she pulled your face up against hers as she playfully nipped at your ear. \"Good morning beloved\" she whispers into your ear before letting of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Morgana\" you reply as she slowly gets up and stretches. Despite your inner protests you couldn't help but stare as she stretched, each powerful muscle unwinding, her tail flicking lazily behind her. She turned towards the dresser in the room and slowly sauntered over her hips moving seductively from side to side, Morgana knew she had a gorgeous body, and at least around you she loved to flaunt it. \"Love what do you think would look best on me?\" she calls \"armour, one of my little outfits, or fur?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...I think armour would look good\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, fur it is then\" she says turning around, she walks back towards you and offers her hand. You slowly take it and she lifts you up off the bed and onto the floor, just like that first morning your body tingles for a second and you find yourself clothed in her favourite attire for you, a simple red t-shirt and a pair of black shorts, you could tell she liked to see as much of you as possible. She turned around and walked towards the door, expectant as always that you would simply follow, you quickly caught up with her. although you trailed slightly behind her, she stops for a second and starts again as you walk beside her \"so love, today's quite special, do you know why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been 15 years\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, it's been 15 years since I won the right to be your mate\" she says smiling, \"you'll get a suprise this afternoon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A surprise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, a surprise\" she says the conversation tapering off as the two of you enter the dining hall. The two guards saluted inside the dining hall saluted shutting the doors behind the two of you, although you know they were smiling as they eyed you. You couldn't help but give off a small smile, the looks were all due to Morgana's \"boon.\" Every 5 years if everyone who served her didn't try anything such as trying to kill her, each of them would get to pick a gift, of course they couldn't pick their freedom..but otherwise she was pretty lenient. As soon as you showed up, you quickly became the only boon they wanted, since most of the guards and servants for the matter were female. Morgana of course wouldn't let any of them keep you, but she didn't mind letting them sleep with you as long as she got you for the 2 days afterward. Given there were 100 servants/guards in Morgana's home her system worked...well enough, it wasn't like you were ever asked your opinion though. Morgana walks over and sits down at the head of the table, you would have moved the chair for her, however the first time you tried she let you know that she could seat herself by giving you another \"love tap\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love, what would you like for breakfast?\" Morgana asks as you seat yourself next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever works\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come now, there's nothing special you want on this day, roast pig? duck? those waffle things i've heard of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you'd like will be fine\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, I think we'll have some sausage and pancakes, mmm and make sure the sausages are nice and bloody\" Morgana says to a mouse girl who runs off to inform the cooks, Morgana turns to smile at you a soft purr starting to escape from her lips. You were always a little unnerved when she simply stared at you like this, it made you feel like a mouse facing a cat. You noticed a fox girl standing just in the edge of your vision, she seemed quite nervous, you lock eyes with her and indicate she could move closer. She slowly walked forward her intent obviously being Morgana and not you, she stops just short of Morgana's line of sight and looks to you for a second, you nod and she clears her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress....you forgot to mention what you and our lord would like to drink\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I did, thank you Julianna\" Morgana says turning to face the fox \"Hmmm....I think I'll just have some milk, love what about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just some orange juice if you have it thanks\" The fox girl nods and smiles at you for a second before turning and hastily heading to the kitchen so your drinks could be delivered with the rest of breakfast. Morgana leans over and puts her head near you, her sign that she wanted some attention, you reach over and gently start stroking behind her ears. Within a few minutes you and a purring Morgana are interrupted by the sound of glasses and plates being placed down on the table. Julianna and Marie (the mouse girl) smile slightly as they place they step back from the prepared meal, you give them a gentle nod to tell them for now they are dismissed and they leave as Morgana starts to dig into her food. After the meal a cat anthro slowly walks up to Morgana and whispers something into her ear, she smiles from one ear to another and you knew what that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love it seems there's a battle going on, I'm sorry but you're going to have to take care of yourself for a while\" You nod in reply as she stands up following the cat to her \"viewing room\" which was basically a room with a giant version of the mirror she gave you, although this one had an enchantment that let it actually search for battle. You gave off a small sigh as the doors closed and slumped back into the chair, feeling around in the pocket of the pants you find Morgana's mirror, since whatever was in the clothes seemed to go with them when they disappeared. You think hard about your children and an image appears in the mirror, like you they had just finished eating breakfast, you smiled as you saw them, they had grown so much in the 15 years you had been gone. Thankfully a snake by the name of Silithera had taken over the job of monarch and the island as a whole took care of your children but you still missed them. Your thoughts slowly turned to Mihal and the mirror shimmered for a second before showing her form, still petrified and sitting on her throne. You sigh as you put the mirror in a pocket and slowly stand up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had learned the layout of the castle by heart and so you were easily able to find the gardens, compared to every other part of the castle which was old as the goddess herself, the gardens were relatively new, you had requested them and were then quite surprised when Morgana built them, although she'd never go in them \"too peaceful\" she said. You enjoyed just strolling through the beds of flowers and laying otu on the grass, and so did most of the servants when they weren't performing duties. You lay there for a while simply enjoying the silence and safety of the gardens. The tranquility was broken by....</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You bolted up as you heard Morgana's voice \"oh so this is where you were, can't we just make another barracks\" she says. \"I mean more guards can't be bad\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm quite happy with the gardens, why don't you like them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're too peaceful, there's no blood, no battle, no...\" she trailed of as you slowly sat up to look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there any of those things in your bedroom?\" you ask. Morgana actually stopped for a second, looking quite stunned for a second before a sly smile crossed her face, \"well you have gotten tougher, mmm but I must admit there really isn't much of a fight\" she says smiling down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm supposed to be able to overpower the goddess of war?\" you reply, Morgana chuckles \"no, you're not, and that's what I find so cute about you, you're not a warrior and yet you still fight\" she says sitting down in your lap. \"I'm quite happy with you as you are beloved, although I think we should....move to the bedroom, you know how battle makes me\" she says. Yes that was one of the things about the goddess of war, battle, or rather war was not only her source of power but also her largest aphrodisiac, she slowly got up and walked away from you \"I'll meet you in my room in 5 love, don't be late\" she says putting emphasis on the last bit. You got up and started heading for Morgana's bedchamber, knowing from one past experience you really didn't want to upset her. You make it to her chambers and she comes in a minute later carrying what looked like a sword case. It was a quite ornate wooden case, deep mahogany, it looked like the case had taken a long time to make. \"Love here's your present\" she says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the box for a second as she sets it down \"it's a very nice case\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, your present is not the case, it's what's inside\" she says opening it up with a flourish and pulling out what was inside. You expected a sword as it was a sword case, but she pulled out 2 lengths of golden rope. You stared at her absolutely confused as she smiled at you. \"Morgana....what's with the rope?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Nalthian rope made out of the Nalthian's fur, very few things can cut it and it can't be broken or torn through no matter how strong a creature is. As for what I'm going to do with the rope, you have been my mate for 15 years and I think it's about time you showed me if you can handle me or not\" she says before turning around and holding the rope behind her back \"come on, tie my arms and legs\" she says. You slowly grab the rope staring at her a bit stunned about what was happening, you tied her arms and legs up with the best knots you could think of and in a minute Morgana was laying there on the bed unable to move. \"Well love, are you going to come and tame the big bad kitty?\" she says a deep sensual purr escaping from her. You couldn't believe what was going on so you slowly moved toward her and got started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Not sure if hardcore scenes are allowed, so like with anonymous you're just going to have to imagine)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana lay on top of you, a deep rumbling purr escaping from her as she lay there. you looked glanced over at the rope a plan formulating in your mind although you looked away after Morgana looked up at you. \"mmm love that was...amazing, I wouldn't mind having a round 2 of that tonight\" she sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be great Morgana you reply, she smiled slightly laying her head back down on your chest, as you slowly reached up to stroke her ears. The two of you apparently fell asleep like that because the next thing you remember is waking up to one of the servants gently shaking you. \"My lord, it's tie for dinner\" she whispers, her eyes never once leaving Morgana. You nod and shoo her out of the room before turning to the sleeping panther on top of you. \"Morgana, Morgana wake up\" you whisper, hey body slowly stirring as she hears your voice. Ina  few seconds her eyes open and she smiles at you for a second before leaning up and kissing you, her tongue easily overpowered yours and the kiss broke a couple seconds later. \"What time is it?\" she purrs as she lays her head back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for supper\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well than I guess I might as well get up\" Morgana says sitting up before stretching, you saw a small smile on her face as she gave you a complete eyeful of her body. \"Come along love, I'm sure we've got a nice little dinner prepared for us\" she says jumping off the bed and walking toward the room exit. You however have to wait a few seconds as you need to find your clothes and get re-dressed before giving chase after her. You reach the dining hall right as she enters and she waits a moment for you to catch up. Dinner was like every night a quite casual affair, and since Morgana loved meat that was dripping with blood and that was usually what was served she took the lion's share of the food. Although you didn't mind, as she'd usually partition off the least bloody part for you as she knew you were a bit squeamish around blood, although she didn't seem to look down on you for this fact, but she would tease you with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana sighed as she sat back in her chair and stared at you, \"mmm love I think it's about time we turned in for bed don't you?\" You nod and you were sure that you saw a few of the servants smile at each other as Morgana got up, although you were sure that you also saw a few jealous gazes pointed at Morgana. Like always she simply walked out of the room and you followed, in a few moments you were back at Morgana's chambers and she smiled as she walked in, \"I'm already undressed love, would you like some help undressing?' she says turning and slowly tracing a claw up and down your shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no that's alright\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right love, just don't take long\" she says walking over to the bed and laying out in a quite sexy pose. You quickly get undressed and follow her onto the bed, she grabs you and after a few seconds of making out she starts getting down to the more intimate attentions. A few minutes later the two of you lay there Morgana tightly hugging onto you, her soft breath falling onto your chest. \"Morgana, love\" you say gently poking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you mind if I...took charge again?\" you say. Mogana's ears perked up as you said this as she had always been the instigator, a purr started deep in her throat as she answered you by holding her arms and legs behind her back. You tied her up and the two of you, you had to admit had a quite enjoyable time. Morgana fell asleep still tied up by the rope, she seemed quite happy and content and as you lay there you realized that she trusted you. You just sat there for a few seconds as something felt...wrong as you went over the plan, you figured it out however after a minute, you were feeling remorse. You just stared at the goddess of war for a few seconds, her chest rising and falling as she slept and you realized some part of you didn\u2019t want to go forward with this plan. You did want to be with Mihal, but that would mean betraying Morgana, and you hated to admit it tto yourself but for the past 15 years she had been the main figure and your constant companion, even going to some great personal lengths to let you have something, such as the garden. You realized with some small amount of horror that you might have in some small way fallen for Morgana, after this realization you were quite conflicted. You took a few deep breathes and decided....</span></div></div>",

She even gave you kids, something you thought you'd never want, but now you're missing them more and more. A tear went down your face as you remembered the good times. That settled it. You had to get out of there. You remember seeing a cool trick on the internet back when you lived on earth. When someone is in a deep sleep, you can ask then even the most personal question, but their subconscious mind would tell you everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgana, sweetheart.\" you say softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my love.\" she says absentmindedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I get back to Anthronia?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple,\" she says. \"For someone other than me to transport to the mortal world, they simply go to the center of my palace with a strand of my hair and concentrate on where they want to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then remember the coat full of Morgana's hair that she gave you. \"Thanks.\" you say. You couldn't believe that it worked. You make your way to the spot that Morgana mentioned and did what she said. Sure enough, you were in Anthronia's castle throne room, right in front of Mihal's petrified figure. You were overjoyed to be back home. Just then, you see two anthros walk into the room. They were your kids!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you two!\" you say excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Kevin asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I know him...\" Yasmin says. She slowly walks over to you and kneels down, so she can get to eye level with you. \"Dad?\" she says. \"Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is me.\" you say. Kevin rushes over to you and he and Yasmin give you a big hug. \"We missed you so much!\" Yasmin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire island was soon informed of your return. There was a great feast and everything. Then after the feast, Yasmin and Kevin wanted to talk to you in private.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you guys want to talk to me about?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know that Morgana will eventually come back for you.\" Yasmin started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we're gonna train extremely hard for when that day comes.\" Kevin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is out of the question!\" you say. \"I already lost your mother! I'm not losing you guys, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But if we win, we'll bring Mama back.\" your daughter retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even so, there's no point. Morgana's tied up with unbreakable rope. There's no way she'll come back.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get to tie her up with rope?\" Kevin asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that your kids were fifteen years old, you decided not to tell them how. \"It's not important.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to be ready, dad.\" Yasmin says one last time.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's been about a month since your return to Anthronia, and Kevin and Yasmin were still going through training. You were scared of two things. First of all, you were scared of when Morgana would come back for you. Secondly, you were afraid of your kids suffering a worse fate than Mihal. One night, you were roaming the halls of the palace when Yasmin approached you. \"Dad, can talk to you for a second?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you went to Yasmin's room, which was actually Mihal's old room. Being there made you a little sad, but you didn't let that distract you from Yasmin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad, I never got to actually tell you how much I really missed you.\" Yasmin said. \"I can't remember a night where I didn't cry myself to sleep. When I finally found out what really happened to you, it only made it worse for me. I thought that you were just gone, but to know that Morgana had you this whole time... it really hurt me to know that you were being held against your will.\" She was holding back tears with every word. \"Kevin was depressed, too, but I was even more so. I'll <b>never</b> forgive Morgana for what she did. I have to do this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were on the verge of crying, yourself. \"Listen, Yasmin. I didn't want you and Kevin to do this at first because I was fearing for your lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mama would've wanted us to.\" your daughter says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. That's why I said yes in the end.\" you say. \"I want you to know that I wish you the best of luck, and no matter what happens, I'll still love you and Kevin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYasmin gives you a hug. \"I love you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, the moment that you've been fearing finally came. Morgana came back for you, and she was furious. You, Kevin, and Yasmin were in the throne room, looking at Mihal's petrified form when out of nowhere, Morgana appears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you leave me tied up like that!\" she howls. \"I can't believe you'd betray my trust like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you get her tied up?\" Kevin asks. You didn't want to tell your fifteen-year-old kid that Morgana was tied up because it was part of a love game. \"It's not important.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" Morgana says. \"What is important is that I take you back home with me. And this time, I won't be so nice to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin and Yasmin jump in between you and Morgana. \"YOU'RE NOT TAKING OUR FATHER ANYWHERE!\" they simultaneously scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't waste my time, you brats.\" the goddess says with a chuckle. \"I can take you both down in a duel easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wanna bet on that?\" Kevin retorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana looks at you. \"Your son has quite the mouth, sweetie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch who you're calling 'sweetie'!\" Yasmin yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two want to die so badly, then fine. Name your terms. What do you want if you win.\" Morgana asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know damn well what we want!\" your daughter says. \"Free our mother and stay away from our dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.\" Morgana says. \"If <i>I</i> win, then I get to torture the two of you to death, but not before you witness me take your father as my own once again. And one more thing, your father has to watch the battle. Deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin and Yasmin look at each other for a while, a little scared. But suddenly their resolve returns. \"We accept!\" they say in unison.</span></div></div>",

Don't be late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Morgana disappears in a puff of smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish us luck, Dad.\" Kevin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will,\" you say. \"I brought you something for good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Yasmin asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I was living with Morgana,\" you explain, \"she gave me a robe that was made of her hair, so I had the royal seamstress split the robe and sew all of the hairs into battle suits that you can wear under your armor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offence, Dad,\" your son says, \"But why would we want to wear our enemy's hair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it can shield you from anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, I get it.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Kevin and Yasmin put on their battle suits and their armor over them, and make their way to the arena, where Morgana was waiting. Time was almost up, and she was counting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five, four, three, two,\" just then, your kids appear on the battlefield, with you watching in the stands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally! I've been waiting an entire month for this, thinking of nothing else!\" Morgana says with a demented tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, she needs a hobby.\" Kevin whispers to Yasmin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had to chew my way out of those ropes.\" the goddess said. \"I was so mad, I didn't even think of eating! I just wanted to get my mate back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our dad doesn't belong to you!\" Yasmin yells. \"We're taking you down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BRING IT!\" Morgana screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the fight begins. Morgana served countless attacks to Kevin and Yasmin, with no luck. Some of them missed, and the ones that hit had no effect. Morgana got angrier and angrier, her attacks getting more reckless. In the stands, you were getting more at ease. Kevin and Yasmin could actually win. Meanwhile in the arena, your kids fall back and regroup. \"Yasmin,\" Kevin says, \"Morgana's so angry, she's forgetting to aim. You thinking what I'm thinking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I do. We just need to get her angrier.\" Yasmin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's my sister,\" he says.</span></div></div>",

However, he had one more idea before putting it into action. He and Yasmin hide behind a large boulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yasmin, lend me your crossbow.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, but what are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\" he reassures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKevin picks up a large rock and throws it over the boulder that he and his sister were hiding behind. Morgana, being as impulsive as she is, blasts the rock, thinking that it was Kevin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" Morgana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the dust settles, Kevin is in the air, aiming his sister's crossbow. \"Think again!\" he says, then he shoots the arrow. He was aiming for her torso area, hoping to strike her chest. The arrow didn't hit her there, but where it did hit her was just as good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arrow pierced Morgana's right eye. She howled in agony. \"AAAAAAAAAAGHH!!!! YOU WORTHLESS BRAT! HOW DARE YOU!?\" she roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so tough now, are ya?\" he says, finally putting his taunting plan in play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHY YOU LITTLE!!\" Morgana charges at Kevin, but he simply sidesteps to get out of the way, using his sword to slice Morgana's left arm in the process. The wound was bad enough to render her arm useless. Morgana then turns to Kevin, planning to strike again, but Yasmin cuts deep into Morgana's right leg, attacking from her blind spot. Now on her knees, Morgana tries to attack again, but the twins slice her remaining two limbs. The goddess now lay on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's over,\" Yasmin says. \"Give up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never,\" Morgana says. \"I refuse to lose to two teenage brats! This battle isn't over. I will win, and you'll never see your father again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sets Yasmin off. She stomps right into Morgana's stomach with her right foot, and kicks her in the face with her left. \"Never insult my father again!\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that she was defeated, and being a woman of her word, Morgana concedes and lifts the curse on Mihal, before dissipating into shadows, returning to her kingdom. You rush over to where Mihal's statue is supposed to be, and you see her unfrozen form on the floor. \"Mihal?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihal's eyes flutter open, and she looks overjoyed to see you. The two of you embrace, reunited again.</span></div></div>",

She swings and you drop to the ground and slide under her taking her down. You get up and run for another gun. You grab the biggest one you could find. It was an AA-12 fully automatic shotgun. You whip around to face Morgana and yell out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TAKE THIS YOU BITCH!!!\" and you unload 150 bullets on Morgana and it shreds her to pieces. By the time you ran out of bullets in you drum magazine you had seen multiple body parts fly off of Morgana.

You walk towards Morgana with the shotgun and you stand in front of her and load it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say hi to Satan for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou point the gun at her and unload another 150 bullets on her.

You couldn't help but wonder, how long did this Pantheon exist, how many years did Morgana stay in her castle, alone, simply because she was the goddess of war, finally having to force others to be with her for any sort of companionship. \"You'll let Mihal go when if I ask, won't you?\" you whisper to yourself more to solidify the thought in your mind than anything else, you undo the ropes and place them back in their case before getting redressed and laying down next to Morgana to fall asleep. As always you wake up first, Morgana's soft, warm breath falling on your neck, you reach up and scratch her ears for a few seconds before switching to her chine.A contented \"mmm\" telling you that Morgana was up and enjoying your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning beloved\" she says quickly flipping the two of you over so she was on top, she proceeded to give you a few love bites this behavior telling you that Morgana was still a bit frisky from last night. \"So my beloved, would you like to have another go, last night was quite enjoyable\" Morgana purrs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't sure how to proceed, although you knew from past experience that lying to Morgana was a very bad idea. \"Morgana....\" you start trying to come up with the right words \"what would you do if I thought of leaving?\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly you felt her grip tighten around her, her claws unsheathing and digging lightly into your flesh \"beloved, why would you ask such a thing?\" Morgana asks her voice becoming cold as ice, her eyes burying into you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well there's no going back now\" you think. Trying your best to maintain eye contact with Morgana you stat \"well...last night you were so...defenseless, I....I admit I thought of going back to...\"gasp\"\" Morgana forcefully cut you off by lifting you up from under her by the neck in one fluid, her iron grip choking the air out of you. \"You would dare even think of betraying me\" Morgana says throwing you against the far wall of the chamber. You were sure you felt a few bones break as you smashed into the unyielding obsidian her castle was forged from, you slowly tried to stand back up, pain shooting through your whole body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mo..\" you start but you're silenced once again as she leaps across the length of the room her weight landing square on your back, the words in your throat dying to be replaced by a scream of unimaginable pain. You were just able to look up at Morgana and you swear it almost looked like she was...crying, but that, that was impossible. Morgana lifted you up by your neck again seeming to almost take pleasure in hearing your choking gasps as you struggled for breath. \"I am your wife now not her\" Morgana snarls \"I replaced that weak woman you were with, winning you fairly in a trial by combat. I have given you everything you need for the past 15 years and you would dare betray me\" she roars, you swear you could feel her voice shake the entire castle, although that wasn't what was most important to you at the moment. You clutch at her hands trying to get some air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress stop\" you hear one of the servants from the direction of the doorway and in a second you feel another pair of arms on Morgana's pulling at them to release you. Morgana lets go although you were sure it was due to shock rather than anything else. You fall to the floor gasping for breath as you felt whoever had saved you lift you up slowly and cradle your head \"master, master are you alright?\" she asks fear and worry practically radiating from the servant. You looked up to see Julianna, the fox from yesterday looking up at Morgana with something akin to hatred Morgana reaches for you and Julianna pulls you closer to her. \"Let him go\" Morgana says coldly \"he has betrayed me, and he must be punished for it\" Morgana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has done nothing\" Julianna replies \"he couldn't have done that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He planned to leave me, to return to that woman even though I beat her fair and square\" Morgana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then why is he still here, mistress you fell asleep last night bound by your own rope, dead to the world\" Julianna replies. \"He has also asked about...ways to stop you and your power, we have always said no, but if he asked one more time, we would have told him about everything, including the prison you built to trap and hold the other gods\" Julianna says her eyes steeling as she stared up at Morgana in defiance. \"If he wished to betray you, you would have woken up in your own prison, powerless, trapped there forever\" she shouts. You felt Julianna's body start to shiver as she leaned down her tongue lapping slowly at a few open cuts. Morgana just stood there, her eyes focused on you, yet not really looking anywhere. Morgana reaches for you again and Julianna does something you never expected she bites Morgana, her teeth just grazing the goddesses fingers for a second before she pulled back. Morgana looked quite startled but what surprised you even more is that she didn't strike back, she just waited as Julianna tended to what wounds she could see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Morgana spoke \"you have to let him go, I heard at least 5 different bones break when he hit the wall, so if they're to be fixed I must get near him\" Morgana says. Julianna stares up at the goddess of war and slowly moves back, Morgana just stares at you for a few seconds before lowering one hand to your chest, it felt like your whole body was on fire for a few seconds before that feeling, as well as he pain disappeared. Morgana then got up and left, she simply walked out of the room, Julianna leaves soon after, returning with a few more of the servants who lift you up onto the bed and start tending to you. Each of them had seen you nude a few times so you didn't even flinch as they stripped you and started to tend to you, first washing away any excess blood before redressing you. Most of the servants left however 5 of Morgana's guard came and stood in front of the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext thing you knew Kayla the head of the guard was shaking you, you had to have fallen back asleep \"my lord, Morgana wishes to see you, should we let her in\" she asks. This shocked you as this was the first time you had ever heard one of the guards or servants call Morgana by name. You slowly nod and she quickly walks back to the door giving the command to let Morgana in. She walks in, eyeing the guards and Kylie who follow her as she walks up to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you've turned my entire staff against me, although I thought they had lost their will to fight, so this is good. She says a small smile forming on her lips.\"However since everyone seems to believe you have a reason for what you said I will allow you to explain\" Morgana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start slowly \"I said I thought of betraying, and I did, however as Julianna said, I couldn't go through with it. How long have you lived?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana looks quite surprised by the question \"Since the creation of our people of course\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many husbands or lovers have you had before me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana looks even more stunned and she slowly starts to snarl before a sword temporarily against her throat silences her \"none\" she replies sullenly. You could see this shocked each of the guards but it was as you suspected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm the first, the first source of companionship, stability, of joy, and love you've had\" you say staring up at her. Slowly you could see her weakening her tail and ears drooping and her body as her body started to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y...yes\" she says her voice faltering for the first time. She just stares at you for a few seconds before pouncing, her weight falls on top of you but instead of tearing into you, you felt her arms wrap around you in a death hug. \"Please beloved, don't leave me\" she cries, visible tears and a voice full of anguish stopping the guards \"I have been so alone, first having to steal souls to be servants for me when the rest of the Panthenon had willing souls lining up, then I had to steal you from that woman\" she hugs you tightly her tears falling onto you as she buried her muzzle in your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgana I never planned to leave you\" you say slowly, \"I realized you were so alone and I could never leave you\" you say gently stroking her back. Morgana slowly lifts her head, her eyes meeting yours. \"Morgana I love you\" you say softly \"however for me to let go, I need you to free Mihal, so I know my children will have at least one parent to raise them\" you say. Morgana slowly nods and snaps her fingers \"her curse is lifted\" she says.</span></div></div>",

As promised,the curse on Mihal was lifted, and the entire island was in celebration. Unfortunately, after all the celebration, you see Mihal and your two kids in the throne room, looking sadly at a statue. You then see that it was a statue made in your honor. Mogana had left before she was able to see this, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing what you just thought made you reevaluate your situation. You realize that you have feelings for both Mihal and Morgana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou loved Mihal because of how kind she was. She even gave you two kids, something you thought you never wanted to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd even though Morgana practically stole you from Mihal, she had genuine affection for you, too. She only did what she did because she was so lonely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo now there are two parts of you: the part that wants Mihal and the one that wants Morgana. The part that wants Mihal is thinking that you only love Morgana out of pity, and the part that wants Morgana is thinking that you only feel committed to Mihal because you had kids with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou need to make a choice.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before you had time to even register what Morgana had said the room was filled with a brilliant light, which faded after a second. From this light stepped what had to be one of the Pantheon as divine was the only word to describe the lioness that had suddenly appeared in the room, although you couldn't quite remember just who she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Mushana, goddess of love and family\" the lioness says, most likely reading your mind, her voice sounding almost amused. She walked right past Morgana to stand over you, and reaching down began to stroke your head \"quite an interesting human, winning not only the heart of the goddess of war, but also the queen of our people\" she says. Strangely enough Morgana just eyed the other figure, making no move to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it you want Mushana?\" Morgana asks staring up at the other goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much\" she shrugs stepping back from you \"I am just here to inform you of a request made onto me, although she hasn't been freed long, the queen of the anthros has petitioned me for a rematch with you Morgana. She states that the only reason you won was because you are the goddess of war, and if you were mortal, she would have won\" Mushana states. \"I as well as the majority of the Pantheon are inclined to believe her, and we are considering allowing her that rematch, with the stated terms of your temporary removal of divinity\" Mushana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Morgana cries standing up quickly \"How dare you interfere in my affairs, I beat that woman fair and square...\" Morgana trailed off as she realized that Mushana was not staring at her but at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You say you won, but did you really?\" Mushana says, she snaps her fingers and before you appears a mirror like the one in Morgana's viewing room. You could see Mihal, freed from her curse, with two foxes that were almost her size, a boy and a girl hugging her, you knew they had to be Kevin and Yasmin. All three were weeping, and you weren't sure how you knew but you knew Mihal was weeping for a different reason than her children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mihal\" you say softly and you couldn't stop yourself,you reach up to the mirror, taking a second to gently stroke the cheek of her image, you felt a single tear trickle down your face as you withdrew your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has always loved her Morgana, however you have won half of his heart\" Mushana says putting an emphasis on half. \"I do not wish to allow this rematch between you and her, as neither of you will win, and the true loser of your conflict will be him, not only will he be made to watch the two women he loves fight each other, but he will suffer the most as no matter which of you win he will lose\" Mushana states waving the mirror away, her face becoming serious. \"Morgana do you remember what the first wars were about?\" Mushana asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course i do, they were about men, females who were....\"Morgana seemed to come to a realization and she just stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on Morgana\" Mushana says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Females who were co-mated thought that a male was spending more time with one or more of the partners, so they began to fight\" Morgana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A co-what?\" you say interjecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Co-Mateship, the originally planned relationships between our people, I am about to tell you a secret which you cannot share with anyone. The population imbalance is not a flike, we created to see how a female run society would work, if it was different than a male run society, we would have made it so the birth's were 1:1, sadly however that wasn't the case. The co-mateship was the original relationship for our people after we realized our little experiment was a failure\" Mushana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cannot seriously be asking me to humble myself...to...to\" Morgana just stood there seething unable to finish her sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To declare Mihal your equal?\" Mushana says finishing for her. \"Morgana you are right she isn't your equal, you are a divine and she isn't, however she won the heart of this man instantly where it took you 15 years to take half, she has in the opinion of the whole Pantehon tied or bested you in combat depending on who you ask. You cannot deny that she is a great warrior and that at least deserves your respect as goddess of war\" Mushana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou actually saw Morgana back down, taking a step back and you actually saw her physically resign herself \"what would you have me do, and why are you telling me?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am asking you to simply recognize her skills and declare her as your co-mate, otherwise I will have no other course of action other than allow the match to go ahead\" Mushana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you stated she is a mortal I am a divine, what would you have me do when she perishes, as she will\" Morgana replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMushana smiled \"you have taken this human as your king, and since you will have recognized her as your equal in combat, why would you not make her the personal guard to you and your husband\" Mushana says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every guard here is our guard\" Morgana replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then the captain of your guard\" Mushana counters..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana looked over at Kayla the girl stepping forward \"I, am the head of Morgana's guard\" she states. \"However if it would make my lord happy, I would gladly work as the second in command as his first wife took my place\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana sighs \"very well, I shall name her my co-mate\" she states glaring at the other goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent\" Mushana says, \"now you just have to convince Mihal to do the same, you have until this evening\" she says before disappearing in another flash of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morgana...\" you say slowly, she turns and walks back to you laying herself down in your arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you'd let her go\" she says sadly sounding quite hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I could, I'm sorry\" you say stroking her cheek gently. Morgana leans up and gently licks at your face, your lips soon meeting as you gently kissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I do the right thing?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know this may sound a bit selfish, but I think you did\" you reply. Morgana starts to lightly purr and you spend a few minutes simply stroking her ear-to-tail. Finally she stands up, \"Kayla prepare the guards, and have the servants gather up the most valuable items in the castle...if we are going to go and meet this woman I wish to show I mean her no ill will, given....how we last crossed paths\" Morgana says. Kayla nods and she as well as the rest of the guard leave Morgana turning on you as soon as they are gone. She smiles down at you \"I love you beloved, and I will do anything for you\" she says laying back down atop you a smile forming on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too Morgana\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you mind holding me?\" she says. You open your arms and she buries herself, sensing that the two of you were alone she starts to cry, releasing countless years of sadness and loneliness. You stroke her back as she weeps \"Morgana I'll always be here for you from now on my beloved\" you whisper. You felt her gently hug you and she stayed like that for a good 10 minutes simply letting all her feelings out before detaching herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should probably get dressed\" she says.walking over to the dresser. She pulls out a red dress and what looked like a suit which she throws to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where did you get this?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A girl has to have a few secrets\" Morgana replies, you quickly get dressed,before leaving the bedroom and heading for the main hall of the castle. You meet up with the servants and the guards, each servant carrying a small sack of things and the guards all dressed for battle. Morgana snaps her fingers and the next thing you knew the whole group was standing outside of Mihal's castle.</span></div></div>",

Suddenly there is a loud bang like thunder, and a bright flash of blinding white light. As your vision clears, you see you are in a grand council room of marble. Several thrones lined in a half-circle dominate the room<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn each seat sits an anthro animal, about Mihal\u2019s size. In the center of the room sat Morgana in a chair of black marble, with golden chains restraining her in place. You stood on Mihal\u2019s shoulder, who like wise stood next to Morgana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorgana, you have gone way out of line.\u201d Says one of the anthros, a snowy owl in a blue toga. \u201cThis court will decide your fate.\u201d You whisper into Mihal\u2019s ear. \u201cWho are these guys?\u201d Mihal whispers back, \u201cThey are the Pantheon, the goddesses of my people.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgana struggled against her bonds. \u201cGive it up.\u201d Says a bear goddess in a black leather garb. \u201cI forged those chains myself. Not even one of us can break them.\u201d A swan in pink robes unfurled a scroll and read, \u201cMorgana, you are charged with attempting to steal another\u2019s mate, interfering in the affairs of mortals, and directly causing the death of innocent souls. You yourself have confessed to these crimes.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTherefore\u2026..\u201d Says a wolfess in a green dress, \u201cYou are hereby sentenced to a century in Kasma.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is an outrage!\u201d Says Morgana. \u201cNo, it is the law.\u201d Says the owl. \u201cNow, you will suffer for it.\u201d \u201cExcuse me.\u201d You say. Everyone looks in your direction. \u201cWho is this mortal who dares interrupt us?\u201d Says one of the Pantheon, you didn\u2019t see who. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am the husband of Empress Mihal.\u201d You say. \u201cYou are a human, are you not?\u201d Asks the wolf. \u201cYes.\u201d You say. \u201cThe same humans who poison my seas?\u201d Asks a blue scaled hydra. \u201cAnd pollutes my skies?\u201d Says an eagle. \u201cAnd destroys my forests?\u201d Says a doe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, listen to me.\u201d You say. \u201cI know humans have made mess of the earth, but we\u2019re not all bad.\u201d You say. \u201cNow, Morgana has killed many of my wife\u2019s people, tried to steal me from her, and even harmed our own children. Therefore, I think it would be a more fitting punishment for her to be stripped of her powers and godhood, and be put in the custody of Mihal to decide her punishment.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a murmur of agreement among the Pantheon as some of them nod. \u201cAll in favor of this human\u2019s proposal?\u201d Asks the owl. The entire court raises their hands. \u201cVery well.\u201d Says the owl. \u201cMorgana, your fate will be decided by Empress Mihal. You are banished to the earth and stripped of your godhood until further notice. Your plague upon the anthronians shall also be undone.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is another bright flash as you are back in the Mihal\u2019s throne room. There at Mihal\u2019s feet stood Morgana, now at your size, her powers gone. Mihal raised her foot and brought it down on top of Morgana, pinning her under her toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo now you\u2019re mortal.\u201d Says Mihal with a sneer. \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve to be mortal. Anything short of death is too good for you. You\u2019re lucky my husband changed the Pantheon\u2019s minds about sending you to Kasma, therefore, you owe him your life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is Kasma?\u201d You ask. \u201cIt is a place of punishment.\u201d Says Mihal. \u201cWhen a wicked soul dies, they are sent there to be punished for the evils they commited in life. For example, a greedy soul could be forever crushed beneath a mountain of gold coins. This vile creature.\u201d She says while pressing down on Morgana with her toe, \u201cMight have ended up in an endless medow, with no one to fight or wage war against, only eternal peace. For her, that would be the worst punishment of all.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihal stares down at Morgana, who is trying desperately to lift Miahl\u2019s toe off of her. \u201cNow, since the Pantheon put me in charge of you, what would be a fitting punishment for you? She ponders this for several moments until, \u201cI\u2019ve know just what to do with you.\u201d      <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Both children were easily 10-15ft tall and sadly that made them consider you more as a toy rather then as a father which really saddened you. Thus although you didn't like it you spent a lot of time away from them and Mihal, you walked into her chamber and looking around you didn't see Kevin or Yasmin, you climbed up and froze as Mihal was breast-feeding them. \"Oh my king, where have you been these past few days?\" she asks as you hadn't seen her in a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just exploring our kingdom, i'm not too familiar with it\" you say which was true but only a half truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're hiding something, I can smell the hesitation on you\" Mihal says. \"Come up and sit with me\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm good\" you reply staying at the foot of the bed. Mihal notices this, \"do you not, like me anymore my king?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no\" you reply quickly. You sigh, \"look Mihal it's the kids, they're what twice, thrice my size, all they see me as is a toy, not a father\" you say looking downcast. You look up and Mihal's just staring at you, she waits till the kids are done before gently putting them down, one on each pillow. Mihal craws across the bed and gently picks you up, \"my king, i'm sorry I wasn't paying enough attention to see\" she says hugging you to her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok Mihal, you were taking care of the kids that's the important thing\" you say. She hugs you tighter, \"no it isn't, our children need to know you're their father, not a toy\" Mihal says sternly, \"you are the one I love and no one else will father my children\" she says lifting you up and giving you a quick lick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blech, I thought I told you to stop doing that\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it shows that I love you\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Humans do that by kissing not licking\" you say. Mihal nuzzles you then kisses you gently, \"better?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Much\" you reply. You heard the sound of crying and Mihal quickly puts you down and picks up you're children gently cradling each in an arm. They stop and both look toward you and start making grabbing motions, you back up but Mihal holds you in place with her tail. \"Yasmin, Kevin stop it this is you're father, this is daddy\" Mihal says moving towards you, you try to move back again but you're still blocked. Yasmin falls onto the bed and crawls toward you, in the past she'd grab onto you, hard, she even tried to bite you once, so yeah you did have so animosity for you're own kids. Yasmin looked at you face to face and her eyes looked different it was like there was, recognition now that Mihal had identified you as their father. She crawls forward and much to you're suprise instead of just grabbing you or something she wraps herself around you and tries to bury herself into you're chest. You tentativley wrap you're arms around her and move her head onto you're shoulder, she gives off what you can only equate to a sigh and much to you're and Mihal's shock says \"daddy\" before laying her head down and letting her weight go pinning you under her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her...her first word\" Mihal says fighting back tears, Kevin falls onto the bed and crawls over, he lies out next to his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got to be kidding me\" you say sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" Mihal asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mihal, they identified you as alpha, so thus, since you never acknowledged my presence as that of you're mate before them they never acknowleged me as their father\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...it's my fault?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but don't worry about it\" you say. Mihal tries to pull Yasmin off you but she actually wraps herself tighter around you, so much so you have to push her off a bit as she was cutting off you're air. Finally Mihal opted to rest you on her chest with Yasmin near you and she held Kevin up near her collarbone. You looked up at Mihal, \"I am sorry, for causing you all this trouble\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Mihal, now that it's solved we can go back to fully being a family\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did...did you ever think of leaving me and the children because of this?\" Mihal asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't going to leave, but I was going to become only a small part of their lives till they were like 4 or 5\" you say. Kevin by now had fallen back asleep and Mihal was tightly curled up around you again, Mihal gently pulls you up and starts gently stroking you're back. \"I'm sorry Jake, i'm such a troublesome wife\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop apologizing, it's ok you're worth all the trouble in the world anyways\" you say laying you're head down on her breast. You were sure Mihal was smiling, \"why don't you take a nap along with the kids, it might do you some good\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, as long as I get to wake up to you're beautiful smile\" you say. Mihal laid a hand over you and Yasmin and started humming, you were soon asleep. While you slept you had a dream, in the dream you were laying on Mihal's stomach as she laid in the middle of a giant grass field. Laying next to her was Yasmin on her right and Kevin on her left and they were both grown up, the thing is for some reason in you're dream when Kevin was grown up, he looked like a well giant anthro red fox, no part of him was left as human. You're dream self ignored it but you filed the information awake. Suddenly you were shaken awake, you look up and it was late afternoon from what you could tell, Mihal was looking at you worried, \"ugghh...what's up?\" you ask. She moves Kevin over to you and gently licks him once, \"he...he has a fever and it's almost like he's growing fur\" Mihal says. You walk over and inspect you're son, indeed there was way too much hair on him for really any human and it was all red. Kevin turned and stared at you weakly, \"daddy\" he says, You smiled, \"don't worry Kevin we'll get you fixed up\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mihal, I need you to get some cool towels, and then get the doctor for me\" you say. Mihal gets up and runs off returning in a minute with the towels before running off to get the doctor. You grab one and drag it over placing it on Kevin's head, Yasmin crawls over and stares at her brother for a bit before grabbing you, \"daddy\" she says the fear easily detectable in her voice. \"Don't worry Yasmin, Kevin will be ok\" you say. The doctor soon shows up and much to you're shock she ushers you out of the room, \"hey why do I have to leave?\" you protest. \"I am going to be doing some very, strange procedures, so it is best you're not here\" she says shutting the door in you're face. You wander the halls for a 4,5,6,7,8 hours, soon the doctor has been there an entire day and you've nearly worried yourself to death. You were just wandering the halls to the kitchen when the cheetah anthro that helped deliver the twins runs up. \"My liege, the doctor requests you're presence\" she says. You nod and run after her, she however gets impatient after 10 seconds and just scoops you up and runs back herself. You push the door open a crack and walk inside, you can't see anything so you climb up onto the bed. Sitting there was the doctor and Mihal, there were looking down at a bundle, fearing the worse you run up and freeze, Kevin was lying there thankfully still breathing, but every trace of him being human had disappeared. He had paws instead of hands and feet like everyone else and the lower part of his face had become a muzzle as well as there were now ears on the top of his head and a tail sticking out of his now furry butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry\" Mihal says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for what?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now you have no reminder of home\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mihal it's ok, are there any problems with him?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None that I can find\" the doctor says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good you reply. Within a few minutes the doctor had left and you were curled up between Mihal's breasts with Kevin and Yasmin laying one on either side of you. Mihal started humming and you were able to stay awake until she fell asleep before falling asleep yourself.</span></div></div>",

Kevin and Yasmin were still asleep, and so was Mihal. Kevin seemed to not really have a problem with being a full fox now.  He lay there, curled up, sucking his thumb as he slept. You smiled. At least you didn't have to worry about him getting cold. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made your way off of Mihal, and climbed down the side of the bed. You slip on a silk robe Mihal had made for you, then make your way to the throne room. You decide to wait until Mihalk wakes up to eat. You always have your meals together. Leaning against Mihal's throne is a ladder, that goes up to the throne's armrest. On the armrest is a miniature throne for you. Indeed, many changes have been made to accomodate you being the new king. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb up the latter and sit on your throne. A few of the other amazons walk by and talk to you. Saying how their own children are doing, etc. You have more than doubled the island's population, and made the other inhabitants very happy. You lost track of exactly how many sons and daughters you have, not that you see them much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Mihal comes in, dressed in her usual attire, and kisses you good morning. \"Good morning, my love!\" She says. She seems happier than usual today. \"Good morning.\" You reply, hugging her nose. She carries you into the dinning hall and sits you on the table in front of her. The servants bring you your breakfast, more of that spicy meat, eggs, ( donated by the local bird girls), and milk (from the cows.) Of course the food is much too large for you to finish, so you eat what you can and Mihal eats the rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you both finish eating she looks down at you, smiling. \"What are you so happy about?\" You ask. \"You don't know?\" She says. </span></div></div>",

I might have been scared, but it was not because I knew i was going to fall for you.\"You smile at her. She smiles and gently picks you up. \"I love you so much!\" You tell her, pressing yourself against her chest. \"I love you too.\"She reponds, returning the hug. Suddenly, from nowhere, you start feeling bad, a feeling that something bad will happen. \"Honey, something wrong?\" Mihal questions, looking at you. \"Oh, nothing, nothing .... \" You respond, not wanting to worry her. \"I pressed you too much?\". \"No, of course not. \" She puts you on the ground.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She created a fountain on this island that would renew the youth of anyone who drinks from it.\" You couldn't believe what you were hearing. \"So you're saying the Fountain of Youth is on this island?\" You ask, astonished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to call it that, yes.\" replies Mihal. \"So, every ten years we hold a great celebration, in honor of Mushana. Everyone on the island drinks from the fountain, and the stay their current age for the next ten years. I myself look like I'm in my twenties, when in reality, I am 237.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're that old!?\" You exclaim. \"Oh yes.\" She says. \"You don't mind do you?\" A look of worry suddenly came to her face. \"Not at all.\" You say quickly. \"I would love you if you were as old as time itself.\" She bends down and kisses you. \"Thank you.\" She says, smiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" She continues. \"The children don't drink from the fountain until they are a certain age. We wouldn't want to have to take care of them their entire lives. Granted, the fountain doesn't make us immortal. We can still die, but it lets us retain our youth and beauty. After wards, after everyone has taken a drink, there is a grand party. You'll just love it!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ponder what she said. First, you become king of an island of amazons, now, you can be young forever! \"Sounds wonderful!\"You say. \"Totally looking forward to it!\" After breakfast, Mihal puts you on her shoulder, and heads outside the palace. \"Wait, what about Kevin and Yasmin?\" You say. \"Don't worry.\" Says Mihal. \"The servants are watching them. I'd bring them with, but I can't risk them getting into the fountain yet. The servants will come to the fountain to drink later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe steps outside the palace, to a crowd of what looks like the entire island. \"The time has come to renew our youth and beauty!\" announces, and the crowd cheers. \"Everyone to the fountain!\" The crowd parts as Mihal walks through them, and they follow her out of the city into the jungle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Mihal stops and lifts you to her face. \"Now, on the ground below me is a cave. In that cave lies the fountain. Follow everyone inside, there is a golden chalice that must be drunken from for the fountain to work. Wait for everyone to take and drink, then fill the chalice and bring it out to me, so that I may drink from it.\" You nod and she lower you to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow the crowd of amazons into the cave. Torches line the walls, lighting the path. When you reach the fountain chamber, you are awed. Three quarters of the chamber, which is the size of football field, is taken up by the fountain, but that's not what awes you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bottom of them basin of the fountain is made of gold, making the water appear golden as well. In the center of the basin is a golden statue of a anthro lioness, with a rose in one hand and a spear in the other. That must be Mushana. Some of the amazons in the crowd carried baskets full of flower petals, which they begins tossing around into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of the fountain is the gold chalice. To the amazons it's the size of a normal cup, but to you, it's as big as a bucket. One of the amazons, a panther girl, steps forward. She picks up the chalice and dips it into the fountain. She brings it to her lips and drinks. She licks her lips, turns, and gives the chalice to the amazon behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand to the side until everyone has taken a drink, then you pick up the chalice by both grips on its sides, and fill it in the pool. You follow the crowd out of the cave, sometimes struggling with the chalice, the water sloshing about onto you and the floor. You finally come out of the cave. Mihal lifts you and the chalice up to her mouth. \"If you would?\" She opens her mouth and you dump the chalice in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, before you drink from the fountain, there's something you should know.\" Mihal warns. \"Once you drink, you must continue to drink from the font every ten years exactly. If you don't all the years you didn't age will catch up to you at once. Do it for so long, and miss one drink, and you could instantly age into dust. Do you accept this?\"           <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You woke up in your usual place, snuggled within Mihal's chest for a while Kevin and Yasmin had slept around you, actually that was the only way they'd fall asleep is if you were nearby but as they kept growing it became very apparent after Yasmin accidentally crushed something about the thickness of your arm it would be better that you stopped sleeping near them. Much crying and whining later Mihal had come up with the solution you would sleep in her cleavage while Kevina and Yasmin could sleep attached in her arms. You heard a giggle as you woke up and you fell a bit landing on your back \"sorry my king did I wake you?\" Mihal says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up and look up at her and stretch \"yeah, but it's ok, just means I get to see more of my beautiful queen\" you reply. Despite the fact the 2 of you had been married for 2 years Mihal still blushes at the comment and lowers a hand which you climb onto. \"You are just the sweetest my little king\" she says gently nuzzling you and then kissing the top of your head. You pet the tip of her muzzle and smile up at her when you heard a voice \"daddy\" it says. Mihal looks down and Yasmin in her pink gown was looking up at the 2 of you, Mihal lowers her hand and Yasmin gently hugs you and snuggles you \"daddy\" she says happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning darling\" you say petting her cheek, Yasmin sighs and tries to go back to sleep clutching you but Mihal gently pulls you from her grasp, Yasmin looks up at her mother and sticks her tongue at her \"daddy back\" she says jumping up and down reaching but she can't reach you. \"Sorry Yasmin, but you and Kevin will be able to play with daddy when you learn to fully control your size\" Mihal says putting you on top of her head. Mihal looks up at you longingly and you sigh, \"Mihal can you let me down for a bit?\" you say. Mihal gently puts you down and you walk over to Yasmin, she bends over and you gently pet your daughter's cheek and hug her. \"That's my good girl, your such a cutie Yasmin\" you say. She giggles and pushes you over with her muzzle probably wanting to just curl up and go back to sleep with you. \"Yasmin stop\" you say and she freezes and you stand up, \"Yasmin you need to learn that you can't lay on top of me otherwise you'll hurt Daddy understand?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuprisingly she nods and lays out on her side and you lay near her, her paws and arms encircling you \"I love you Daddy\" she whispers kissing your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you too Yasmin\" you say. She quickly falls back asleep and Mihal pulls you out of her grasp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you'd be the perfect father for my children\" Mihal says happily nuzzling you. Your stomach rumbles and she giggles \"I think it's about time we went for breakfast\" she says. You nod and Mihal exits the room, Sara and Clara, Kevin and Yasmin's caretakers run into the room as they leave just in case the kids wake up. Mihal briskly walks through the hall, being greeted by everyone she passes, no one could see you as you were right in the center of her head. Mihal walks to the dining hall and sits down in her chair gently taking you off her head and putting you down in the right next to hers. She picks up a bell about the size of a church bell and gently rings it, from about 4 different corridors run 4 cat anthros who expertly jump and get to the top of the table and in front of Mihal in a second. \"Yes your majesty, what would you like for breakfast\" a tabby by the name of Kim asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think some eggs would be good today thank you, as well as some milk and some meat\" she says. The head cat points and the other 3 jump off the table and run off to get the food, Kim walks up and bows to you. \"What would you like today my liege?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scowl \"didn't I tell you to stop calling me that\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods \"I'm sorry my king but it feels strange calling you by name\" she says. You sigh \"fine fine, whatever, i'll have the same thing\" you say. She nods \"Tara is doing quite well\" she says before running off to get your food. You were glad that everyone had at least taken one of your orders to heart, everytime you saw someone you wanted an update on how your daughters were doing be it you saw them once a year or once a day. In a few minutes a team of anthros come in carrying 2 silver plates and a glass filled with milk, Mihal bends over and lifts each of the plates up as well as the glass, she smiles at them \"thank you for the hard work\" she says. The anthros bow and run off, you turn as there is a clank in front of you from Kim setting your plates and glass down, \"breakfast as you ordered my liege\" she says kneeling. You sighed and stared at her \"Kim what was my order\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fidgets for a second but doesn't raise her head, \"to call you by name my liege\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod \"good now are you going to do it?\" you ask. You weren't going to force any of them but you really preferred to be called by name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim fidgets again and sighs \"breakfast as ordered Jake\" she says but you saw a smile play on the edges of her lips. You stand up and she stays kneeling as you walk up and pet her head \"thank you Kim\" you say. She gently starts to purr and gently pushes against you \"anything for you Jake\" she says fully opening up to using your name. You heard a cough and Kim looks up at Mihal and quickly bows \"I must get back to my duties\" she says scampering off the table and down a corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone's getting a little too friendly with people\" Mihal says a warning tone in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Mihal\" you say taking your seat \"I guess I just don't know the where the line is\" you say. Mihal giggles and plucks you from your chair lifting you up to face height she gently kisses you \"that is why I'm here my king\" she says. Mihal places you back down in your place and starts eating, soon the mood between the 2 of you lightened and the hall was filled with Mihal's laughter. Soon breakfast was finished and anthros came to remove the plates, Kim was nice enough this time to call you by name and you nodded at her approvingly. Mihal lifts you up and walks back to the throne room. She puts you down in the little groove carved into the top of her chair which had a throne your size added to it. You didn't think you were above Mihal but she insisted you be close and actually chose the spot herself saying that if you were to fall she could catch you or at the very least you'd fall onto her. The builders couldn't exactly argue with her because well she was the queen and her logic was sound, although it did take them a while to get your throne set up. You walked up and took the small crown off the seat and put it on, it still didn't really feel right though, you just didn't consider yourself royalty even though you were married to a 300ft tall vixen queen. Your inner thoughts were interrupted as.....</span></div></div>",

Please, forgive me! It wasn't my fault!\" She began talking very fast, nearly hyperventilating. Mihal raised a hand. \"Calm down! Now, calmly tell me what is wrong.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe panther took a deep breath, then sighed. \"I beg you my liege. Forgive me. I can't keep it a secret anymore.\" She stared up at you and pointed. \"It was him!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was him?\" Asked Mihal. \"I.......I.......I've been having an affair with him.\" The panther admits. \"What!?\" Exclaims Mihal. She reaches up and grabs you from your throne, holding you in front of her face. \"Is this true?\" She demands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\" You say. \"I would never cheat on you! You're the only one I love!\" \"He's lying!\" Says the panther. \"Smell him! My scent is on him!\" Mihal sniffs you. \"She's right!\" Mihal's fist tightens around you, and you struggle to get free. \"How could you!?\" She says, hear voice cracking, tears forming in her eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mihal.......please.........\" You gasp. but she ignores you. \"What is your name?' She turns to the panther. \"Jengra, my liege.\" Says the panther. \"I couldn't live with it any longer. He has been sneaking out of the palace to visit me for the past few weeks. He said that he really loved me, and that he planned to poison you, so he could choose me as the new queen. I couldn't stand the thought of betraying you anymore. So I came to confess, in hopes that you would forgive me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not true!\" You say, but your pleas fall on deaf ears. \"You made a wise decision.\" Says Mihal. \"Stealing one's mate is punishable by death, and so is treason. Therefore, there will be a trial one week from today, to determine his innocence. You are to be there to present your case, understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my queen.\" Says Jengra, bowing. \"Thank you, oh merciful one.\" She turns and leaves. Mihal turns to you with a snarl. \"You're coming with me.\" She says angrily. She stands up and carries you back to the bedroom. There, the caretakers are tending to Kevin and Yasmin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two, take Kevin and Yasmin out of here, I need to talk to my husband in  private.\" The caretakers bow and do as Mihal says, carrying the children out of the room. Mihal holds you in front of her face. \"YOU BASTARD! HOW COULD YOU!?\" The wind from her yelling feels like a typhoon, as it nearly blows you out of her hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mihal please, listen to me!\" You plead. \"You know I would never betray you like this! How can you believe those lies?\" \"Her scent was on you! Explain that!\" Mihal counters. She has you there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know how that got there. But you have to believe me, someone is framing me!\" Mihal turns her head away, tears streaming down her face. \"I wish I could. What about the children? How will they react to this?\" Mihal reaches under the bed and pulls out what to her would be a small birdcage, but to you, it's as big as your old apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe places you inside the cage and locks the door. \"You will stay there until the trial. I pray that you are innocent, I suggest you do the same.\" She hangs the cage from a hook in the ceiling, suspending you in the air. Then she buries her face in the bed pillows and cries. You stare down at her from your hanging prison, heartbroken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could this have happened? Who was doing this, and why? Whatever punishment was in store for you if found guilty, it couldn't be worse than watching Mihal like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Mihal stopped crying and left the room, leaving you there. She didn't come back until later that night, carrying Kevin and Yasmin in her arms. \"Daddy bad?\" Ask Yasmin upon seeing you in your cage. \"Yes. daddy has done something very wrong, and is being punished.\" Says Mihal as she lays down with them next to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, their snores fills the room. You lay there staring at the roof of your cage. \"Whoever is doing this, they're gonna pay.\" You think to yourself before you finally fall asleep.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(By the way, I'm aware that Mihal let Jake mate with every female on the island, but that was for re-population. She's mad now because he is only supposed to mate with her now. This affair supposedly happened out of lust for another female, not for population. Just thought I'd clear that up.)</span></div></div>",

You were stunned as Mihal enter the room as it looked like the entire island apart from Yasmine and Kevin were there since Mihal wouldn't let them watch the trial. Mihal walks to the center of the room and puts your cage down harshly almost letting it fall before walking up to her throne and sitting down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake you have been charged with treason as well as adultery, how do you plead?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not guilty\" you reply timidly as Mihal was very scary when she was angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihal gestures at the crowd and Jengera steps forward and bows before Mihal \"your majesty for weeks now he has been visiting me in my bedroom saying how I was a much better lover and more beautiful then you are.

There was a gasp from everyone assembled, some had thought you had actually done what you were charged but no one thought you deserved death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared up at Mihal as she stood up and pulled out what you were holding, it was a claw shaving, one of Mihal's sharpened to a fine point. Mihal lifted up the cage and stared at you \"what is that?\" she asks angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her and smile \"Mihal, you won't believe me, I'm sorry, I can't die by your hand, I won't let you carry that burden, I love you, take good care of Kevin and Yasmine\" you say before you stab the claw shaving into your chest.

They run right past Mihal and lift you up and turn you over so the blood won't just fall out as they run off. Mihal turns as there is laughing and it came from Jengera and she was staring at Mihal laughing her head off. \"I can't believe it, the fool killed himself, it would have been much better if your majesty had in fact purged him instead, but this works just as well\" she says. She freezes as Mihal stands up and quickly grabs her lifting Jengera lifting her to her face. \"What did you do?\" Mihal says growling and squeezing the panther in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your majesty, he was a taint, he made us unpure, now we are a pure anthronian race once again, now that we can sustain ourselves\" Jengera gasps out. Mihal stared down at the panther and actually dropped her, Jengera fell to the floor below and everyone assembled heard a crack as a few of her bones broke as she hit the floor. \"Guards take her away but makes sure she stays alive, I want to know if there are more in on this\" Mihal says as 2 guards and 2 more doctors run out of the crowd and lift up Jengera. Mihal steps over them and runs after the 2 anthros that took you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Alright back to you)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt like you were in darkness before you felt a sharp pain in your chest. \"Ok, pain is, pain is good, means I'm still alive\" you think, you heard something, it sounded like crying. You ever so slowly open your eyes, you realized you were in Mihal's bedroom more specifically in the center of her bed reclining against the pillows. You were just able to look down and see that your whole torso was bandaged up, thankfully the bandages weren't bloody so that meant you'd probably survive the wound. You looked around weakly for where the crying is coming from and you spot Mihal sitting in a chair weeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mihal\" you say weakly, her ears perk up and she looks around and then at you. She moves closer and lowers her ear to just above you \"Mihal\" you say again and she smiles the largest you've ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your alive, he's alive\" she shouts before looking like she's going to cry again \"Jake I am so, so sorry, it was all a plot to kill you, and I helped\" Mihal says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared up at her and weakly smiled \"it's, alright.....I would feel horrible and be angry if I thought you had betrayed me\" you say weakly. Mihal looks down at you and ever so gently lifts you up before laying down herself on the bed and gently setting you down in her chest. Mihal stared down at you and gently started to pet your head \"don't worry, I'll make sure these conspirators are brought to justice, and executed for what they have done\" Mihal says almost growling again. You stared up at her stunned, you wanted some sort of recompense but you didn't want whoever did this dead, that would make you no better then them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MIhal\" you croak out and she lowers her head \"yes?\" she replies. You ever so slowly sit up wincing as you lose your balance for a second, \"Mihal, I want you to find out who did this, but don't execute them\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?' she says staring at you shocked \"but they hurt you, they manipulated me they must be brought to justice\" she says and you wince again but this time it wasn't out of pain, it was fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mihal\" you say again and she lowers her head, you hug the front of her muzzle and start gently stroking it \"please, I don't need vengance, All I've seen of in the past week are sadness and anger\" you say. She stares down at you wondering what you are thinking before you speak again as you let go of her muzzle \"Mihal, I'm....I'm afraid of you right now, your not acting like the kind wonderful vixen I fell in love with\" you say. Mihal stares down at you stunned and gently picks you up and moves you onto the bed before lowering her head near you so you were mostly eye to eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry Jake, you're right I haven't been a very good wife, it would have been better if the accusation were true I deserve to be cheated on\" she says starting to tear up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh, shh, no you don't\" you say stroking her muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihal lifts her head and stares at you \"Jake how can you forgive me, I almost got you killed, I've been nothing but angry and bad-tempered, and I wouldn't listen to your side of the story\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared up at Mihal \"are you still the vixen I fell in love with and had 2 wonderful children with?\" you ask. Mihal slowly nods and you lay back \"I can't stay mad because I love you Mihal and as long as you at your core remain the kind vixen I first met, I always will\" you say. You felt your body grow heavy and just before you fell asleep you heard Mihal whisper \"I'll always trust you from now on, no matter what.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You spent the next few days hanging in your prison, pondering your fate. Mihal wouldn't so much as look at you, let alone speak to you. Sometimes you would peek over the side of the cage, and Mihal would be asleep, while Kevin and Yasmin were reaching up at you. You would reach back at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt broke your heart that this was happening to them. You just hoped that when they get older, they don't remember this. Of course, just because you were in solitary confinement, and Mihal was pissed at you, doesn't mean she was cruel. You were brought fruit and water twice a day. Mihal would open the cage door, shove it in, lock the door, and leave without saying a word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou barely slept at all. At  night, you could hear Mihal crying in her sleep. Clearly, this was hurting her even more than it did you. You dreaded what would happen if you're found guilty. Mihal said the punishment was death, but how would it be carried out? Would you be crushed? Eaten? Or maybe have your limbs tied to rocks and thrown into the sea? You shuddered at either thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day before the trial, the door to your cage opened, and Mihal placed a lioness anthro in front of you, shutting the door behind her, and leaving. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lioness was dressed in a white toga with gold trim, and wore what could be described as glasses, two crystal lenses in a bamboo frame, that sat on the bridge of her nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings Jacob.\" She says. \"My name is Sarabi. I am to be your arbiter during your trial.\" \"Arbiter?\" You ask. \"Yes. I will be defending you, and hopefully, if worst comes to worst, at least get you a lighter sentence.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down cross legged in front of you. \"So, can you tell me where you were the night before the accusations were brought to light?\" You concentrate on what you had done a week ago. \"Well, I remember going on my usual stroll.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat part was at least true. Lately you had gotten into the hobby of going for an evening stroll around the city. \"After that, everything is a blur. I don't even remember how I ended up back with Mihal.\" Sarabi nods. \"I see.\" She leans in closer and lowers her voice. \"Your majesty, I'm going to be blunt. There is a conspiracy against you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it!\" You say. \"Someone framed me! But who? And Why? Wait, how do you know this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I overheard a group of people talking about how their plan was working, and that you were sure be executed. The entire island knows about your trial, and they're planning to kave you killed in front of everyone. Even worse, Mihal will be the one to do it. Here, the empress is judge, jury, and executioner.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are suddenly overcome with rage. \"When I get out of this, I'll have whoever is behind it all ground into dust!\" You say, clenching your fists and teeth. \"That's the problem.\" Says Sarabi. \"I'm not sure you can get out of this. The evidence against you is very strong. You'll likely be put to death. But, I might be able to help you in another way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tonight, me and some of my friends who also want to save you, will sneak you out of the palace, and to the island shore. There is a rowboat there, that washed up during a storm. We'll provide you with food and water, and you can escape this island. It is really your only chance for survival.\"   </span></div></div>",

I'll try to get you a less severe punishment, but I can't make any promises.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Day of the Trial..........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day had finally come. Your fate would finally be decided. That morning, Mihal took you out of your cage and placed you on the floor, handing you over to two guards. \"Take him to the box while I get ready.\" She commanded. The guards bowed and did as told. They grabbed your arms and dragged you out the door, through the hall, your feet scraping the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey dragged you into the throne room. There, what seemed like the entire island sat on the floor in front of the throne. Before the throne sat another cage, but this one was much smaller and narrower. you were placed inside the cage and locked inside. Mihal entered the room. Instead of her usual white attire, she was dressed in a black version of her usual dress. She sat on her throne, and stared down at you with a sneer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake.\" She said. \"You are accused of adultery and treason. The penalty for which, is death. How do you plead?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not guilty.\" You say. \"Will the arbiter please step forward?\" Sarabi steps out of the crowd and approaches Mihal. \"The defendant claims to have been on an evening stroll the night the supposed crime took place. He also claims to have only ever mated with Jengra on your orders. Past that, he's never even seen her.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jengra, step forward.\" Says Mihal. Jengra approaches and stands next to Sarabi. \"You claim Jake has been visiting you every night for the past few weeks?\" Mihal asks. \"That is true my queen.\" Says Jengra. \"What would happen during these visits?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He would come into my house, I'd make him a nice dinner, we'd have a bit of wine, then we would sometimes, shall I say, \"Play around\". Then he'd leave.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he promise you my throne, and that he would poison me to give it to you?\" Asks Mihal. \"Yes. He said so in the letter.\" Jengra produced a scroll from inside her sleeve, and showed it to Mihal. \"Arbiter, read the letter.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarai takes the letter and reads it out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dearest Jengra,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihal remains unaware of our little excursion. Soon, we can be together without fear of discovery. Once I have disposed of Mihal, we shall rule this Island together, no one will be able to separate us. As for the two little brats, they shall be dealt with as well. I shall poison them all when the time is right. No one will suspect a thing, and Anthromia will be ours! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDearly yours,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one else saw this?\" Asks Mihal. \"Yes, actually. Some of the citizens here witnessed him sneaking in through my window.\" \"Who? Raise your hands.\" Commands Mihal. Five anthros in the crowd raise their hands. \"After you \"Played around\", that is how your scent was on him?\" Asks Mihal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is, my queen.\" Says Jengra. \"Very well. Does the defense have anything to say?\" You bow your head, knowing you have been beaten. \"No, Mihal. I have nothing.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tear runs down Mihal's face as she speaks. \"Then, Jake, you are hear by found guilty of both charges. I have no choice but to sentence you to death by digestion. To be carried out immediately.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihal reaches down to pick up your cage, when Sarabi cries \"WAIT!\" Mihal pauses as Sarabi motions for her to bend down closer. Sarabi whispers in Mihal's ear, and she sits back in her throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. The Arbiter has made a very good point.

They bring you in front of Mihal and stand on either side of you, forcing you onto your knees, holding you up by your arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bring the potion.\" Orders Mihal. A guard leaves the throne room, and comes back with a vile containing a strange, glowing blue liquid. \"Administer the punishment.\" Mihal commands. The guard stands in front of you, and tilts your head back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe forces you to open your mouth with her fingers an pours the strange fluid down your throat. The taste is so awful, it makes you gag! Like someone liquified old gym socks. You sit there, coughing for a few seconds. Then, the pain hits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBurning, searing pain, as though your insides were on fire. The guards release your arms as you collapse on all fours. Your skin burns, as yellow fur  with black spots sprouts from every follicle on your body. Your insides feel as though they are being torn out and rearranged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour jaws feel like nails are being driven into your gums, as your teeth reshape into fangs. You face elongates into a muzzle, your nose and eyes change into that of a feline. Your ears become rounded and small, and move to the top of your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour feel as though every bone in your body is snapping in two, as your entire form elongates and enlarges, tearing your clothes to shreds. Your fingers and toes feel like they are being split and claws shoot out from the tips. Finally, you feel a tail tear its way out of your backside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow bad was the pain? Well, if you're a guy, and you've ever taken a hit to the groin, imagine that pain, multiplied by a thousand percent. Yes, ouch indeed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the pain stops. You sit there, hunched over, naked, and panting. \"What........was...........that?\" You ask between gasps. One of the guards hold a large mirror in front of you. There, staring back at you, is an anthro cheetah. You place your clawed hand on the surface of the glass, the cheetah does likewise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm.........one of you.\" You say. \"Yes.\" Says Mihal. \"You had better learn to love the pain, because there's a lot more of it to come.\" \"What do you mean?\" You ask. \"That potion you drank will cause you to continually transform into an anthronian at random. you may change again in a few minutes, or a few days. Either way, there is no way to control it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm stuck enduring unbearable pain for the rest of my life!?\" You exclaim. \"Maybe, maybe not.\" Says Mihal. \"If I feel you have learned your lesson, I might give you the antidote. Until then, well, you know what they say. Love hurts.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihal stands up from her throne and waves a hand. \"Court is dismissed.\" The crowd begins funneling out through the doors. You run up to Mihal's feet and look up at her. \"Please tell me I can at least be with you and the kids again.\" You beg. Mihal ponders it for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" She says. \"You may be with us again. But, to add to your punishment, you're going to be doing a lot more around here than what you did before. Such as helping me take care of the children, giving me belly rubs, and anything else I can think of. Understand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. \"Yes, my dear.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So far you have been a leopard, a cat, a bat, a snake, a mongoose, a dragon, a husky, a crow, a mouse, a squirrel, a skunk, and you lost track of what else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wondered just how much more of this you could withstand before you finally went mad from the pain. On top of all this, Mihal forced you to do various tasks around the palace. These ranged from scrubbing her entire throne from top to bottom, to giving Kevin and Yasmin a bath using only your tongue.         <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Kevin and Yasmin, when they first saw you in your transfigured state, they didn\u2019t recognize you and growled at you. Mihal had to tell them it was you before you could get near them. Mihal would also make you do such tasks as cleaning the inside of her mouth, or between her toes. She would also make you massage her back, which, given it was as long as a football field, left your body hurting even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihal may have been kind and loving, but she could hold one hell of a grudge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night you sat on Mihal\u2019s belly, scratching it as she lay in bed, Kevin and Yasmin asleep at her sides. Currently you were in the form of a wolf. \u201cMihal?\u201d You ask. She grunted in response. \u201c I need to talk to you.\u201d Mihal picked you up between her fingers and placed you on her right breast. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026\u2026\u201d You begin. \u201cWell, I have done everything you have told me to do this past week without complaint, not to mention I\u2019ve transfigured I don\u2019t know how many times. Each of which, was more painful than if I had been a victim of the Spanish Inquisition.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe what?\u201d Mihal asks, confused.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever mind.\u201d You say. \u201cAnyway, don\u2019t you think I\u2019ve suffered enough?\u201d Mihal didn\u2019t respond for a moment, before saying, \u201c I don\u2019t know. I think You should go another month, just to be sure the message is drilled into your head, to never betray me again.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMihal, please, listen to me!\u201d You say. \u201cDo you really think I would betray YOU? The woman who took me in when I was stranded with no way home? Who I fell in love with and who birthed my children? Only someone truly heartless would betray a love like that! You know I am not heartless.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you feel the transformation flaring up again. You writhe and roll on Mihal\u2019s breast as your entire body feels as though you were being dunked in molten slag. You change from a wolf to a fox. Your fur turns orange, with your belly, chest, and chin being white, and black on your hands and feet. You tail becomes thick and bushy, white a tip of white at the end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finish transforming, you lay there panting. \u201cI wish I could believe you.\u201d Says Mihal, with a hint of sadness. \u201cBut the evidence that you are guilty is too compelling.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMihal!\u201d You half yell, now starting to get angry. \u201cI never wrote that letter! There is a conspiracy against me, Sarabi told me so!\u201d At this, Mihal\u2019s ears perk up. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t she say anything about this then?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d You say. \u201cPlease, just end this now, it\u2019s been torture for both of us, in more ways than one.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Miahl asks. \u201cI mean, just knowing that you harbor this anger towards me is worse than any punishment you could give me.\u201d You say, hanging your head. A single tear rolls down Mihal\u2019s cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe holds you up to her face and nuzzles you as she cries. \u201cTo say that, you must be truly innocent.\u201d You hug her cheek and pat her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t cry.\u201d You say. \u201cYou must hate me now for what I\u2019ve done to you.\u201d Says Mihal, now beginning to whine like a puppy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever.\u201d You say. \u201cYou did what had to be done, even if it was for a false charge.\u201d You climb up Mihal\u2019s face to the top of her head and scratch her ears until she stops crying. \u201cThank you.\u201d she says, her voice quivering slightly. \u201cI am going to end this right now.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe carefully get out of bed and makes her way to the bedroom door, with you still on  top of her head. She opens the door and orders the servant standing outside it to bring her the antidote. The servant ran off anf came back a few minutes later carrying a vile with a glowing red liquid inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihal placed you in her palm and handed you the vile between her fingers. You uncork the vile with your teeth and hastily swallow the liquid down, eager to end this constant torture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: The antidote works! You are fully transformed back into a human. Of course, the conspirators will still be looking for a way to dispose of you, and will likely send an assassin this time.      <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: The antidote only half works. It stops your random transformations, but you are permanently stuck as a fox. At least maybe now the conspirators will stop trying to kill you.     <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Arbiter, fetch some wine.\" Sarabi leaves the throne room and comes back with a bottle and two cups. The guards unlock your cage and you step out, walking over to Jengra. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarabi hands you both a cup, and pours. You hold your cup in front of you. \"To you, my dear.\" You say. Jengra toasts h her cup against yours. \"To you, my king.\" She puts her cup to her lips and drinks. You do likewise, but only pretend to drink. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Jengra. Exactly how did your scent get on me?\" You ask. \"Oh, it was easy.\" Says Jengra matter-of-factly.\"You were on your evening walk and you stopped at a wine-house for a drink. I followed you there and greeted you, and pretended to share a few drinks with you. Once you were drunk enough, it was easy to seduce you into coming back to my place and have some fun with you.  After that, I left you outside the palace steps, Mihal found you there, brought you inside, and step one was complete.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Step one of what?\" you ask. \"Our plan to frame you and have you executed.\" Says Jengra as though it were common knowledge. Several gasps arose from the crowd, loudest of all from Mihal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't really write that letter, did I?\" You say. \"Nope. Forged it this morning.\" Says Jengra. \"Also, those supposed witnesses who saw me with you, they're in on this too, aren't they?\" You ask. \"Yep, they planned it all, and I carried it out.\" Jengra suddenly slaps her hand over her mouth, realizing everything she just said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile. The truth potion in the wine had done the trick. Just like you and Sarabi planned. At this point, the five anthros who had raised their hands earlier shoot up and run for the exit. \"Seize them!\" Shouts Mihal. All the guards run after the conspirators, while Jengra stands there, still in shock of what she had just done.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, The guards came back, dragging the five traitors, all of whom were felines. She stood before Mihal on their knees, heads bowed. \"So, you tricked me into nearly killing my own mate!\" Says Mihal furiously. \" For that you will all suffer far worse than what Jake would have endured, I promise you that!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMihal ordered the guards to take the conspirators, including Jengra, to the dungeons, where she would deal with the later. After they had left, she picked you up and nuzzled you to her cheek, tears streaming from her eyes. \"My king, I am so sorry! Please, can you ever forgive me?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" you say, hugging her cheek. \"It's not your fault. They did this to me, not you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which.\" Says Mihal, holding you in front of her. \"What would you have me do with the conspirators?\"</span></div></div>",

Another cascade of water follows as Kibal drinks a second glass, then a third, fourth and fifth! You decide playing dead might be a good idea at this point and just start floating around on your back, keeping as silent as you can. More water flows in, lifting you up until you almost touch the roof of her stomach... But not quite. There's a good few seconds of silence, and then a satisfied grunt from the wolf, who lays back in her throne with a loud belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you simply lay there floating. These aren't the best conditions - but at least you're not in immediate danger, you guess. And so you lay there, waiting for something to happen. The water level in the stomach slowly drops over time as she absorbs it into her system, leaving the room about a quarter full before something happens... A little sphincter, so small you hadn't spotted it yet, opens up near the base and begins to suck the water downwards, quickly forming a huge waterfall!

Momentarily dazed, bubbles form around you as your head spins from the shear force of the suction. Your lower body soon manages to get sent straight into a rather tight hole, as a squishy like sensation wraps around your waist. A quick shudder courses down your spine by the odd feeling the lower sphincter provided as it greedily begins to slurp up your form. In no time, your whole body was slurped up before being deposited right through the compact hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe current soon begins to lighten up in intensity as you somehow manage to arise up from the watery surface with a gasp. \"y-you've got to be kidding.\" you stutter in utter revolt, now aware of your new location.

Which, you had a feeling it would be if they didn't get done on time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard takes you to an enormous pot on a fire in the center of the room, surrounded by ladders. Slaves stand on top of the ladders around the pot, peeling and cutting vegetables and throwing them in. The guard hands you an onion and a small knife, then turns around and leaves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb a free ladder and begin cutting, the fumes of the onion burning your eyes. \"You new here?\" A voice next to you asks. You turn to see another human slave. He has dark black hair, and looks a little too skinny for his height. \"Yeah.\" you say. \"Well, I hope you have a good work ethic.\" He says. \"Because if you don't, your the one who will be thrown in the pot next. The name's Kyle.\" \"Jake.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both stand there cutting, talking to each other. \"So how did you get here?\" You ask. \"I was out fishing in my boat on the ocean. I saw this island and came ashore to explore it. I've been here for three years now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so you have a boat on the shore?\" you ask. \"I did. I don't know if it's still there.\" He replies solemnly. \"Don't even think about trying to find it. We'd never make it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour stomach begins growling. \"When do they feed us?\" You ask. \"When Kibal finishes her dinner. Then we eat whatever's left. But there's never much left.\" He says. That would explain his wiry frame. After you finish cutting the onions, you begins doing potatoes and carrots. But you are shocked when the time comes to add the meat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlaves, whom you assume had tried to escape, are thrown into the pot by guards.Their screams echo through the entire kitchen. You know that you'd best follow their example, if you don't want to end up like them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kibal enters the kitchen, towering over everyone. \"I'm hungry. You all better hope you did a good job with my stew.\" The goes over to a huge cabinet and pulls out a wooden bowl and spoon. Then she gets out a ladle big enough to be the big dipper. She scoops the slave soup into her bowl and tastes it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good enough.\" She says. \"She drinks at least ten bowls of the soup before she is satisfied. After she leaves, the slaves begin crowding around the pot, hoping to get some of the stew themselves. They take long hollow bamboo chutes and use them as straws, sucking the leftover soup up. You don't even bother to. The idea of eating soup with human in it disgusts you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter cleaning up the kitchen, you are taken to the slave quarters, a huge dark room with a single fire in the center. They only thing to sleep on is piles of straw. You lay in a corner trying to sleep, while the other gather around the fire, talking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear that her power comes from that jewel around her neck.\" One says. \"Even if it did, how would we get it?\" Says another. You ignore them and their illusions of a way to escape. You know your stuck here for the rest of your life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, you dream you are running away from Kibal through the jungle, her footsteps making the very ground shake. Suddenly her huge hand grabs you and holds you over her head. She licks her lips as she opens her mouth, blasting you with her gagging breath. You scream as you are dropped into the darkness of her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awake with a start. Someone was shaking you while you slept! You feel a hand close over your mouth in the darkness. \"Come with me.\" A voice whispers in your ear. \"I know how to escape this place.

Soon you can make out the shoreline from about fifty yards away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKale goes over to a large pile of palm leaves, and moves them away to reveal an overturned rowboat. \"Go. Get back to your home.\" \"Your not coming?\" You ask. \"No. I can never leave here.

You turn to see Amazons were following you! \"Go!\" Yells Kale as he tries to lead them away, running off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo of the amazons go after Kale, two others come after you.

You both are at her eye level due to her height. \"Well, we have a method for punishing slaves who try to escape.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns to Kale. \"I have a special punishment for you, son.\" \"SON!?\" You exclaim. \"That's right. This ungrateful little welp has crossed me for the last time.\" She grabs Kale's chains and holds him over her mouth. \"I had you inside me when you were born, and now you'll be inside me as you die.\" She dropped the chains, and Kale fell into her open mouth.

Her expression changed, instead of anger, you see her smile mercilessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake..\" She starts out slowly. \"Let me tell you a little story, I'll keep it short and sweet as to not bore you.\" she finishes in a sarcastic tone giving way to a small grin revealing those ever dangerous teeth of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One thing you probably notice about this island, other then the anthropomorphic creatures, is that there are no males.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she talks, you realize that she was right, everyone you had seen so far had been female, you listen as she continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A long time ago, there were males, just smaller males, maybe a little big then you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put in \"Well what happened to them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quiet you\" the Wolfess glared<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There was a revolution of sorts, the larger, more powerful female Amazon Anthros of the island captured the males, with the help of this\" She taps a claw to the ruby necklace she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once we had proven to be the dominant sex, we enslaved them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp quietly at the thought of all this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are some, males left\" she continues \"but they have disappeared into the depths of the jungle\" she smirks at her next thought \"even some females joined them... what fools\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way the Wolfess spoke just a moment ago made it sound as if she was hiding something. You quickly think that the remaining males and you guessed some females must be hidden out in the jungle, this might be your only chance of escape, or even survival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started to speak again, \"And now on to you my little furless friend. Few of your kind appear on our island, only 3 others before you have washed up on my shores. You see, it is very rare we have slaves around, we would never enslave our own gender, but seeing you are male, makes you the perfect candidate. One sadly remarkable thing about you humans is how little <i>pain</i> you can withstand. At least with our males, they put up a fight, a struggle, they make it fun, but for you, it's just work work work. However, this is a good thing, because your kind make some of the most obedient slaves I have ever seen, with such little effort for us. I don't even have to hurt you to make you do something, but that will <u>always</u> be an option, just up to you.<br>\r\nSo, slave, let's get back to your punishment, that story tired me out. How about a nice foot bath.\" She smirked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she said didn't register in your brain, and you let out in involuntary \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me\" she said coldly \" you are to clean my paws\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe adjusted herself again so her massive gray furred, footpaws were placed in front of you. What lay before you was an expanse of paw pad and fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how am I suppose to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't talk back to your new master, slave. Just for that, you can have the pleasure of using your tongue\" She said in a smug tone.<br>\r\n\"Do it now, or I'll end you like the little bug you are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided not to risk it, you will need your chance to escape, and being squashed under her foot isn't part of the plan. You preceded with a grimace on your face. You stepped towards her paws again, bringing your face close to the rough leathery surface of her dark gray pawpad. A musky odor was detected, you hadn't noticed it so much while massaging earlier, but the closer you get to her furry toes, the stronger the smell gets. You couldn't describe it as anything you knew, just a heavy musky smell. Your height only came up to the ball of the footpaw some that's where you started. You lean forward the last bit and press your tongue to the warm surface. It was surprisingly soft, contradicting it's rougher appearance. You slowly dragged your tongue up a small distance on her paw. The taste of grime and sweat entered your mouth, but was fully intensified when you closed your mouth. Above her toes wiggle a bit, it probably tickled. You mustered up the courage to place your tongue back on the pungent surface. Again pulling your tongue over the wide expanse of her leathery, musky pawpad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you had only been working on the ball of her right footpaw, you still had so much to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked above the towering toes to see the Wolfess relaxed with her eyes closed. This could be your chance to escape if you play you cards right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get back to licking, repeating the process all over again on the rest of the ball of her footpaw and then the heel. When you stopped licking her heel, the giant anthro wolfess opened one eye and looked down on the miniscule creature below. She adjusted herself again, making her feet push down, and her toes lower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spoke in a groggy but commanding voice. \"Your not done yet\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drat\" this was going to be the hardest part. You were hoping she would just fall asleep, or even just move on to the next paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith thoughts of escape still on your mind, you submit. You move towards her huge toes each with it's own little pawpad. You start on her 1st gray furred toe. One large claw right above you as you started to lick the mini-pawpad. Her furry toe was slightly bigger then your head. You decide not to wait for her to ask, so when the time came, you forced your head between her toes, making an honest effort licking, or at least trying not to pass out. Between the toes was the worse part, it's where that musky smell was from, and with your head in there, it was magnified to an alarming degree. You lick between the giant toes, all kinds of gunk getting in your mouth, creating a multitude of bad tastes. Then out of nowhere, a immense pressure is pressed upon your head. You were stuck. She is squeezing her toes together forcing your head into the furry valley between her toes. Ther smell was horrific, it was has if there was no escape from it. You pull and tug, but your head isn't budging and now its getting warmer and smellier. All while struggling, you think \"God Damn, she must have fallen asleep and be dreaming or somthing!\" With the last bit of strength you had, you finally pulled you head free. You fall backwards due to the momentum gasping for the fresh cool air. Breathing heavily and wiping the moisture from your face, you look up to see the wolfess sleeping. You look back in front of you at her twitching and wiggling toes... \"Glad I'm not in there anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance around the colossal room, designed to accommodate an equally colossal anthro Wolfess. The guards appeared to have left but who knows for how long. This could be your chance to escape!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll play with him some more there.\" The two guards who found you grab your arms and drag you through the palace halls, to a huge black stone door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey push the door open like it was nothing, and push you inside. Inside, the room is lit by torches. In the corner is a massive mirror. Apparently, Kibal likes to admire herself. In the other corner is a pile of bones. You dread to think what they came from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the center of the room is a gigantic bed, with black sheets and black curtains around it. The guards nudge you toward the bed with their spear tips. When you reach the bed, you stare up at the top. To you, it looks like you're at the bottom of a mountain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunk guard pokes you with her spear. \"Get climbing.\" She says. You gulp and grab hold of the sheets, and start to climb. You don't know how long it took you to get to the top, but when you do, you're exhausted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards leave and you lay back on the bed, and fall asleep. Shortly after, you feel something poking you. \"Hey, I didn't say you could sleep.\" You wake up to see Kibal standing over you. \"Wake up! You have work to do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she lifts her black gown over her head, and your jaw hits the bed. For such an evil bitch, she had a fantastic body. \"Like what you see, little man?\" She says. \"Well, you're in luck, because you're going to give me a massage.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lays on the bed face down next to you. \"Well? Get to work!\" <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

You carefully latch onto a patch of her fur and slowly haul yourself up onto her back. Your body still aches from being \"toyed\" with earlier. Your hopes were that Kibal would realize this, and thus go easy on you. However, those thoughts were quickly dashed as the wolfess turns her head, a smirk utmost deviancy present on her muzzle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go up along my spine.

And if I don't approve of the job you've done at the very end of this....there will be consequences...dire consequences.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly nod, kneeling onto her vast spinal column to allow your hands to begin to knead fur and flesh alike. After about five minutes, you quickly realize that this massage will be no walk in the park. Your arms begin to burn, sweat pours down your brow....but you continue to work regardless, knowing that you would quickly become a stain on Kibal's large paws if you failed this test of hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after a good hour of massaging her back, you finally make it to the nape of her neck.

She lightly gripped her necklace, the ruby glowing for a moment as the black silken sheets remade themselves perfectly; even the pillows were fluffed. A wicked grin was plastered on her face as she sauntered over to your cage. Living in a tropical climate, she was sporting better sleepwear than a stuffy robe: a blood-red tear drop G-string that just barely managed to cover her slit and an equally-red micro triangle bra that similarly barely covered her nipples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been aware for some time of the rebel faction. I'm not an idiot, you know. My own spies have been working relentlessly to discover any traitors, and they've gotten quite a few over the years.\" Kibal paused, tapping a claw contemplatively on the surface of the table. \"I admit, I find it fascinating that despite my spies' best efforts, there's always one more traitor to catch, one more plot to foil.\" She snorted. \"It doesn't matter; Mira will be interrogated and executed by tomorrow, and you'll be the topping on my favorite desert before I retire to a restful slumber.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to leave, and, desperate to save Mira's life, you shouted out, \"Killing us won't stop your real enemy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKibal stopped, glancing over her shoulder as she said, \"And why should I believe this little ploy of yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because,\" you said, \"Mira's eyes were glazed over when she was talking to me. Unless she's blind, then who's to say she wasn't under some kind of possession spell? Just look at the magic your ruby gives you; I'm betting there's another magic jewel out there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Somebody has the emerald...\" Kibal said to herself softly, and then remembered you were there. \"You still haven't given me a reason to trust you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please, I'm going to be eaten alive if I <i>don't</i> gain your favor,\" was your answer, and it took most of your courage to keep from giving yourself away. \"I don't exactly love being a slave, but I'd rather be the pet of a tyrant than suffering forever in some crappy spirit world...assuming I even get that lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKibal chuckled darkly. \"Yes, self-preservation is a powerful motivator. I'd save my own life if our positions were reversed.\" She tapped her chin pensively. \"But what to do about Mira? If she's being possessed, then it's because she's the best avenue through which to attack me. If my enemy were to use you, they'd have to reevaluate every step of their assassination plot and I'd too easily discover a mastermind, because a lowly, enslaved newcomer couldn't cobble together a serious threat against someone like myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were sickened by her ego, but you had to egg her on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Mistress, if Mira is possessed, then how are you going to confront your true enemy? Entrapping Mira won't work because she'll just be released from the spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fool,\" Kibal snapped. \"My ruby should be able to magically ensnare whoever is controlling my chambermaid so that I can either banish my enemy's very soul or at least learn their identity while freeing my servant.\" She paused, thinking. \"Yes, I'll do it tomorrow night, when Mira comes to attend my bath. That will be the perfect time to try again to kill me, since the poisonous body rub has failed.\" Reaching down, she opened your cage and then grasped her ruby again. \"You've served me well, pet. I think such...loyalty...deserves a reward.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped. \"M-me, Mistress? A reward?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKibal nodded, grinning. \"Yes, and perhaps more than one. This enemy has pestered me for so long that one small act of repayment seems so little; perhaps three small acts coupled together will suffice? You'll receive the other two soon enough, but for now, be satisfied with the first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ruby began to glow steadily, and you were levitated out of the cage. Your raggedy loincloth was effortlessly torn away as you were tossed onto the bed. You only had a moment to scramble into an upright seated position before the bed sucked you in like oil-colored quicksand. Up to your neck in cushion-backed black silk, you looked in wide-eyed fear to Kibal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M-mistress?! What is this?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughed as she replied, \"Your reward, my pet. My powers allow me to manipulate many elements in quite a few ways, but none of them have the wonderful feel of expertly-crafted silk. I've been toying with myself often with this method over the past several months, and I can't tell you how exhilarating and relaxing it is.\"  She sighed, almost dreamily. \"Silken black tendrils violating your every hole... You have no idea how fortunate you are, pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Due to the graphic nature of this section, the author of this story has edited this scene out. Baisically, you are tentacle raped by her bed sheets.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lay there, helpless and gasping, Kibal chuckled and said, \"I hope you enjoyed that, my pet. Rewards of that quality and magnitude don't come often to those I favor. Now get some sleep; I need you rested if you're going to help me protect my crown.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour strength gone, you passed out into merciful oblivion.</span></div></div>",

She grasps you in her fist, and exits the room into the halls. \u201cBefore I can have any fun with you,\u201d She says, \u201cWe have to make sure you don\u2019t have any of that poison left on you.\u201d When she reaches the throne room, she points to one of the guards at the door. You notice that it was the same skunk who found you yesterday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKibal lowers you to the floor and the skunk takes your arm. \u201cTake him to the baths and scrub every inch of him from top to bottom.\u201d Kibal orders. The skunk nods and leads you buy the arm through the halls once more. She brings you to a wooden door far too small for Kibal to enter. This bath must be for the slave\u2019s use. Kibal\u2019s own bath would no doubt be much larger and grander.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the room was a round shallow pool about thirty feet wide. At the edge of the pool were various bottles of multi color liquids and brushes, used to bathe no doubt. The skunk sets her spear down and motions for you to remove your clothes. It didn\u2019t take long to do, since all you wore was a loincloth. Of course, you couldn\u2019t remove your bracer because it was magically locked. Maybe you would get lucky and it would rust. Although, you had to admit you felt uncomfortable stripping in front of a woman, even if it was a skunk-woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step into the pool and sit down at the edge. Even sitting down, the water only came up to your stomach. The skunk gets down on her knees behind you and begins scrubbing you with a brush, the rough bristles feel like sandpaper as they rake up and down your back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo the poison trick didn\u2019t work?\u201d Asks the skunk. \u201cNope.\u201d You say, before realizing, \u201cWait, how do you know about that?!\u201d She quickly covers your mouth with her hand. \u201cMy name is Angela. I\u2019m one of the conspirators against Kibal.\u201d She whispers. You move her hand away and whisper \u201cYou need to warn Mira. I told Kibal it looked like she was under a spell as she spoke to me last night. Kibal plans to interrogate her when Mira goes to give her a bath.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela nodded. \u201cI will warn her. But first, I must finish with your bath.\u201d She pours some blue liquid from one of the bottles into her hand and begins rubbing it all over you. The oil felt cool on your skin, and smelled of berries. \u201cWhy not pretend to have given me a bath and send me back out to her? She\u2019ll no doubt want me in her mouth again.\u201d You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019ll likely sniff you when you get back to her to make sure.\u201d Says Angela. \u201cI have to get every last trace of poison off of you, or she\u2019ll suspect me.\u201d   She vigorously scrubs your entire body with the brush, making you feel like you were being rubbed with a cactus. You just hope you didn\u2019t lose too much skin. <br>\r\nFinally, Angela finishes scrubbing you and you step out of the bath. You look around and see no towel or anything to dry off with. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you expect me to stand here until I drip dry.\u201d you say. Angela shakes her head. \u201cOf course not.\u201d Suddenly, her long bushy tail wraps around your body, gently rubbing you up and down, drying you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to admit that you rather enjoyed this. Her fur was thick and soft like a blanket, and felt incredibly warm after standing in the cold air. You were a little disappointed when she stopped. Angela reaches behind her and pulls something out of her belt. It was a knife, with a wooden handle, leather sheath, and a large curved obsidian blade. She hands the knife to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this for?\u201d You ask. \u201cIf you ever anger Kibal, or she grows bored of you, she\u2019s bound to eat you. This will give you a means of escape.\u201d Says Angela. \u201cYou expect me to cut my way out of her!?\u201d You exclaim. Angela quickly shhhhh\u2019s you with her finger. \u201cYou have a better idea?\u201d You shake your head. \u201cThen just take it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strap the sheath around your thigh, covering it with your loincloth. Angela takes you by the arm and leads you out of the room back to Kibal, who is sitting in her throne, staring down at you. Kibal picks you up between her fingers and holds you up to her nose. Just as Angela said, she sniffs you, making sure you don\u2019t still smell of poison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a satisfied grunt, she placed you on the armrest of her throne, propping her head up on her fist. \u201cI have to deal with a few traitors today, so just stay put and keep your mouth shut.\u201d She says. \u201cSend the first one in.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entrance doors to the throne room open, and through them enters two guards, dragging a young male husky by his arms. He is dressed similarly to you, wearing only a loincloth and bracer. The guards bring him to the center of the room, and force him down onto his knees. \u201cThis one was caught trying to escape Mistress.\u201d Says one of the guards.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husky boy is shaking like a leaf as he stares up at Kibal, who smiles evilly. \u201cWell now, what punishment would befit such an ungrateful slave?\u201d Kibal wonders aloud. The husky looks about ready to wet himself as Kibal taps a finger to her chin. Her face lights up as she suddenly has a wicked idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShave him!\u201d She orders. \u201cThen take him into the jungle and throw him in the thorn patch. Take him back to the slave quarters after he\u2019s crawled out, and leave any thorns he has in him.\u201d The husky flails and cries as the guards grab him by the arms and drag him away. You were about to say how Kibal had given him too harsh a punishment, but quickly decided not to after thinking that she could come up with something far worse for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly came to realize that Kibal\u2019s cruelty knew no boundary. Most of the punishments she gave out were to slaves who tried to escape or refused to obey orders. One of them she ordered to be hung upside-down by his ankles over  a pool of boiling water and slowly dunked and raised from it fifty times. <br>\r\nAnother she ordered to be used as a scratching post by the feline guards. One of her guards had been caught steeling from the vaults, so Kibal ordered her hands chopped off. But the worst one of all came not with a slave or guard, but with a citizen. A mouse-woman was dragged into the throne room, her feet scraping the floor as the guards held her arms over her head. \u201cThis one was found to have aided in your attempted poisoning, Mistress.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKibal scowled. \u201cSo, yet another conspirator trying to assassinate me. There is only one punishment for that.\u201d She grins evilly, showing her wicked sharp teeth. You immediately know what\u2019s coming. \u201cDo you have any last words?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, the mouse doesn\u2019t look afraid at all. That, or she\u2019s hiding it very well. She stands up straight and defiant. \u201cYes. Killing me will only rally others to our cause.  No matter how many of us you kill, there will always be more to end your tyranny and restore the rightful queen.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKibal laughed. \u201cEven if you could stop me, how would you ever regain my bitch of a sister as queen? I turned that whore to stone with my necklace. If I die, the jewel\u2019s power dies with me, and nothing will revive her. Now then, time for my mid-morning snack.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards who brought in the mouse grab her and shove her forward. Kibal picks the mouse up between her fingers and raises her up to her face. Kibal sticks her tongue out and licks the mouse girl, tasting her, but the mouse bites her on the tongue, hard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKibal lets out a sudden gasp and wretches in pain, quickly pulling her tongue away, and covering her mouth with her hand. She glares at the mouse and growls. \u201cBig mistake.\u201d she says, voice filled with malice. \u201cI was just going to swallow you, but now\u2026\u2026..\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKibal opened her mouth wide, blasting the mouse with her foul breath. The mouse girl still showed no fear, staring into the cavernous mouth that was soon to be her doom with the utmost defiance on her face. You couldn\u2019t help but admire her for that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kibal tossed the mouse into her mouth, and brought her jaws slamming down with a sickening crunch that made you flinch. To make it even worse, there was even more crunching as she chewed. The horrid sound sent a chill through your body, each one seeming to echo through the room. Finally, Kibal tilted her head back and swallowed, sending the remains of the brave mouse-girl to their final resting place.               <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt nauseas after watching such a gruesome display. You nearly vomit, but force yourself to hold it down. \u201cAny more offenders for me to deal with?\u201d Kibal asks. \u201cThat\u2019s all Mistress.\u201d Replies one of the guards. \u201cGood.\u201d Says Kibal, leaning back in her throne. \u201cAll this punishment puts me in the mood for some entertainment.\u201d She looks down at you.</span></div></div>",

Her wings are at least fifty feet wide, with the webbing between them yellow also. Her fingers and toes are tipped with curved, black claws. She wears no clothes, other than a silk skirt that goes down to her knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come closer.\" She said. You approach her step by step. She bent over and lowered her hand, palm up. You timidly climb into her hand, and she lifts you up to her face. \"Why are you here?\" She asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell her how you were thrown overboard in the storm. \"I see.\" She says. \"Well, until I can decide what to do with you, you will be kept in my chambers..\" She lowers you onto the floor. \"Take him to my bed chamber.\" She orders her guards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards lead you out of the throne room, down a massive hallway. You come to a pair of twin golden doors, the guards each push one open, and lead you into the bedroom. Everything in the room is ten times your size! The bed is big enough to be an aircraft carrier! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards pull out a bamboo ladder from under the bed, and motion for you to climb it. You start climbing the ladder up the side of the bed, a task that takes you about ten minutes. When you reach the top, all you see is a vast desert of satin sheets. You walk over to the edge, feet sinking into the soft bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down and see the two guards standing at the bottom. \"Stay right here!\" One of them yells up to you. \"The Empress will be with you soon!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay back on the bed, sinking into the mattress. The bed is so soft that you fall asleep, after all you've been through. You wake up to a giant scaled finger poking you. You turn and see the dragoness is laying beside you. \"Sleep well?\" She asks, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit up, marveling at how truly huge she is. \"Well, I've decided to give you a choice.\" She says. \"I need someone to watch over my eggs. Someone to keep them warm and safe, and feed them after they hatch. So, you can be my royal egg watcher. Or, you could be my little pet. You'll keep me company and you'll be taken good care of. So what'll it be?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weigh both options, deciding wich would be better. Finally, you come to a decision.  <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

She stops between two columns and presses her hand against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wall swings back to reveal a hidden passage! The passage is lined with torches, and a spiraling staircase going down below the palace. She begins descending the stairs, your eyes adjusting to the dim light. When she reaches the bottom of the stairs, you see a clutch of six eggs, each of them as big as an SUV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sets you down on the floor, and gather all of her eggs into a group. Then, she places them in the middle of the room, in the the center of a pile of wood. She opens her mouth and a jet of flame shoot out, igniting the wood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, make sure that fire stays burning. It will keep my hatchlings warm, and also determine their gender. I would prefer that you keep it at high heat, as I want them to be female.\" She points to the corner, and you see an enormous stock of wood for the fire. \"Restock the flame every few hours or so.\" She continues. \"That should keep it hot enough. I'll send some dinner down for you later. Bye!\" And she leaves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit and stare at the fire, hoping you don't screw this up. If you don't follow her orders, you don't want to think what she could do. As the flames glow, you see the eggs become somewhat transparent. You can make out the silouhetes of the baby dragons inside. You really hope that when they hatch, they don't mistake you for their first meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some horus of watching them, you restock the flames, and lay down and fall asleep.  <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

You sit down again but then hear a cracking sound. One of the eggs is hatching! You see the snout of a dragon poke through the shell, and then notice the other eggs are beginning to hatch as well. One by one they emerge from their eggs and fall onto the floor. They start to open their eyes and sniff around around a little. You move back, unintentionally catching their attention. One of them looks in your direction and starts crawling toward you. The others follow behind and soon they have you surrounded. As they move closer you flinch but they don't try to hurt you. Instead you are pushed to ground as they dog pile on top of you. They roll around together with you caught in the middle until you fall onto your stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA booming sound draws closer and closer until Akair's scaly feet appear in front of you. You look up at the dragoness but she's not looking at you. Her gaze is fixed on the dragons playing together behind you. There's a smile on her face as she steps over you to get to her children. One by one she picks them up and inspects them. \"All of them are female, I guess you did your job.\" she says. Then she picks you up and carries you off with her children. She enters her bed chamber and places her children on the bed, but simply tosses you down. \"Now since you succeeded in your task you will be given a new job.\" she begins. \"From now on you will help me take care of them as their caregiver.\" She just basically made you a nanny. Before you can respond to her one of them pounces on you and licks your hair. \"It seems they've already become attached to you anyway.\" Akair notes. Maybe its because you're the first thing they saw after hatching. When Akair sits down they go to her as well. Even though you hatched them, they still know who their mother is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom then on you help Akair raise the dragons. At first she expected them to eat you when they were big enough, but it seems they were too attached to you. You also notice that they mature a lot quicker than humans.

You've been helping Akair take care of them ever since. A short while after they hatched some of the other subjects felt that someone more capable should do it, but the girls were already too attached to you. You played with them all the time and watched them when Akair had duties to perform. Early on in their lives they would all cuddle with you and dog pile on top of you. As time passed you saw that they matured faster than humans, and they went from babies to children in just a couple of years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day you are napping in your bed peacefully. A low rumbling stirs you from your sleep and you find yourself being prodded by someone's claw. You wake up to see Amelia smiling down at you. She looks like the rest of her sisters except for her hair, which is shoulder length. \"Good morning!\" she says cheerfully. She and her sisters are much larger now. When they hatched they were about the size of large cars, but now you're about the size of a doll to them. Soon Henrietta's face pops in next to hers and she reaches down to scratch your head. She's got short hair that comes down to her neck. It feels pretty good but you shoo her claw away after a second. She giggles at the look on your face. \"I told you not to do that!\" you tell her with a sigh. \"But you enjoy it, I know you do! You always look so happy when I do it!\" she says. You look away slightly in a huff. You can't deny t feels good when she scratches you but it makes you feel like a dog or something. All of the girls care for you deeply like family, but sometimes Henrietta treats you like a pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up and stretch your arms when another hand shoots out and grabs you. You are brought to the grinning face of Cheryl. Her hair is shoulder length but she keeps it wild and messy. \"Lets have a lot of fun today, okay?\" she says and grabs one of your arms with her claws. She moves it up and down until you are snatched away by Krystal. Krystal has her hair worn in two pigtails. She loves to dote over you because she thinks you're the cutest thing in the world. \"Be more careful with him Cheryl!\" she says while brushing you off. She then hands you off to Dahlia, who holds you to in both hands and gives you a warm smile. \"Good morning.\" she says softly. Her hair is worn in a single pony tail. Dahlia was always a shy one, and the only ones she was really comfortable around are her mother, her sisters and you. Gina walks up and interrupts. \"What do you guys want to do today? Mommy said she was attending to official duties, so we get to spend the day with him.\" Gina is the most serious of them all. She looks up to her mother a lot and hopes to be a great empress as well. She even wears her hair exactly the same as Akair, down to her back and nice and straight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDahlia carries you away from your bed, now holding you to her chest like some sort of stuffed animal. The six of them share one bedroom, with you sleeping there as well. When it was time to give them their own room the cried at the thought of being separated from you and their mother. The solution Akair came up with was to put you in the room to calm them down. You were given a small bed that now sits sits on a table near their own beds. \"I want to play some games!\" Cheryl says and claps her hands. \"I know a good one!\" Krystal says.

The food was a little strange though. You were given water, strange fruits of all kinds, and a spicy tasting meat that you couldn't identify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were allowed to come and go as you pleased. You would spend most of the day exploring the city. It was a true wonder to behold. The buildings were a mix between Roman and Mayan architecture. With marble columns, and carved walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was time for bed, you would curl up on Arkair's stomach, and she would stroke you until you fell asleep. All in all, it wasn't a bad life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe island seemed to contain anthro animals of all kinds. From birds to reptiles, from canines to felines. There was one however, that did make you uneasy. A skunk named Lorana. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was one of the palace guards, and didn't seem to like you very much. When ever you walked past her, she would glare at you with a contemptuous sneer. She wore the standard guard wear, blue skirt, breastplate, and a spear with a golden spearhead. Something gave you the feeling she would like nothing more than to hang you from that spear like a flag.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're sitting on Arkair's shoulder as she sits on her throne one day, and she notices you look rather worried. \"What's wrong little one?\" She asks. \"It's one of your guards. That Lorana.\" You reply. \"Every time I see her she looks at me like she wants to kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She probably does.\" Says Arkair. \"Lorana hates outsiders. Her only loyalty is to me. She trusts no one else. Were you not my pet, she would kill you on sight.\" You gulp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But don't worry.\" She says reassuringly. \"As long as you are under my protection, she wouldn't dare harm you.\" Later, you are strolling through the halls of the palace, when you hear a voice behind you. \"Hey! Human!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and feel your heart sink. It's Lorana! She walks toward you, face in a scowl. You are too scared to move as she comes closer. When she reaches you, she stares down at you from her ten foot height, and says.......... <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the pig is coming closer towards you, you point the bow right at it's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the giant pig makes a huge leap at you, you fire right at it's chest and watch as the arrow pierces his heart, causing him to fall down to the ground which makes a loud crash and the ground shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leap up in triumph, not believing what you had accomplished. \"Kina will no doubt be pleased with this.\" you say to yourself, not even noticing how your voice has risen in pitch.</span></div></div>",

The only person you knew on this island of freaks had just been taken by some black bird to an unknown fate and now you were left here all alone. You sat near the back, although there weren't that may left, you could just imagine how you looked, scared and now more or less alone. A few anthros walked right past you not even noticing you till one walked in. She was a bald eagle, taller than most anthros, you'd say about 12 feet to the average 10, she looked like a bald eagle, white feathers covered her head and a yellow beak, her body, arms and legs were covered in brown feathers and both her arms and legs ended in yellow 4-fingered hands and feet that ended in black razor sharp claws. She was quite muscular and she carried herself with an air that more or less said \"don't fuck with me\" discouraging you from staring at her for too long. As soon as you broke eye contact however she walked right up to you, ignoring every other prisoner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey what's this one's story?\" she yells at the guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Newest prisoner, you want him, 20 coins\" the guard replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns and stares at you, her eyes piercing straight into you \"if he's new he hasn't been trained, 15\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     The guard sighs but gives up motioning for the eagle and her to walk out, she comes back in a minute holding what looked like a dog collar, although big enough for you, the black bird that took Matt got one as well before she led him out. She unceremoniously dropped it over your head but surprisingly waited for you to stand up and follow her. \"Looks like she doesn't want to eat me\" you think semi-happily as she leads you out of the dungeon and away from the palace, heading towards the village that you passed through when you first arrived. After a few minutes of walking she stopped, looked around and pulled the leather \"chain\" short, so short that you had no choice but to follow right beside her. She seemed pleased with herself as she continued walking along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     A few seconds later you got another shock as she started to gently stroke your cheek with one clawed finer, that wasn't the shock however as after a few seconds you found yourself gently leaning against her moving yourself so she had an easier time stroking you. She really seemed pleased with this as she gave off what you could only describe as a cooing sound, reaching down she gently started stroking your cheek with her entire palm the scales on her hand feeling quite smooth and surprisingly soft, almost like skin as she stroked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to hurt you\" she says, the shock of her talking knocking you out of the small reverie you had fallen into. \"Although I'm very glad you like me, as I like you\" she says giving off that same soft cooing sound before going back to stroking you with her palm as the two of you walked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting a bit soft are we Miranda?\" A voice says, Miranda wheeling around pulling you close to her chest as she does so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want Lira?\" she replies, you gently move one of her arms out of the way and you get your first look at the other figure, she was an eagle like Miranda although much smaller, only about 8 feet tall as compared to Miranda's 12 and her body was covered in black feathers rather than brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From how you were acting it almost looked like you cared for that male\" she replied in a quite condescending tone <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Males serve only one purpose, to do whatever we say, they are slaves, entertainment, breeding stock nothing more, and it seems the male you have with you hasn't been taught that yet\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lira talked you could feel every hair on your body stand up, and you found yourself trying to bury/hide yourself in Miranda's feathers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda just glared at her, one hand moving to gently stroke your back, \"come now Miranda you know that the best males are those that have been \"taught\" give him to me and I promise he'll never even think of disobeying you\" Lira continues her eyes for some reason piercing you with what you could feel as a hate filled stare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck off Lira, and if I hear that you have even thought of touching him I will kill you\" Miranda says before lifting you up into a bridal carry and jogging off towards the village. She doesn't stop till she reaches a hut and sets you down gently on the dirt floor. You tried to stand up but your legs collapsed out from under you, that was how scared you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda lifted you up into a hug one hand gently stroking your back, \"it's alright, I promise I will not let her hurt you, you are mine, and I will protect you\" she says. \"you again found yourself buried in her feathers, returning the hug as best you could, after a minute she let you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still haven't asked, what's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Jake welcome home, I know it's not the nicest place, certainly not as nice as the palace, but better than a dungeon right?\" you nod trying to seem enthusiastic but it was kind of hard as you were still a slave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do with me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm your slave aren't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, as I said you are mine, but you do not belong to me.....how do I put this? You are the watcher of my home, father of m children, you are my mate.\" You just sat there staring at her a bit stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon?\" was all you could choke out after a minute of silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda sighed \"What Miranda said was somewhat true, many anthros believe that men are only good for, well serving us, as long as they fulfill our needs they are useful, and for times....when there is no food. But I don't believe this I believe that men can be our equals, my father was wonderful, kind, sweet, he died protecting me as a child, men aren't something to just be used and thrown away\" Miranda started to tear up a little as she mentioned her father and you let her continue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I went to look for a man who was free of our influence one that hadn't been \"taught\" to fear us....one I could love, and would love me, and I found you\" she finishes her eyes falling on yours. Needless to say you were stunned, every anthro you had seen here had more or less told you that you were good for nothing more than food or pleasure, but this eagle was the complete opposite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I still have to mark you with my scent, so the entire island knows you are mine, so I am asking if you would join me willingly rather than me having to force you, it would be much better for both of us that way\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you'll just like rub up against me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda giggled, \"of course not, I can only mark you with my sweat, besides how else are you to become the 'father of my children'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     With a yelp you were lifted up, Miranda again carrying you like a new bride into what had to be her bedroom, a quite soft looking bed of what seemed to be molted feathers and leaves taking up the majority of the room. Miranda lowered you onto the bed before walking a few steps away, turning and then running up and pouncing on you. You felt her cheek gently cuddle against your, her arms wrapping around you possessively before moving away slightly her eyes meeting yours for a second before she leaned in, opening her beak slightly and kissed you.</span></div></div>",

They are both kneeling on one knee, heads bowed, and spears held out in front of them. Your guess is that this is a sacred place to the amazons, and they would probably think you wouldn't dare hide in here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look in to the cave and see the wall is lined with torches, illuminating the entrance. You make your way in, going down the long hall until you come to a wide cavern, full of stalagmites and stalagtites. It is here that the torches end, and you see only darkness before you. You take a torch from its bracket on the wall and continue deeper into the cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now you must be hundreds of feet below the island, and those amazons wouldn't dare to look for you in here. Suddenly, you could swear you could hear faint voices. Whispers. You can't make out what they are saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gust of wind suddenly bows out your torch! Now you stand in darkness. Where did that wind come from anyway? suddenly, you can make out a faint blue light ahead about a hundred yards ahead of you. You don't know what it is, but it's got to be better than standing here in the dark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way towards the light, tripping over several stalagmites on the way. Finally you find the source of the light, and are amazed at what you see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's an entire underground city! Stone buildings and and houses fill the entire cavern. A gigantic blue crystal is attached to the ceiling, radiating a dim blue light that illuminates the whole place. You stand at the top of a stone staircase leading down into the city. You can't believe your eyes! This whole place must be thousands of years old, if not more! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire city seems deserted. You haven't seen a single living thing since you got here. You take a look into one of the stone houses. It is a single room, filled with various objects, such as weapons, jewlery, furniture, etc. In the center of the room is a long rectangular stone box, covered in strange carvings. A coffin <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice that all the other buildings are pretty much the same as this one. Then you realize what this place is. It's a tomb! A city of the dead! This is the amazon's burial chamber! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you hear those faint voices again. But this time you can understand them. \"Who dares disturb us?\" In front of you, a figure begins to appear. At first you can only make out the outline of a body, but then it appears in full form. A transparent cheetah amazon appears from thin air in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, thousands of other spirits appear. Every animal you can think of is there. Canines, feline, birds, reptiles, etc. \"who dares enter the city of the dead?\" Says the cheetah. She sounds mad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the cave has gone very cold, and you see your breath as you speak. \"I.....I.....I was just trying to h....h....h...hide from the hunters.\" You stammer. You really hope these ghosts can;t hurt you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. So you are an outsider.\" Says the cheetah. \"Grab him!\" Two of the ghosts grab your arms and they all carry you to a black stone tample at the back of the city. You pray that whatever happens, you get out of here alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the temple, there is a enormous black throne with the skeletal remains of a gigantic anthro bat. The cheetah emerges from the crowd of ghosts and approaches the skeleton. \"Lord of the Dead.\" She says. \"What shall we do with this outsider?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a chill in the air and a guest of wind, as a whispering voice echos though the room.   </span></div></div>",

You step inside to see the interior isn't any better than the outside. A fire pit with a huge cauldron is in the center of the hut, with various objects hanging from the ceiling, stick figures, bottles, bones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a minute, bones? Various animal skulls hang on ropes from the rafters. Jars of various spices and ingredients on shelves line the walls. You take a closer look, and see some of the jars contents are quite frightening. Eyeballs, tongues, etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide perhaps it would be better to find another place to hide. But as you turn around, a dark figure is standing in the doorway of the hut. It is a grey wolf with long black hair, dressed in a black robe. \"What are you doing in my house?\" She asks menacingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.....uh......\" You are too scared to speak right. You steps toward you, and sniffs you. \"What are you?\" She asks. \"Hu....hu.....human.\" You stutter. \"Human? Never heard of a human before. But whatever you are, you must be an outsider.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snaps her fingers, and you suddenly can't move! You're frozen as still as a statue! \"And if you're an outsider, then that means you are being hunted, right?\" You are unable to answer. She turns around and begins taking down various jars off the walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never had human before, but I'm sure you'll make a fine stew.\" Stew!? She's gonna make you into stew!? She snaps her fingers again, and a fire lights under the cauldron in the center of the room, and the cauldron is instantly full of yellow broth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe begins adding various ingredients into the broth. \"Don't bother hoping the hunters will find you first. They won't come near this place, because they know I live here, and they wouldn't dare trespass. You see, I was banished from the city. I was once the empress's royal magician, but they found out I was turning citizens into food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls out a knife and begins slicing carrots as she continues. \"It's been a long time since I've had a proper meal. I've had to live off of fruit and fish. But I'm sure you'll do just fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin sweating with fear as she continues adding vegetables to the soup.

You run through the jungle for what seems like a long time. Your legs are exhausted, your lungs are burning, and you're covered in sweat. They must have sent the hunters in after you by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slow down to a walk, when your suddenly trip. You look down to see a vine wrapped around your ankle. You sit back up and try to get it off, but it only tightens. You tug and tear at it for several minutes, but by now it's starting to cut off the circulation to your foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear footsteps approaching from behind. It must be one of the hunters! You draw your knife and turn around. There, looking down at you is a ten foot tall, anthro doe. She is dressed in a skirt made of palm leaves, the same for her top. She has hands, and hooves instead of feet. On her head is a crown of olive leaves, like a Roman emperor. Two points stick out from the top of her skull, they look more like Hershey Kisses than antlers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo eyes as green as her outfit stare down at you half curious, half demanding. \"Who are you? What you you doing in my jungle?\" She demands. \"I......I......I was being hunted.\" You stammer. \"I didn't know this was your jungle.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face softens. She snaps her fingers, and the vine around your leg releases you. \" I'm sorry about that.\" She says as she helps you up. \"I don't like intruders in my jungle.\" You put your knife back in its sheath. \"Do you have a name?\" She asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake.\" You tell her. \"What about you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles. \"I have a name, but you couldn't possibly pronounce it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try me.\" You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tells you her name. She was right, you couldn't possibly say it. It had to have at least forty syllables!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggles upon seeing your confused face. \"You can just call me Kri.\" She takes your hand and you follow her through the jungle. You notice all the ferns and bushes that are in your way instantly part upon her approach, then reform as she passes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you doing that?\" You ask. \"Magic.\" She says simply. \"You see, my name, my real name, means Lady of the Jungle. I am the goddess of this place.\" \"You're a goddess!?\" You exclaim. \"Yes. I give life to all plants on this island. Look.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached down and picked up a seed off the ground. She holds it in front of you, and you watch as it instantly begins growing into a flower. \"Without me, this place would wither and die.\" She says. \"That's why the inhabitants of this island respect my children.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Children?\" You ask. \"Yes. I consider all vegetation on this island my children. The people in the city, they know not to harm them, or there will be dire consequences. Believe me, I can do much worse than cause a drought or have my babies stop producing food for them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" You ask. \"Like grow giant carnivorous plants and have them overgrow the city, devouring everything in site, leaving nothing but ruins behind.\" You stare at her in shock. \"But They give me no reason to do such a thing.\" She says laughing a bit. \"They leave me offerings at my shrine, and I give them a bountiful harvest.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both continue walking, as you talk. \"Don't worry about those hunters.\" She says. \"They won't dare harm you, as long as you're with me. I detest killing any living thing, even for food. There's plenty of fruits and vegetables on the island, what do they need meat for?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, night falls. \"So where do you live?\" You ask. \"This entire jungle is my home.

Then you realize you hands and feet have been tied together. Where was Kri!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three hunters are all felines. One is a panther, with long black hair and a scar across her right eye. The second is a lioness, with sandy hair in braids. The third is a cheetah, with black hair in a long ponytail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey seem to be arguing about something. \"I saw him first, so he's mine!\" Says the panther. \"You only heard his snoring! I'm the one who found where he was sleeping!\" Says The lioness. \"why don't we just share him?\" Suggests the cheetah. \"We each get him for a day in turns, then start of over again and again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they continue to argue, the panther turns around and sees you. \"So you're awake.\" She says. She picks up her spear from beside her and strides over  pointing it at you, the tip centimeters from your cheek. \"Mistress Kina said whoever finds you gets to do whatever they want with you.\" She says, lightly pressing the spear tip to your skin. You can feel the cold, golden point slowly going deeper into your flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was thinking of making you my little slave.\" She says grinning. \"We found him, so we all get him!\" Says the lioness. \"Shut up!\" Snaps the panther. \"I wasn't talking to you.\" She bends down until her face is above yours. \"Or maybe, I could just eat you right here.\" She gives your cheek a long lick. You shiver at the touch of her rough tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear voice inside your head. It sounds like Kri's. \"Don't worry. I will not let them harm you.\" The panther grins and extends a clawed finger to your cheek. \"What's wrong? Don't like to be touched?\" She quickly runs her claw across you cheek, leaving a thin cut. You yelp in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get used to it my slave.\" she says. \"You're going to be my slave for more than just housework. And I like it rough.\" The lioness and cheetah stand up. \"For the last time, he's ours too!\" They say at the same time. \"You and what army?\" Responds the panther snarling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all face each other, arguing again. They start getting physical, pushing and clawing at each other. They're so engrossed in their fight, they don't notice the vine snaking along the ground towards them. It wraps around the cheetah's ankle and yanks, pulling her feet out from under her and dragging her into the jungle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining two grab their spears and look around in fear. The lioness walks wearily towards the edge of the clearing. a large flower pod burst up from the ground. It opens to reveal a long sharp barb, that it shoots straight into the lioness's neck. The lioness falls over backwards, out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow only the panther is left. She looks from side to side, spinning around and around, eyes wide open for any threat. Suddenly, roots spring up from under her, curl around her legs, and pull her into the ground. She screams in panic, desperately cutting at the roots with her claws. But for each one she cuts, two more grow in its place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow only her head is sticking out of the ground. She wriggles her body around under the soil, but can't get free. The vines tying your arms and legs slacken, and you are able to free yourself and run off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run for several minutes through the jungle, with only the moon to light your way. You look behind you, to see if they are following, and WHAM! You run straight into something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall back on your rear, look up, and see what you ran into was Kri. \"She smiles and extends a hand to help you up. \"I told you I wouldn't let them hurt you.\" She pulls you onto your feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was you?\" You ask. \"Of course.\" She responds. \"You didn't think i'd abandon you, did you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why did you leave in the first place?\" You ask, a little mad. \"I had just gone for a minute to get a drink from a nearby stream. I'm sorry, that was very irresponsible of me.\" She takes your hand and you follow her. \"From now on, you're not leaving my side.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I thought you hate killing?\" You ask. as she leads you deeper into the jungle. \"I didn't kill them. They are merely.........incapacitated. They'll be fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brings you to a cave in the side of a mountain. \"It should be safer in here.\" She gathers a pile of palm leaves and grass for you to lay on. You curl up on the \"bed\" and doze off again. Kri sits ten feet away from you leaning against the cave wall. \"No mistakes this time. I'll watch him all night if I have to.\"         </span></div></div>",

You continue to eat the rest happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, any ideas on what we could do while we're here?\" She asks. \"Well,\" you say. \"You're a godess, you must have some interesting stories to tell.\" She smirks. \"Indeed I do. I'll tell you about the other deities of this island.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tells you about how there are several other godesses that the amazons worship. \"There are many of us, but only females. In order to reproduce, we must mate with mortal men, but that hasn't happened in a very long time, do to the male population steadily declining, until there were none left. Each of us prevails over certain things. Such as Mushana, the lioness godess of Love and Fertility, and Thanatra, the bat godess of Death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, listening intently. \"One case of a godess falling in love with a mortal happened with me.\" She says sadly. \"You were in love?\" You ask. \"Long ago. IT was when this island was just a barren patch of land, and the city was a mere village. I loved him dearly, but one of the other godesses, my sister Jagara, killed him out of jealousy. I buried his body, and cried over it. When my tears hit the ground, trees and ferns sprung from the earth, spreading all over the island. That is when I vowed to protect the jungle I created, and never let a single living thing come to harm in it. Of course, Jagara had a different idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is Jagara a godess of?\" You ask. \"She is the Lord of the Hunt.\" Replies Kri. \"So as you can guess, me and her have never gotten along. Even before she killed my love. In fact, those hunters from earlier and probably praying to her to help them hunt you. For your sake, I hope not. She has a golden bo and arrow that never misses, not to mention her sacred spear.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp. \"Don't be scared.\" Says Kri. \"You shall not come to harm, as long as you stay in this cave.\" Just then you both heard voices coming from the cave entrance. \"Could they be in there?\" Asked one. \"Most likely.\" Relied another, more menacing voice. \"Prey will often hide when it is being stalked. I will go in first, you stay here in case the run by.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKri quickly waves her hand, and the fire extinguishes. You sit there in the dark in silence. You pray to your own god, that whoever is coming, it's not Jagara, and that they can't see in the dark.     <br>\r\n     </span></div></div>",

There in the corner oc the cave is Kri, an angry look on her face, and in her hand, the thorn vine, curled like a whip. \"You will not harm him!\" She says angrily. Jagara snarls. \"You would protect him? An outsider?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!\" Says Kri. \"And he's not just an outsider. He's my mate!\" Before you can object, you hear Kri's voice in your head. \"Play along.\" Jagara smirks. \"Mate? Another one?

You had to be quick, or else you were finished. You spring from your perch, jumping on the huge snake. She lets out a yelp of surprise as your impact forces her flat on the ground, you on her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your knife, preparing to bury it in her skull. But she flings her long tail around and wraps it around your neck. You clutch at the tightening coils as she gets back up. She twists around and stares at you for a moment, desperatley trying to escape her grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stab at the coils around your neck, but her scales are like armor, the knife doesn't do anything. Her tongue darts out of her mouth as she grins, savoring your fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens her mouth wide, enough to swallow you whole. She slowly brings you toward her gaping jaws. Then, out of desperation, when you are close enough to her face, you stab her in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lets out a scream of pain, and her tail releases you. You waste no time running away as she  held her eye, screaming and cursing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like forever, night falls. You find the mouth of a cave in the side of a mountain, and sit there, resting after the long day you've had. Somehow, you survived day one. Two to go.

You try to yell, but the hand muffles your screams. Then, you hear a voice whisper in your ear. \"Stop struggling. I'm not going to hurt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you feel yourself being lifted up and held against a warm, furry body, as you are carried further into the cave. It's too dark for you to see, and the only sounds are your carrier's footsteps, and water dripping from the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you can see a faint light up ahead. As you come nearer, you can see the light is a fire. The amazon carrying you sets you down on her bed, a pile of palm leaves. Now you can see her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is a fox, with red fur and long black hair tied in a ponytail. The fur on her hands and feet is also black. You take a look at your surroundings. The chamber is made of smooth rock. The fire in the center of the room is the only light and source of warmth. In the corner are barrels of various food and spices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen stares down at you. She sees you are a little afraid. \"It's okay.\" She says gently. \"My name is Jasmina. Who are you?\" You tell her your name. \"Well, (your name), Do you want to tell me what you were doing sitting on my doorstep in the middle of the night?\" You tell her how you got on the island and how you were being hunted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, you can stay with me. They won't dare come in here.\" She says, smiling kindly. \"Why not?\" You ask. \"Because I am an outcast.\" She says, somewhat sadly. \"I was banished from the city, and forced to survive in the jungle, living off whatever I can hunt and whatever washes ashore.\" That explains where she got those barrels of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you banished for?\" You ask. She turned her head and was silent for a moment. \"I don't want to talk about it.\" Then you hear your stomach rumble. Running for your life really works up an appetite. Especially since you dropped your pack of food when you were fighting that cobra.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmina giggles. \"Hungry, huh?\" She gives you a strange fruit to eat. It is round, pink, and the size of your fist. You take a bite, and find it to be the best fuit you ever tasted!. It is very juicy and sweet, like liquid sugar. You eat another three of the fruits before you are satisfied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be tired after the day you've had.\" Says Jasmina. She lays down on the bed of leaves with you and wraps her tail around you. You snuggle your face into her stomach, (She is three times your size),  enjoying her warm soft fur. Jasmina strokes your back as you cuddle, then says.......      </span></div></div>",

There was just no way to take all of it in at once, not that there was much to take in. The creature seemed to have a grey blob for a body - not very interesting. What was more interesting was the large tentacle wrapped around both your legs (damn, it was learning) and the giant eye it was pulling you towards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eye looked like that huge eye from Lord of the Rings - a giant bloodshot mix of red, orange, and yellow, complete with a black vertical slit for a pupil. The creature held you in front of this eye, and just stared at you. It may have just been oxygen deprivation, but after a certain point you started to think that it wasn't merely look at you, but it was actually looking <i>into</i> you. Then you \"realized\" it was <i>looking at your soul</i>. Unable to stand it anymore, you tried to scream, but were met only with a mouthful of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't see. You couldn't breathe. You were being filled with water. You started thrashing about, desparate to get away. Air. You needed air. You were going to die here. Unable to do anything else you passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness. Darkness everywhere. Were you floating or falling? Did it matter?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGradually, you became aware of your surroundings. You were lying down on your front, on something soft. You could feel fabric on top of and beneath you, so you were probably in a bed somewhere. There was a noise you couldn't quite make out. After awhile, you realized it was a female voice, humming tunelessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom?\" you call out, not opening your eyes, not sure of anything anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, dear?\" The voice had been humming replied. That was comforting, somehow. It seemed vaguely familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had this really bad dream. I was shipwrecked on this island of animal women, and they put me in a room with this huge monster, and I was drowning, and,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're cut off by someone gently stroking your head. \"Shhhh. You're safe now. Get some rest.\" The female voice resumed it's humming, and doing as you were told, you drifted back into slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Later</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou woke up feeling a little dazed, and uncertain where you were. You open your eyes and take in the surrounding environment. It looked like an ornately decorated bedroom about the size of an airplane hangar. That's when you saw something that made it very clear that you weren't in bed. You saw the face of that giant skunk anthro grinning down at you. You had been using her as a bed! \"Ah, you're awake little one. Did you sleep well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cEr, yes I did. Thank you. And I\u2019d prefer that you call me \u201cJake\u201d, not \u201clittle one\u201d.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, Jake,\u201d the giant skunk said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d prefer that you call me Sarina.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Sarina. Um. How long have I been sleeping on you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, since we fished you out of the hot spring. Although you did wake up once, briefly,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized why the voice from before seemed familiar. \u201cYou mean that was you that I was talking to?\u201d you asked, embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry about that! I-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Sarina cut you off by stroking your head. For someone of her size, she was incredibly gentle. \u201cThere is nothing to be sorry about. You were confused, and were seeking comfort. Do not feel shame over that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well thank you. But if that wasn\u2019t a dream then\u2026\u201d You left the sentence hanging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, you did almost drown, and yes, there was a giant creature looking at you. Before you ask, we know little about it. Indeed, we know little beyond that this island is built on top of it, that the Creature is so vast it is no longer capable of movement, and that it wishes to protect us when it can.\u201d You shifted into a sitting position, getting ready to hear what she had to say. \u201cThe Creature has telepathic abilities; that\u2019s how we know it means no harm. Over the years, others have come to this island, though you are the first human to arrive. Many of these individuals had malevolent intentions, and would have killed us if not for the Creature. It has become standard that whenever someone washes up on our island, we bring it before the Creature to stand in judgment. If they are deemed a threat, they are killed. If not, they may live.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd I was deemed not a threat, right?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina nodded, then scooped you up in both hands and raised you up so you were face-to-face with her. (Sort of. More like body-to-face.) \u201cAnd you know what that means?\u201d she asked in a barely-containing-excitement voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt means\u2026YOU GET TO STAY WITH US!\u201d she shouted. Then, before you had recovered from the sudden outburst, Sarina was nuzzling you. Rather forcefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, Sarina? I can\u2019t breathe,\u201d you managed to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m so sorry! I was just so excited! You know what? I want to make what happened earlier up to you. You and me, in my private bath! What do you think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you thought was that Sarina was rather attractive. What you also thought was that she was more than a little over-excited. Trying to be tactful, you asked, \u201cDo I have a choice?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarina paused to think about this for a moment, and then cheerfully said, \u201cNope!\u201d She then swiftly lowered her hands to her mid-torso, and clasped them to her body, trapping you.  You could feel Sarina get up and start walking. \u201cDon\u2019t worry! It\u2019ll be fine. There are no giant monsters in my bath.\" Sarina paused, then added in a seductive voice, \"Well, unless you\u2019re counting me, handsome.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the \u201chandsome\u201d that caught you off guard. You\u2019re about to take a bath with a giant anthro skunk chick who\u2019s a total hottie, and who thinks you're <i>handsome</i>?!

Some of them would ask you questions about America, which was starting to annoy you, having to repeat the same answers over and over again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Island\u2019s ship builders cut down the largest trees in the jungle they could find, and carved them out to make massive canoes. Each canoe had a single sail in the center of it, and each one was connected like a train by a rope. All together, there were about ten of them single file. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took the builders about two weeks to prepare the boats, during which time, you explored the island some more, and spent some time with Sarina, who had rather taken a liking to you. Perhaps a bit too well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe insisted that you would share her bed with her when it was time to sleep. She would lay you on her breast and gently stroke you as you fell asleep, humming a sort of lullaby. She would sometimes lick you with her long, pink tongue, saying it was how their kind showed affection. Not that it really bothered you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the day arrived when it was time to set sail. The boats were much too small for Sarina, so she would just swim with you on her back. \u201cBut won\u2019t you get tired?\u201d You ask her as she step into the ocean. \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m an excellent swimmer.

For 8 days, she swims across the ocean with the train of boats next to her. You were surprised that she could go this long without rest or food. The anthros in the boats had brought their own supply of food, but Sarina hadn\u2019t eaten anything the entire trip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, land was in sight. There it is.\u201d You say. \u201cAmerica. At least, I hope it\u2019s America.\u201d The caravan of boats began chatting excitedly among themselves. Of course, when you reach the shore, there\u2019s a huge crowd gathered on the beach, having seen Sarina coming from miles away. There are countless news crew filming as Sarina places you on shore and stands up to her full height. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReporters run up to you as the string of boats beaches on the shore, and the passengers step out. You raise your hands as the reporters are asking a million questions at once.  \u201cPlease! Please! One at a time!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are these strange beings?\u201d Asks a woman holding a microphone up to you. \u201cThey are humanoid animals, from the island of Anthronia.\u201d You say. \u201cI was stranded on their island and they took care of me. I told them about the outside world, and brought them here. The giant skunk behind me is named Sarina. She is their ruler.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cameras pointed up at Sarina who smiled and waved. \u201cThey come in peace I assure you.\u201d You continue. \u201c They hope to join human society and mean absolutely no harm. I\u2019m sure that everything will be just fine once you get to know them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: Everything goes well! The anthros are accepted in human society as citizens, work alongside humans, some even become famous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: It\u2019s a total disaster. Humans don\u2019t trust the anthros and shun them. Some are forced to be slaves on the grounds that they\u2019re animals, not people. Some are even hunted as big game.   </span></div></div>",

What's more, she's armed with a wooden staff and a bola; hell, her \"armor\" is a pair of shin guards, a shapely breastplate, and a shoulder pad (you don't count her leather thong as armor, naturally). You, meanwhile, have been outfitted with your sweet double-sword, shin guards, leather half-fanny bikini, breastplate, and a basic metal helmet. Confidence is practically dripping off you; the mouse-girl may have more experience in the arena, but she doesn't have the height advantage most of the other anthros would and she's a larger target compared to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse-girl offers Nara a salute before assuming a battle stance, and you take your own.

They cheer both of you on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouse pours it on, twirling her staff and advancing.  You drive your weapon forward, intending to hit her in the center, but she breaks off her whirling assault and sidesteps.  You immediately slash with your other blade and amazingly slice her left inner thigh.  She manages to get away before you can slash again, but is clearly weakened, almost hobbling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strike again, and because of her bad leg, the mouse-girl looses her footing and doesn't get her block up in time, and your blade presses against her throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitating, you look the mouse-girl in the eyes.  There's a mysterious gleam to her brown orbs, one that twists your gut.  Something is very wrong...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations!\" Nara declares, her voice booming through the arena.  \"This is a wonderful day!

Your escorts, exchanging jokes over how \"lucky\" you are to be granted a private audience with the Empress, march you straight to a large door with a series of water drops carved in relief on its front, as if descending from the heavy gold knocker at its upper center. One of the guards uses the knocker almost too enthusiastically, the loud banging temporarily robbing you of your hearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, the door is hauled open by a jackal, who blinks in astonishment when she sees you. She fumbles with a question, no doubt about who you are and where you come from, when the other guard informs her, \"Empress Nara wants him cleaned up for her private attention later.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're roughly pushed forward into the jackal's arms, and your now-former escorts turn and leave, one cackling \"No pressure!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jackal curses angrily as she moves you out of the way to close the door. \"Bullies!\" she seethes. \"Drop one bottle of elixir and they never let you live it down!\" She sighs and gestures; you follow her indication and notice the large, porcelain-tiled tub in the room's floor. The tiles are a muted cream color, in stark contrast to the dark brown of the rug laying next to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you absentmindedly study the contents of the room, the jackal begins removing your arena clothing. There are shelves with multiple levels lining each wall of the room, in turn lined by dusty scrolls, dusty books, or dusty bottles (the last two coming in a whole variety of colors). A rack with an assortment of clippers, scissors, combs, brushes, and all such grooming devices occupied the wall opposite the sunken bath. Finally, there was a basket of fresh towels to your right and a much larger basket of fresh clothes to your left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jackal finishes with your arena gear and pushes you forward, and you comply, getting into the surprisingly warm water. As you lay down, sinking up to your chin, the jackal deftly collects a couple of bottles from her shelves and a comb and scrubbing brush from the rack. She pays you no heed when she pours some blue liquid into the bath, which causes it to immediately bubble like Coca-Cola; oddly enough, the bubbles release a sweet scent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just a bonding agent,\" the jackal says to you, examining her remaining two bottles as if deciding which to use next. She shrugs and sets both down, scooping up a handful of the bubbling water and dousing your face with it. \"Faces aren't cleaned very often, I think,\" she says before wetting your hair with another handful. She then uses her brush (which, thankfully, isn't hard-bristled) to work up some suds. After a few moments, only your face is free of the foamy white mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly pours a bottle of red liquid into the bath, making sure it washes over your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect is instant: the bubbling ceases and you're left feeling like you've been put through the car wash on the deluxe payment plan. While you're busy marveling at this, the jackal replaces the three used bottles, also replacing the brush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to get out now, so I can dry you off and get you dressed for Empress Nara.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing as you're told, you carefully get out from the bath and stand on the rug, letting the jackal wipe you down with a towel. Finishing with that, she takes a rag and proceeds to carefully nab any remaining moisture from your armpits, toes, fingers, ears, and nether-regions (which cause you to jump slightly at the ministrations). With that out of the way, you spend the rest of the time going through the basket of clothes with your temp groomer. Predictably, all of the garments are feminine, but some are mildly androgynous and therefore wearable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the jackal's fashion sense lighting the way, you settle on a navy leather mini skirt (which would probably be a micro skirt on an anthro), which has the sides slit and a second layer of silk to fill the gap, giving you the appearance of wearing a very strange kilt. Your \"shirt\" is a sleeveless tunic and its pea green color was almost depressing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Done at last!\" smiled the jackal, handing you your sandals, which she swiftly cleaned. \"And don't forget this!\" You shift uneasily as she returns your equally-swiftly hand-washed bikini. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock on the door pulls her away from you, and you both find the guards have returned, to escort you to Nara. You slip on your sandals and follow, forced to endure more banter. After several minutes of walking, turning down huge corridors and striding past impressive sculptures, your group reaches a gigantic pair of doors, each one with a roaring lion's head in their center. The guards don't knock or call out, and yet the doors part, granting you entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter alone and the doors silently close behind you, but you're too busy looking into Nara's eyes. She's lying on her side, watching you, propped up on her elbow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit,\" she says, nodding at the table and chair ahead of you. \"I'm sure you have a lot of questions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking your seat, you immediately ask, \"Why did you tell me I could be a citizen if you were just planning on putting me in a brothel like some sex slave?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically, you <i>are</i> a citizen. It's just that males are second-class citizens by necessity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!\" you gape. \"What kind of necessity is that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The necessity of a low population. There are less than ten thousand of us on this island, and it is rather difficult for a male anthro to impregnate a female. The chances are approximately one in twelve. When a human is factored in, there is a marginal increase; the chances become one in ten. Oh, don't fear that I'll play the dirty trick of telling you how plenty of other humans have enjoyed their breeding obligations. Some of them were pleased with their fate and others learned to be content enough. I'm not going to belittle you by telling you that sort of nonsense; everyone reacts differently to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pauses to crack her neck, the vertebrae popping like rifle shots. \"Now, then, we've tried a host of solutions throughout our history. Our various cults pray to our gods; our alchemists concoct potions to affect the procreation process; and we have even resorted to making blood pacts with our gods by sacrificing particular gladiators in their names from time to time. Not a single bit of difference has been made through those methods, and they're frankly wasteful, so we've taken up for a few generations now the practice of making all males into servile breeders to keep ourselves from dying out. So far, it's kept our population steady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her, overwhelmed by the revelations. After a moment, you give her your response.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You nearly wet yourself as your opponent steps through the gate. A ten foot tall, anthro rhino woman, wearing black armor, with a large battle axe in her hands. But by far the scariest thing about her, was the horn on the end of her nose that had to be as long as your arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing you had to protect you was the weapon and armor the amazons had given you. A breastplate, shin guards, bracers, a helmet resembling that of a Spartan, and something like a leather kilt covered your thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are completely screwed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBegin!\u201d Nara shouted, echoing across the stadium. The rhino let out a blood curdling war cry, as she lowered her body and charged, horn aimed straight at you. Each footstep made the ground beneath you shake. You had to think, and fast! Otherwise you would be impaled like a shish-kabob.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly duck and roll to the side as she charges past you, skidding to a stop before turning around and charging you again. Suddenly an idea hits you. You raises you double bladed sword and throw it like a spear. It sails through the air and hits its\u2019 mark, hitting the rhino in the eye. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee suddenly stops charging, and screams in pain. You smirk. You knew being on your school\u2019s javelin team would come in handy. But then your realize that your move was very foolish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blade had pierced her eye, but it didn\u2019t go into her brain. Not only that, but now you have no weapon, and you seriously pissed your opponent off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYanking the sword from her bleeding eye, the rhino raised her axe over her head and ran towards you, ready to cleave you in two. You get another idea and pray that it works. Once she is a mere foot away, you side-step and stick out your leg, tripping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTimber!\u201d You think to yourself as she seems to fall in slow motion, face down into the sandy ground, making it quake as she lands hard. Her axe has flown out of her hands and lies several feet away. You jump onto her back and wrap your arms around her thick, sinewy, tree trunk-like neck, and squeeze with all your might. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rhino chokes and gasps for breath as she gets back on her feet. As you cut off her air, she back up against the arena wall and slams you into it, knocking the breath out of you. She presses her back against the wall, crushing you between it and her armor.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the air is pressed from your lungs, you squeeze even tighter around her neck. It was a battle of breaths. Who would hold out the longest? You can feel some of your bones popping and cracking as she presses ever harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your last bit of strength, you give her neck one more mighty squeeze. The rhino gives one last coughing choke, before she falls to her knees, and collapses. You uncurl your arms from her neck and climb off of her, sucking in loud breaths of air. You look up at the crowd. For a moment, everything is silent as they take in the shock of you defeating such a brutish opponent. Then suddenly\u2026\u2026.</span></div></div>",

Some of the anthros in the crowd begin throwing various things into the pit at you. Flowers, coins, you even saw a thong or two. One cat anthro in the crowd even blew you a kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo of Nara\u2019s guards, the skunk and fox from earlier, enter the arena and approach you. \u201c Empress Nara wishes to speak with you.\u201d Says the fox. \u201cCome with us.\u201d  You follow them through the streets of the city back to the throne room. There, Nara happily greets you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was amazing!\u201d She says as she looks down at you from her throne. \u201cGranted, your style was very amateurish, but Big Bertha was one of the arena\u2019s best fighters! The fact that you, a mere outsider, were able to defeat her, is astounding! Your citizenship is well earned.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you your highness.\u201d You say, bowing. \u201cYou should feel honored.\u201d Says Nara. \u201cI am about to offer you a chance most anthronians would kill for.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d You ask. \u201cThe chance to become a gladiator in the arena.\u201d Says Nara. \u201cWhy would they kill for that?\u201d You ask. \u201cWell, you see, the gladiatorial games are a very large part of our culture. They have been in practice for centuries. Therefore, gladiators are some of the most revered and respected members of our society. I can see much potential in you after your victory today. After you\u2019ve finished being trained  properly, of course. Plus, you\u2019re the first male to fight in the arena for many years, so you\u2019re sure to be a big attraction.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am honored by your offer.\u201d You say, trying to be polite. \u201cBut I must decline. I have a life, family, and friends back home, and I really should be trying to get back to them.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t let you do that.\u201d Says Nara. \u201cWhy not? You ask. \u201cBecause our home has been kept secret from your kind for hundreds of years, and we want it to stay that way. We can\u2019t risk you telling the rest of the world about this place, so we must keep you here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d You exclaim. \u201cI\u2019m stuck here for the rest of my life!?\u201d \u201cI am afraid so.\u201d Says Nara. \u201cSo, you might as well try to fit into society.

They lead you back to the arena, but this time they lead you down a side passage that leads under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow them down a winding staircase lined with torches, to a large room made of sandstone. One wall of the room is lined with various weapons. From spears and swords, to strange looking ones you\u2019ve never seen before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was illuminated by a single fire pit in the center of the chamber. Punching bags hung from chains in the ceiling. Against another wall of the room hung an enormous gong. All around you sat several other anthro gladiators of various species, sharpening weapons, polishing armor, chatting about recent matches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the center of the room stands a cheetah woman with long silver hair in leather pants and a tunic, giving orders to the others. \u201cKreia! I told you to shine those swords two hours ago! Thuul, I want those arrowheads sharp enough to pierce stone!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns around to face the guards after they tap her on the shoulder. \u201cBy order of Empress Nara, this human is to be your new trainee.\u201d The cheetah looks down at you, and snorts. \u201cAh yes, the human that got lucky in the arena today. I don\u2019t think he would last the first week of my training, but if the empress demands it, then so be it.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards turn and leave. \u201cMy name is Zira.\u201d Says the cheetah. \u201cWhile you\u2019re here, I will be pushing your body beyond its limits. So you had better get used to pain.\u201d  You gulp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZira turns and motions for you to follow her. She leads you down a side hallway lined with doors.. \u201cI don\u2019t know how someone like you managed to beat one of my best girls.\u201d She says. \u201cEspecially since she was about three times your size. In fact, everyone here is twice as big as you. To them, you would be merely a child.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leads you around corners and turns through the torch-lined hallway, continuing her monolouge. \u201cSo the first thing we\u2019ll need to do, before we even start with weapons, is work on that body of yours. Some jina roots should help with that.\u201d You have no idea what she means by \u201cjina roots\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally stops at a door at the very end of one hall. She opens it to reveal what looks like some sort of dining hall. Long wooden tables and benches fill the room, with more torches lining the walls. She leads you past the tables into a storage room filled with barrels and crates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reaches into a barrel full of strange blue roots, and hands you one. \u201cEat this.\u201d She says. \u201cThis ins a jina root, it develops growth and will help you catch up with the others in height.\u201d You take a small bite off the end of the root. It tasted bitter and could have used some sauce, but you eat it anyway. \u201cNow then, lets get some meat on those bones.\u201d Says Zira. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leads you out of the storage room back into the dining area. She motions for you to sit down at a table. She disappears through a back door way for a few minutes and comes back carrying a silver platter with what looks like to be a chicken leg as big as your forearm, a small loaf of bread, and a bowl of some strange red soup. In her other hand she holds a gold cup of some purple liquid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sets the tray in front of you. \u201cEat up.\u201d You are awfully hungry after all you\u2019ve been through, and eagerly dig in. \u201cEveryone here is given a high meat diet.\u201d Explains Zira as she sits down across from you. \u201cIt helps build muscle.\u201d She explains the rules of the arena as other gladiators enter the room, and servants come out of the kitchen, lining the tables with various strange looking foods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe only rule in the arena\u2026.\u201d Says Zira \u201cIs there are no rules. You do whatever it takes to survive. Blind you opponent, disembowel them, slit their throats, everything is permitted. You fight until you opponent is dead, disabled, or surrenders.\u201d     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice a group of gladiators sitting at a table all the way at the front of the room covered in a velvet cloth, and lined with intricately carved  chairs. \u201cWho are they?\u201d You ask. Zira turns to look at the luxurious table. \u201cThey are the Elkar, the most elite of gladiators. They are the most respected and honored of all. They rarely participate in matches anymore, so when they do, it always draws a crowd. It\u2019s an honor just to be defeated by one of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turn back to face you again. \u201cI was offered to be one of them back when I was competing, but I turned them down.\u201d \u201cYou used to be a gladiator?\u201d You ask as you take a bite from your drumstick. \u201cLong ago.\u201d Zira nods. \u201c My arena name was \u201cThe Iron Maiden\u201d. I was one of the best fighters the arena had ever seen. I beat some of the toughest men around, back when there were still males on the island. I was even the grand champion for a time, until I decided to retire. Empress Nara\u2019s mother begged me to stay on as trainer, in hopes of breeding more gladiators like me. While I have trained countless others over the years, none have lived up to my legacy.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about the Elkar?\u201d You ask. \u201cI thought they were the elite?\u201d \u201cThey are a league all their own.\u201d Replies Zira. \u201cI only ever fought in the mainstream. The Elkar don\u2019t count.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finish your meal (you could only eat about half of it), Zira leads you back to the corridor lined with doors. \u201cYou know what the hardest part of my job is?\u201d Asks Zira as she leads you down the halls. \u201cFinding an available room whenever we get new meat.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter checking several rooms, she finally comes to an empty one. \u201cThis will be your quarters.\u201d The only things inside the room was a hammock, a stool, and a small wooden box. The only light came from a lantern hanging from the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet some rest.\u201d Says Zira as you climb into your hammock. \u201cYou\u2019ll need it for tomorrow. \u201cAlso, just because you beat one of my best fighters, don\u2019t expect any special treatment. I\u2019m going to push you just as hard as everyone else.\u201d  With that, she closed the door. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nThe next morning, you immediately knew this was going to be rough. You found out what the gong in the main chamber was for, as Zira would bang on it early each morning to wake everyone up. After the sudden loud noise made you jump out of your hammock, you exited your room and got lost in the maze of doors and hallways, until you finally made your way to the main chamber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZira directed you to the dining hall, where the rest of the gladiators were already eating breakfast. It was basically a buffet. Food was piled onto silver trays lined along the tables, and you just took what you want. After breakfast everyone went out to the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the others were practicing sword fighting, hand to hand, archery, etc, Zira had you doing various exercises. She had you lift buckets filled with stones up and down over and over again, Run laps around the edge of the arena, push ups, sometimes a combination of the three. Needless to say, by the time you went to bed every night, you were exhausted. Zira wasn\u2019t kidding when she said she would push your body beyond its limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, your muscles became more developed, after six weeks, you were able to do the lifting and running exercises without breaking a sweat. The jina root Zira made you eat daily was also taking affect. After the first month of training, your body had grown to the point where you could look the amazons in the eye, though some of them were still a few heads taller than you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter three months of working with your body, Zira put you on weapons training. Each gladiator was allowed to choose what weapons they wanted to train with, but Zira had something special for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI want you to have this.\u201d She handed you a gauntlet with a large brass disc attached to it. As you slip it on your left arm, Zira tells you to clench your fist. You do so, and the disc instantly grows into a full shield. The edge of the disc was also razor sharp and it could spin like a saw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis was my signature weapon.\u201d Says Zira. \u201cEmpress Nara has asked me to give it to you to use.\u201d After putting on the same armor you were given before, you choose a sword with a wicked curved blade, and a spear with a two-pronged head, almost like a giant fork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would practice battling with the other gladiators with wooden weapon. Some of them seemed to really be trying to hurt you, but Zira told them to save it for the real matches. The shield-glove Zira gave you came in very handy. blow after blow banged against it from your opponents, yet it didn\u2019t even dent. You found it most effective to hold your shield out in front of you, using to block any incoming attacks, then backhand your opponent with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n One of the gladiators, however, seemed to not want to fight you. She was a white tiger with long black hair tied in a ponytail. When Zira told everyone to pick a partner for battle practice, she would do her best to avoid you. You didn\u2019t know her name, but you have noticed her staring at you during meals and while you were training.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after months of training, it was time for your first match. The order of the matches and who would fight who decided by lottery. Each gladiator wrote their name on a scrap of parchment, and placed it in a clay jar. Zira would then reach into the jar and select names at random. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she pulled out the parchment with your name, Zira grinned from ear to ear. \u201cAh, our rising star\u2019s first real fight!\u201d She said. \u201cNow, who will have the honor of being his first defeat?\u201d The other gladiators gripped their weapons eagerly as Zira reached into the jar and called out your opponent.</span></div></div>",

Looking down the row of Anthro Warrior women, you see they all have looks of annoyance &amp; disgust..........all but one White Tiger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widened as you realized you were fighting the same person who'd been trying to avoid you. \"This is BULLSHIT!!\" You looked over at Zune, clearly angry about the results. \"Here I am, ready to char this meat sack, &amp; now I have to watch him fight his stalker!!\" Wait, what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised an eyebrow in confusion, \"What do you mean, Zune?\" The purple scaled dragoness pushed smoke from her nose as she glared at you, \"Don't tell me you don't know why snowflake over there has been avoiding you, Meat Sack!\" She growled at your ignorance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the drama caused the other Antho Amazonian's to howl &amp; hoop with instigation. The White Tigress just put her head down in embarrassment. Though you couldn't see it through the fur, she was obviously blushing heavily. Now you were EXTREMELY confused. This Kreia couldn't possibly have feelings for you, could she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha!! Okay, Meat Sack, I'll give you a hint......'Oh, Nolan! How I long to sit next to you during lunch &amp; cuddle under the sun set!!!'\" This caused the entire Amazon Warrior chamber to erupt with laughter, leaving all but you &amp; Kreia in silence. Zira stood with a stern expression, waiting for the right moment to chime in &amp; stop the nonsense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut UP, Zune! Don't tell him anything else!!\" The embarrassed Kreia turned towards the dragoness. \"Hahahaaaaa! I can't believe you actually LIKE this excuse of a warrior! No wonder you're the weakest fighter here, Snowflake.\" Zune blew light flames at the feet of Kreia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this point when the Tigress started to lunge at Zune, who was anything but unprepared to skin her alive, when both you &amp; Zira intervene. You blocked Zune's flames with your suddenly flame proof shield, which also grew to protect your entire body. Zira tackled an enraged Kreia down, holding her to the floor till she calmed her nerves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IS THIS HOW WARRIORS OF ANTHRONIA ACT?!?!\" Zira' voice echoed throughout the chamber so loud that even the Empress could hear it. \"TAUNTING ONE ANOTHER? FIGHTING OUTSIDE OF THE ARENA?!?!\" Zira stood up, looking even taller than she normally does. \"This is Nolan's first official battle, and I'm not about to have you all ruin it just because you fools can't wait your turn!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZira turned to you, a hint of worry in her eyes, \"Go &amp; prepare for the battle. Meet me out in front of the Arena gates when you're ready.\" You nodded, retracting your shield to it's watch size &amp; turning to Kreia. Zira turned to the other Amazon's, \"The rest of you, out of my sight until the fight starts!!!\" The Amazon's went off, grumbling in disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKreia was so embarrassed at how she'd let her emotions get the best of her. You offered a hand to pick her up, &amp; she obliged. Once she was level to you, you finally got a good look at her. She was actually rather gorgeous to you. Crystal blue eyes, a zebra stripe pattern with thin lines of black fur trailed along her body. Her figure was slender, but still athletic, as you could see her biceps &amp; muscular thighs. Her bust was a sizable C cup, &amp; her tail was long &amp; slender. Compared to the rest of the muscle headed women here, Kreia actually had a nice womanly figure. At least for an Amazonian Native.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snapped out of looking at her amazing body, \"Ah......good luck at the fight.....Kreia.\" You held out your hand for her to shake. She only looked at you sadly before turning to head out to the arena grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh.....I better go get ready.....\" With that, you took a long walk to your room to gather your armor.</span></div></div>",

A golden tiara rests on top of her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stares at you with sparkling green eyes, with a look of hunger in them. \"Release him.\" She says. \"I have special plans for this one.\" Your captors cut the vines on your wrists, and push you toward the giantess leopard. She bends down and picks you up in her fist. You get the feeling of being on a moving elevator as she lifts you up to her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the end.\" You think. \"I'm going to be eaten!\" The huge mouth opens, blasting you with her hot breath, and revealing long white fangs. You close your eyes, waiting for the chomp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it never comes. Instead you feel something hot, rough, and wet press against your body. It's her tongue! She's licking you! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe continues to rub her tongue on you for three minutes before she stops. Then, she begins walking with you in hand. You try not to look down as she carries you through the grand halls of her palace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brings you to her room, in the center is a vast velvet pillow, which you assume is her bed. She lays down on the pillow, and presses you against her chest, stroking you like a pet. You can hear her heartbeat, as well as the sound of her purring as she pets you.   <br>\r\n  <br>\r\nYou look up at her face, she is looking down at you, smiling. \"My name is Jasmine.\" She says. \"I have ruled this island for ten years, and have gone a very long time without any company, other then my guards and servants.

There could some benefits of having an empress as a lover. And besides she is pretty hot, and seems to be very nice. \"As you wish.\" You say, hugging her as much as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful!\" She says. \"Now, would you prefer to drink the potion, and become my size, or shall I drink it, and shrink to your size?\"   </span></div></div>",

In comparison you were about 5.6 feet tall,  At her 1 foot, she was bearly reaching youre knee.<br>\r\n<b>- Guess \u2013</b> you started <b>- this isint youre original size?</b><br>\r\n<b>- Of course not!<br>\r\n- Sorry was trying to humor the situation \u2013</b> now afther saying and remembering that she is the Empress made it sound awful.<br>\r\n<b>- Something is with this potion. Better get another one on.. that shelf.. \u2013</b> she said noticing how big everything. Her potion was on the toppest shelf. It was very high for you, not to mention for Jasmin. <br>\r\n<b>- Are sure this wont complicate thing? \u2013</b> you asked<br>\r\n<b>- Maybe i should ask  Na\u2026 -</b> she stopped, something interupted her. What they heard was a roar's like in a football match when the crowd is dissapointed. <br>\r\n<b>- What now? \u2013</b> the now little empress said angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commotion was coming from the window. Thankfully the bed was next to said window so they can take a look. You noticed Jasmine was having trouble on getting a better view. She was trying tip toe and jump to see. You decided to lend her a hand.<br>\r\n<b>- i can\u2026 -</b> you corrected yorself <b>\u2013 Empress if i may you land you a hand -</b>She allowed to pick her up. You lifted her putted her on your shoulder like any other house cat. The lower parts of the city suddenly were flodded with thousand of troops It was an open riot The attackers were attacking civilians and gurads were trying to hold them off. The attack was so sudden that the guards patrolling the city were overwhelmed. When they got closer you noticed most of these attackers were male slaves and some of the amazon guards as leaders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>- Do you have some harsh laws on slaves empress? \u2013</b> you said glancing at her.<br>\r\n<b>- No. They are normally bounded to a mistress. In distress they come to me, the shaman or royal guards to reslove.<br>\r\n- Then thney propably someone is holding a grudge. This doesnt look good.<br>\r\n- Dont worry, my royal guards will hold them off. And if that wont work got 2 more defense systems.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was saying that you noticed how Royal guards were forming up. There were all femals weareing gold plated armour. Armed to the teeth (with them included) in spears, battleaxe\u2019s and shields. Most of the anhros were predators or just extreamly huge animals. One of the the talles and buffiest was a lioness, from that angle she towered most of them, you were assuming she was 20 feet. They made a wall near the palace. The golden \u201edam\u201d was holding the brown (they were wearing leather armour) flood. It was effective. They were cutting them one by one. The lion of course were one of the best warriors. She was roaring orders and cutting down anywone in the range of her battleaxe. It was an astonishing view seeing and ogrinized golden army against a brown riot mass.  She was cutting, bashing people with her shield and even choke slamming them. You were astonished and a bit disgusted by this dance of death. It looked like the riot will be resolved. Unfortunatly something change in the favor of the slave army. The back of the slave line were bowman which started to shoot. The were shooting even their own man, but they did hit the lioness in the arm, she roared, yet she was still fighting. You even hear her roar <b>\u2018\u2019 you need more then THAT to kill me!\u201d</b>. The a another arrow pinned her in knee and third in the stomach. That last one was enough for the lion to fall. From that point the wall broke, they were losing the line going to far or falling behind. The were incircled and killed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>- Uh oh. \u2013</b> you were worried. The were now stroming the palace. Great first you were washed away form a cruise ship, then captrued and now you gonna die in a slave riot.<br>\r\n<b>- Till im empress i wont le tany harm to you or my subjects \u2013</b> Said Jasmin<b> \u2013 Being an Empress isint only becouse of a linnage. Is for a raw magic power inside. \u2013</b> she said that while rising her paws and chanted a magic spell, which sounded gibbrish to you. You noticed a light blue aura surrouding her paws. And when she finished she pushed foroward her paws.<br>\r\n<b>- Nothing happend? Is it a long therm spell?<br>\r\n- I- i dont understand i should have created a shield.<br>\r\n- Maybe something didint work. Try a different spell<br>\r\n- Ill try to push them with wind power \u2013</b> she was chanting again. And did the same motion. This time something did happened, but instead a wind that blow away the troop\u2019s. It was flow of compressed air that blew away some dust.<b> \u2013 Why my magic isint working?!</b><br>\r\nThis was bad the slave army already stromed  the palace.<br>\r\n<b>- So its over\u2026<br>\r\n- No its not over until i say so. There is a 3rd thing. \u2013</b> she was cutted short the door opend and it was one of the wounded guards. A tigress.<br>\r\n<b>- Empress\u2026 -</b> she was shocked to see not that big empress on youre shoulder. Before she could get her head of the clouds, her head was strucked with an arrow. Behind the corner came a anthro giraffe. It was a male slave, wearing a leather helmet and armour. Seeing you he said.<br>\r\n<b>- And i thought ill be the first to capture her, yet was too slow. Well done brother.<br>\r\n- Brother? \u2013</b> you asked<br>\r\n<b>- You are also a brother in chains. Yet yourse are golden seeing you with the \u201ebig\u201d Empress. Enough males were humilated by their mistresses, enough of them fleeing the jungle. Were were forming up to make a move and now we have a good occasion.<br>\r\n- More like good timing. Too good. \u2013</b> you were suspicious about it.<br>\r\n<b>- It wasnt that bad for you \u2013</b> yelled Jasmin, almost making you deaf while she was still on youre shoulder. \u2013<b> All you had to be in bond of youre mistress, keep our population and if someone broke the law you come to me or other autority here!</b><br>\r\n<b>- Not any records come to youre ears your \u201elowness\u201d \u2013</b> he said with a chuckle <b>\u2013 enough of these lies, come now borther give that thing back to me and lets make a new era of prosperity freedom and equal right\u2019s. Let me come to you and get that weight out of youre shulder. Litterly.</b><br>\r\nYou were now placed in a crossed road. You could hand Jasmin over and help esablish equal rights for men. So you wont get killed. You also can help Jasmin out, you still rememeberd she had a 3rd plan to get out of here safely. And she was the only good thing that happend in this streak of bad thing\u2019s.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You though you were making friends and by the end they betrayed you, becouse they listened to one bully who started it all. Everyone of you turned on you. And felt so alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt bad for Jasmin. She risked anything for youre safety. She shrunk herself so you could be together and to know you better. And was reassuring to that it will be ok even if that wasnt the case. If you handed her over you would feel like scum, not better then you\u2019re so close \u201efriends\u201d. Youre not going to let that happen. Not again!  You whispered quickly to Jasmin<br>\r\n<b>- What\u2019s that 3rd thing?<br>\r\n- An Escape route\u2026<br>\r\n- So \u2013</b> the giraffe cutted<b><br>\r\n- No! Wont give her. And Remeber SHE has a name. I wont let you take her \u2013</b> afther youre speech you noticed that the giraffe got finally up on the bed. Despite being a male slave he was still taller then you. Youre head bearly rached his torso. You were a bit intimitaded.<br>\r\n<b>- Oh how sweet \u2013</b> he said <b>\u2013 well traitor time to say goodbye and ill become the hero of the day.</b><br>\r\n<b>- Not today or ever! \u2013</b> Jasmin roared <b>\u2013 Fireball! -</b> she casted a spark form her hands Orange light was flickering in her tiny paws.<br>\r\n<b>- That spark wont do anything \u2013</b> the giraffe laughed., slowly stepping towards you<br>\r\n<b>- Wait for it. \u2013</b> Jasmin said and threw the spark, which hitted his left eye. He grabbed his eye and was screaming of pain<br>\r\n<b>- Maybe got weak spells but they still work on weak point\u2019s. Now quick our escape route, behind my bed there is a botton press it and we can escape</b><br>\r\nWith lack of any other option you quickly ran to the button. Under the ledge of the window there was a giant red botton. It was 4 times big as youre fists, guess for bigger Jasmin it was just as big as her former giant finger. You tried to press but it didint budged. You punched it. You noticed that the bed was slowly rising and tipping on the other side<br>\r\n<b>- Quick on the ledge! \u2013</b> Jasmin ordered. You jumped on the ledge and noticed how the bed was rising higher and higher, tjhe giraffe toppled down and was sliding on the floor. While the bed was rising Jasmin jumped out of youre shoulder and pointed downwards. Under the bed there was giant hole <b>\u2013 This will take us to the underground tunnels and outside the city.<br>\r\n- But that a giant hole \u2013</b> you protested<b> \u2013 Maybe it\u2019s a safe drop then you were over 5 football fields<br>\r\n- Football fields?<br>\r\n- Nevermind! I wont jump too risky</b><br>\r\n<b>- There is a slide and come on you risked so much anyway<br>\r\n- No \u2013</b> you were determined. You were afraid to jump.<br>\r\n<b>- Well guess have no choice \u2013</b> she said with a smirk<br>\r\n<b>- What\u2026 -</b> Before you could finish youre sentenced you felt how jasmin kicked you under youre knees and you started to loose balance and was slowly falling through the hole. While falling you were screaming youre head off. Growing darkness quikly surrounded you. The fall was taking a while, you were running out of youre breath while screaming. Later you felt a wall , you could easily reach it, you tried to grab onto something to slow down. To no Evail. The wall was slowly aproching during the fall. Soon it was touching youre back. Slowly the wall turned into a slide which angle was getting lower an lower. This time you were screaming but of fun. You felt like it was at a theme park, so did Jasmin. The ride ended when you reached the bottom floor. And stone walls with lighten torches. Guieding the way out. The chamber was enormous, but to no suprise since the Empress was a giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>- Where does this path Leads? </b>- you asked<br>\r\n<b>- It leads\u2026 \u2013</b> she pointed to the end of the tunel<b> \u2013 \u2026 to the jungle outside the city.

You realised that she cant keep up her smaller legs. Your face turned red and walked to her<br>\r\n<b>- This\u2026&lt;huff&gt; isint a &lt;puff&gt; a race you know?<br>\r\n- Well were on the run so got rushed<br>\r\n- Ha ha<br>\r\n- Here come.</b><br>\r\nYou picked her up and putted on youre shoulder, THEN you picked up the pace. Since the way was long, even for youre fast walking <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfther a moment of silence Jasmin broke the ice<br>\r\n<b>- Can i ask you something?<br>\r\n- S-sure<br>\r\n- Why did you helped me? I m-mean not that i mind or something, but\u2026<br>\r\n- It\u2019s ok. Well back there i had a flashback form my teens years. When i saw you i saw a reflection of myself. When i was in need the only ones who could help was only close friends and my parents. But they got convinved too. It was a very hard time for me. Afther that i promised myself that i wont let that happen to me or anyone. Ever.</b> For a while silence pervade.<b> - Kinda stu...<br>\r\n- Noble couse i would say - She cracked a small smile.<br>\r\n- Well that\u2019s new.<br>\r\n- What is?<br>\r\n- This point of view, i remember for this corridor to be faar shorter, since the last time i was here. <br>\r\n- When was the last time you used it?<br>\r\n- I never used it actually. Last time it was when i was crowned, it was showed to me by the captain of Royal guard Simmone.<br>\r\n- Who?<br>\r\n- You saw her the one that\u2026 lion who got... Shot \u2013</b> she frowned, her cheer faded away<b> \u2013 What am i saying right now, im fooling myself. I got shrunk. My kingdom above us is being destroyed. My guards and friends are killed ip there and here im talking small stuff trying to forget, im fooling myself. Such a fool!<br>\r\n- Hey, youre still alive and can change things. Youre not fooling yourself youre just trying to cheer up.<br>\r\n- But its my fault this is happening\u2026<br>\r\n- No time for regrets and looking back. Stop thinking what if? Lets thing about what now and what to do later, ok?</b><br>\r\nYou did that again. Automaticly you cheered her up. First you wanted to help her with her current situation and now you did not want her to get sad. You started to care about her. For some reason <i>\"I could not let her be sad and want to see her cheerful self.\"</i> Looks like not only Jasmin has a new point of view on things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfther that long walk you ended up near a giant door<br>\r\n<b>- Great, how are going to opend them up?<br>\r\n- Well we need just to turn the door knob which is ridiculsly high or just  look lower and see a botton for the guards who would be escorting me out of</b><br>\r\nAs she said that there was actually. A door botton above youre head, guess it was good for the \u201enormal sized amazons\u201d. You  both ended up on a hill nearby the city. Jasmin wanted to take a deep breath, but ended up gasping seing how her city was still on fire with echoing screams and shouts. She covered her muzzle and closed her eyes, which forced her tears. You hated that sight and had to say something<br>\r\n<b>- Listen i know its not much from me, but i promise you. I will get to the bottom of this. You get youre throone back and everything will get fine.</b><br>\r\nShe whiped her tears<br>\r\n<b>- You are right!

You stood at Numa\u2019s feet as you waited for them to finish filing in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stood in rows of ten, each row behind the other. You could make out some of them whispering to each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat sort of creature is he?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but he looks cute.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf he picks me, I hope he\u2019s a gentle one.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNuma nudges you forward. \u201cGo on, go pick your favorites.\u201d You walk along each row, inspecting each female. There wwas at least one female from every species you could think of.  Felines, canines, birds, reptiles, even some mythical creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you inspect each one, you pause for a moment, looking each of them over. When you find one you like, you tell them to step forward and to go stand in front of Numa\u2019s throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it\u2019s over, you have chosen several of them. Kri the Cheetah, Luna the Wolf, Aisha the Dragoness, Isis the Hydra, Mellany the Fox, Minx the Cat, Sasha the Husky, Li the Bat, and several others that I am too lazy to name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcellent!\u201d Says Numa when you are finished. \u201cThe prince has selected his chosen mates. They shall stay here with him in the palace, and be treated as royal guests. The rest of you are dismissed.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remaining females file out of the throne room. Numa stands up from her throne, and motions for you and you chosen mates to follow. She leads all of you through the halls of the palace to a large marble double door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNuma pushes the door open, revealing a room with silk pillows everywhere, with a golden fountain in the center of the room. \u201cThis is where your mates will stay. If they need anything, all they must do is call for one of the servants.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your mates file into the room Numa says to you, \u201cHave fun.\u201d as she nudges you into the room behind them.   </span></div></div>",

The first of which, is that there really is a shortage of males on this island. We need as many as we can get, and it would be a terrible shame to lose one. Then there is the matter of the last meal he prepared himself.

You take note of the hieroglyphic-like paintings and strange script that decorate the walls as you're brought to a room at what you think must be the center of the complex. There are two doors: one very large one, clearly meant for the empress, and another smaller door, which you think must be for staff.

Empress Eve had no heirs, but even so, that wouldn't matter, as you have proven yourself the victor in such a contest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait,\" you say, \"it wasn't a contest! Like I said, it was an accident!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Reba asks. \"How did you slay the Empress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fed her food I prepared that I didn't realize I added poison to,\" you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, and why were you making her food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I asked her to let me try to cook for her because I didn't want her to eat me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there you go!\" Reba says. \"That sounds like a life or death contest to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" you say. \"Wait, does that mean I'm your ruler now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite,\" Reba responds. \"Our leader must be one of us. That means an amazon, and judging from your height and masculinity, you're no amazon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plus, you would have to be part animal,\" Ravanna adds. \"Not completely human as you are now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human!\" Reba shouts with a tone of realization. \"That's what those balding ape things are called! Anyway, no, (your name), you're not our new ruler, but there is a solution!\"</span></div></div>",

She opens up a small burgandy pouch and pours the powdery contents of some of her vials into it, giving it a good shake once she has closed the little bag. She then takes a larger vial and pours the mixture into it, adding various multicolored liquids at different doses until it takes on a blueish hue.

You're now being bathed in the yellow mist, which is starting to make you feel nauseous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the smell overtakes you, you start to feel warm, almost feverish, and every muscle in your body starts to tense. You start to feel your bones stretching and reshaping, and your flesh doing the same as it tries to keep up. The process is painful and you begin to scream and thrash about. You feel your arms being grabbed, which you assume is Captain Maxine and Ravanna grabbing them to hold you down. As you feel your teeth begin to become more pronounced and a tail begin to emerge from above your behind, the intensity of the transformation becomes too much for you to bear and you pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to come to and feel a weight on your chest, and a warm layer of fur all over your body.

But you notice Ravanna was still holding her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to your arm Ravanna?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You threw me against the wall while you were thrashing from the potion.\" Ravanna replied with a small smile. \"Before you try to apologize, don't. I knew the risks of trying to hold down someone thrashing and did it anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ravanna, why don't you go see the healer, I'll continue to escort Lady Fenna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All of Reba's choices sound intriguing, but knowing there's no returning to your current self or changing after you choose a form makes it tougher. You think about how Reba said white tigresses were pretty unique among the inhabitants of this island. You decide that if you're going to be the new leader of these anthro amazons, you may as well make yourself stand out (even more than being gigantic would, anyway.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll be a white tiger,\" you delclare to Reba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you absolutely certain?\" Reba asks. \"There's no going back once I'm done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am certain, Reba,\" you affirm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReba nods. \"Very well, then,\" she says as she sorts through her materials. She opens up a small burgandy pouch and pours the powdery contents of some of her vials into it, giving it a good shake once she has closed the little bag. She then takes a larger vial and pours the mixture into it, adding various multicolored liquids at different doses until it takes on a blueish hue. Finally, she adds what looks like hairs of black and white fur to the concoction and secures the vial's lid before rapidly shaking it with both of her webbed hands.You watch the solution within change colorsfrom blue to yellow and bubble as she stops and sets the jar upon a nearby table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind her back, Reba pulls out a colorful staff decorated with feathers. She twists the head of the staff to remove it, revealing it to be hollow within. She opens the jar and pours the mixture she just created into the staff. You swear you can hear it sizzle as it hits the confines of the staff. She screws the staff's head back on, taps it on the ground a couple of times, and turns to walk back over to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I advise you to lie on the ground,\" Reba says. \"These changes may be overwhelming. I'd hate to see our new Empress injure herself before she's even coronated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp and comply with Reba's warning, facing upward as Reba and the two guards stand over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain Maxine, Ravanna,\" Reba addreesses the two guardswomen, \"please be prepared to secure our soon-to-be-Empress if he starts to shake violently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye, Madame Reba,\" Captain Maxine answers as she and Ravanna walk over to your sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, then,\" Reba says. \"I believe we're ready to begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReba begins to chant and shake her staff, which causes it to begin exhuding a yellow mist. You can smell a pungent aroma in the air as Reba dances toward you, moving in rhythm until she stands over your prone form on the floor. As she continues chanting, she twirls her staff and eventually points the head of it at you. You're now being bathed in the yellow mist, which is starting to make you feel nauseous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the smell overtakes you, you start to feel warm, almost feverish, and every muscle in your body starts to tense. You start to feel your bones stretching and reshaping, and your flesh doing the same as it tries to keep up. The process is painful and you begin to scream and thrash about. You feel your arms being grabbed, which you assume is Captain Maxine and Ravanna grabbing them to hold you down. As you feel your teeth begin to become more pronounced and a tail begin to emerge from above your behind, the intensity of the transformation becomes too much for you to bear and you pass out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to come to and feel a weight on your chest, and a warm layer of fur all over your body. You slowly open your eyes and see that standing over you are Reba, Captain Maxine and Ravanna, who is rubbing her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's coming to!\" shouts Reba. \"I'm so glad this didn't kill her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was untested?\" Captain Maxine asks with a shocked tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, of course!\" Reba answers. \"He, or rather, she was the first human I ever saw. What would I have tested the spell on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, God,\" you say, shocked to hear your new feminine voice even though you were expecting it. You turn your head as much as you can and see what remains of your clothes in tatters all around you. \"I'm actually kind of glad there's no going back or changing into something else because I don't want to go through anything like that again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you strat to rise, Reba warns, \"Do not exert yourself too much, Your Future Highness. The transformation took a lot out of you. Even after you blacked out, you continued to thrash about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Ravanna says, still rubbing her arm. \"You managed to throw me into the wall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry, Ravanna,\" you say as you sit on your knees. You realize that in your kneeling position, you're now at eye level with these women's waists, which is where you were eye level at before while standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be all right, Empress-to-Be,\" Ravanna says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I must ask,\" Reba begins, \"what name have you decided for yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answer, \"When I thought about a white tigress, I imagined the color being ghost-like. So I thought I would call myself 'Spectra.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, a lovely name, and an interesting choice,\" Reba responds. \"As I mentioned, white tigresses are rare amongst the people of Anthronia. There are legends that they have a connection to the spirit world somehow. In fact, taht's part of the reason I learned this spell; I thought if I ever ran into a human, I'd turn them into a white tigress and see for myself what they can do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think such a thing is really possible, Reba?\" you ask incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" says Reba. \"Did you think you'd ever change gender, species and height all at once?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point,\" you say as you carefully start to rise to your pawed feet. \"I wish I could see how I looked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Empress Eve was quite vain,\" Captain Maxine responds, \"so of course, there's a giant mirror in here, behind those drapes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe anthro horse amazon trots over to the drapes, situated on the wall at the side of the throne, and pulls a rope, revealing the looming looking glass. You walk over to it, only really able to see your new white tiger head, with straight, lengthy, black-and-white striped hair cascading down past your shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, Your Imminent Majesty,\" Maxine says as she trots back over to you. \"I'll let you stand on my shoulders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxine kneels down and lowers her head, motioning for you to straddle her. You turn around and begin to place your new, striped, furry legs around her head as Ravanna, still nursing her arm, walks over to the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll spot you, Empress-to-Be,\" Ravanna says as Maxine rises to her feet to hold you aloft. The guard captain is quite strong, you think to yourself, to be able to do this with little struggle. Maxine turns so that you're now facing the mirror, and you carefully begin to stand on her shoulders while Ravanna holds your hips steady, moving her hands down to your ankles as you stand yourself up. You're amazed with the ease at which you do so, believing that you may have inherited a feline's grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now see for yourself that your tansformation is complete: you're covered from head to toe in white-and-black striped fur and have a long, striped tail. You're also most definitely female as your super-curvy form reveals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't look half bad,\" you purr. \"This is excellent work, Reba.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you, Your Future Higness,\" Reba says with a bow. \"I'll take you to Eve's quarters to find some clothing to wear. She spent all her time at her maximum height but I'm sure she has some stuff she's never worn at your current size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain Maxine,\" a voice shouts from behind. \"We bring you the Empress' crown!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain Maxine turns (effectively turning you with her) and you see a raccoon anthro amazon holding the crown that was atop Eve's head. You also see two other guards, a pig and a zebra, carrying a familiar looking anthro male appear behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We also found this one in the kitchen!\" the pig announces, referring to the smaller anthro panther she's carrying . You see that it is Jira, the former cook who helped you prepare the meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screwed!?\" Jira calls out to you. \"What have they done to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your head down, cook!\" the zebra orders. \"You are not to look at our new leader while she is unclothed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really feel naked, you guys,\" you say as you gracefully leap off of Maxine's shoulder with your new feline agility. \"And besides, Jira kind of helped me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this true?\" Captain Maxine says as she walks over to Jira. \"Was poisoning Eve YOUR idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poison?\" Jira asks. \"She died from being poisoned? I thought the glutton just finally choked on something!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean it wasn't your plan to put Jinko Powder in her food?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jinko Powder!?\" Jira says with a confused expression on his face. \"Wait, you mean that wasn't tenderizer? Who would put Jinko Powder in a container clearly marked 'tenderizer?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did find the Jinko Powder in the tenderizer bin, Captain,\" the bear admits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Maxine says with, bringing her finger to her head and closing her eyes to think. \"Jira, you would be the prime suspect in this case if we were actually making a case for it. As it stands, we're all actually happy to finally be rid of Eve. Of course, as you are a male anthro, you're unable to hold any kind of political office in our society, and we've already chosen a new leader anyway.\"</span></div></div>",

Of course, as you are a male anthro, you're unable to hold any kind of political office in our society, and we've already chosen a new leader anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't even want to!\" Jira insists. \"I really don't even want to be here in the first place! I just became a cook to save my own skin! All I really want to do is go back to my home in the jungle, far away from you amazons!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't sound unreasonable,\" you say. \"I guess you're free to go home.\" The other guards look at you with a slight sneer before Captain Maxine speaks up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spectra here is to be our new Empress,\" Captain Maxine addresses her underlings. \"If this is what she wants now, it's perfectly reasonable to expect that she'll want the same in a few hours when she actually is the Empress. Let Jira go!' The two guards then lower Jira to the floor and set him down gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, thank you, Screwed!\" Jira says, bowing to you. \"Sorry I'm going to miss your coronation but I'm done with this place! May your reign be remarkable and the attempts on your life be few!\" With that, he dashes out the door as fast as his paws will carry him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was possibly crazy,\" Maxine muses, \"but it was hilarious when he fed Eve that extra spicy meal.\" The guards and Reba chuckle as they remember the event Jira described to you earlier. \"I want you three to properly dispose of that Jinko Powder,\" she says to the guards that carried Jira in as Reba walks over to the raccoon amazon to take the crown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Follow me, Spectra,\" says Reba. \"I'll take you to Eve's room, which is soon to be your room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReba leads you from the throne room into the halls of the palace keep, with Captain Maxine and Ravanna accompanying you at your sides. As you walk through the halls, you look around and observe the decorations, which include various paintings and statues of anthro amazons, among other items. At one point, you come across a human-sized dummy dressed in the armor of a Spanish conquistador.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That armor seems out of place,\" you remark. \"How did it get here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anthronia is a magical island that appears in various places in this planet's oceans, so it's nearly impossible to locate,\" Reba explains. \"However, humans who wore that kind of armor once found us. At first, we thought they were peaceful, but they soon tried to make war with us, so that they might plunder our island and make us their slaves. It did not end well for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's a trophy,\" you realize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely,\" Reba says. \"In fact, that was the armor of their leader. His final words before his execution was a curse, that any outsider who set foot on our island and was welcomed would be our undoing. Since those days, we've been distrustful of outsiders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you seem to be welcoming me,\" you point out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but we've also made you one of us,\" Reba replies. \"Besides, we distrusted Eve even more. Even so, most of us nowadays don't believe that the captain's words had any weight to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you begin to approach a massive doorway, which you think must be the entrance to your soon-to-be private quarters. As you walk through this final hall, you see paintings of the various empresses, beginning with Leona. You admire the beauty of the various Anthronian Empress before walking past the final painting; that, of course, of Eve, who appears to be glaring at you from the paining as if you were her next meal. Reba turns and sees you looking at Eve's painting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You probably think she wants to eat the observer,\" she correctly guesses. \"I don't believe it will surprise you to learn that she ate the artist almost immediately after that painting was completed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She seems like she was a real asshole,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but those days are over now, Spectra. I trust that your rule will be much fairer,\" she says as she beckons you to follow you to the end of the hallway and the giant door waiting there. To the side of the grand door is a much smaller one, clearly meant for service. Reba opens the door and leads you inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around and see incredibly huge furniture, which is much more ornate than what you've seen elsewhere in the palace. Everything is scaled for Eve's personal use.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure there's something that will fit me in here?\" you ask. \"Like I said earlier, I don't even really feel naked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There should be right in here,\" Reba says as she leads you to a small (compared to everything else in the room) chest sitting in a corner behind a chair. Reba opens the chest and sifts around inside, producing a leather bikini top and loincloth. \"Eve took so much from so many people, and she didn't even use it all. She just kept it.\" Reba hands you the clothing and you put it on, with her assistance for the bikini top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" you say, noting that it is a rather simple, yet nice look on you. \"This will work nicely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, Spectra,\" Reba says. \"Come, let us prepare for the coronation.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A couple of hours later, you wait behind the stage of an amphitheater outside of the palace as you hear a crowd of Anthronian Amazons begin to gather in the stands, waiting to see the coronation of their new Empress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is nerve-wracking!\" you say to Reba.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just try not to think about it,\" Reba advises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Try not to think about it!?'\" you say. \"What if they don't like me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then they might try to kill you to become the next Empress. That's why you shouldn't think about it,\" Reba answers before walking off onto the stage. Dumbfounded, you wait backstage with Captain Maxine and Ravanna at your side while Reba addresses the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazons of Anthronia,\" Reba speaks, \"and any males who happen to be in the audience to catch a peak, lend me your ears! As you have heard by now, Empress Eve is no more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheers erupt from the audience, making it clear that Eve was almost universally reviled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As is Anthronian custom, the one who slew Eve is the one who inherits the crown of Empress! Our new Empress is not originally from Anthronia, had never even heard of Anthronia before today, and wasn't even an Anthronian or an Amazon until just a couple of hours ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a mass of hushed whispers coming from the crowd and start to get really anxious. Why on earth would Reba point that out about you?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummmmm,\" Reba continues, \"she killed Eve!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd once again erupt into cheers, making you breathe a slight sigh of relief. Still, Reba's words have put some doubt in your mind. Are you really the right person for this job? As Reba made clear to you earlier, there's no backing out now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please hail our new Empress, Spectra!\" Reba announces, which is your cue to walk out onto the stage. Maxine and Ravanna accompany you as you walk from behind the curtain, greeted with a cacophony of applause. You take position at the center of the stage, before a massive throne fit for a giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spectra,\" Reba says as she holds aloft the crown of the Empress, \"the Amazons of Anthronia bestow upon you the crown, title, and office of Empress of Anthronia, to bear until your dying day, or until you decide to retire, or until someone has had enough of your crap and murders you. Actually, that would also be your dying day, I suppose.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulp, not sure if the crowd notices your sweating. Nice job of helping me not think about that, Reba, you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lower your head, Spectra, so that I might place the crown upon it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou comply with Reba's request and lower your head. As Reba lowers the crown upon your head, you're overcome with a sense of warmth, as if something magical just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dub thee, 'Empress Spectra!'\" Reba declares. \"Now, ascend above us all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd looks at you in quiet anticipation as you just stare ahead in confusion about what you're supposed to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Psst,\" Ruby whispers. \"Think about growing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, ascend! That's what that meant! You realize the warmth you felt from putting on the crown must be an indicator that you're now capable of growing with a thought. With that in mind, you begin to concentrate on growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself expanding outwards, rising to the sky well past the heads of Reba and your two guards. You realize the clothing that Reba found for you earlier is miraculously keeping pace with your growth, although, again, you didn't exactly feel like you were naked before. Your surrounding seem smaller and smaller each second until about ten seconds have passed, when you reach 100-feet tall, which is as large as Eve was and the maximum height Reba told you was possible. You look down at the minuscule crowd, which is cheering for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take your seat on the throne, Empress Spectra!\" Reba shouts from down below. \"Your Coronation Banquet will begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFar below you, you see castle servants begin to cart out huge plates of delicious-looking food. Some of this is the unusual stuff you saw in the kitchen earlier, but it looks rather appetizing to you now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead, Empress!\" Reba yells from below as the staff gets everything into position, \"dig in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at the feast that was prepared for you and grab one of the six-legged boars. The mouth-watering aroma is picked up by your huge nostrils, and you can't help but pop the whole thing in your mouth and start chewing. Your newer, sharper teeth make quick work of the bones and flesh and you swallow the delectable beast once it's fully pasted up in your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lick your chops and begin to reach for another. However, as you do, you look at the food and realize there's quite a bit of it, enough to feed everyone in this amphitheater... three time! However, no one in the crowd, and not even Reba and the guards, are partaking in the banquet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I ask why none of you are eating?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Very, Very Highness,\" Reba shouts from below, \"this feast was made exclusively for you! It is our gift!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may be so,\" you say, \"but it's silly that there's so much food for me and none for everyone else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rise from your throne and think about changing your size once more, only this time, you reduce yourself in height, down to about 15 feet tall, which is 5 feet taller than the other Anthronian Amazons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I invite everyone here to come down and help yourself to this food!\" you announce!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stunned crowd look to each other in a brief moment of silence before breaking out in the largest cheer of the night as they begin to spill from out the stands towards the bountiful banquet that was prepared for you on stage. They do so calmly, knowing that there is more than enough food for everyone here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That applies to you three, too!\" you say, motioning at Madame Reba, Maxine and Ravanna. \"As well as the guards and the staff who brought it out!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheers for Empress Spectra and her generosity!\" someone in the crowd shouts as your staff partakes of the meal, fallowed by a raucous ovation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVery little food is left after the coronation ends, and every Anthronian who attended went home with a full belly. As the staff begins to gather the dishes for cleaning, the guards and Reba begin to accompany you down the halls to your quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you be growing back to your maximum height, Empress Spectra?\" Maxine asks. \"Everything in your quarters is sized for someone much larger than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good point!\" you say as you picture yourself growing again, rising back up to 100 feet and making the hallway seem normal-sized for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wish, I can have new furniture commissioned for you at any scale you wish if you prefer to be smaller,\" Reba offers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't be necessary,\" you say. \"I don't think there's anything wrong with being this tall most of the time. It just seems wasteful to eat this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReba nods. \"You're already doing better than Eve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, maybe with the money saved on food, the guards and other staff can get a raise!\" Ravanna jokes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd like for everyone to be treated fairly, Ravanna,\" you say as you continue down the halls. You feel a little more comfortable in your new furry skin now that the coronation ceremony has come and gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you get an odd feeling whenever you pass by one of the things in the hallway you noticed earlier...</span></div></div>",

This time, since you're now as tall as she was, you no longer get the feeling that the subject of the painting is looking down at you. However, you still feel something uncomfortable about it as you walk past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this painting have to remain up?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if you don't want it here, Empress Spectra,\" Madame Reba replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't suppose I do,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be happy to have my guards take the painting down and burn it,\" Captain Maxine offers. \"There's no reason to pretend we have to honor Eve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Captain,\" you respond. \"What are you doing with her body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm having my guards bury her in a secret location at this very moment, so that her corpse might not be defiled,\" Maxine answers. \"Again, there is no reason to honor her with a funeral, but she consumed so many of us. In a sense, we are giving them their proper burial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow,\" Reba says, \"we will have a memorial service for those we've lost to Eve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod as you reach your doorway. \"I'll make certain to pay my respects then,\" you say as you step inside your quarters. \"Good night to the three of you, and thank you for all that you've done for me today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Empress Spectra,\" the trio says as you close your door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you lay in your new bed, unbeknwonst to you, a scene plays out n a remote location in the jungle where Maxine sent her guards to bury Eve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should have just thrown her wretched corpse in the sea!\" a rabbit amazon guard says as she nearly finishes shoveling dirt on the grave of her former empress. \"She's not worth this trouble!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not about her,\" the sheep amazon replies as she also continues refilling the plot. \"It's about those she's taken from us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we could have at least gotten some males to do this for us!\" the rabbit sighs, rubbing her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh, we're stronger than they are,\" the sheep responds. \"Better to have gotten this done faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit groans. She didn't want to be far from the city at night and so far into the jungle. But she puts her back into it, knowing that she's almost done. A few more shovelfuls full of dirt and the grave is properly covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good riddance,\" says the rabbit as she pats down the earth. \"Not even worth my spit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it just me,\" the sheep asks, \"or did it get darker out here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rabbit looks around and sees that it is indeed much darker out than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What on earth?\" she exclaims. \"Come, let's get back to town before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she speaks, a strange black fog begins to pour into the clearing, enveloping the area with darkness. The two guards are overwhelmed by the fog and begin to cough violently, passing out onto the jungle floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fog rolls out and a hooded figure emerges from behind the trees, walking towards the grave of the fallen empress Eve. A horrid chanting begins to emerge from the hood as its paws begins to sprinkle a strange, black, powdery concoction on the grave. As the figure continues to chant, the ground begins to shake violently, loosening the recently patted-in dirt of the grave. After a few seconds of this, the figure stops chanting, and steps back from the grave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaking suddenly stops when a hand clad in spotted fur thrusts itself from the grave. A glow appears around the wrists of the hand and takes the form of a shackle with a broken chain. The rest of the body follows quickly as Eve, now with phantom shackles on her wrists, ankles, and neck, has awoken from her eternal slumber. She looks dead-on at the figure who gave her the wake-up call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would thank you,\" she hisses to the hooded figure as she holds up her shackled wrists, \"but these chains indicate that you expect something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, I do,\" the hooded figure says as he uncloaks himself, revealing the grinning visage of Jira!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU!\" Eve growls. \"The lousy cook!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I'm a very good cook,\" Jira laughs. \"I just happen to be an even better necromancer. Since the day I convinced you to let me be your cook instead of eating me, I've been feeding you a series of components that would allow me to put you under my command. Those spices you thought I overdid? That was on purpose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should have eaten you when I had the chance,\" Eve laments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have eaten Screwed when you had the chance, too!\" Jira points out. \"I got him to complete the spell for me, and now HE'S the Empress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who? What? How does that even... Bah, it doesn't matter! I am the rightful Empress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anymore! But the magic granted to you as an empress still linger within you, and it's mine to control now! Observe!\" With that, Jira holds out his palms to frame his view of Eve from top to bottom and then begins to slowly force them further apart, causing Eve to grow in size to fit within the frame until she is twenty feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to regret giving me a size advantage,\" Eve says as she starts to lunge towards the necromancer, only to be held back as the phantasmal chains of her shackles become rigid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nuh-uh-uh,\" Jira chides with a taunting voice, \"it works both ways.\" With Eve's movement restricted, Jira frames Eve in the frame of his palm once more and this time closes them shut, causing Eve to reduce in height, shrinking well past her previous Amazonian stature and finally standing at a mere one foot tall as the chain as release her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want with me?\" Eve demands as she stares up at her new apparent master. \"It's clearly not the throne as it sounds like you could have had tit for yourself instead of this... 'Screwed?'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do want the throne, my dear, but on my terms,\" Jira muses as he slooks down at the smaller Eve. \"I'll not be undergoing some sort of mojo to become a female, and I won't take a bride only for her to become the empress and me be the concubine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm not to be your bride, then? Then what am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pet,\" Jira cruelly taunts, \"and a weapon. Through your power, I will conquer Anthronia and take its place as ruler.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEve sulks. \"I've been demoted from empress to pawn, it seems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come now, my dear, you make it sound so terrible,\" Jira chuckles. \"I know you really cared nothing for the throne, anyway. You only ever wanted one thing, and I'm prepared to offer that to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, I offered to prepare you meals before,\" Jira says as he frames Eve with his palms once more and quickly spreads them out. \"I'm about to give you the feast of a lifetime!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJira vanishes in a cloud of smoke as the two amazon guards start coming to. The rabbit quickly looks in the sheep's direction, only to watch her be snatched up by a massive spotted hand. Before she can even start screaming, however, the other hand grabs her and holds her aloft, bringing both amazons face to face with the former Empress they had just buried. Both are frozen in shock as Eve licks her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I always wake up so famished after a long nap,\" Eve says with a malevolent grin before opening her massive maw, providing both guards with the last sight they'll ever see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you awaken the next day, unaware of what just happened above, you...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You looked up to see a giant nut brown mare, strangely she still had hooves instead of feet but she did have hands. She was covered in a flowing white dress from head to toe and that was it as you could see her chest pushing against the thick to you but probably thin to her fabric. She lowered one hand toward you and gestured with 1 finger \"come little one\" she says gently. You hesitantly walk forward and climb onto her hand and she raises it to her face, \"what are you?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a human, your highness\" you reply weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to call me your highness, my name is Amira and I expect to be adressed as such, who are you?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake\" you reply weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you scared?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense Amira, but you're a gigantic talking anthromporphic horse, that is far from normal where I come from\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so what is this place you come from like?\" she asks. You tell her everything, probably too much as you did describe humans at war and her face visibly darkened as you talked about it. When you finished she raised you up by 2 fingers, \"you were very honest with me, so are you one of these humans who would dare hurt my people?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no no no\" you say, \"I'm not a fighting person, not really built for it, plus well i'm pretty sure any of you're subjects could knock me out without me landing a punch\" you say. Amira nods and lays back in the chair, \"that is good, I really detest violence, but it is necesscary at times to get food\" she continues. You nodded and she put you down in her lap, \"so little one what do you wish to do now?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I go home?\" you ask. Amira thinks for a minute before replying, \"i'm sorry, but even if you won't try to harm us, others of you're kind might so I can't let you leave\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Anthroia, our forefathers landed here many years ago and we haven't wanted to leave\" Amira says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.... well then can you put me down?\" you ask. She moves you from her lap to the ground and you start walking for the exit, \"where are you going?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, maybe go throw myself into the sea, don't have much else to do\" you reply. You were shocked as you were yanked up and Amira holds you up to her face, \"why would you do that?\" she asks a touch of anger in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I lost everything, my family, my friends, my home, my life\" you say almost breaking down. Much to you're suprise Amira hugs you to her chest \"little one you still have you're life, that is a blessing\" she says gently stroking you. She stops after a minute and lifts you up, \"better?\" she asks. \"Much, thank you\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So little one why don't you make you're home here, i'm sure my citizens would be very accepting of you\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't i'd just impose\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense\" she says, \"you have a lot of redeeming qualities, you seem to be in pretty good shape, you're a male, you are quite handsome\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what was that about me being male?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well our civilization's male population has declined to well, none in the current generation\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So i'm the only guy on the whole island\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that makes you very valuable, in fact maybe I should claim you as my own right now\" Amira says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Claim me?\" you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't actually own you, it just states that when you are ready to mate then I will get first chance\" she says. Amira lifts you up and her tongue rolls out and she surrounds you in it, rolling you around once or twice before gently pressing you against her nether regions for a second. She lifts you up and sniffs, \"there my scent is on you now\" she says happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just licked me\" you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, that was very rude of me, well come then\" she says. She walks through a palace that seemed to barely fit her as her head almost hit the ceiling, you felt the air heat up and Amira stepped into an area full of steaming pools. \"Welcome to my personal baths\" Amira says putting you down, you stand there shocked, \"well aren't you going to undress\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do it with you standing right there\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nonesense\" Amira says undressing in one fluid motion in front of you, you were left gawking as the dress fell revealing her slim body and quite large chest, you couldn't help but blush and she smiled down at you. \"Oh so you like what you see little one?\" she asks teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Jake not little one\" you reply starting to undress, once you were fully undressed you felt a blast of hot air wash over you and you looked over to see Amira's face right in front of you. \"I know you're name, but little one just seems to fit you much better, it's cuter and you can't really dispute it\" she says. You were about to answer when you shivered and her face changed from jovial to concerned, \"we need to get you into somewhere warm before you catch cold\" she says picking you up. She walks over to the nearest pool and submerges herself up to her head, you had to swim to stay afloat and seeing no better place you swam over to her shoulder and you were just able to sit down with you're head out of the water. \"Oh so can't stay away from me can you?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know for someone who comes from a society of all women, you don't seem to really mind men\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course not, it's not like I never knew any men, they just all...died\" she says sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....i'm sorry for bringing it up\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright\" Amira replies, \"it was many years ago, besides you're here now and....\" she replies trailing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to be sure to give everyone lots of children, I personally expect 5 children no less\" Amira says looking at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you yell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't actually think you got to stay without giving something in return did you?\" Amira says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, kind of\" you say. Amira laughs \"well now you know you won't\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, isn't sex supposed to be between 2 people who love each other?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh of course, but you don't exactly have much choice in the matter, now do you?\" Amira says. \"Or do you not find me beautiful?\" Amira asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no, you do look very good\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have I not been kind to you?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes but...\" \"so then what is the problem\" she interrupts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I barely know you, no offense you seem like a good girl but for all I know this could be an act\" you say. Amira looks down at you shocked, \"you think i'd lie to you?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I barely know you\" you say. Amira drops you into the water and actually pushes you down, you were shocked for a few seconds but considering how large she was you knew if she wanted you dead you weren't making it out of this alive. \"Great i'm gonna die because I pissed her off\" you think and you're shocked as she pulled you out of the water, \"there now do you trust me\" she says her voice cracking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck was that?\" you yell, Amira doesn't answer instead she nuzzles you against her palm, \"please little one just stop\" she says her voice breaking now you see a tear stream down her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hey why are you crying?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, it's just well you are the first male to show up in years, and if you hated us, or me then I would be a failure as a queen\" Amira says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, Amira what do you want?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I just need you to trust me and tell me that you'll stay\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, Amira i'll stay, you seem to be completely honest with me\" you continue.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Amira nods \"alright then bathtime's over\" she says standing up, Her hand whisked under you and you were lifted out of the water and placed down near your clothes, you watched Amira's tail as she walked away and came back carrying a towel which she dropped on top of you. You quickly dried yourself off and got changed back into your clothes, in a few seconds the towel was lifted up and you turned away as Amira started drying herself off. You heard the sound of hooves on rock again for a few seconds before you were lifted up by 2 fingers \"so does this mean you don't want to mate right away?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you say opening your eyes and seeing her giant face \"look, no offense but I don't know you, or well anyone on this island other then your all some sort of anthro, and from what I can remember of the guards about 10ft tall\" you say. Amira giggles \"don't worry, I'll go first and there's no way you can resist me\" she says like a statement of fact, \"everyone else will be easy after me and you'll be plenty loosened up\" she says dropping you into an open palm and shutting her hand. You felt Amira start walking and you just sat there in her palm as she walked. It took her a few minutes and she stopped for a bit, you heard her speak although it was muffled and then her palm was opened up, you looked around and you were back in her throne room but now standing as a large group in front of her throne were hundreds upon hundreds of female anthros ranging from cats to dogs, birds to reptiles. All eyes were focused on Amira's palm and as hundreds of eyes locked onto you a great cheer was given by the whole crowd.  Amira's hand closed around you again and you heard her give off some sort of command, you didn't feel her move for a few seconds after that obviously waiting for the crowd to part. She started walking again and she walked for a good 10 minutes making you wonder just how big this castle was, hell it had to be the size of a small city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen next you saw light it was because you were dropped onto a velvety soft bed spread, you looked around and you realized you were in Amira's bedroom. You could tell it was the bedroom of a princess from a few things, giant dresser, 4 poster bed, hell one side wall was a giant open balcony although you weren't sure what it looked out over you couldn't see. The room was lit mostly with natural light but there were candles bigger then you were in giant holders on the wall. You heard rustling and you turned just as Amira finished removing her dress, she smiled down at you and lowered herself, \"well you gonna undress or what?\" she says poking you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I...I'm really not comfortable with this\" you stammer not able to really move or really do anything as you were too stunned at the beautiful creature presenting herself to you. You froze as Amira reached down and with insane dexterity pulled your shirt and pants off although you held your arms up so she could. You weren't sure if you wanted or it at the moment and she smiled \"come on, I need you to remove those\" she says pointing at your underwear. You realized that you did want it as you pulled your underwear off, Amira picked you up the soft hair on her body tickling you as she crawled up onto the bed and smiled at you, \"don't worry I'll be gentle\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few hours were pure bliss for you, all you knew was the warmth and gentleness of Amira's touch, the soft feeling of her fur as she rubbed against you and you rubbed against her. The warm wet confines of her love, you even learned a bit about the giant equine including but not limited to her favorite pleasure spots. In the end you were laying on Amira's stomach as she panted above you \"that was amazing\" she says. You couldn't do anything other then nod at up at her, Amira's hand gently lifted you up and put you down on her head and you gently stroked her nose. Amira sighs and here yes focus on you \"you know I'm actually conflicted, I'm not sure if I should let you go with everyone else\" she says. You nod when there's a knock at the door, it creaks open and in a few seconds there's 2 large anthros that look like panthers standing above you on Amira's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your majesty, the time is up, I assume you had fun with him?\" one of the panthers asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes he was wonderful, I don't think i've ever felt that good in my life, even with the toys\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright that explains why there was no hymen, wait toys....don't think about it, don't think about it, don't think about it\" you think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your majesty may the rest of the kingdom have our turn?\" the other panther asks thankfully averting your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmira nods making you slide forward for a second \"it is his duty, the other part will come later\" she says. The 2 panthers lift you up laying your arms on their shoulders \"come on handsome if you get tired this easily you'll be in trouble\" one of the panthers say. They jumped down they're size preventing you from hitting the bed or the floor below as they jumped and finally they just changed it so that you were carried between the 2 of them. They were suprisingly silent as they carried you, after a minute you have enough and ask as you were still naked, \"so where are we going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well first you will be brought back to the throne room so that everyone may see that the queen is done with you, then you will be given a 5 hour rest period to rest and sleep. Then the mating will begin, you'll be given a 5 hour rest period every 8 hours so you should be done the island's populace in....\" she trails off as she does a few figures \"....a month and a half\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at the panther \"um how many girls does that mean I have to impregnate in that 8 hour period?\" you ask as they carried you along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the lowest number is 50\" the panther on the right replies. You just stared at her stunned and you turned as a great cheer erupted from your side. You turned to see that the 2 panthers had entered the throne room and you were lifted up like a trophy. There was another great cheer and you finally figure out that you were still naked \"can I uh have some clothes?\" you ask. The panthers lowered you and snapped, \"clothes\" the one on your left said. A ferret anthro comes out of the crowd holding some underwear, a pair of work pants which although they looked like shorts were jeans to you and a much too large t-shirt. You quickly got dressed and were led to what you assume was the kitchen as there was a plate with some strange meat on it and some sort of drink made out of some unknown fruit. You ate and drank as much as you could before you were led to a small room. The 2 panthers gently pushed you into the room and you collapsed upon the waiting bed. You slept as deeply as you ever had awakening in a few hours to the 2 panthers. You were led out and smiled at you \"we're your second and third\" one of the panthers whispers before all 3 of you walked out of the castle which in itself took about half an hour. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were surprised at what you were seeing, sitting upon the throne was a gigantic grey mouse, tail, big round ears and all. She was wearing a sky blue dress that fell down to her paws and she smiled at you as you walked up. She was a very shapely mouse you could tell that much as there were 2 good sized orbs poking out of the dress and it was very....form fitting. She was slim so she seemed to get a lot of exercise, for a mouse she had very long legs and her face ended in actually a quite cute pink nose and set of whiskers. She bends down to examine you and you backed up for a second, her hand shot forward and lifted you up to her face, \"so who and what are you?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex....ma'am and I'm a human\" you say. The mouse thinks for a second \"humans never heard of em, anyways I'm May welcome to my kingdom of Anthroia\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, can you uh put me down\" you say as she was holding you up by the legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my yes\" she says putting you down in a palm she lowers her face and starts to examine you. \"Hmm your pretty scrawny, not really meant for fieldwork are ya\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm more an...intellectual\" you reply. She nods \"well good then you should be fun for a game or 2\" she says. She lowers her hand and puts you down on the floor and that's when you realize that the giant hall was silent except for the sound of breathing and the guards who had stood watch and the ones who had brought you here had disappeared. May lowers herself into an almost crouching position \"alright Alex here's what we're going to do, we're going to play a little game called cat and mouse, and guess who's the cat\" May says smiling. \"You have 10 seconds so I suggest you get running\" she says. You take her advice and bolt in the other direction back down the hall you had come from \"here I come\" May shouts after a few seconds and you turned for a second to see her start walking after you. Just as you turn a corner you see her drop down onto all 4s and start running. You were suddenly grabbed and pulled into a doorway, 3 pairs of hands covered your mouth as you heard the titanic mouse race right past the doorway. Finally after a minute the hands were removed and you were able to turn around. You were staring at 3 mice, all of them about 5ft 10, and they all looked like duplicates of May even the dress, the only difference was fur color, one was brown, one was white, and one was jet black which surprised you a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez I can't believe this first visitor we have in ages and she wants to \"play\" with him\" the black mouse says obviously perturbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could have been worse, I mean she could have wanted to play something else\" the brown mouse remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe white mouse walks forward and looks at you eye to eye \"are you alright?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I'm fine\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods \"that's good, oh by the way I'm Cathy, and these are my sisters Tina and Diane\" she says indicating the black and brown mouse in turn. \"You already met our elder sister\" she says with a hint of scorn in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your related to that giant mouse!?\" you say stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the first born always becomes that big, although she only beat me by 2 seconds\" Cathy says. Suddenly you hear a tearing sound and a large chunk of the wall including the door was ripped out behind you and you slowly turn to see May the mouse staring down at you, \"found you mousey\" she says smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H,o,l,y.....shit what the hell she wrecks her own castle?\" you say. The 3 mice sisters nod, \"May quit it, you won, do you have any idea how much work the construction crews are going to have putting that wall back together\" Tina says walking up and challenging the large mouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blehhh your not the boss of me besides I win, now I get to decide what happens to him\" May says reaching for you when suddenly the 3 mice stand in her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't May, we're sick and tired of this, as you know under law no anthro can touch another's husband so we claim him as ours\" they say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you shout but they just ignore you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay laughs \"fine if that's how you 3 want to prove that you have some power around here even though I'm the first born that's fine. However you also know under law I can challenge you for your husband\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes but you have to put up something of equal value for if you lose\" Cathy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay nods\" that's true, so I'll wager my crown against him, do you accept the challenge?\" May asks. The 3 mice sisters nod, \"good then the competition will be held one week from today, I'll see you there\" May puts the piece of wall down and calls \"clean up\" before heading back towards the throne room. Out of a side corridor run a bunch of male furs most of them large horses who grab the piece of wall and hoist it back into place, it's held there and mortared back into place. They nod at the what you assume are princesses and just stand there holding the wall in place till It dries. Your pulled away by the 3 mice and Cathy sighs \"I'm sorry my sister has caused you such trouble\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's uh...okay\" you say really not sure what else to say. \"So what was that whole exchange?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Under Anthroia law not even the queen and touch the husband of another anthro without their say so, if we hadn't intervened well May has never seriously hurt someone but you may have been....scarred\" Diane says. You nod \"well then......thank you\" you say. Tina sidles up next to you and hugs your arm \"although that's not the only reason, you are pretty cute\" she says. Suddenly the 3 girls were walking very close, \"you know she's right, you pretty cute for a...what are you?\" Diane asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Human\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah your pretty cute for one of those\" Cathy says. They lead you down the hall into a room about 3 times the size of any other you had seen so far except the throne room, in it were 3 identical king size beds as well as 3 dressers although there was only 1 bathroom that branched off the room. You stared at the three of them and Cathy smiled \"this is our bedroom\" she says walking forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's very nice, so why did you bring me here?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To make sure that May doesn't try anything we need you to stay here, one of us will stay with you at all times to make sure that nothing happens to you\" Cathy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, no offense but what should it matter what happens to me, I mean you don't even know me\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, as soon as you stepped on our island you became a citizen of Anthroia, and as it's royal family we have a duty to protect everyone who lives here\" Tina says, \"also we wouldn't mind getting to know you\" Tina says getting closer to you. You nervously giggled when Diane pulls you back \"I'm sorry about my sister's actions it's just that May has a....controlling hand on the male population, it's not very often a guy becomes available that she hasn't already tried to sink her teeth into or just doesn't like\" Diane says. \"Ok that's quite not really good\" you say. The three sisters nod \"don't worry, we won't let May get you, and then you'll be ours to love\" Tina says as if it's fact.</span></div></div>",

This, you guessed, was the empress's bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard the door open behind you, and in stepped Arache. \"So, I hope these accommodations suit you.\" She said with a toothy smile, showing her fangs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly nodded, knowing telling her that they weren't would probably result in your death. \"Excellent.\" She says. \"Now, let's discuss what the plan is for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe places you in her palm, and climbs onto her web.

Only, she's much larger than you've normally seen her on the internet. Other than that, she looks exactly the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her white fur with the black stripes, the long white hair, the red painted nails, only her outfit is different. She wears a light blue silk skirt that goes down to her knees, with golden belt above it, with a strange symbol on the front. Her chest is covered by a sleeveless light blue silk top that exposes her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her head is a golden tiara, with more symbols carved all around the ring. She looks at you with a gentle smile. \"Come here little one.\" She beckons you with one finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk toward her, marveling at her gigantic size. You had always been a fan of her, but you never knew she actually existed, or that she was so huge. But then again, you didn't think anthropomorphic animals existed to begin with, either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reach her feet, she gently picks you up between her fingers, and places you in her palm. \"Now then, what brings you here?\" She asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" You reply. \"Last thing I remember was drowning in the ocean, then, I wake up on this island.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n\"Well, you're in safe hands now.\" She says gently. \"My name is....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I know.\" You say, cutting her off. \"Your name is Zig Zag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks at you bewildered. \"How did you know my name?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're an internet icon, where I come from.\" She looks even more confused. \"What's an internet?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou explain to her about the internet and computers. \"I see. But how could.........Max! Of course!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Max?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Several years ago, another one of your kind found this island. He ended up here the same way you did. He stayed with us a while, then we built a raft for him and sent him home, after erasing his memory of this place. I just hope he didn't remember it after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't worry.\" You say. \"He didn't tell anyone. Otherwise, a lot more humans would have come here before me. He probably only remembered you, and thought he had just made you up himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's a relief.\" She says.\"So, in this \"Internet\" of yours, what am I like?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell her all about how she's practically a celebrity of fandom, and how she is portrayed in art and writing.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Just know that your memory will be wiped as well.\" she states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod your head as she tells you this. \"Of course, I understand. No worries.\" you reply although slightly disappointed that you aren't going to be able to remember the fun times you're sure to have while you stay here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing that wasn't mentioned about Zig Zag is that she has the ability to read minds and knows exactly what you're thinking. \"Don't worry, the memory I'll replace it with is one of you having a good time.\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at her and give her a meek smile. \"Thanks Zig Zag.\" you reply.

She sighs to herself. \"It's to bad he'll be leaving. He seems like such a good guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way down the marble steps in front of the palace. You look out at the city before you, marveling at how grand it is. It looks like a a mix between a Greek and a Mayan city, with marble buildings and columns, walls with pictures carved into them, and some statues here an there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder around the city, admiring the beauty of it, passing anthros of every species imaginable. You come to what look like the local market place. Stands selling various strange fruits and fish, jewelry, art, etc, lined the street. As you walk past, you hear various calls from the stand owners. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fish! Fresh Jing Fish, just caught!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got berries, I've got roms, I've got squin, any fruit you can think of, I've got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eels! Come and get your eels!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come! I just get a fresh supply of medicine! I even have a new cure Sleeping Fever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pass by, admiring the various goods, when you hear the sound of a horn. You turn toward the direction of the sound, to see a skunk anthro walking down the street, blowing into a conch shell. She is followed by four of Zig Zag's servants, carrying one of those beds with rods sticking out the sides, surrounded by a pink curtain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho ever was coming was apparently very important, because every one in the street was stepping to the side to let them through. You quickly follow their example. The servants stop in front stand. A long, slender leg steps out of the carriage, followed by another. Out steps the most striking anthro you've ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is a tigress, with black fur, and white stripes! Snow white hair hangs from her head to her shoulders, and her tail tip is white as well. She is dressed in a way that reminds you of Cleopatra. Unlike her mother, she is the average height for species, ten feet tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stand owner, a cheetah, bends down on one knee and bows his head. She motions for him to rise, and begins speaking to him. You can't help but stare at her. She was so captivating, so exotic, so..........beautiful. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tap the anthro standing next to you, a fox, and ask. \"Who is that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is Princess Kasmir, Empress Zig Zag's daughter.\" He responds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZig Zag's daughter! That explains her fur, even though it's the vice versa of her mother's. You want to go up to her and talk to her. Even just to say hello.    </span></div></div>",

Suprisingly you felt her arm on your shoulder and she lifted you up till you were standing and looking at about a 50 degree angle up at her. \"Aren't you gonna say hello?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hello, princess....ma'am\" you say. She laughs \"geez cat got your tongue?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well somewhat, you are very beautiful\" you reply before covering your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leans over and there's a look of almost hunger in her eyes and it almost sounded like she was purring. \"This is the first time i've ever had someone compliment me who wasn't a citizen, thank you\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y..your welcome\" you stammer back. She smiles at you and snaps her fingers the bed and the anthros carrying it moving to her and she climbs on \"come\" she says motioning for you to follow. You slowly stepped forward and climbed onto the bed before it started to move, Kasmir smiled at you as you were well very nervous to say the least, for some reason you were more nervous now then you were seeing a 300ft tall Zig Zag. You jumped as you felt her hand on your shoulder and she smiled at you \"you really need to settle down, it's not like I bite...much\" she says showing off some fangs. You nervously laugh and she licks your cheek \"mm actually you taste pretty good\" she says leaning over more \"mmm maybe just a little nibble\" she says. You were unsure of what to do, I mean you didn't want to get eaten and they didn't seem to be into cannabilism but you never knew. She leans over and nibbles on your ear causing you to laugh \"haha stop that, it tickles\" you say.

She nods and keeps staring \"your just so strange, but in a good way\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you?\" you reply kind of confused. She moves forward and lays her head down on your stomach \"so did my mother tell you that i'm single?\" Kasmir says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I kind of figured\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm a unique husband, only one on the whole island and he's pretty cute\" you heard her mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think i'm cute?\" you ask. Her head shoots up and she sighs \"yes you actually are pretty cute, in fact\" she leans over and gently nibbles on your ear again \"I just might pick you\" she says. \"Stop\" she shouts and the bed stops moving \"Fernando\" she shouts and through the curtain appears the head of a fox \"yes my liege?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like him to be entered into the pick\" she says pointing at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...but Princess only men of somewhat noble birth can be entered\" he replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you questioning my orders?\" Kasmir says staring him down. The fox sighs and nods his head \"as you wish Princess, we will enter him as soon as we return to the palace\" he says. The bed starts to move again and Kasmir seems very excited \"excellent, now it is all a matter of time\" she purrs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly did you just do?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I am the one and only daughter of the Empress and tradition dictates that any male of noble birth may fight for the right to marry me\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, what about your feelings?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon?\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What doesn't the monarchy have the right to pick someone who they like rather then whoever wins them?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well no, tradition has always dictated that men fight over the queen and in her generosity she allows the winner to marry her\" Kasmir says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh and nod \"oh that reminds me, why is Zig Zag so big?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well you see even though the man wins the woman we have always been a matriarchal society, there's some ritual that gives the queen that size so that she may rule over even her husband although i've heard tale of one queen who denied the ritual\" she says. You nod again and she sits back \"so what is the outside world like, I don't know anything but this island\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright, the outside world is an alright place, there is a lot of war and other problems\" you say sighing. She pestered you with more and more questions till the bed stopped and she stepped out again motioning for you to follow. \"We might as well tell mother in person\" Kasmir says leading the way since her strides were twice yours. You soon re-entered the throne room where Zig Zag was sitting looking very bored \"oh Kasmir welcome back and you brought our guest with you\" she says sitting up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Mom can I ask for a favour\" Kasmir says and you see her put on \"the eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it my daughter?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well can you enter him into the competition to marry me\" Kasmir says pointing at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZigZag actually looks stunned \"Kasmir he can't that's only for the families with noble lineage\" ZigZag says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not\" she replies \"can't I have someone who was chosen because I like them instead\" Kasmir says. ZigZag sighs \"Kasmir please the rules haven't changed for hundreds of years, I met your father through them even though I didn't like him\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You didn't like dad?\" Kasmir replies as you watched thankfully all but forgotten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No your father was a good man, and I liked him, but I didn't love him, I never really fell for anyone before I met your father\" she sighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please mom can he enter then, please\" Kasmir says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZigZag sighs \"Kasmir please i'm sure there are lots of nice boys to pick from\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No there aren't, they're all too afraid of you to do anything but suck up\" Kasmir says folding her arms. ZigZag sighs and picks her daughter up \"Kasmir please just go with tradition\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom why? If you had fallen in love before you met dad would have gone through with the competition\" Kasmir asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I would not have\" ZigZag replies then covers her mouth. Sighing ZigZag says\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Alright Kasmir he may join the competition\" ZigZag says. \"Oooh thank you mom\" Kasmir says hugging her mother's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you truly alright with doing this?\" ZigZag asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am\" you reply giving a little bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZigZag sighs again \"Anthony\" she shouts and from a side corridor runs a male skunk in very regal garb who bows when he stand in front of Zig's throne \"yes ZigZag?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like him to be entered into the competition for my daughter, no questions\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony nods and turns to you \"name?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex\" you reply. He quickly writes your name on what you can only equate to parchment before bowing to ZigZag again and running off. ZigZag puts Kasmir down and she runs up and grabs your hand \"come on I\u2019ll show you your room\" she says pulling you along after her. Kasmir happily runs through the halls which like the throne room were absolutely gigantic as they had to fit something ZigZag's size, you weren't exactly sure how long they took to carve as they were all made of stone you just knew it must have taken a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what exactly happens during the competition\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well there's 3 parts, physical, mental, and then the pick\" Kasmir says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pick?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes the physical and mental challenge reduce the amount of anthros for the pick down to 10\" Kasmir says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many anthros usually compete?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Around a hundred competed for my mother\" Kasmir says. She pauses after like the 10th identical giant wood door you passed, she looks in and motions for you to come in \"alright well this is your room, see you at the competition tomorrow\" she says before leaving the room. The room was very majestic, one of the side walls was taken up by a giant oak dresser and a door that led to a bathroom with a toilet and bathtub although you knew there was no plumbing so the room confused you a bit. The whole wall across the door was open and it led onto a large terrace the only cover being a light curtain. You turned as there was a knock at the door and a shy looking dog anthro in a maid outfit comes into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hello I'm Petunia, I'll be your personal servant for the competition\" she says not once lifting her head. You walk up and she gasps as she was well able to look down at you at a 90 degree angle. \"Hi\" you say and she backs up a step, \"you, what are you?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A human\" you reply smiling at her, her face softens and she bows \"as I said i'll be your personal servant for the competition\" she says. You nod and decide to ask, \"so um how do the toilets and the bathtub work, since you probably don't have plumbing\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plumbing?\" she replies confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like a system of pipes that moves water into the home\" you say. She nods \"well if you wish to have a bath we can heat the water right now as for the waste, well we use it as fertilizer\" she says. You look up at her \"are you serious?\" you ask and surprisingly she nods \"augh ok that's kind of gross\" you say. She shrugs and bows to you again \"is that all?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes that's fine, thank you for your work\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do anything\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your willing to help me out that's all the work I need right now\" you reply. She looks at you confused and shrugs again before leaving the room. You sit back on the bed and lie down, you must have fallen asleep as the next thing you know Petunia was shaking you awake \"come on wake up, you need to get changed for dinner\" she says pointing to a set of clothes already laid out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" you reply starting to undress, you freeze as you realize she hadn't moved \"um you can leave\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't leave I have to escort you to dinner\" she says. You try to convince her to leave but finally you just sigh and get changed although you swear you felt her lean forward once or twice. You followed Petunia out of the room and she leads you to the dining hall which you expected was absolutely massive in size, you followed Petunia up to what looked to be a chair with a ladder on the side and you started to climb up. You were seated about halfway down the table between a male dog anthro and a deer anthro. Both turned and stared at you for a second before turning away. You saw ZigZag at the front of the table and she stood up \"I have been informed that everyone is here so me may begin dinner\" she says. Servants like Petunia come out from side corridors carrying giant trays of food that are actually passed to ZigZag who sets them onto the table. Finally the servants take their places near the end of the table and everyone gets up and grabs part of the nearest dish and digs in. You ate what looked to be some sort of giant boar with a sail like a sailfish has on it's back as well as some sort of rainbow fish as well as some sort of fruit juice. After about a half an hour the dinner hall quieted again and ZigZag once again stood up \"all you men are here to battle for my daughter's hand in matrimony, as the first competition will be tomorrow I can do naught but wish you luck\" she says. There was scattered applause across the table and people started to leave you followed suit retracing the path you saw Petunia took to get back to your room, thankfully you got the right door on the first try. You headed straight for the closet and started to undress when the door opened and you heard a muffled \"eep\" standing in the doorway was Kasmir red as a beet, she quickly shuts the door and you get dressed and slowly open it. \"May I come in?\" she asks and you nod. She walks into the room and it was weird it was almost like it got brighter \"I am....sorry for my intrusion before\" she says blushing a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...alright, Princess do you need me for something?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laughs \"I am very different from my mother but you will address me as Kasmir got it\" she says. You nod and she shuts the door \"I thought I should come and see you since you are somewhat, disadvantaged in the physical competition\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, what is it?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an obstacle course, although thankfully some of the obstacles take brains rather then brawn to figure out, especially the last one, I designed it myself\" she says smiling. You nod and she smiles at you \"you know your my favorite right\" she says. You nodded again and she pushes against you with one paw \"you better win otherwise you will make me very sad\" she says. She pulls out what looked like a pink ribbon with a bell in the center, \"I want you to wear this around your neck during the obstacle course\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh \"fine\" you say stashing the ribbon under your pillow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh thank you\" she says leaning over and pecking you on the cheek. She quickly but silently exits your room and you change into your sleep clothes before laying down into bed. You heard a gentle knock and you go and answer it, opening the door Petunia was standing there \"has Lady Kasmir been here yet?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs \"good, well good luck in the competiton tomorrow\" she says before she leaves. You scratched your head for a second then shrugged, shut the door and went to sleep holding the ribbon tightly.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You were woken up by Petunia's shaking as well as the call of some bird \"get up you must have breakfast and then we must go to the competition grounds\" Petunia says. You nod when you sit up and knowing she's going to stick around you get changed into a t-shirt and what seemed to be shorts although you could tell they were modified to fit you. You followed Petunia into the dining hall where there were a few of the male contestants and you had a breakfast of strange fruit one was even a blue square as big as you were but you just shrugged and dug right in. Petunia led you back to your room and you grabbed the ribbon and secured it around your neck in a little bow. You were led out onto the course and thankfully everyone was just standing around. In a few minutes ZigZag walks up and everyone lines up and you take the one empty place. The same deer from yesterday looked over at you and he actually growled and soon there was very angry muttering going through the whole line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the first competition for my daughter's hand, each of you will go along the path in front of you so that there may be no interference\" ZigZag says. You waited around for a few seconds and ZigZag yelled \"start\" and you started off at a sprint heading into the tree lines. The first few challenges were very basic, swing over a pit, climb up the hill or over the tree that kind of thing. The first major obstacle was you had to cross a river and all you there was, was a single giant tree and an axe, throwing caution to the wind you chopped down the tree and pushed it into the water. Suprisingly it fit the gap perfectly so you ran across the makeshift bridge. The second challenge required a bit of archery to hit a lever that would make a rock fall into a giant pit so you could cross. Luck was on your side and you hit the lever on the first shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final challenge was where it got interesting there was a bird anthro waiting near a box full of wooden blocks with letters on them. On a tree nearby was a note which you guessed was the only clue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of this there is only one\"<br>\r\n\"More like the night instead of the dawn\"<br>\r\n\"The most beautiful in all the land\"<br>\r\n\"All you'll see though is the hand\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instantly knew it was Kasmir and quickly grabbed the blocks you needed and spelled out her name. The bird nodded and flew upwards and spread her wings, it was nuts like a peacock but the display this bird gave off had to be seen for miles. She then swoops down and picks you up by the arms and flies back to the starting area. When she lands your suprised as you don't see anyone else. Within minutes however more of these birds come flying back and in about 10 minute there are about 70 of you there as well as 30 extra bird anthros with no male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZigZag walks up \"that is disappointing that there were so many that couldn't figure out the riddle\" she says. \"Alira\" says ZigZag and instantly the bird who carried you back stepped forward \"how long did it take him to solve the riddle?\" ZigZag asks obviously referring to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No time at all ZigZag he looked at the riddle once and in a second spelled Kasmir's name\" Alira replies. You look up to see ZigZag smiling and she picks you up and examines you and you felt one of her claws press against your neck and the ribbon. \"Seems somebody is a favorite\" she whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first round is over, with the outsider in the lead\" ZigZag says. There were gasps from all over especially from the other participants. \"Kasmir will now stow give him the first prize\" ZigZag says. Kasmir walks up and smiles at you and then pretends to freeze \"mother, he already has the prize around his neck\" Kasmir says. Zig pretends to lean over and she gasps in shock \"your right, how could he have gotten your personal ribbon, did you steal it?\" she asks you sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just found it, in the baths, but then I heard Kasmir and I bolted\" you say trying to come up with a suitable answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZigZag nods \"well since you found the ribbon you may keep it, but you still deserve a prize\" she says. Without hesitation Kasmir walks up and kisses you gemtly on the lips for a second and this time there was a stunned silence however you don't know what happened after as Petunia comes out of nowhere, grabs you, and starts running carrying you like a sack of grain. She disn't stop until you were back in your room and she deposits you on the bed and locks the door, \"that was close\" she says panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why'd you do that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You couldn't feel it, every other contestant wanted to kill you, I suggest eating your meal in here\" Petunia says. You nod \"thanks for saving me\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lady likes you so you can't be all bad, and your welcome\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Petunia come here and sit down\" you say. She walks over and sits next to you, you reach up and start scratching behind her ears and she gives off a sigh of pure contentment. \"Mmm what is that?\" she asks moving over so you can get better access to her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's called an ear scratch\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh it's heavenly\" Petunia says. She freezes as there is a knock at the door and you hear Kasmir's voice \"May I come in?\" she asks. You walk forward and open the door and you find her standing there and she hurries inside and shuts the door \"your ok\" she says hugging you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lady you must try this\" Petunia says sitting her down next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Petunia what are you.....ohhhhh\" Kasmir sighs and starts purring as you scratch her ears her tail happily wagging from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He says it's called an ear scratch, it feels heavenly doesn't it\" Petunia says. Kasmir nods and after a minute you stop and she turns to you, and pushes you over \"mmm you are absolutely my favorite now\" she purrs. You started to gently rub her back or atleast the part that wasn't covered and the purring increases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kasmir we should be leaving now\" Petunia says pulling at her. Kasmir sighs and kisses you once before getting up \"I will see you after the mental competition\" Kasmir says leaving the room. You took Petunia's advice and stayed in your room as the day led on, Petunia brought you your midday meal and it did kind of suck as you wanted to go out and see Kasmir but you knew that you needed to be alive to win the competition. Later in the day Anthony came to your room and he read a message from ZigZag \"I am sorry that the jealousy of my people have confined you to your quarters, I am quite happy that my daughter has found somebody that she loves as much as you as to give you her ribbon. I expect great things from you during the mental trial and best of luck\" Anthony bowed after reading the message and left the room. You sighed and sat back in bed not having much to do you just stared at the ribbon and you went out onto the terrace and observed the forest below. A little while later Petunia showed up with your dinner and she gave you what a ring with a small topaz stone set in the center. \"Like the ribbon you are to wear it tomorrow for the competition, do not worry the mental competiton has each male in their own room\" Petunia says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how long after the mental competition is the pick?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right after\" Petunia says before leaving the room. You fell asleep that night somewhat tense but you clutched the ring and felt better.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Again you were woken up by Petunia but this time she shushed you as you get up. \"No one is supposed to be up yet but I need to get you to the starting area early so that no one attacks you\" she whispers. You nod and quickly get dressed in a shirt and some pants made out of cotton and follow her out the door, the castle was eerily quiet this early in the morning, every so often you'd see a servant rush past and they didn't even give a second glance as they passed you. You were led suprisingly to Zig's throne room \"this is where the competition starts and ends, that is all i'm allowed to tell you\" Petunia says. You nod and she leans over and you scratch her ears \"I could get used to this\" she sighs and you both waited there. Within 10 minutes ZigZag and Kasmir as well as the other contestants started to show up, within 15 minutes everyone was there. ZigZag stands up and looks over the contestants \"all of you have beaten the first trial but the second one is much more difficult, a king must be smart enough to take care of their kingdom as well as his wife\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that you are led by Petunia as well as the other contestants are led into a room. The room is lit only by candle and you heard the door seal as you entered, in the center of the room was what looked like lines as well as there was a constantly flowing stream of water. You had 3 small blocks and you almost laughed your head off, the big mental challenge was nothing more then a water diversion challenge. From the looks of it the answer was simple as could be, you faced harder puzzles in video games. You grabbed the blocks and quickly had them in place. You removed the partition holding the water back and it started to flow. Following the path you created the water flows swiftly and with precise accuracy, it fills what looks to you like just an empty pool. You jump as the bottom of the pool sinks and the door you had entered from creaks open. \"Holy shit I didn't know they had that kind of technology\" you think. You sprinted the whole way back to the throne room and as you entered the great hall suprisingly there was cheering from everyone. Zig walks over to a wall and pulls a lever, \"that's 6 doors that won't open until the end of the competition\" she says smiling at you. She then walks up and picks you up \"how did you figure that out so quickly?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense but i've faced harder puzzles on pretty much a daily basis\" you say. ZigZag smiles \"I wonder what would have happened if Max had stayed, we probably would have had a competition on our hands\" she says laughing. It took a few minutes for the next contestant to show up and again ZigZag pulls a lever. By the end ZigZag had pulled all the levers and making sure the count was correct she pulled the lever back up and told the servants to go and get the rest of the contestants. It took a few minutes but the other contestants joined the onlookers as ZigZag smiled at the rest of you. \"You have proven yourselves worthy to be picked by my daughter, now Princess Kasmir go and pick your husband\" ZigZag says gently pushing her forward. She walks up and starts examining everyone up and down or well just down in your case, she bends over and carefully grabs your hand so that no one else could see and you saw her smile as she saw the ring. She walks down to the end of the line and starts walking back having contestants do things like open their mouths or bend over and show their tails which kind of confused you. Finally she nods and walks up to ZigZag \"you've made your choice , already, are you sure?\" she says. Kasmir nods and ZigZag stands up \"the Princess has made her decision, to make sure that there are no, interferences with her choice all canidates will bow and shut their eyes. The one Kasmir picks will walk up with her to the throne\" ZigZag says. You like the rest of the contestants bowed and closed your eyes, you smiled a bit as it was like that old kid's game just with a much larger prize. You felt a paw on your shoulder and you grabbed it and stood up. There was a gasp from the crowd as you slowly followed Kasmir up to the throne and you opened your eyes to see her smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, our princess has chosen the outsider to be her king\" ZigZag says, you froze as each of the other contestants stood up and pulled out a sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My queen we cannot allow this\" the deer anthro from before said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Horn it is not your choice but my daughters, besides all of you lost before this even began\" ZigZag says picking you up. \"hold out your hand\" she whispers and Lord Horn has a look or pure shock on his face. \"That can't be, how did he get the royal signet\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gave it to him, as well as my ribbon before\" Kasmir says stepping forward. ZigZag smiles \"oh so now we have a full confession do we, I was wondering where it went\" ZigZag says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No..um...well...I\" Kasmir stammers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZigZag laughs \"it is his to wear now\" she says. Your lifted up to face level and she smiles \"you'll take good care of my daughter won't you?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing pleases me more then to see her happy\" you say bowing your head. ZigZag smiles and puts you down next to Kasmir who excitedly hugs you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The competition is complete and your new king has been chosen, this calls for a feast\" ZigZag says. Instantly the halls erupted into cheers and all the anthros except the competitors including Anthony and Petunia swarmed forward and started to congratulate both you and Kasmir. You were hoisted up by ZigZag \"now now you gotta remember the new king's kind of short\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming from Godzilla that's saying something\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey\" ZigZag says pinning you under a finger \"you sure have some nerve insulting the ruling queen\" ZigZag says but she's chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not an insult, it's a crack, besides why would I insult the mother of the most beautiful thing i've ever seen\" you say. Kasmir giggles and ZigZag puts you down though now she's smiling. Kasmir leads you once again to the dining hall yet this time she pulls you up after her as she climbs the ladder for her chair and sits you with her. The feast was incredible to say the least the creatures you could name were some sort of duck, a one of those sail boars and again some sort of rainbow fish. You and Kasmir were passed some sort of fruit drink but you almost felt a little tipsy after you drank it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, it's to give you lots of stamina, for later\" Kasmir whispers into your ear. You shivered a bit and she gently licked your cheek \"I knew you'd win, I just knew it\" she says. You nodded, the feast lasted for hours and then ZigZag stood up and smiled. \"Everyone it is time for the ritual, no one is allowed to follow me\" ZigZag says. She picks you and Kasmir up, one in each hand and walks back to the throne room. She pushes against the back of the throne and it disappears revealing a tunnel lit by torches. ZigZag puts the back of the throne back and walks down, you were however totally freaked. Zig walked down for a good few minutes until she reached a large room with a weird symbol in the center. The outside looked like a normal runic circle which was a circle with runes in the lines, but the center was some weird design. It almost looked like a sword planted down with wings on either side of it. ZigZag lifts both of you up \"I need to ask you both a question as you get to decided if this happens, do you want the ritual to happen or do you want Kasmir to stay the same size?\" she asks.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You just stood there for a few seconds, although Zig Zag had said it was up to the both of you, both her and Kasmir's gaze were fixed directly on you. It was a bit unnerving but you couldn't let it distract you, you thought about it for a few seconds weighing all the pros and cons you could think of before looking up at the both of them. <i>I really hope I'm not making a mistake</i>. \"Kasmir i'd like you to go through with the ceremony\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Why?\" she replies sounding almost hurt by your statement, you sighed knowing this wasn't going to be easy. You were just about to speak before she cut in \"why do you want me bigger? Is there something wrong with me now? I...I don't understand\" she says sounding frantic her eyes almost welling up with tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kasmir\" you say quietly and she stops a second. You slowly reach up to stroke her cheek and she leans down so you can stroke her. \"Kasmir...\" you pause and just take a second to stroke her waiting for her to settle down \"I love everything about you, my beautiful kitten, nothing about you needs to change, however this is something bigger than the both of us. Imagine something happened, and you needed this size, to protect your...our people, protect me, our children\" you say. Kasmir freezes as you say \"our children\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You...you'd still want me? Even if I was that big?\" she says fear evident in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I would, and do, Kasmir I don't care if you become 300 or 3000ft tall, I will always love you, no matter the size, or shape, as long as you stay you\" you say. Before you could move Kasmir hugged you tightly and started to purr, a deep rumbling purr that not only reverberated through her but also through you as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Mom, I think i'm ready\" Kasmir says. Displaying an extreme amount of dexterity Zig Zag gently separates the two of you and lifting Kasmir up placed her down in the center of the circle before stepping back out of it. She then started to chant, although it didn't sound like her, the voice sounded divine...literally. It was like nothing you had ever heard, gentle as the rays of the sun but at the same time it felt like this voice could move mountains if it wished. Slowly the circle started to glow, brighter and brighter until the light engulfed the whole room, although you had time to shut your eyes. When you opened your eyes again Kasmir was standing eye-to-eye with her mother, her own eyes closed. <br>\r\n\"Kasmir, Kasmir\" you call unsure if she was alright, slowly in response to her voice her eyes opened and she started examining the room, obviously a bit disoriented due to her new size. Her gaze fell back onto her mother and of course you \"well...how do I look?\" she asks spinning in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but smile up at her \"you look beautiful Kasmir\" you answer and she smiles. Her expression quickly changes to one of hesitation and you find the source, she was slowly lifting her arm, her obvious intent to pick you up. You waited as she slowly lifted her hand to in front of you the massive object shivering as she looked at you, you reach out your own hand and she ever so slowly moves forward till you felt her hand around you. Just as slowly and gently her fingers wrap around you and she lifts you off Zig Zag's paw and deposits you on her own a small smile spreading across her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time you two, my arm was going numb\" you nearly go flying as Kasmir jumps in fright but all you end up doing is turning a somersault in the air and landing back in her palm. Both of you had forgotten all about Zig Zag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom don't do that\" Kasmir shouts glaring at her mother. She looks down at you a little dazed from your flight but otherwise fine \"are you alright?\" she asks her muzzle quickly moving to almost poke you in the chest as she tried to look you over for injuries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine\" you reply, although you turn as you hear the sound of giggling. Suprisingly Zig Zag was standing there giggling like a little school girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww don't you two just make an adorable couple\" she says. \"I'm sorry about startling you, but it was just such a cute little moment between the two of you and my arm was starting to hurt\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry mom, I was just...\" \"worried that you'd hurt him? Controlling yourself at this size is hard, but you will learn in time\" ZigZag says smiling at her daughter. \"We do have to leave now, since the ritual is over\" Zig Zag says. She leads the way out with Kasmir following and she set the stone that had been removed back making the throne seem as if it was one solid piece again. \"So Kasmir do you need me to lead you to your new room?\" Zig Zag asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No mom, you showed me the way how many times\" Kasmir replies. With a final small wave Kasmir leaves with you along for the ride, she walks through the corridors of the castle for a couple minutes. Just as you were about to pipe up that you might be lost, she stops in front of a doorway. \"Here we go\" she says pushing the doors inward. The room before you was like nothing you had ever seen, the wall on your left had a large window taking up most of the space with a dresser and drawers standing on either side of it. On your right hand side was a mostly empty wall except for another doorway on the far side. Taking up the majority of the room was the largest bed you had ever seen, it was covered with a mound of pillows and silken sheet and looked like it could fit both Zig Zag and Kasmir at their current size comfortably. The wall opposite the door was taken up mostly by the headboard of the bed, as well as a small nightstand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" was all you could say as Kasmir walked into the room examining everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very nice isn't it, Mom had this room made for me on my 16th birthday, although it took till my 20th to be finished\" Kasmir says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, how old are you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasmir lets out an audible gasp before gently lifting you up to her face \"you do know your not supposed to ask a lady her age don't you?\" she says,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes....so how old are you, come on tell me it's not like i'm going to leave you\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasmir sighs \"fine i'm....21\" she says a meek smile on her features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young and beautiful\" you reply a small smile spreading across Kasmir's features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well mister, just how old are you?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...younger than that\" you reply suddenly feeling embarassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I told you how old I am, you have to tell me\" Kasmir says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or what?\" you reply staring up at her in defiance. Kasmir walks over to the bed and carefully drops you onto the sheets, before you can get up she pins you under a finger and starts tickling you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or I'm not going to stop\" she says from above you, she kept up her \"torture\" for a full minute before picking you back up \"ready to talk yet?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine...fine\" you say between fits of giggles \"20, are you happy?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's through the other doorway?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just our private bath\" Kasmir replies. She then slowly lifts you up to face level \"would you mind..if I kissed you?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not, why do you ask?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm just a bit...\" she stopped as you stood there tapping your foot \"just hurry up and kiss me\" you say. You saw her smile and she gently leaned down her lips pressing ever so gently against you as you kissed what you could of her lips in return. The kiss broke and you saw Kasmir smile as she spoke again \"you do know that we are officially mated now\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, and I couldn't be happier\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well tradition states....I mean you basically said you wanted kids with me...I mean...\" you couldn't believe that Kasmir was so flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kasmir I would love to be your bed companion tonight\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I don't want you in my bed I want you in me\" she says freezing as she realized what she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bust out laughing \"well that's what I meant, but I don't think I could say no now that you've been so forward, just be gentle\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw the inside of Kasmir's ears pink \"I will\" she says.</span></div></div>",

I like him too, but it is forbidden. I'm not normally a rules person, but this is a big one. Now, I don't want to hear any more about this, understand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasmir's ears drooped, and she had a sad look on her face. \"Yes, mother.\" Zig Zag put her back down. \"Good. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some new decrees to take care of.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasmir trudged off, head down, tail dragging behind her. You followed her, hoping to comfort her. You called to her a few times, but she didn't answer.She turned and walked through a door, closing it behind her. You guessed this must be her room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear muffled crying coming from behind the door. She must be really upset. You plan to come back here later and try to make her feel better about all this. You make your way back through the halls to the throne room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZig Zag is still there, dictating a new law to a scribe. \"And furthermore.........\" She notices you coming in. \"I'll get back to you Lawrence. Go take a break.\" The scribe bows and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do you like the Island?\" She asks. \"Oh, it's beautiful.\" You say. \"I just hope Kasmir will be alright.\" Zig Zag nods. \"Don't worry, she will be. She'll eventually come to understand that I must stick to my duties as empress, and we can't go against tradition.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gets up from her throne , picks you up, and puts you on her shoulder. \"Where are we going?\" You ask. \"To dinner. You must be hungry after all you've been through.\" She brings you to a grand dinning hall, big enough for perhaps the whole island to eat in. There, at the head of an long table sits a huge bowl of fruit. Zig Zag sits in the grand chair in front of that bowl and picks out  a strange green fruit in the shape of a pyramid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she eats it, she picks up a round orange one that to her is the size of a grape, but to you it's a big as a beach ball. She hands it to you. \"Eat up.\" You hold the fruit in both hands and take a bite. It tasted like a cross between an orange and a strawberry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the next hour or so telling each other about your own cultures. \"So this \"electricity\", you use it to power a box that contains moving pictures?\" She asks. \"Yes. It's called television.\" \"Fascinating.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, you are given your own room to sleep in. The bed is much larger than you, so you have plenty of room. Zig Zag provided you with a silk robe to sleep in, which was very comfy. You lay there for a couple hours waiting until you're sure everyone is asleep. When you are, you sneak out through the halls to Kasmir's room.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quietly push the door open. Inside, Kasmir lay asleep, curled up under her silk sheets. You silently make you way to the head of her bed. She looks so peaceful asleep. You reach out your hand and gently brush her cheek. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes shoot open. She wasn't even asleep. Even in the pale light coming through the windows, she knows it's you. She throws her sheets off and grabs you, embracing you to her tightly. \"I don't care what my mother says.\" She says. \"I'll find a way to be with you if it's the last thing I do.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach around and rub her back. \"But how?\" You ask. \"I don't know, but I swear I will find a way.\" You crawl in with bed with her and hug her. \"Care to join me in for a bath?\" She asks seductively. \"I don't think we could get to the baths without getting caught.\" you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles. \"No, not that kind of bath.\" She takes the rest of her sheets off, and you realize she sleeps nude. Her belly and chest were as white as her stripes. She turns you around and warps her legs around you. She takes your robe off and beings licking you like you were her cub, starting with the top of you head. You sit there and let her clean you. Her rough tongue tickles your skin and she makes her way down your back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I want you to scratch me.\" She says when she finishes. She lays on her stomach and you scratch her back, causing her to purr. \"Mmmmmm, that feels so good.\" She sighs happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter half an hour or so of scratching, you lay next to her. You wrap your arm around her, she wraps her tail around you. She licks your face affectionately. \"Good night, my love.\" She whispers. \"Good night, my queen.\" You whisper back. You faall asleep to the sound of Kasmir's purring.</span></div></div>",

But she stays asleep. You say her name, still nothing. Then you get an idea. You slide your hand under the sheets and tickle her belly. She wakes up giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ticklish are we?\" You ask slyly. \" Maybe. What about you?\" She asks smirking. \"Uh.....no, not at all.\" You say nervously. \"Really? I can tell you're lying. And when you lie to me, there's consequences!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shoves her hands beneath your arms and tickles your pits. You thrash around laughing, Kasmir clearly enjoying this. After five minutes of this she stops. \"You better get out of here now. Before someone catches you in here with me.\" You nod and pull your robe back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you slip out the door, Kasmir blows you a kiss. You blow one back, and disappear.

Where were you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I just decided to go for a walk.\" You say. \"Well, come with me, the empress wants to see you.\" You follow her to the dinning hall, here Zig Zag sits, eating breakfast. \"Good morning.\" She says.

She hands you a bamboo chute that you use as a straw, to suck up the yolk from the eggs on her plate. You eat a piece of egg white as you continue talking. \"So, any plans for today?\" She asks you. \"Not really.\" You say. \"What do you guys do for fun around here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you spend the day with Kasmir?\" She suggests. \"I thought you didn't want us together.\" You say. \"I never said that.\" She says smiling. \"I said she couldn't marry you.

You knock on the door, and here what sounds like shuffling and scrambling inside the room. \"Just a Second!\" Calls Kasmir. \"Come in!\" She says.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the door, there's Kasmir on her bed, reading a scroll. \"Oh, it's you.\" She says relieved. \"What was all that noise?\" You ask. Kasmir hesitates. \"I'll show you, but you have to swear to not tell anyone.\" She says. \"I swear.\" You say. She lays the scroll she was reading on the bed, gets up, reaches under the bed, and pulls out several other scrolls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are these?\"You ask. \"Spells.\" Says Kasmir. \"I've secretly been studying magic.\" \"Your people know magic?\" You ask, stunned. \"Only a few of us do.\" She says. \"Those who do are mostly healers  and such. Mom says it's too dangerous, but I wanted to learn it so I could help the people more when I was queen. For example, this entire island is enchanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is?\" You ask. \"Oh yes.\" Says Kasmir. \"We actually have our own language. But the island is enchanted so that you understand what we're saying. Also haven't you wondered why your kind has never discovered this place, other than the occasional castaway? That's because the island is enchanted, so that from above or from a distance, it just looks like a empty spot of ocean, surrounded by huge jagged rocks. So anyone sailing or flying by wouldn't dare  come near, or even see the island.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know humans can fly?\" You ask. \"Yes. I've been able to see much about your world through magic. Airplanes, I believe they're called.\" You nod. \"Yeah, that's it. What else do you know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that your kind can't even go one decade with being in a war of some kind.\" She says, sadly. \"I swear, you humans are so violent.\" \"Well, not all of us.\" You say. \"We're constantly at war with each other because we all have different views on how things should be done, and different beliefs. I wish we could have peace, but the world is full of people who think things should be done their way, and only their way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasmir nods. \"It's sad, isn't it?\" You nod. Then, there's a knock on the door. Kasmir quickly shoves the scroll back under her bed. \"Come in!\" A servant comes in, carrying a tray of fruit. \"Your breakfast, my liege.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Winston. You are dismissed.\" The servant bowed and left. Kasmir laid the tray on her bed. She sat in front of it and stared at it. \"Everyday, it's always fruit. I think I'll make it more interesting. I'll turn it into some of the food your people eat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can do that?\" You ask. \"Yeah. All I need to do is concentrate on what I want it to be.\" You stares at the food, a look of great focus on her face. There is a bright flash! When it clears, where once was a bowl of fruit, there is now a stack of pancakes. \"Oops. Forgot something.\" She stares at the panckaes again, and they are covered with butter and syrup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snaps her fingers and a fork appears in her hands. She begins to eat. \"Mmmmmm! This is delicious! I can't wait until we get back to your land, then I can eat like this all the time!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Your gonna love all the food we have.\" You say. \"If you think pancakes are good, wait until you try and omelet.\" \"What's that?\" Kasmir asks. \"It's kind of like an egg pancake filled with cheese.\" Kasmir licks her lips at that. \"I've never had cheese, but it already sounds good.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of getting back home, have you figured out a way for you to come with?\"You ask. \"I think I might have something.\" She says. \"Would you like anything?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thanks, I already ate.\" You reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spend the next hour or so talking about her abilities. \"So what else can you do?\" You ask. \"Oh, lots of things.\" She says. \"I can make things move without touching them, make things disappear and reappear, light fires with my fingertips, a whole bunch of stuff. I can even see through time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See through time?\" You ask. \"Sure. I can't travel through time, that's too risky, but I can see what has happened in the past. It is possible to see the future, but I prefer not to. I'd rather be surprised. Would you like to see?\"        <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She continued reading as the dot grew larger and wider, until a glowing blue disc hung in the air in front of you. The disc began to shimmer like water, as a image began to become visible inside it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as though you were watching a TV screen, you saw Zig Zag, at normal anthro height, laying on her bed, a small bundle in her arms. Next to her knelt an anthro tiger, holding her hand and smiling. They were both looking down at the bundle, tears of joy in their eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blanket fell away from the bundle's face, and now you could see it clearly. It was a baby Kasmir, sound asleep in her mother's arms. \"She's so beautiful.\" Said Zig Zag, smiling. The tiger nodded. \"Just like her mother.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice of screen, which you assumed was whoever helped deliver the baby, said \"What are you going to name her?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kasmir. That seems fitting.\" Said Zig Zag. Kasmir's eyes slowly opened and she began crying. \"Shhhhhhhhhhh.\" Zig Zag said. \"Mommy's here. Don't cry.\" She lifted Kasmir to her shoulder and patted her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned and looked at Kasmir in the present. \"You were so cute as a baby.\" Even beneath her fur, you could tell she was blushing. \"But you're even cuter now.\" You add. She blushes even deeper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what was your father's name?\" You ask. She shook her head. \"I don't know.\" She said. \"He died when I was very young, so I don't have any memories of him. I never asked mom either. We always just called him Dad.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded. \"Anything else you want to see?\" She asked.      </span></div></div>",

How about we head to the shore? I always love it there.\" You agree, and you both head out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you exit the palace, four servants come up, carrying Kasmir's mobile bed. \"Not today boys.\" She says. \"I fell like walking this time.\" She dismisses and you both continue on your way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you make your way through the market, you become lost. Being half the size of the island's citizens, you can't see anything in front of you but legs. Kasmir picks your up and sits you on her shoulder. She puts her fingers in her mouth and gives a loud whistle. The crowd instantly clears a path, that she calmly walks through, with you sitting on her shoulder like a parrot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both leave the city, and enter the jungle. As Kasmir walks through the brush, you pass a group of anthros cutting down trees and lashing them together, another was tying cloth around sticks, making a sail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be my boat.\" You say. Kasmir nods. \"It looks like they're almost done too. Which means soon, we'll be together forever.\" She almost seems to skip as she says this. \"Speaking of which, how exactly do you plan to smuggle yourself off the island with me?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasmir smiles. \"Oh, you'll just have to wait and see.\" She says playfully. You both exit the jungle, coming out on to a white sandy beach. Kasmir picks you up off her shoulder and places you on the ground. The warm sand feels so inviting on your bare feet. You turn around to see Kasmir pulling her gown over her head. She wore nothing underneath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though you had seen everything already, you still turn the other way to give her some privacy. Kasmir smiles. \"Oh, come now. You don't need to do that. After all, you'll be seeing me like this a lot when we're back in your world.\" She turns you around, and you find yourself staring at her shapely body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirks. \"Like what you see.\" You nod. \"Yeah.....uh......very nice.\" Kasmir giggles. \"Really? How's this?\" She begins posing seductively, swaying her hips and sticking out her tongue cutely. You face turn a bright red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasmir laughs. \"Come on, let's go!\" She starts heading toward the water, you follow. She sits on the edge of the beach, allowing the waves to wash back and forth over her legs. You sit next to her and lay back in the sand, enjoying the heat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, you decide to play around with Kasmir a bit. You get up and go over to her thigh. \"What are you doing?\" She asks. You don't answer. Instead you begin massaging her leg. She lets out a mewl of surprise and begins purring. You move up to her belly and begin scratching vigorously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lets out a loud yowl of pleasure, and lays back in the sand, letting you continue. As you keep scratching her midriff, she continues yowling, her tongue loling from her mouth, as she pants and purrs. Finally, you stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was fantastic!\" She says, sitting back up. \"Glad you liked it.\" You say, resting your now sore arms. \"When I'm back home, I can do that all the time.\" Kasmir lays down next to you, and begins nuzzling and licking you affectionately. \"Can't wait for it.\" She says. You give her a kiss on the lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls her head back, surprised. \"What was that?\" She asked. \"A kiss.\" You say. \"It's how humans show they love each other.\" Kasmir smirks and kisses you on the head. \"I love you too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both lay there, locked in another kiss for a good ten minutes before you break it.       </span></div></div>",

You had gathered some wood piled it in front of you, while Kasmir lit it with a snap of her fingers, the orange flames dancing in front of you both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't they beautiful?\" Asked Kasmir as she gazed at the stars. \"Oh yes, very.\" You say. \"But I've seen prettier.\" Kasmir looks down at you. \"Like what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You.\" You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasmir giggles and pets your head. \"You're so sweet. That's why I love you.\" Just then, your stomach growls. \"Hungry?\" Kasmir asks. \"Kind of.\" You say. I haven't eaten since breakfast.\" Kasmir smiles. \"Well then, I'll get us some dinner.\" She snaps her fingers, and two large salmon fly out of the sea, into her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" you say. \"You put the Gortan's Fisherman to shame.\" \"Who?\" Asks Kasmir. \"Never mind.\" Kasmir nimbly guts, bones and skins the fish with her claws, and soon you're both roasting them on sticks over the fire. \"Where did you learn to do that?\"  You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I used to catch fish a lot.\" Says Kasmir. \"I am feline after all. I once caught one as long as my arm!\" Yeah, right.\" You say, not believing her. \"It's true!\" She says. \"Ask my mom! She saw it! Of course, she was normal sized then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next hour or so, you both sit there, eating your fish and just talking. \"So, did you ever love anyone before me?\" Asks Kasmir. \"Why?\" You ask. \"Just curious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh. \"I thought I did. Didn't turn out so well.\" \"Want to tell me about it?\" She asks. \"No.\" You say. \"I can't. It's too painful.\" Kasmir stared at you for a minute, not saying anything, until........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her name was Jessica.\" She says. \"You had known her since childhood. You went to school together, played together, and shared your first kiss together. You started dating at 16, then found out she was only using you to get another guy jealous, and it worked. That other guy gave you a black eye, and since then you've never trusted another woman.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at her with your mouth open, dumbfounded. \"How did you!?\" She grinned. \"Magic, remember? I can read minds too.\" \"Man, I can keep anything from you, can I?\" You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" She says, chuckling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what made you decide to talk to me when we met if you don't trust females?\" She asks. \"Well, I guess because you're not human.\" You say. She looks at you confused. \"What does that have to do with it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've always related to animals better than people.\" You say. \"I used to have a cat for company at home. He was all the company I needed. I would sometimes even talk to him. When he died, I felt like I had lost my only friend, which I had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, all your life your only real friends have been your pets?\" Asks Kasmir. \"Yeah, I guess.\" You say. \"Kasmir smiles. \"Some of your people might call that pathetic, but I think it's sweet.\" \"You smirk. \"Yeah, well, I don't care what other people think.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Except me, right?\" Asks Kasmir. \"Of course.\" You say. Kasmir looks up at the moon. \"Oh! We better head back now, it's getting late.\" She slips her clothes back on and places you on her shoulder, striding through the jungle. The cool night air relaxes you, could could fall asleep right here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get back to the palace, you are greeted by Zig Zag. \"Good news!\" She says. \"Your boat is finished! We can send you back home tomorrow.\" You pretend to be disappointed. \"That's too bad.\" You say. \"I was really enjoying it here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZig Zag smiles kindly. \"Don't worry.\" She says. \"When I erase your memories of this place, I'll replace them with happy ones. I promise.\" \"Mom.\" Says Kasmir. \"Since the is the last time I'll see him, can he share my bed with me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends.\" Says Zig Zag suspiciously. \"You don't plan on doing what I think you are, do you?\" \"No! Of course not!\" Says Kasmir indignantly. \"Can't you even trust your own daughter?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" Says Zig Zag. \"But he better not be covered with claw marks in the morning like the last one.\" Kasmir carries you to her room and locks the door, setting you on the bed. \"Just think!\" She says as she slides her gown off and crawl in next to you. \"Tomorrow, we can be together forever.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But won't your mother notice you are gone?\" You ask. \"Well, by then it will be too late.\" She says. \"I'll be long gone. She'll miss me, sure, but she's more than capable of having another daughter to replace me. I'm willing to give up my kingdom, all for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulls you over to her, wrapping her arm and tail around you. \"Besides, You're worth more than any kingdom.\" She kisses your forehead, and purrs as you stroke her back. \"Goodnight, my love.\" You say. \"Goodnight, my prince.\" She says as you both fall asleep.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were at the table with Zig Zag, eating breakfast, when she said. \" Well, it's time. You might want to say good bye to Kasmir. I know she still has a thing for you, and she'd be heartbroken if you didn't at least say goodbye.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea.\" You say. Zig Zag places you on the floor and you make your way to Kasmir's room. You knock on her door. \"Who is it?\" She calls. \"It's me.\" You say. \"Come in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open the door, the stands Kasmir holding something beghind her back. \"Alright, Kasmir.\" You say. \"It's time for me to leave. So If you have a plan, tell me it now.\" Kasmir pulls out two vials from behind her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These right here are my plan.\" She says smiling deviously. \"What are they?\" You ask. \" They're potions. \"This one.....\" She indicated the blue vial. \"Will allow me to change myself at will, from my normal form into that of those cats your kind keeps as pets. This way, people won't discover what I really am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about, your.......you know, fur?\" You ask. \"You can tell anyone who asks that I'm a new breed of cat, and that you recently took me in.\" She indicated the clear potion. \"This one, is what will allow me to leave with you. It will let me control my size so I can shrink to a small enough size that you can fit me in your pocket. Mom will be none the wiser!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's your plan, then?\" You ask. \"Yep.\" She says. \"It's simple, yet foolproof! Here it goes.\" She down both potions, and pauses. Soon, her clothes begin looking like they are a bit large for her, then, way too big. Her entire body gets smaller and smaller, until she is swallowed by her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothes lay in a pile on the floor. You pick them up, and there stands a miniature Kasmir, completely naked. You close your eyes as you pick her up, wanting to give her some privacy. \"Oh come now.\" She says. \"You've already seen it, there's no need block yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at her. She was now no bigger than a lego figure, making her look kind of cute. \"Wait, what about wiping my memory? I won't remember the plan, or you even.\" You say, just realizing that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry.\" Says Kasmir. \"I'll take care of that, but we should get going.\" You nod, slipping Kasmir into your pocket. You head back out into the throne room, where Zig Zag is waiting. \"How did it go?\" She asks. \"She'll be okay.\" you say. \"She dosen't want to watch me off, she can't take the sight of it. She's still crying, but she'll get over it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know she will.\" Says Zig Zag. \"I know just how she feels, I've seen many loves come and go. Now, let's get going.\" She picks you up and places you in her palm. As she leaves the palace, what seems like the whole Island follows her to the beach. There on the sand is a large log raft with a single sail in the center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZig Zag picks up the boat with her other hand and walks out into the ocean, while the crowd watches from the shore. When the water is up to her waist, she places you on the raft and gently sets it in the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, little one.\" She says. \"This is where we bid each other goodbye. I wish you a safe journey.\" You nod. \"Thank you for everything. Hug Kasmir for me will you?\" You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZig Zag Smiles. \"I will. Now, you know what I must do.\" She touches you on the forhead with her finger. There is a blue spark as she touches you, and you fall unconscious on the raft. Zig Zag gives you a gentle push, sending you on your way. \"Farewell, little one.\" A single tear rolls down her face and splashes in the ocean. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes. You're laying on a raft in the middle of the ocean, the sun shining down on you, tanning your skin. \"Must have dozed off.\" You say to yourself. You begin to remember how you got here. You had been shipwrecked in a storm and ended up washed up on an island. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a time, it was kind of fun, having an entire island to yourself. But soon you got bored and lonely, and were able to construct a raft out of fallen logs, you couldn't remember where you got the sail from. You feel something squirming in your pocket. \"What the?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach  into your pocket and are surprised at what you find. there in your palm, is a tiny cat creature, with black fur and white stripes. \"Miss me?\" The strange creature asks. \"What are you?\" You ask, dumbfounded. \"Bring me closer and I'll tell you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou held the tiny creature up to your face. Suddenly, kisses you on the lips. Everything comes flooding back at that instant. The Island. Zig Zag. Kasmir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasmir................<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasmir begins growing back to her normal height, amused at the shocked look on your face. But, at her full height, the raft is too small for her, so she shrinks down to your size. You remember everything, including her plan. \"Kasmir. Now I remember.\" She smiles, showing her gleaming white fangs. \"I told you it would work. Now, you're all mine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe crawl over and kneels over you, forcing her lips into yours. You kiss back, wrestling with her tongue. You had no Idea how long it would take to get home, but as long as you were with Kasmir, it didn't matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You had plenty to eat, with Kasmir summoning fish to fly from the sea onto the raft, then changing them into whatever you wanted with her magic. She would turn the sea water into whatever you wanted to drink as well. You sort of hoped you never got back to land, if it meant you could just be at sea with Kasmir, forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo pass the time, you and Kasmir would just chat with each other. \"So, what are we going to do when we get back to your home?\" Kasmir asks you. \"The first thing I'm going to do....\" You say. \"Is go to the pet shop. I need to get a few things if you're going to be my pet.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasmir scowled. \"I am not a pet! I am your mate. We only want to people to think I'm your pet, when really, I'm anything but.\" You laugh. \"Really? Then if you're not my pet, you wouldn't like it when I do this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached up and scratched Kasmir behind the ears. You could see her resisting the urge to purr. You scratched vigorously, until finally she gave in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, maybe I am your pet.........but only in my normal cat form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled, and began scratching her back. Kasmir purred loudly and laid out across your lap as you scratched her. \u201cI love you.\u201d You say to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leans up and licks your cheek. \u201cI love you too.\u201d Suddenly, she does something unexpected. She bites you semi-hard on the neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw!\u201d You cry, startled by the sudden pain, jumping back and covering the spot she bit with your hand. \u201cWhat was that for?!\u201d You say, suddenly angry. \u201cWhat?\u201d Says Kasmir. \u201cIt was only a love bite.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, next time, warn me.\u201d You feel a trickle of blood running down your neck. Kasmir\u2019s eyes widen at the scent of blood. \u201cOh no! Did I hurt you?\u201d She says, suddenly worried. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d You say, wiping the blood away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance, you can see a land forming on the horizon. \u201cWe\u2019re home!\u201d You say, suddenly forgetting about the bite. You turn to Kasmir. \u201cYou better change into a normal cat awhile. Don\u2019t want anyone spotting you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kasmir nods and begins to change. Her body shrinks down to the size of a mailbox. Her white her seems to retract back into her scalp. Her arms and legs become that of a housecat\u2019s, with her hands and feet becoming paws.  There she sits, a tabby cat with black, white striped cat with a white belly and head, with her muzzle and the bridge of her nose being black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gives off a little mew as she jumps into your arms. You hold her close to you as you sail ever closer to land. You come ashore on an empty beach, which was lucky, because you  wouldn\u2019t have to answer any awkward questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven luckier, you landed in Miami, which is exactly where you live. You step off the raft, Kasmir in your arms and make your way up the beach. When you turn around, the raft is nowhere in sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know the neighborhood well, and have no problem finding your apartment building. You open the door with your key, (yes, you still had your house key this whole time) and step inside. Kasmir leaps from your arms onto the sofa, and changes back into anthro form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, this is how humans live?\u201d She asks, spreading out on the couch and yawning. \u201cWell, it\u2019s how I live at least.\u201d You say, as you move about closing all the blinds and curtains, so that no one who happened to be looking through the window would see Kasmir. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I\u2019m going to the store, you stay here, don\u2019t answer the door, and stay away from the windows, and just watch TV.\u201d You say handing her the remote. \u201cOkay, daddy.\u201d Kasmir says jokingly as she flips through the channels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou head to the pet shop and buy a cat carrier, a scratching post, litterbox, and whatever else you would need. The cashier smiles at you. \u201cTaking in a kitty?\u201d She asks. \u201cYou could say that.\u201d You say. You load everything into your car and head back to your apartment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you come in the door, Kasmir is watching a some anime show. \u201cAre all TV shows this weird?\u201d She asks. \u201cOnly the ones that are produced in Japan.\u201d You reply as you put your purchases away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided to order pizza for dinner. Kasmir had never had any before and was curious to try it. You ordered a large with half anchovies and half sausage. Kasmir found that she loved it, particularly the little fishes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Kasmir curled up in bed with you in her cat form, to give you so you both would have more room. She purred all night as you stroked her, until she finally fell asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 1: That bite Kasmir gave you earlier seems to be having strange affects on you. Somehow, you are slowly becoming an anthro cat yourself. Including fur, claws, and a taste for fish. Good luck explaining that to the neighbors! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOption 2: For a few weeks all goes well for you and Kasmir. But you have been seeing a lot of animals that you wouldn\u2019t normally see around here. Unknown to you, they are in fact anthros from the island in normal form. Zig Zag was very angry with her daughter abandoning them like that, and has sent them to get her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

But you brushed it off assuming that it was just from Kasmir sleeping with you. So you went to your bathroom to brush your hair before Kasmir got up, and that's when you noticed what was different. YOU HAD A TAIL! You looked at it in amazement, then confusion, and finally you panicked not knowing what to do. You yelled for Kasmir to come in the bathroom and you heard her get up and start to walk to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want to talk a bath this early in the day? Well thats fine with me.\" Kasmir says walking into the bathroom without even noticing your new tail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kasmir what did you do to me?\" You ask her. She is confused by the question and then looks at you and see's the tail behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a...?\" Kasmir trys to say the full sentence but fails to, but you answer her question anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup it is a tail. Now answer my question, did you do something to me?\" You ask her this again and then you see guilt all over her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... When I gave you that \" love bite\" my saliva might have gotten into the cut. I think that since some of my DNA got into you, that its trying to fix anything it thinks is wrong, and it must think that something is wrong since it gave you a tail...\" Kasmir says this all rather quickly and you could just barley keep up with what she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let me get this straight... I'm going to turn into an Anthro like you?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I'm not sure how long it will take though.\" Says this with a faint smile like she was enjoying this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how am I going to explain this to the neighbors?\" You ask Kasmir when just then their is a nock at the door. You jump at first and then you panic, and so does Kasmir. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" You yell just to see if it was someone who you knew. Then a voice answered back.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It\u2019s been several weeks since Kasmir moved in with you. She\u2019s learned quite a bit about the human world. You taught her how to use the computer and stove so she could feed and entertain herself while you were at work. One time she had gone on Google and typed in her mother\u2019s name to see what would come up. To her surprise, there were several pictures of her. You never told her about how humans knew about Zig Zag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can this be?\u201d She said. \u201cAnd are all humans this perverted?\u201d You chuckled. \u201cI forgot to tell you that here, Zig Zag is a fictional character. As to the second question, only most of the males.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a feline, Kasmir was naturally curious about many things, a trait of hers that tended to get her into trouble. Like when she found the six-pack you keep in your fridge while you were away. When you came home, you found her passed out on the floor, she only drank one can. Kasmir\u2019s body clearly couldn\u2019t handle alcohol. She was too used to the wine the amazons drank, which was non-alcoholic. When she woke up, she had a very painful headache, and even the slightest noise was like a thunderclap to her. You laid her out on the sofa with an icepack on her forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spent the whole day there, groaning in pain. After that, she never drank anything but water. You also taught her how to play video games. It turns out she was very good at them, as she would always whip your ass at Super Smash Bros. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also seemed to like human music, particularly Ozzy Osbourne, Kid Rock, Metallica, and Voltaire. Kasmir soon became bored with being stuck in the house all day, and wanted to go outside. You had refused at first, but gave in after Kasmir licked and nuzzled you for several minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had bought her a collar and leash. At first she had refused to wear it, but you were firm with her, saying that if she didn\u2019t put it on, she wasn\u2019t going anywhere. With a sigh of frustration, she reverted to her cat form, and allowed you to clip the collar around her neck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou led her around town, with everybody you passed staring at Kasmir and her unusual fur pattern. Some of them even approached you and asked where you got her. You told them that your parents work at an animal shelter and that they bred Kasmir themselves, that they named her \u201cKriss-Kross\u201c, and gave her to you as a gift. You let them stroke Kasmir and scratch her ears. Kasmir certainly seemed to be enjoying all the attention, purring up a storm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been sunset when you took Kasmir for a walk, so it was dark by the time you got back to your apartment. As you approached the front door, you saw a fox and a skunk rummaging through the garbage cans near the entrance, that they had knocked over. They turn and stare in your direction for a moment before running off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOdd.\u201d You think to yourself. \u201cSince when were there skunks and foxes around Miami?\u201d You put the thought out of your head and head into the building, Kasmir at your side.  After you get to your apartment and close the door, Kasmir changes into her anthro form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell!\u201d She says. \u201cThat was certainly fun!\u201d You smile. \u201cYou just liked all the extra attention.\u201d Kasmir smiles back. \u201cIs that so wrong? By the way, I liked the explanation you gave those people about me. How did you come up with the name \u201cKriss-Kross\u201d? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d You say. \u201cYour mother is called \u201cZig Zag\u201d for her fur pattern, so I did the same for you. Since you two have striped fur, I came up with Kriss-Kross to counteract with Zig Zag.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasmir nods. \u201cVery clever.\u201d She scratches at her neck. \u201cCan you take this accursed collar off now? It itches!\u201d You take off her collar and she licks you in thanks. She yawns, showing her white fangs. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for bed.\u201d You say. Kasmir nods, reverting to her cat from again.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk towards your bedroom, Kasmir following briskly at your heels. You don\u2019t bother to change into pajamas, and just lay down on your bed. Kasmir leaps up onto the bed and curls up on your chest. You stroke her as she softly purrs to sleep. A few hours later, you are woken by the sound of voices coming from your living room. \u201c  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you ssssssssure thisssssss isssssss where they are?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbsolutely. We saw them here earlier.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe must be here. Who else could it be?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat of the boy? What shall we do with him?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully lift Kasmir off your chest and lay her on your pillow. You reach under your bed and grab the shotgun you store there for emergencies. You slowly step into the living room. You aim the shotgun in front of you and feel for the light switch. As you do, the voices continue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI say we take him with us. He should be punished as well.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if he didn\u2019t know she was with him?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow could he have not?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally find the switch and flick it on. When the lights activate, you are stunned by what you see. Standing in your living room in a circle, is four amazons! A snake, a skunk, a fox, and a wolf, all dressed in leather bras and skirts, except the snake who had no legs, only a long serpent tail. They each held various weapons. Spears, knives, arrows, etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could react, the fox raised a blowgun to her lips and fired a small black thorn, which struck you in the neck. You felt a sudden sting of pain, then everything went black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you awoke,   your hands and feet were tied behind your back. You lay on your side on the floor, the four intruders gathered in front of you. You noticed much of your furniture had been overturned as you heard yowling and hissing noises coming from the cat carrier the fox was holding at her side. They had captured Kasmir. <br>\r\n\u201cEmpress Zig Zag was furious when she discovered Kasmir was gone.\u201d Said the skunk looking down at you. \u201cShe sent us to bring her back home. We\u2019ve been looking across this strange land for weeks. You have no idea what a chase she put up after we knocked you out.\u201d \u201cHow did you find us?\u201d You ask, confused.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunk smirked. \u201cYou saw us yourselves picking through your garbage.\u201d You couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cThat was you? But how-\u201d \u201cWe were given potions that allow us to change our form at will.\u201d The fox cuts you off. \u201cAfter we saw you enter here, we knew this was where you were hiding the princess. It was just a matter of following your scent to the right door.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou will sssssssurely be punissssssshed for kidnapping the princessssssss.\u201d Hisses the snake. Suddenly, the cat carrier in the vixen\u2019s hand explodes, sending shrapnel everywhere, as Kasmir changes back into her full anthro form. The other amazons duck and shield themselves as the bits of plastic fly in every direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe did not kidnap me!\u201d Says Kasmir angrily. \u201cI wanted him to bring me with him. I loved him, and would rather give up my position as heir to the throne and be with him, than never see him again. As your princess, I order you to go home and tell my mother I am staying here, and that\u2018s final!\u201d The amazons stand back up, and the wolf approaches Kasmir. \u201cYour highness, our orders are to bring you back to Anthronia. The queen\u2019s orders are above yours, so you must come with us.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Says Kasmir. \u201cI am not going anywhere. This is my decision, my love, and my home. No one, can make me leave!\u201d The snake grabs your head and tilts it back, exposing your throat. \u201cCome with ussssssss or I ssssssshall bite him!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait!\u201d Says Kasmir, raising one hand in alarm. \u201cWe are sorry princess.\u201d Says the skunk. \u201cBut if this is the only way to get you to come with us, then so be it.\u201d Kasmir\u2019s eyes dart from you to the snake, who hovers over you, fangs exposed, dripping venom onto your face. You close your eyes, lest the burning poison blind you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasmir hesitates. She could easily dispatch these amazons with her magic skills, but could she do it faster than this snake can bite?</span></div></div>",

You couldn't take it anymore. You say a short prayer and go grab your shotgun and load it with one round. You then put the barrel of the gun just underneath your head. Then as your about to pull the trigger the gun gets yanked from your hands, leaving you clueless to what just happened. You look to your left and see an Anthro fox holding your shotgun in one hand and a spear in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What were you doing?\" She asks with a caring voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't take it anymore... A life without Kasmir... Is a life not worth living...\" You say this with a very shaky voice. You then start to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you were going to kill yourself?\" The fox asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it ment I could watch Kasmir from Heaven or Hell... Then yes... I was going to kill myself.\" You say this and get up. You look at the fox and try to grab your gun from her but she just throws it into your living room and blocks the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was sent her by Kasmir to make sure that you were alright... But it seems you are emotionally crippled... I will go to the queen and tell her what has happened here and I will try to get her to change her mind. Now if you don't mind try not to kill yourself until I come back with the news.\" She smiles at you and then leaves. You look at the shotgun on the ground and grab it. You then unload it and put it under your bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few days go by and still now word from the fox that stopped you from suicide. Then you heard something at your door. It sounded like an animal scratching a tree or something like that. You then realized that it was the fox out their trying to get your attention. You quickly opened the door and to your suprize their was to animals standing at your door. A fox and a black and white striped skunk. You knew immediately that it was Zig Zag. You let them both in and they change into their normal forms, except Zig Zag who only grew to human height. They both stared at you for about a minute until Zig Zag spoke to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was told that you tryed to kill yourself just to see my daughter in your afterlife. Is this true?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is Zig Zag. All I can think about is your daughter. She has my heart and I have hers and no one can change that.\" You say sternly to Zig Zag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then... I think we can do something to help ease your suffering.\" Zig Zag smiles and then she starts to walk towards you. You start to run for the door thinking that she was going to erase your memory once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now theirs no need to run. I am not going to hurt you.\" Says Zig Zag. You stop when she says this and you turn to say something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do then?\" You ask nervously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Zig Zag says is \"You'll see.\" And then it all goes blank. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout an hour later you wake up to see Kasmir's face. You try to speak to her but you can't even make a sound. So you decide to rub her cheek. She feels you doing this and then looks at you with a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex I missed you so much.\" She says hugging you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again you try to push out some words and this time they come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I missed you to Kasmir.\" You say faintly. She smiles and kisses you. You smile at her and say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kasmir I'm sorry...\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you sorry?\" She asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tryed to kill myself a few days ago... I just couldn't take it anymore... Not seeing you was killing me from the inside... I'm sorry.\" To your suprize Kasmir just kissed you and said that she would be back in a few minutes. She then returned with some fruit. You ate some of it and then you slowly feel asleep. Hours later you were awoken by hundreds of Amazon's screaming and cheering. As far as you could tell you were in some gladiator arena. Then it hit you. You were going to fight someone. You look around and see Zig Zag sitting in a thrown with Kasmir crying next to her. That's when you hear some yell from behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOUR GOING TO DIE HUMAN!\" You look be hind you to see a wolf boy running at you. He swings his sword at you and you just duck under it and start to run. While your running you notice your shotgun on the ground to your right. You then think to yourself 'How the hell did that get here!?' But you put that thought aside and ran for your shotgun. You grab it and turn around to see the wolf running at you again. You quickly check the gun to see if its loaded and it is surprisingly. You point it at the wolf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP DON'T MAKE ME SHOOT YOU!\" You yell but the wolf didn't stop. You yell at him again saying \"STOP OR I WILL SHOOT!\" but again he doesn't stop. Then it hits you, he won't stop till one of us is dead. You then pull the trigger and hit the wolf dead in the chest and he fly's back about 10 feet. You slowly walk towards him and see first hand what you did. The wolf is in severe pain and he needs medical attention immediately. You try to stop the bleeding but its no use. You look him in the eyes and say. \"I'm sorry...\" And then walk away. The crowd was silent. You look at you shotgun that's in your hands and throw it to the ground and walk away from it. The crowd then started to cheer and throw roses at you. This confused you. 'Why are they happy?' You thought to yourself. Then you hear Zig Zag start to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations Alex, you have survived the first round of the contest.\" Says Zig Zag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What contest?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The contest for...\"</span></div></div>",

She happened to know a spell that could freeze time just long enough to get you out from under those venomous fangs. She'd need to buy some time, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked at Kasmir this whole time, wondering what she was gonna do. You see her drop to her knees, seemingly in defeat, but then you see her mouth moving. You couldn't read lips, so it was impossible for you to figure it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is she doing?\" the skunk said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, everything except you and Kasmir became frozen in time. She rushes over to you, pulls you out of the frozen, snake's grip, and unties you. She then has you hide in your bathroom before she releases the spell. Once that happened, the guards were dumbfounded. To them, It looked like Kasmir just instantly hid you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to talk to my mother alone, face to face, right here, or else I'm not going anywhere.\" she said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then the front door to the apartment opened, and in walk a skunk with a zig zag fur pattern. It then grew into Kasmir's mother, ZigZag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"The three of you are dismissed.\" she says to the guards, and they promptly leave the apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasmir then calls you out into the living room. She felt that you needed to hear the conversation that was bout to go down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were in the room, ZigZag proceeded to reprimand her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young lady, you deliberately disobeyed me.\" she started off. \"I told you that you had to let him go, no matter how much you loved him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, I'm twenty years old!

Is that too much to ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can sympathize with you, sweetheart, but according to tradition-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw the tradition!\" Kasmir yelled, catching you and ZigZag off guard. \"I am so sick of hearing about how my life is controlled by traditions!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am your mother and I know what's best for you.\" ZigZag said, trying to keep her daughter under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you just think you do.\" Kasmir snaps back. \"You don't know what's best for me, you only know what's best for you and the kingdom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's your kingdom, because you're going to be queen someday.\" ZigZag said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis set Kasmir over the edge. \"Well maybe I don't want to be queen! Maybe I never did! MAYBE I JUST WANTED TO BE A NORMAL GIRL!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and ZigZag were shocked at those words. You thought to yourself: 'Now we're getting to the root of the problem.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasmir was now on her knees, head in her hands, sobbing her eyes out. You quickly went to her side to comfort her, and she embraces you tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight was too much for her mother to bear. ZigZag started to wonder if upholding tradition was worth her daughter's well being. She sighed. \"Is this really what you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasmir calms down a little. \"More than anything.\" she answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, I think I can have a new heiress to the throne. If you two promise to visit Anthronia at least once a week, you can stay here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasmir's eyes lit up. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really,\" ZigZag said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how are we supposed to visit Anthronia every week when it's so far away?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZigZag snaps her fingers and a scroll appears. \"You can use these teleportation spells.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you so much, Mother!\" Kasmir says with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome.\" ZigZag says, before leaving.</span></div></div>",

The two of you kept your promise to visit Anthronia every week. And ZigZag was more than happy to see you every time. Over the course of this year, Kasmir has now gotten fully used to the human lifestyle. She's even gotten used to keeping herself at average human height. The most amazing day of this year was when Kasmir learned a spell that allowed her transform into a human at will. This allowed you two to go on real dates instead of staying at home. It also allowed you new girlfriend to shop for her own clothes. Kasmir decided to call herself Katherine when she was in her human form, in order to fit in more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was the day the two of you were to pay another visit to Anthronia, when you were surprised by a visitor. The doorbell rings, and you answer it, and in walks a skunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, mom!\" Kasmir says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skunk transforms into queen ZigZag. \"Hi, you two! I decided to pay you guys a visit for a change.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is a pleasant surprise.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why don't we go out on the town?\" she says. \"I would just love to learn about human life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait.\" Kasmir said. \"Does that mean you learned the trans-species transformation spell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.\" ZigZag says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the three of you go out to the city, deciding to call ZigZag \"Zoey\" in her human form. Later that evening, ZigZag, or rather, Zoey, has something to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Now, you two,\" she says \"There's a reason why I wanted to visit you guys today. I have an important announcement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" the two of you say simultaneously.</span></div></div>",

Neither of you has any idea where this was going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you know that I've been feeling under the weather during your last few visits,\" she continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment. ZigZag was right. For the past month,  ZigZag has been ill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I took Kasmir's advice and went to the doctor, and... it's official.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's official?\" Kasmir asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pregnant!\" ZigZag says with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kasmir look at each other, your mouths gaping open. Then Kasmir composes herself and says \"Wait a second. You never even mentioned having a mate to perform the mating ritual with yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I wanted to wait until the time was right.\" her mother says. Kasmir doesn't say another word. Instead, she just leans back in her chair and rubs her temples, still in disbelief of what she just heard. \"I don't see why you're so shocked.\" ZigZag says to her daughter. \"I'm sure you and your boyfriend have mated several times already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Kasmir blush. In actuality, the two of you haven't had sex yet, but it was best not to bring that up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when do we get to meet the father?\" you ask, trying to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next week.\" ZigZag says. \"You guys are going to love him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the conversation ended, you were already home. ZigZag says goodbye and  you and Kasmir settle down in the house as she changes back into her anthro form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's great that your mom found a guy that she's happy with, right?\" you ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasmir looks at you and the look on her face says it all. </span></div></div>",

She raises her and thinks a second, \"wait, I never showed him anything to make him think like that, Allison, Evelyn\" Zig Zag shouts. From some side corridor appears a young looking skunkette and some sort of snake anthro, they run up and bow \"yes your majesty\" the cobra says keeping her head bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our guest says that Max, believes me to be much more....promiscuous then I am, why is that?\" she asks. The skunkette giggles and Zig Zag repeats herself in a much more serious tone \"why is that you two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls started to visibly shake \"i-it--it was so that he would think you a figment your majesty, as you know men think about sex a lot and thus he would think you only a fantasy meant to satisfy his desires\" the skunkette says nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do not care, you depicted me in a most unladylike manner, I shall come up with your punishment later, now away with you\" she says. The skunkette and cobra stand up and quickly leave, Zigzag turns to the 2 male dogs guarding the door \"you 2 may also leave\" she says. The 2 guards look at each other and are about to protest when Zig Zag glares at them and they quickly retreat from the room, she slumps back in her throne and sighs. You just wait there patiently and after about 5 minutes you figure out she forgot all about you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me...Zig Zag\" you say. She practically jumps out of her skin and looks down, \"oh i'm sorry, I forgot all about you didn't I\" she says. You nod and she picks you up, \"sometimes being the queen is so hard, have you ever had power?\" she asks. You shake your head, \"mmm, well it's not all it's cracked up to be, so many people relying on you to make decisions and you have to fix others mistakes\" she says. You nod again and she stares at you, \"I don't think you ever told me your name\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex ma'am\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiles, \"no ma'am, or your majesty, or queen anything, you call me Zig Zag got it.\" she says. You nod and she pats you on the head with one finger \"glad you understand\" she says. She places you down in her lap and sighs, \"well might as well start preparing\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Preparing what?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why your raft of course, obviously you want to go home\" she continues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What I can't stay here?\" you reply. She stares at you shocked, \"you...don't wish to go home?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this place is beautiful, quiet, calm, better then my life back home, my parents barely visit me anyways so it's not like i'm leaving a loving family or anything\" you say. She gently strokes your head \"poor thing, of course you can stay\" she says. You sighed and you saw her smile coyly at you, \"in fact, I decree that from this moment forth you are a member of my great kingdom of Anthroia\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...um thank you, your maj....I mean Zig Zag\" you say. She lifts you up and smiles \"your welcome, you do know being a citizen has some perks right?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh no, I did not\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only citizens of my domain may be engaged, get married, and bear young\" she says. You nod, If you were going to stay then you were going to need to be able to start a family right. She pushes you over with one finger, \"on that note, i've taken quite a liking to you\" she says. You were left speechless, she giggled and put you down \"oh Anthony\" she shouts. From that same side corridor runs a male skunk who runs up and bows \"yes Zig Zag\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take our guest to a room, and have him prepare for dinner, make sure he as well as the rest of the kingdom are ready for a royal announcement\" she says. You quickly shook thoughts of what Zig Zag said before out of your head as you heard about a royal announcement and started thinking it might be you becoming a citizen. The male skunk leads you down the side passage glancing at you every so often, \"so uh what are you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, I am clearly a skunk\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I mean in Zig Zag's court\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I am her royal advisor\" he says. You whistle \"wow so your like pretty important\" you say. He nods, \"yes I am\" he replies. You are led to what seems to be a bath area and you are instructed to quickly wash yourself. You strip and take a quick bath cleaning yourself as thoroughly as possible. You are then led to a large bedroom, it was as big as about a 4th of a regular 2-story house. He starts to rummage through some drawers as you walk around admiring everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what was with all the windows in the halls?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Zig Zag likes natural lighting she hates artificial light, even candles, so there are tons of windows all through out the castle\" he says. You nod and he keeps searching \"where are those garments, I know i should have had an extra pair, damn it all i'll just have to go get a set from the storage house, wait here\" he says running off. You looked around the bedroom it was elegent to say the least, extravagant to say the most. There was a 4-poster bed in the middle of the room and one whole wall was covered in windows which let natural light in although there was a candle holder, telling you this wasn't ZigZag's room which made sense due to just proportions. You waited around for a good 10 minutes before Anthony comes running back carrying a set of clothes identical to the ones he was wearing. \"Here you go\" he says handing you them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow thanks man, you didn't need to run the whole way\" you say starting to undress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, ZigZag, says, is law\" he replies talking between intakes of breath. You got dressed quickly and you admired yourself in a mirror, the outfit was very regal. Sky blue shirt and pants with a golden cape and a black pair of leather shoes, although you have no idea where they got the leather. \"This way\" Anthony says walking out of the room, he walks more beside you then in front of you now telling you that you must have at least earned the guys respect. You expected him to take you straight to the dining hall but instead you found yourself just wandering the halls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh shouldn't we be heading to dinner?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not for another half an hour\" Anthony replies. He then showed you the rest of the palace. There were some places you took an instant liking to such as the royal garden and a hill that the palace naturally opened onto. There were also a few places you did not really like such as the bathrooms of the palace, since the anthros didn't have any real technology to speak of they were little better then outhouses. Finally Anthony led you to the dining hall, it was huge as right when you arrived so did ZigZag and you could see that the ceiling was twice maybe thrice her height, as for the length of the hall, well it seemed to be able to fit a population you guessed to be a thousand or more, so it was really big. ZigZag sits down at what was obviously her spot and Anthony walks up with you right beside him, \"here he is Zig Zag\" he says. She nods and he walks over and climbs up onto a chair to Zig Zag's left. Zig Zag picks you up and whispers \"so how do you like the palace?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very beautiful, just like the monarch\" you say without thinking. She smiles and lifts you up \"My people, I have gathered you for this feast, to welcome the newest member of our kingdom and my......</span></div></div>",

You froze as you saw those same 10 furs jump up and start running to the front of the table where Zig Zag sat. Much to your suprise her hand closed around you and pressed to her body, \"Stop\" Zig Zag says anger evident in her voice. The furs freeze and she uncurls her hand and looks down at you then at them, \"if you dare attack him I will see that as an attack on myself and you remember what happened the last time someone did that\" Zig Zag says. You look up at her and were actually scared but she lowers her head, \"don't worry I didn't hurt anybody, just used my....natural defenses\" she says. You thought about it and that was better then what you were thinking of but you still shuddered a bit. The furs sat back down and the meal began, you were served what seemed to be duck, except it was a duck the size of a truck. You were all served water although Zig''s was served from a giant crystal pitcher, the meal thankfully was uneventful except for what happened at the start. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you everyone, I think I will retire\" Zig Zag says standing up. Much to your suprise she picked you up and so you sat obediently as she walked through the halls. She entered a giant chamber which you figured out was Zig Zag's bedroom as there was a black and white striped bed sheet on a bed that was the size of a small suburb. She flops out on the bed and puts you down, \"well little one, that went better then I expected\" she says. You nod and look up at her as she was actually looking nervous, \"there is um...one thing I must do before you are officially my betrothed\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your going to hate it, I offered the same thing to Max and he rejected it outright and now i'm gonna be rejected twice\" Zig Zag says looking very shy and scared now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" you shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to....spray you\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou freeze, \"excuse me\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one is slightly different then the normal spray we give off as it contains some good pheremones that identify the target as owning to a skunk, they will never wash off and well due to our sense of smell, they're the only part we smell\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I'm not sure\" you say looking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew it, you hate me now don't you?\" Zig Zag says taking your moment of silence as a yes she was now on the verge of tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, do it\" you say. She stops sniffling and stares at you. You shut your eyes and sit down \"do it now before I change my mind\" you say. You heard the sound of silk material and you practically felt the weight of her body now hanging over you before you were drenched. It lasted no more then 5 seconds but it really did stink, afterwards you opened your eyes and instantly started coughing from the smell. You were lifted up and kissed repeatedly for a good 3 minutes before Zig Zag stops and smiles at you, \"well now your mine, forever and ever, because like that smell i'm never leaving\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe yeah\" you say. Zig Zag turns as the door to her room opens, and in walks Anthony, he sniffs the air and a look of anger crosses his face. He runs up and quickly scales the bed, \"Zig Zag how could you do this, I loved you ever since I was a child\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anthony you have Allison and a family\" Zig Zag says suprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I, I never stopped loving you, and now, now you've marked this outsider I cannot stand for it\" he says unsheathing his sword (yeah yeah laugh it up). Zig is about to do something before Allison runs into the room yelling \"stop!!\" Anthony turns around stunned and drops his sword to his side and he's tackled onto the ground \"you idiot\" Allison says looking at him. She then lowers herself and kisses him \"I knew you were still in love with our majesty, heck I had a crush on her for a tiny bit\" she says which confused you until you remembered Zig attracted both guys and girls, guess that wasn't a lie. The two just stare at each other and Allison lowers herself to her knees after getting off Anthony \"i'm sorry Zig Zag, please forgive us\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZig waves her hand \"there was no harm done, but you better be a good advisor from now on Anthony\" Zig Zag says adding an authoritative tone. He nods and carefully picks his sword up and puts it back in it's scabbard before he and Allison climb down the bed and walk out the door. Zig Zag sits back holding her hand with you in it to her forehead, you tap on her fur and she moves it \"oh sorry, I really need to remember your there\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez what do I have to do bell myself\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you'd actually look quite cute with a little collar with a bell on it\" Zig Zag says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah not happening\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I wear one too?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't that negate the whole point of it\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you say you were supposed to smell me or something\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes that's right, but only after the normal smell is gone........bath time\" she say smiling at you. She quickly stands up and holds you to her chest, she practically runs through the castle although probably no more then a half hour had passed and the sun was still high in the sky. She slows down when she nears a door with steam flowing out from under it and you were suprised at what you saw. It was pretty much a modern bathroom, with pink tiles, yellow paint, and a pink bathtub. Zig Zag walks into the room and you finally noticed something, there was no natural light here, the room was lit by candle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zig Zag, don't you have problems with artifical light?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks down at you and smiles \"this is the one place I don't mind it\" she says. She quickly ran the water and you really started to wonder how this place was created until you felt her tug at your clothes and in a second you were sitting there naked. You were lowered into the water and she spent the next half an hour gently scrubbing your body, it was wonderful she was so gentle and the soft fur was just heavenly. Finally she pulls you out and she lets you sniff yourself, you didn't smell anymore skunk smell \"I think it's good now Zig Zag\" you say. She nods and smiles at you \"don't worry, i'll let you take a bath with me very soon\" she says. You flared red \"I wasn't thinking that\" you say. She hugs you to her cheek and then gently towels you off. She lets you get dressed and heads back to her room. She lays out on the bed putting you down on a pillow \"good night little one\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night Zig Zag\" you say.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You woke up the next day to the sound of tons of activity, \"huh whas going on?\" you say still half asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour field of view was soon taken up by Zig Zag's face, \"oh nothing, just preparing, and good morning\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning, preparing for what?\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why our wedding of course, it's happening this afternoon\" ZigZag says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you shout that revelation waking you right up. \"What about a suit for me, what about your dress? There's no way that could be done by this afternoon\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not silly, I've had my dress finished for years\" she says walking over and opening a dresser where a very traditional wedding dress hung. \"I'm so happy\" she says lifting the dress off it's hangar and giving a small twirl. You heard the door open slightly and you ran to the end of the bed to see Anthony and his wife standing there, you then felt yourself lifted into the air and you were set down on the floor in front of the two. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well come along\" Anthony says turning and walking off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and look at Allison \"don't worry, he's just a bit miffed that you beat him, he hates losing\" she says before following Anthony. You sigh and follow the two of them, your first stop for the day was the dining hall which suprisingly had very little activity. \"All the servants are preparing a grand banquet for the event tonight, so no prepared meals for a while\" she says lifting up a giant berry. You follow her lead and suprisingly you were able to eat the entire thing. You were then led to the baths where Allison took her leave and you just stared at Anthony warily finally he spoke up \"are you sure you like girls, since you keep staring at me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm watching you because you tried to run me through twice yesterday\" you reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony looks at you for a few seconds and sighs \"yes, I must apologize for that, I mean how would you feel if you had a secret crush on someone for years and suddenly some guy you've never seen steals the heart of the one you love\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I must admit I've never had that happen to me, but you still don't just try to kill someone\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes well maybe I overreacted a bit\" he says. It got really quiet after that which it should and when you got out you found a towel and clothes all set out. You quickly get dressed and wait outside for Anthony, who took a bit longer because he had to dry his fur. Then it was off to a tailor. \"Are you sure you can have a suit made by tonight?\" you ask the tailor who was the first ever spider anthro you had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course\" she replies, \"I pride myself on my speed and skill, now shoo I must get to work\" she says waving the three of you away. You just wandered around the island for a while Anthony and Allison showing you some of the island's most beautiful spots. For once in your life you were really happy that there was a place civilization had left mostly untouched as you saw more natural beauty in a few hours than you probably would have seen in your whole life in the outside world. You headed back to the tailor's shop and she comes right up holding a suit \"it's all finished\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stare stunned, you couldn't have been walking for more than 2 hours \"wow, you're fast\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it helps when you have 4 sets of hands\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, \"um... I don't have any money on me\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry about it, it's for the queen's wedding, I'll just accept a small favor as payment\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of favor?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't need a favor right now, I'll just hold it in lieu\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod and suddenly the sound of a gong rings out, \"they're finished already\" Anthony cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finished what?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The wedding preparations, come on we need to head back\" he says. Allison and Anthony lift you up and they both run back to the castle carrying you between them. When they enter the castle all you could see were anthros running around in what you could only describe as organized chaos. Anthony took you to a room and put you down \"get changed and wait here\" he says. You quickly got changed into the suit which was a very good fit. You just sat there for a few minutes till one of the other anthros came in \"it's time\" he says. You follow him out and you were suprisingly led to the throne room, you were led up to the throne and stood near the anthro who was a pure white horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the sound of trumpets blared and every face turned to stare at the entrance of the room. ZigZag slowly walks in the veil only slightly obscuring her face as she walks you see there's about 30 anthros holding up the end of the train of her dress and even though she was walking slowly they had to jog to keep up. Zig Zag finally reaches the throne and stands next to the horse and you, although you both had to tilt your necks up 90* just to look at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse gives off a small cough \"we are here this day to finally wed our queen, she has waited many a year for this and finally her dreams shall come true\" he says. You couldn't help but smile as you knew this wasn't going to be a normal wedding ceremony. \"This man has come from the outside world and stolen our queen's heart, yet we cannot fault him for it and we can only wish her the best\" he continues. You looked up and you swear it looked like she rolled her eyes, you looked over at the horse and he seemed to get the hint as he gave off a small cough and quickly flipped a few pages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem, yes well, ZigZag do you take this man to protect and cherish, to watch over and love, in sickness and in health till death parts you and even after\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do\" ZigZag replies quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you take our queen, to love and cherish, to nurture and respect, in good times and bad, till death do you part and even after?\" he asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do\" you reply quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then you may now-\" ZigZag cut the horse off by scooping you up and kissing you passionately. The whole room erupted into cheers and ZigZag after a few seconds broke the kiss, good thing too as you were running out of air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no getting away from me now\" ZigZag whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I ever want to leave\" you reply and she smiles. The whole kingdom then seems to surge forward at once and you actually saw something you hadn't before, children. A lot were sitting on their parents shoulders staring up at you and ZigZag and she noticed you looking. \"So, you're interested in kids\" she says slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I actually haven't seen any till now, and of course I'm interested in them\" you reply answering her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you haven't seen any children because they're not really allowed within the castle walls, they're even smaller than you and I could never forgive myself if I ever hurt one\" ZigZag says. You nod and reply \"well Zig Zag you always seemed kind to me, so I'm sure you'll make an excellent mother\" you say. There was a collective aww from everyone gathered and all Zig said in return was \"well you'll have to give me some kids first.\" The crowd at these words parts and Zig Zag walks right through them heading towards....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zig Zag carries you through the halls of the palace with a spring in her step. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d You ask. \u201cWell, you said you wanted kids, and there\u2019s no time like the present.\u201d She says as she comes to her bedroom door. Wow, you thought, she sure doesn\u2019t waste any time. She sets you down on the bed and slowly begins to remove her dress. You sat there mesmerized as she ever so slowly revealed more of her body, a mischievous smirk on her face. \u201cI thought you said you didn\u2019t act like this.\u201d A wide grin appears on her face as she finally finishes stripping, standing bare in front of you, hands on her hips. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t know how. Besides, this is a special occasion, and I think this calls for it anyway.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she lays down on the bed and places you on her breast, her confidence suddenly disappears. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d You ask. \u201cI\u2026I\u2019ve never done this before. I\u2019m a little afraid I won\u2019t be good enough for you.\u201d You walk over to her face and stroke her muzzle, trying to comfort her. \u201cYou\u2019ll do fine.\u201d You say reassuringly. \u201cI\u2019m what, three hundred times smaller than you? I\u2019m the one who should be worried about not being good enough.\u201d That seemed to make Zig Zag feel better, as she smiled warmly and asked. \u201cSo are you going to remove those are shall I do it for you?\u201d, indicating your clothes. Before you could answer, she holds you in her palm and removes your clothes with amazing dexterity with her fingers. She holds you in front of her face. \u201cReady?\u201d She asks with a smirk. \u201cNot exactly.\u201d You say. Zig Zag smiles. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be gentle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, you were sprawled across Zig Zag\u2019s stomach, sweating and panting. Her belly slowly rose and fell beneath you as she panted with you. \u201cThat\u2026was\u2026.incredible.\u201d She said between intakes of breath. \u201cYeah\u2026.you\u2026.too.\u201d You reply. When you regain enough strength, you crawl up her stomach to her breasts. From your point of view, each was as big as a hill. You scale her right breast, Zig Zag clearly enjoying it as much as you did. When you reach the top, you lay there enjoying the softness of her breast as she strokes your back with one finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think it worked?\u201d Zig Zag asked. \u201cI hope so.\u201d You say. \u201cBecause if it didn\u2019t, I\u2019m gonna need a good long while before we can try again. At least a month or so.\u201d Zig Zag laughs at that remark. \u201cWell, all we can do is wait and see.\u201d She leans her head forward and kisses you before laying her head back on the pillows. You both fall asleep soon after that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout two weeks later you both got your answer. Zig Zag\u2019s belly had noticeably started to bulge. News of her pregnancy quickly spread across the island. Most of the citizens were excited and came to the palace themselves to give their congratulations. Others however, were less than pleased, particularly the many males who had wanted Zig Zag for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Anthony was noticeably disheartened on learning of Zig Zag\u2019s coming birth, but he didn\u2019t seem to hold any ill will towards you. But something unusual was going on with Zig Zag. By the second week of her pregnancy, her belly was twice the size it was before, and she showed none of the symptoms of pregnancy such as morning sickness or mood-swings. You guessed that Anthronian pregnancies worked differently than human ones. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night during Zig Zag\u2019s fifth week, you both lay in bed together, Zig Zag on her back and you on her stomach. By now, her belly had grown to stick out a good distance from her body. Had she been normal sized, it would look as though she had swallowed a beach ball. You gently rubbed her taut stomach as she murred and cooed softly. \u201cAny ideas for a name for the little one?\u201d You ask. \u201cThere\u2019s still some time before she\u2019s born, a name can wait.\u201d Zig Zag said. \u201cHow do you know it\u2019s a she?\u201d You ask. Zig Zag giggles. \u201cI just know.\u201d She looks up at you. \u201cWhy? Do you think it will be a boy?\u201d You shrug. \u201cBoy, girl, it doesn\u2019t matter to me. I\u2019ll love it all the same.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZig Zag smiled gently stroked you. \u201cThat\u2019s why I knew you would be a wonderful father.\u201d You chuckle. \u201cYou seem to just know a lot of things, don\u2019t you?\u201d Zig Zag laughed. \u201cI\u2019m the queen, it\u2019s my job to know everything.\u201d Just then, you feel a kick directly beneath you, causing you to jump slightly. \u201cLooks like she\u2019s trying to tell you something.\u201d Zig Zag said, smiling. You gently pat Zig Zag\u2019s stomach. \u201cDaddy\u2019s here.\u201d You say. \u201cI hear you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lay on your back, hands behind your head, and sigh. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d asks Zig Zag, sounding concerned. \u201cIt\u2019s funny.\u201d You say. \u201cI have three younger brothers at home. After seeing what my parents went through with raising them, I swore I would never have kids. I also swore to never get married after my parents got divorced and my dad was left with nothing to his name.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a divorce?\u201d Asks Zig Zag. \u201cThat\u2019s where two people who are married can\u2019t stand each other anymore and separate for good. Typically it involves the woman getting everything the man owns in the process. I used to think marriage was a trap created by women to rob men of their homes and money. Yet here I am, married to you and expecting a child.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZig Zag nods. \u201cSo why did you marry me?\u201d You shrug. \u201cI guess I could just see there was something about you that was different from a human female. You\u2019re honest, kind, caring. Those qualities are nearly impossible to find in people.\u201d  Zig Zag places you in her palm and nuzzles her against her cheek. \u201cYou humans can\u2019t all be that bad. Just look at you.\u201d You kiss her cheek. \u201cThanks Zig Zag.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big day finally arrived. You stood outside the doors to Zig Zag\u2019s bedroom, listening to the commotion from inside. You could hear Zig Zag, grunting and panting, but hardly screaming at all. You heard voices telling her she was nearly there, and to keep pushing. You had offered to be there with her to hold her hand, but then you realized that would likely crush you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor what seemed an eternity, you stood outside the room, anxious and nervous at the same time. Finally, you hear the sound of a baby crying. After several more minutes, the door opens and one of the doctors, Allison, steps out, a huge smile on her face. \u201cIt\u2019s done!\u201d She says excitedly. She leads you inside to a ladder leaning against Zig Zag\u2019s bed for you to climb. You quickly scale the ladder to the top of the bed, to see Zig Zag, smiling broadly, and bundle in her arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did I tell you?\u201d She says. \u201cIt\u2019s a girl!\u201d She picks you up between her fingers and places you on her shoulder. She opened the pink bundle to reveal your newborn daughter. She was the spitting image of her mother, right down to the black and white stripped fur, white hair, and fluffy tail, albeit in miniature form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least, miniature to Zig Zag. To you, the baby was three times your size already. You really weren\u2019t looking forward to her teenage years. \u201cSo, have you decided on a name?\u201d You ask Zig Zag, who nods. \u201cYes. I have decided to name her Zelda, after my sister.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have a sister?\u201d You inquire, as she had never mentioned this before. \u201cI did. It\u2019s a long story. Now\u2019s really not the time for it.\u201d You look down at your daughter as she sucks her thumb in her sleep. Well, here I am, you think, right where I said I never would be. I just hope I turn out to be a better parent than mine were.    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Although you tried on multiple occasions to get her to open up, Zig Zag never would tell you who Zelda was, however this was the least of your problems. What problems could someone with a 300 ft tall furry wife hot enough that she could be considered a pornstar have? The 300ft tall part, and all the consequences that came with it, namely Zelda. The problem wasn't Zelda herself, it was her attitude as from practically the moment of her birth she somehow seemed to declare herself your protector and bodyguard. This was cute when she was 15ft tall as a babe and she'd curl around you, as the two of you slept on Zig Zag this made sense and was practical however as the years went by this went from being practical and cute to annoying and well...harmful. Zelda although you took her on a few play dates would never stray far from you, in fact she seemed perfectly content with having no interaction other than with you and Zig Zag. You told Zig Zag about this multiple times but she just waved it off and said that it was just part of growing up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all came to a head a little after her 5th birthday, you and Zig Zag were trying to get Zelda to sleep in her own bed, as she was 5 years old. She threw what you could only describe as the mother of all temper tantrums constantly complaining that she couldn't sleep without you there,. finally Zig Zag handed you over to her like well a favourite doll, Zelda curling up around you and falling asleep. You expected Zig Zag to be standing there, waiting to take you so the two of you could go to bed, but no, she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day to say you were angry was a bit of an understatement, you woke up to the smiling face of your daughter, and put on a smile, after getting dressed and taking a shower (two of the few events Zelda will let you do alone) a servant came to get you for your royal duties. You sent her back and slipped away as the Castle had many secret passages and hallways. You spent the remainder of the day avoiding both Zelda and Zig Zag, of course you had to come to dinner, so that is when they saw you next, Zig Zag just looked at you for a second before returning to her meal, everything went well until Zelda started speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy guess what I did today?\" No Answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy guess what I did today?\" Still no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alex your daughter is speaking to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have a daughter, I have a guard\" you reply curtly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZig Zag juststares at you after that reply mouth agape. \"How could you say that?\" she says standing up obviously planning to use her size to intimidate you. You quickly stand up as well your chair clattering to the ground \"How could I say that? You handed me over to her like I was nothing more than a doll and then you just left me. I've told you about this problem time and time again and you've ignored me. If you're ok with her being my guard rather than my daughter then that's whatshe'll be and royalty doesn't talk to the guards, pets them, tells them stories, nothing\" you reply venomously. Zig Zag physically takes a step back, the shock and distress on her face evident. You just stare at her till you hear what you could only describe as a \"hitching\" sound, you turn to see Zelda her head bowed, her body spasming wth eac little hiccup. Suddenly she raises her head up and wails \"DADDY HATES ME!!!\" before running out of the room sobbing her little eyes out. You sigh and fall back onto your butt, you can feel the deathly glare Zig Zag is giving you. Without a word she turns and leaves the room, about a minute later you feel a servant tap you on the shoulder, \"sir are you alright?\" she asks. You simply shake your head and sigh again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the night you were \"banished\" from the royal hall and you already knew that Zig Zag wasn't exactly going to be letting you into bed tonight so yu simply wandered the halls of the castle. It took you awhile but you made it to Zelda's room, surprisingly the guards didn't stopped you when yu made to enter and only gave you sympathetic looks. You climbed up the ladder on the sideof the bed and observed her sleeping there, your little girl who was no more than 5 had literally cried herself to sleep. \"Oh Zelda\" you whisper walking up and gently stroking your head, slowly Zelda awakens at your touch and she just stares at you, treas near instatnyl threatening to fall from her eyes once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh Zelda shh\" you say gently stroking her cheek, she doesn't try to grab you, just stares at you. \"Zelda, I'm srry, what I said was mean,but it's true, you're a big girl alight, and I'm glad that you want to look out for me, but that's what mommy is there for, do you understand?\" you ask. She nods her head and just stares at you staring at you, \"Zelda what are you, my guard or my daughter\" you ask your voice taking on a gentle loving quality as you said the word daughter. \"Y-Your d-daughter\" she wails before wrapping you up in a hug, \"shh Zelda shh Daddy's here\" you say gently stroking what you can of her back and one of her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes she calms down and starts t fall back asleep, you gently stroke her, gaining her attention\"Zelda do you think you can help Daddy?\" you ask. She nods and you continue \"Mommy is mad at me at the moment as she should be, I don't think she wants to see me at the moment, but we can't simply let Mommy be sad can we?\" you ask again and she shakes her head this time. \"Good ten let's go cheer up Mommy\" Zelda lifts you up onto her shoulder before starting towalk to Zig Zag's room, she knocks at the door and the guards stare at you for a few second as audible sobs could be heard coming from behind the door. Zelda knocks and there is a pause before Zig Zag replies \"who is it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the guars answers \"your daughter empress\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"let her in\" was Zig Zag's reply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelda slowly entered the room, hiding you behind her back, she walked up to Zig's bed, your wife was sprawled over the deb, her eyes puffy and red from what was probably hours of crying, she quickly lifted her daughter up to her. However she froze mere seconds after that Zig's fingers quickly wrapping around you and quickly lifting you up to her face. You expected her to be angry, to yell at you, what you weren't expecting was for her to start sobbing again and hug you to her chest \"I'm sorry...I'm sorry\" she repeats the words over and over. You felt Zelda hug her mother and after a minute you were released from the confines of her chest. She wipes a tear away with a free hand \"you were right, this has been going on for far too long, none of this should have happened and I should have listened to you earlier\" she says. You wanted to be mad at her, you did, she wasn't the one who had to put up with it, but you couldn't stay mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zig\" you say softly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lowers her head to you and asks in a quavering voice \"yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou motion for her to come closer before kissing the end of her muzzle \"you're forgiven\" you say. You were hugged tightly against her muzzle as Zig peppered you with kisses, she fell back on her bed and opened her arms for Zelda to come and lay down, laying you down in the cleavage of her chest. You felt one of Zelda's hands fall on your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zelda you know you have to sleep on your own after tonight don't you\" Zig says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mommy\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel Zelda give you a small squeeze before the three of you fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

Her fur is a light beige color, except for her hands, feet, tail, and face, which are a dark chocolate color. Her eyes are are a bright blue, and almost seem to glow.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wore nothing, with only her fur covering her body. She stared at you with a mischievous smile. She gets up from her throne, and gets down on all fours. She crawls toward you, tail straight in the air. She towers over you, bending down until her face was in front of you. Her sparkling blue eyes seem to stare straight into your soul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she lifts her paw, and lightly taps you with it, knocking you over. She taps you again, sliding you across the floor. She scampers over to you, and bats you again. By now, you're getting dizzy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, mouse. Run!\" She says. \"I'm not a mouse!\" You say indignantly. \"Well, you're certainly small enough for one!\" She laughs. \"Come on! I won't hurt you. Much.\" She grins, making her look very much like the Cheshire Cat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" You ask, getting back to your feet. \"Just to play.\" She says. \"My name is Jira, by the way.\" You hesitate for a moment. \"Alex.\" You say. \"Well, Alex, don't you want to play?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a game where I'm being smacked around like a football.\" You say. \"A what?\" Says Jira, confused. \"Never mind.\" You say. \"Okay, I'll stop smacking you around, if you do something for me.\" She says. \"What?\" You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She lowers her head and gentle nudges you. \"Scratch my ears.\" You comply and scratch behind her left ear. Jira begins to purr loudly, making the room shake a little. After five minutes of scratching, you do her other ear. When you finish, Jira gives you a lick, her rough tongue scratching your body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was delightful.\" She says happily. \"Now, time for a new game.\" \"Hey, you said no more games.\" You say. \"no I didn't. I said I wouldn't knock you around. This is just a little game of hide and seek. You go run and hide, and I'll count to 100. If I find you within an hour, you're my little toy. If not, I'll do something nice for you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I refuse?\" You ask. Jira licks her lips. \"Well, you know how cats love to play with our food.\" She opens her mouth, revealing her long white fangs.     </span></div></div>",

You quickly look around the throne room. It was so big, that by the time you got to the door Jira would be at fifty. You decide to hide under her chair, which was right behind her. You walk as quietly as you can, hoping that she wouldn't hear you. When you get under her the chair, you want to find a place to hang on to so that when she looks, she won't see your feet. You look up and see a bar that you can sit on, so you climb up to it. So you sit there and wait for almost an hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Jira returns to the throne room. \"Okay...\" she says. I've looked everywhere in the castle except in here. I'd better get started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check your watch. She had five minutes to find you, or else she had to do something nice for you, whatever that was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't hide from me, Alex.\" she says. \"I can smell fear!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were hoping to God that she was joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, you hear footsteps coming closer... and closer... and closer.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the light coming from under the chair disappears. Jira must be looking under it now. Thank God she couldn't see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at your watch again. Five, four, three, two, one...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Alex!\" she calls out. \"Time's up! You can come out, now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawl out from under the throne. \"Oh, there you are!\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so you said you'd do something nice for me.\" you say. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJira looks at you and says...</span></div></div>",

You stood there and waited for her daughter, fearing the worst. You then see someone walk into the throne room. She looked like Jira, only her hair was loose whereas her mother's was tied down in a ponytail. Another difference was that Jessica's eyes were a deeper shade of blue. What was really weird about her was that she was only seven feet tall, rather than the usual ten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to see me mother,\" she says. Then she looks at you and jumps a little. \"Who's this?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Alex, he's a visitor from the outside.\" Jira calmly explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see.\" Jessica says. This was weird. While Jira was mischievous and playful, her daughter seemed quiet and shy. She must take after her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want you to spend the day with Alex, Jessica.\" the queen says to her daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, mother. That's not necessary.\" Jessica says waving her hands in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" Jira says. \"You need to get out more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really...\" the princess attempts to say, but then Jira picks you and her daughter up, places the two of you outside the throne room, then closes the door. \"Don't come back 'till seven!\" she says from behind the closed door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry that you're stuck spending the day with me.\" Jessica says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind.\" you say. \"You're kinda cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica blushes. \"Really?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo where do you to go.</span></div></div>",

There were all sorts of plants that you've never seen before. It was like you were looking into a fantasy book. However, the trip wasn't completely satisfying. Jessica was sort of ruining the mood of the trip. Every time you tried to strike up a conversation with her, she'd end it immediately. You wanted to get to know her better. but she had a wall of insecurity surrounding her, and it was not gonna go down easily. You decide to try a different approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Jessica.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" she asks. \"There's nothing wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You barely talked the entire time we were here.\" you say. \"Are you uncomfortable because of me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no.

The fact that I'm only seven feet tall is pretty much adding insult to injury.\" You see a tear fall down Jessica's face. You felt sorry for her. She definitely needs a confidence boost, but what?</span></div></div>",

I am the ruler of this island. What is your name?\" She asks. \"Alex.\" You reply. \"Now Alex, could you explain how you got here?\" She asks. You tell her about the storm and how you were thrown overboard. \"I see. So, you're from the outside world?\" She asks. You nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly becomes excited. \"This is wonderful!\" She says. \"Um, what's so wonderful?\" You ask. \"We've always known there were other lands across the sea, but we've never traveled to them. With you here, there are so many things you can teach us!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about me?\" You ask. \"What if I what to get back home?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what if there was no reason for you to leave?\" She asks. \"Do you have a family?\" You shake your head. \"No. My parents and I were never really close, and I can't stand my brothers. Also, every girlfriend I've had ended up stabbing me in the back, so I've just given up on women. So, I really have no one who would miss me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmm. Perhaps I can change his mind on the women thing.\" Kasmir thinks to herself. \"Well, it's settled then! You'll stay with us! We'll be like your new family, and you can teach us everything about your world! We both could benefit from this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't see any way you could argue, so you agree. \"Splendid!\" Says Kasmir excitedly. \"Now come. You must be tired after all you've been through.\" You gets up from her throne with you in her palm. She carries you through the titanic halls of her palace, bringing you to her bedroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the center of the room is a massive bead with silken sheets and several pillows. Kasmir lays down on the bed, setting you on her stomach. \"Now you just rest. I think I'll take a catnap myself.\" She closes her eyes and your \"bed\" rises and falls with her breathing. You lay down, snuggling into the soft fur. You begin rubbing and scratching her belly, causing Kasmir to purr loudly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you pass into sleep. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The tranquility of your waking was interrupted however as you felt something very large and wet move over you pressing you gently into the fur below. She was licking you, atleast that's what you thought until you felt the tongue wash over you a few more times. Finally you sat up making as if you were stirring from sleep although you just felt the tongue push you down again before you heard Kasmir's soft voice. \"Nice try, but I know you're up, if you're wondering about the licking, you need a bath and this is easier than walking all that way\" before you could react you felt Kasmir's tongue wrap around you and you were lifted up for a moment your facade of being asleep ending as you let out a small \"eek\" as she dropped you into an open palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were whisked up to her face, where you were greeted with a very large smile \"I don't remember asking for a bath your majesty\" you say standing up and attempting to wipe all the spit off your extermities. You heard the giantess giggle for a second before you felt her palm lift and you were gently pressed against her cheek for a few seconds before you were returned to the previous place in front of her face. \"I am the empress, I may do as I please, also I do believe I told you to call me Kasmir\" she says although any air of seriousness she had was dispelled by the large ear to ear grin on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed and looked up at her \"yes Kasmir\" you reply. \"So how was your nap?\" she inquires lowering her face closer to you, \"Oh it was excellent\" you reply seeing no reason tell anything but the truth, \"best sleep I've had in a long time, you take very good care of yourself, your fur is very soft and comfortable.\" Although you couldn't see it Kasmir blushed at the compliment, although most of her servants did compliment her on things such as her appearance, this was the first time she had ever heard one that seemed so heartfelt. Kasmir slowly stood up the grin that had been on her face before seeming to grow, if that was possible. Without warning she just started walking taking you along for the ride, \"um...Kasmir, do you mind telling me where you're going?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought we could go for a walk before dinner, I thought you might be interested in a personal guided tour of my home\" she says. You hesitate a second before answering \"That sounds great\" and with that she opened the door and the tour began. \"Legend states that hundreds of years ago, the Panthenon, our gods and goddesses, carved this castle out of a mountain so that the leader of the Anthronians, my ancestor may have a home that actually fit her, it took them only a week to create this whole castle. Each generation of ruler has added their own touches to the castle, my mother for example hand carved each of the statues you see lining the halls, and I added a garden to the center of the castle\" she finishes seeming quite proud of herself. You couldn't help but grin to yourself, the tour continued for a good hour, Kasmir pointing out things such as tapestries, furniture, and even whole rooms that her predecessors had built or added to the castle. Finally she ended the tour with the dining hall, to say it was massive was an understatement, the dining hall seeming to be fashioned after the ones of Midieval Europe with a ceiling about 3 times as tall as Kasmir and the room being large enough that it took her a minute to walk from one end to the other. The dining hall was furnished with a single table, although you were sure it was made up of more than one piece each piece fit so perfectly it looked like one long table that took up the center of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasmir walked to the head of the table, sitting in a high backed chair obviously meant for her as the \"chairs\" if you could call them that looked more like small watch towers with a ladder on the back for the person to climb their way up. Kasmir set you down on the table and was just about to say something when a loud, low horn blast cut her off. \"Oh, it seems we're right in time for supper. You weren't sure where they all came from but within minutes hundreds upon hundreds of anthros came streaming into the room, each anthro taking a place in a chair. You couldn't have counted more than 500 altogether, but something seemed amiss but you couldn't quite put your finger on it, you shrug it off for the moment instead focusing on the food being brought in by groups of anthros and then lifted onto the table by Kasmir. There were many strange creatures, a boar with a fin like a sailfish, what looked like some sort of rainbow coloured trout as well as a rabbit, although it had golden fur and was as large as you were. The drink was some sort of fruity drink made from what at least tasted like mangoes and peaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the meal had concluded one of the anthros, a fox woman approach Kasmir, \"your majesty?' she says Kasmir shooting her a look for a second causing her to back up for a second before clearing her throat \"I mean Empress Kasmir.\" Kasmir sighs and lowers her head to look at the fox \"yes Jaina what is it?\" she asks. \"Um...it's about the crops, the drought is still going on, we are in danger of losing the majority of this year's harvest\" Jaina says. Kasmir sighs like this had happened before \"do we have enough in the stores to make up for it?\" The fox woman nods and looks at a sheet of bark she was holding \"yes, but if we do that, well there will be no stores left\" she replies. Kasmir sighs and sits back in her chair, \"Um...Kasmir?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" she replies her eyes focusing more on the ceiling than you. \"Couldn't you just irrigate the crops to make up for the lack of water?\" you say. Kasmir bolts up, \"irri-what?\" she says her gaze focusing on you. \"Irrigation, it's a system of pipes or ditches that takes water from a source like a river and diverts it crops so they can use it\" you say. \"But, how would that get the water to the leaves\" Kasmir replies. \"Why would it need to get to the leaves?\" you ask. \"Plants take in water through their leaves\" she replies matter-of-factly. You literally facepalm \"Kasmir that is, that is false\" you reply. For the next 20 minutes you explained to Kasmir and who you learned was the head of food for the island how plants took in water the finer points of irrigation. Jaina ordering another anthro to bring more of the bark sheets and what looked like a stick of graphite wrapped in a leaf. By the time you had finished explaining she had used up all the bark sheets she had and was staring at you like you had just told her some mystic truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could stop her Jaina tackled you onto the table wrapping you up in a full body hug \"oh thank you, thank you, thank you, this is perfect, oh wait I must go and get this started\" she bolts up grabbing the notes she had written and ran off. You heard Kasmir chuckle for a second before you were knocked off your feet as she moved her palm underneath you and you were lifted up. \"See, I told you that we could help each other\" she says. Before you could say anything she moved forward and kissed you gently pressing you against her own palm. \"K-kasmir\" you say staring up at her in shock, you had never been expecting something like this. Kasmir for her part just smiled for a second before getting up and starting to walk. The two of you were silent as she walked, although you grew curious as she neared the throne room. She sat down in her throne placing you down on her armrest \"Marie\" she calls, a cat fur running to stand in front of her. \"I need.......</span></div></div>",

Marie pauses before running off and looks up at Kasmir \"would you like them to be held over the next 3 days?\" Marie asks. Kasmir nodded again and Marie ran off to fulfill her given order. You turned towards Kasmir, curiosity taking over, \"so what are these marriage trials you're talking about?\" you ask. Kasmir just smiled slightly for a second before replying \"unlike most of my people, as Empress I get to decide my mate, the trials are to prove that the male I have chosen is worthy of being emperor\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this'll be quite interesting\" you reply sitting back on the armrest, \"I get to see a very important part of your culture, so who's the lucky guy?\" you ask. Kasmir looked dumbstruck as you asked the question \"the one I have chosen is you, you didn't realize?\" she says her head tilted to the side in a confused expression. \"Oh well that's nice....wait me, why would you want me?\" you ask this making absolutely no sense to you. Kasmir waited long enough to lower her head to be level with you before answering you, \"did you see anything strange at dinner?\" she asks. \"Well now that you mention it, I did feel like there was something....off\" you reply. Kasmir nods slowly before giving off a small sigh \"my kingdom at the moment has a population of five hundred anthros, of those only twenty-five are male\" she says pausing to let what she said sink in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stood there for a second stunned at what you were hearing \"only 1/20th the population is male?\" you say stifling the urge to shout. Kasmir nodded slowly before outright sighing this time and laying her head down on the armrest \"yes, my people have always been plagued by a low male birthrate, so \"laying claim\" to a male as fast as possible is very important, although as Queen I get to decide who I choose, and I choose you\" she says her expression growing more cheerful as she spoke. \"I'm sorry if this is insulting Kasmir, but...why me?\" you ask. She smiles for a second, her fingers closing on the back of your shirt and she moved you closer to her face \"well for starters you're quite a smart man, you haven't even been here a day and you already solved a quite detrimental problem for my people. On top of that, you are quite....trusting as you instantly listened to my request, and yet you're willing to speak your mind around me\" Kasmir paused to set you down on the armrest before continuing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for the trials themselves, they are split into three: body, mind, and heart, you will also face each trial in that order\" she says. You nod slowly and she sops and seems to consider something before speaking again. \"The first two trials were created by me, back on my 18th birthday, they will of course have to do with me, although I may inform you right now that nothing such as facing me in combat will be required\" this information bringing a large sigh of relief from you. \"However I can only tell you one more things surrounding the trials. You may get clues for the trial, but they along with the instructions will only be issued on the day of the trial.\" You just sat there as Kasmir finished speaking trying to take in all that you had learned. <i>The trials had something to do with Kasmir, and thankfully it seemed like you would only need to do one per day.</i> \"What exactly happens if I fail one of the trials?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasmir looks at you quite sadly \"nothing will happen, although it'll make me very sad\" she says her voice dropping a few decibels. You walk forward and before you could stop yourself, you started stroking her cheek fur, suprisingly you felt Kasmir's head tilt in your direction so that you could stroke more of her cheek. After a minute of this Kasmir sat up \"I think it's about time we went to bed\" she says, before you were lifted and deposited into her palm. You looked out one of the windows Kasmir passed and you noticed that it was indeed later in the evening, the sun just peeking out behind a set of mountains in the distance, and painting the sky orange, and red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasmir reached her chamber in a moment and you were gently deposited on the bed before you heard her walk off. You weren't sure why but you looked up, Kasmir was standing near a dresser that stood against the wall, and as if she forgot you were there entirely she started undressing. You quickly turned away, holding you eyes down at the bed you heard the sound of cloth hitting the floor once, then twice and a drawer open then close. What surprised you was that you didn't hear anything after that except for Kasmir's footsteps for a few seconds before her fingers wrapped around you and you were lifted up. You felt Kasmir walk to the front of the bed, and then her body reclined as she lay down her hand gently depositing you on her stomach. \"You wouldn't mind doing what you did before, would you?\" Kasmir asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean pet-ting-you....\" you trailed off as you looked up to answer Kasmir, your voice failing you as not only did you see Kasmir's face but 2 very well-sized hills sitting between you and her. You quickly looked back down at her stomach and you felt her finger gently poke you a second later \"what's wrong? You looked up at me and then you...\" she trailed off as she seemed to realize what had caused you to falter. You felt Kasmir's finger gently wrap around you and you were lifted up and deposited quite quickly, \"open your eyes\" she says. You weren't sure why but you had the feeling you shouldn't so you shook your head. \"Open your eyes\" she says again this time adding a bit more of an authoritative tone to her voice. You slowly opened your eyes, a wall of white fur rising to a peak meeting your gaze. You felt your cheeks flush instantly freezing when you heard Kasmir speak \"well, be honest, how do I look?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-pardon?\" you reply having to fight to even speak you felt so embarassed. Kasmir gave off a small almost exasperated sigh \"I want to know what you think of me, I mean I would understand if you find me ugly\" she says. You quickly turned to face her \"that's not true...you're...\" you start but your not sure how to continue. \"I'm what?\" she asks curiosity practically dripping from the question. \"Well...you're the most beautiful creature I've ever seen, but more so than that you're kind, and gentle, beautiful in both mind and body\" you say. This time you did see her fur visibly redden, \"thank you\" she whispers, you were lifted up off her body before being lifted up to her face as she sat up, a deep purr starting as she brought you up to eye level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKasmir leaned forward and gently kissed you again, and this time you kissed her back, \"i'm sure you will pass all the trials with flying colours, now I think it's about time we got to sleep\" she says. Suprising you instead of setting you back on her stomach she set you down on her collarbone and curled up around you her, her hands laying over you holding you in place. It was the most comfortable you had ever felt, you started to gently stroke her fur elicting a soft purr from Kasmir. The two of you fell asleep like this content just to be with each other, you safe and sound surrounded by her warm body, and her content that she had finally found her true love.</span></div></div>",

Her hair is as black as night, and cascades down her back to her waist. She is dressed sort of like Jessica Rabbit, a tight red dress that hugs her body, showing of her voluptuous figure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirks as she beckons to you. \"Come closer.\" Her voice was cool and seductive, like a temptress baiting her prey. You step forward, mesmerized by her beauty. A delightful aroma seems to be emanating from her, it smelled of roses and honey, having sort of a calming effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, you would be terrified of such a gigantic creature, but her beauty, combined with her scent, caused quite the opposite. You calmly walked toward her, not scared in the least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached down and picked you up between her thumb and index finger, lifted you up, and placed you on the armrest of her throne. \"Now, my pet, would you mind telling me your name?\" You didn't even mind that she called you \"my pet\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Jacob.\" You say. \"What is yours?\" She laughed. It was no ordinary laugh, it almost sounded like a symphony of angels, a melodious, beautiful sound. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have many names.\" she says, smiling, showing her gleaming white teeth. \"But you may call me Fortune. Miss Fortune.\" She said with emphasis on \"Miss\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that introductions are out of the way, what shall I do with you?\" She says, putting a finger to her chin, thinking. \"If it isn't too much, I would like to go home.\" you say. Fortune leans down with a seductive look on her face. \"Why? What do you have at home that is so important? wouldn't you rather stay here with me? Forever?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she speaks, you stare into her emerald green eyes. Suddenly, you loose all reason and logic. There is only her beautiful face, and mesmerizing voice. You really do want to stay here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On second thought, there's nothing for me at home. I would like to stay here.\" You say in a dazed voice. \"Splendid.\" Says Fortune. \"Now, could you do something for me?\" she asks. \"Anything for you.\" You say, not even realizing what you are saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you.......\" </span></div></div>",

All credit for this one goes to him.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gaped open-mouthed up at the creature that even sitting towered above you. The very fits thing you noticed was that they're empress had to be a giraffe as it looked like her legs were atleast half her height while her smaller head sat on a larger then normal neck. Being a giraffe she was very slim which also meant that she was pretty much flat, but yet that didn't seem to detract from her body as a whole. You wouldn't say she was petite but comparing her to everyone else she looked a bit....underfed to you either that or she wasn't eating enough. Long slim legs and arms extended to a smaller body covered completely in a deep sea blue dress that billowed down to her hooves. Thankfully her arms ended in normal hands although her whole body was covered in yellow hair/fur that was blotched brown in an even pattern. On her head sat a very simple tiara that was pretty much just a golden circlet. Her face didn't reveal much except that her eyes stared down at you happily, yet there was something behind the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who might you be?\" the giraffe asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Alex, ma'am\" you say staring up at her. The giraffe slowly stands up and you gape, she was even taller then you thought, she had to stand at 400ft tall. The giraffe gently lowers herself to a kneeling position and holds out a hand, \"come here, I won't hurt you\" she says. For some reason you trust her and step onto her hand, she lifts you up to her face and smiles \"I am Gen and I am the empress of the nation, where did you come from?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou told her everything, you could she nodded at times and a look of concern crossed her face as you described how you drowned \"well I'm quite happy to hear that you survived, welcome to my kingdom of Anthroia\" she says still smiling. She stands up and moves sitting back down in her throne, you looked up at the gigantic giraffe and decided to ask what was on your mind \"ummm...your majesty\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please just call me Gen\" she says smiling down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I know we just met but are you unwell?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, why?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you seem quite skinny, even for a giraffe\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I eat quite well thank you\" she says, you raise a hand up and your able to trace the outline of one of her ribs in the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't look well fed to me\" you say. Gen stares at you for a few seconds before starting to cry, \"oh shit, oh shit, oh shit\" you think to yourself. \"Uh, it's alright, you still look very beautiful\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen shakes her head and slowly stops crying \"I know you didn't call me ugly, your right I haven't been eating well, I'm depressed and lonely and your the first one to say something about it\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depressed?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I was born the only child of the royal family and was raised to be better then everyone else, I didn't have any friends growing up and now that I finally am the empress everyone subjects, servants or otherwise treats me as such. I don't want to be seen as just the empress, I want some one to play with when i'm bored or just snuggle with when it's cold, some one to notice and speak up when I've done something wrong or when there's something wrong with me without fear of consequences. I, I just want someone to love and love me back\" she says bursting into tears again and burying her head into her hands. You were stunned to say the least and realize what you had seen in her eyes was pain, the pain of someone who had been mostly alone all their life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gen\" you say, she lifts her head and realizes you were still there, wiping away the tears she says \"I am sorry, I'm not acting very empress-like, let me find you a place to stay\" she says trying to smile again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gen I know we just met, so I know this will sound kind of weird, but can't I just stay with you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon?\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you said your lonely, and I've got no place to stay here, so can I stay with you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGen stared down at you, she lifted her hand up to her face \"really? You'd want to stay with me?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean if you don't want....\" you were cut off as she hugged you. \"Of course you can stay with me\" she says happiness evident in her voice, \"oh but you must be starved after all that you've been through\" she says standing up. She holds you as she starts walking with a purpose, letting you get a second look at the absolutely gigantic palace, the halls were lined with giant carpets made out of insane lengths of wool. She enters a gigantic dining hall which you couldn't even estimate the size, all you know is that the ceiling was probably 3 times Gen's height. She sits down at one end of the huge dining table and lifts a bell about the size of a church bell with her free hand ringing it before putting you down on her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of a bunch of side corridors run 3 different anthros all cats as they make it up to the top of the table in a matter of seconds. They all run up and kneel before Gen \"yes your empress\" the middle one which was covered entirely in black fur says without looking up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'd like a nice salad brought here, as well as a nice sing fruit\" she says. The 3 cats nod before running off to you assume fulfill her request. They come back in a few minutes with a bunch of other anthros, most were carrying a bowl of salad that Gen reached down and picked up lifting up to the table. One cat carried a fruit that looked like you took an orange and made it as long as a banana. Gen picked the fruit up after setting the salad down, she nodded at the servants \"thank you, you are excused for now\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey nodded and left although you were sure one of the wolves turned and stared in your general direction before walking away. You heard a tearing sound and you turn to see Gen skinning the fruit before setting the pink centre'd fruit down on the table. She lifts her hand up and you step on, she sets you down on the table and starts to eat the salad. You take that as a cue and dig into the fruit. The fruit tasted quite good, juicy yet tangy it was a very unique flavor, a taste you had definitely never tasted before but it was still excellent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it?\" Gen asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite good actually, how's the salad?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's heavenly, it's been a while since I last ate a good salad\" Gen says. You nod and dig back into the fruit, your able to eat about half the fruit and get yourself totally covered by the fruit's juices. Gen looks down at you and giggles \"can I have the rest of that?\" she asks pointing to the fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure go ahead\" you say, she picks up the other half of the fruit and tosses it into her mouth \"mmm nothing better then a juicy sing fruit\" she says. Smiling she lifts you up \"aww your all covered in the juice, well let me fix that\" Gen says. She lifts you up and starts licking you \"mmm sing fruit juice\" she says licking you faster and faster, in a minute you were totally soaked in her saliva. You glared up at the giraffe and she giggles \"sorry, I go a bit overboard around sing fruit\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's alright\" you say wiping saliva off yourself before you shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, are you cold?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah I'm fine\" you say before shivering again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I'll warm you up so....</span></div></div>",

She wants to have a regular life and pass on her throne to someone else, but being a giant dragon can cause difficulties outside the palace. She wears two gold bracelets on her wrists, a golden necklace on her neck, and a dark blue skirt that goes down to her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Two huge, bat-like wings protrude from her back. They are currently folded, so you can't tell how wide they are. Her eyes are a deep purple color, with slitted pupils, like a cat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo horns curl from the top of her skull to the sides of her head, almost making her look like a giant, scaly, winged mountain goat. She stares at you with a bored expression, head propped up in one hand. She drums the fingers of her other hand on the armrest of her throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come closer.\" She says with a dull tone, as though she's been through this a thousand times before. You step toward her, rather intimidated by her size. \"My name is Lenore, who are you?\" She says as though she were half asleep. \"Alex.\" You reply. \"Are you a human?\" She asks. You nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought so. You'd be surprised how many of you kind have washed up on my shores. All together, I think it's like 50.\" You stare up at her, wondering why she sounds so bored. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" You say. \"I don't mean to be rude, but you sound like you're not even interested in me being here.\" She scoffs. \"Didn't you hear what I just said? I've seen plenty of your kind, it's no big news. We even have a little district of the city cut off for them, so they don't end up getting stepped on.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs. \"I'm sorry, I've just been stuck in this dead end job for so long. You have no idea what it is like to rule a nation. People always begging you for advice, having to solve other people's problems, constantly having to make decisions, and that's just for starters!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you don't want to be queen?\" You ask. \"You got it.\" She says. \"I would give all this up in an instant, just to have a normal life, to be a regular citizen.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what if I could help you?\" You say.

The citizens of your Island will vote on who they want as their new ruler. You select some candidates that you think would make a good ruler, and whoever gets the most votes from the people will be the new queen.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this how your people's leaders are chosen where you come from?\" Asks Lenore. \"Yes.\" You say. \"But where I come from, we elect several leaders, because we use a different system. But I'm not trying to start a revolution here.\" \"You would do this for me?\" Says Lenore. \"Just so I can have some peace?\" \"Of course.\" You say. \"On one condition.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name it.\" Says Lenore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will do this election for you, if I get to stay here in the palace, as an honored guest.\" You say. \"Done!\" Says Lenore excitedly. \"You may stay with me until the election is over.

It's an improvement over her bored, sarcastic attitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she does something unexpected. She reaches down and picks you up between her finger, holds you up to her mouth, and kisses you. \"I can't tell you how much this means to me.\" She says. \"You must be hungry after what you've been through.\" She turns to her servants. \"Bring some food.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servants bow and run out of the room, returning a minute later, carrying a bottle, a plate of meat, and a bowl of fruit.

The meat was good, but tasted unlike any you had before, like a cross between chicken and steak. The fruit was very strange, such as what looked like an orange, but was purple and tasted like watermelon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you finish eating, Lenore picked you up and placed you on her shoulder. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d You ask as she gets up from her throne. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You stared up, transfixed by the radiant figure sitting in the the large ornately carved throne. You could tell that you were looking at a phoenix, but she was beautiful, resplendent, her gold and red plumage seeming to shine with their own inner light, each feather appearing as if a small flame. She was wearing in contrast to her bright red plumage a soft looking light blue cocktail dress with a small slit in the center creating a v between her breasts. Two quite large yellow eyes stared down at you over a small orange beak that seemed to you to twist up into a smile, although you weren't entirely sure. You froze as she slowly stood up and took a single step, her foot, which you now noticed was shaped like a bird's, 3-toed and clawed, landing probably 20 feet in front of you. She bent over her, your attention fixed itself solely on her form so you were caught by enough suprise to give a little yelp when you were lifted up, 2 clawed fingers taking hold of the back of your shirt. She lifted you up to face level and examined you as you swung in the air, every so often giving off a small hmm, or hah. Finally she took a step back and sat down in the chair her examination finished she held you out at what for her was about arms length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who and what are you?\" she asks, her eyes never once leaving you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me I-I'm Jake, and I'm a human\" you stammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing on my island?\" she asks, although you noticed a change in her voice it sounded sweeter. Without a moment's hesitation you launched into the story of how you got washed up onto the island, how you stumbled into the trap, were captured and finally brought before her. As you did her eyes slowly seemed to soften until you swear it looked like she was going to cry. She lowered you onto the arm of her chair her head coming to rest on her arm so you were practically looking at her face to face, or well close enough. \"I must apologize, for my earlier behaviour and my unnecesscary tone of voice. I did not know if you were a threat to my people or not\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok\" you reply quickly, \"although your majesty if I might ask, may I make a request\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Nepenthe, and I wish to be addressed as such, and yes you may\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since I seem to be no threat to your people, could I possibly go home?\" you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNepenthe stares at you for a couple seconds before shaking her head \"I'm sorry, but we can't let you leave, although you don't seem to be a threat to my people, I have heard things about the outside world and your people, so we can't risk you leaving as there is a chance you might lead them back here\" she says. You slowly nod, although you would have liked to head home, you could see her reasoning as to why they'd want to keep you there. You had to look somewhat depressed as you felt her finger start to gently stroke across your back \"don't worry, you can live here as a citizen of my kingdom\" she says her voice soft and calm to soothe you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at her large face \"thank you, although I'm not entirely sure what I could do for you\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNepenthe takes a second to think \"well I do need an advisor, do you think that you could do that?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can try\" you reply. She lifted her hand up and you were deposited onto her shoulder before snapping her fingers, the guards at the door rushed over to stand in front of her throne \"yes your majesty\" one says her head bowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may inform everyone that I am finished with the new arrival and that he is officially a citizen of our island as well as my advisor, also I am free to adress any complaints or grieviances anyone might have\" she states. The guards both quickly bowed again and raced off to fufill their order, Nepenthe and you just waited for a few minutes, her fingers drumming on the arm of the throne as she seemed to be quite bored. The guards returned with a group of 6 amazons, 5 female and 1 male, although all seemed to be some variant of a wild cat. One guard stopped at the door while the other led the group to the front of Nephente's throne. \"What is the problem?\" Nephente asks leaning over although careful not to have you fall off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All 6 of these women claim to be the woman that this man loves, although he claims only one of these women is the one he loves and the others just sires\" the guard states. You looked down at the group, all 6 were in some way or another clinging onto the guy, and you couldn't help but take a few seconds to wonder about this whole \"sire\" thing before Nephente speaks. \"Which one of you is the one he loves?\" she asks. In a second each yells \"me\" and then they literally growl at the rest of the group Nepenthe sighs and slumps back into her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you just ask the male, which of them he loves?\" you whisper into her ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would, but we are a matriarchal society, I cannot make a decision based solely on a male's word\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, ouch\" you think. \"Do you mind if I give it a try?\" you ask as you had heard a story like this before. She nods her head \"if you can fix this, you are welcome to try\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clear your throat and Nepenthe sits back up giving you a better vantage point \"each of you claims to be the one this man loves?\" you ask. Each female cat in turn nods their head, and you can't help but smile \"very well then, there is only one solution, since each of you loves him we will divide him into 5 pieces and he will be shared equally among you\" you state. Instantly the room goes silent except one girl a leopardess rushes forward practically throwing herself in front of the throne \"please Empress not that, that would kill him, we...we can share him without that step if we must\" she cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNepenthe seems to have figured out your plan as you looked over to see a small smile on her beak, \"that action will not be necesscary, it is obvious that you are the one who loves him the most and I assume from how much he is fidgeting back there, he loves you back\" the leopardess just stared up at her. \"Guards if you would please remove the others\" the two guards removed the other felines from the male and he rushed over to the leopardess the two embracing each other. You got a lot of cold stares as the other felines stalked out fo the room, the leopardess and what you now realized was a lion stared up at you happily. \"Thank you Empress, thank you\" the leopardess says before the two of them are led out of the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNepenthe lifts you up off her shoulder \"that was a very wise thing to do\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug, \"it wasn't that hard, besides I've read a story where something similar happened\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am still most impressed, to be honest I was completely stumped as to what should have been done\" she says. She moves her other arm and puts you down in her palm, \"Nepenthe may I ask a question?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may\" she replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did they mean with that sire thing?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a large imbalance in my kingdom between males and females, I cannot stop love from sprouting, but I cannot just let my citizens who wish to be mothers go their lives without children. So a male may have one love, be it of an inital claim which grew into love, or because it was more...sudden, any women other than his love may still bear children by a male as long as he is virile, but his love is the only one who he is expected to take care of, I believe they're called a wife in your society\" Nepenthe replies. You slowly nod, it made sense, you weren't sure if you agreed with it but it made sense. Nepenthe opens her mouth again as if to speak</span></div></div>",

Instead, she places you on the floor and motions for you to step back. \u201cDo not be alarmed by what you are about to see.\u201d She says. \u201cIt is perfectly natural.\u201d You take several steps backwards, you still have no idea what she is talking about. Suddenly, you can make out smoke rising up from underneath Nepenthe\u2019s dress. \u201cNepenthe! You\u2019re\u2026!\u201d You begin, but Nepenthe raises a hand to silence you. \u201cI told you.\u201d She says. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less time than it takes for you to blink, Nepenthe bursts into flames! You gasp loudly as bright red fire instantly covers her entire body. But there was something strange about this whole situation, other than Nepenthe spontaneously combusting. For one thing, she didn\u2019t seem to be in any pain. She just sat there in her throne, a calm expression on her face. Instead of the smell of something burning, the room quickly filled with the aroma of fresh roses and lilac. But strangest of all was the guards. They didn\u2019t looked panicked at all. They stood at their posts, staring at the sight of their ruler burning alive as though it were a normal thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNepenthe stands from her throne, still burning, and stands in the center of the room, a living tower of flames. In about a minute, where Nepenthe once stood now sits a massive pile of ashes. For a second or two, you stand there staring at the great heap of soot, stunned by the spectacle you have just witnessed. Finally, you regain enough of you senses to blurt out, \u201cWhat the hell was that!?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the guards in the room approach the ashes as begin digging through them, searching for something. One of them, a tabby cat, who introduces herself as Samantha, explains what just happened. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you had to see that so suddenly without an explanation.\u201d she says. \u201cYou see, Empress Nepenthe has ruled Anthronia since our civilization\u2019s beginning. As a phoenix, when her life nears it\u2019s end, she bursts into flames as you just saw, and is reborn from the ashes.\u201d As she says this, one of the guards digging through the ashes calls out, \u201cI found her!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard, a female wolf, emerges from the ash pile, carrying a small chick that looks as though it had just broken through it\u2019s egg. You have to admit, that Nepenthe was much more beautiful as an adult. In her newborn state, she has no plumage, and is rather hard no look at. But you know you had better keep that thought to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what happens now?\u201d You ask Samantha. \u201c Nepenthe has no heirs.\u201d She says. \u201cShe normally selects someone to rule in her place until she grows up again, but she failed to do so this time.\u201d She turns to face you. \u201cSo, as her advisor, the responsibility falls to you.\u201d Once again, you think you think you had misheard her. \u201cCome again?\u201d You ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is the law that should the empress fail to choose a successor, the royal advisor shall be ruler for the time being.\u201d Samantha explains. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never had such responsibility, much less so suddenly!\u201d You say. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about ruling a nation!\u201d Samantha shrugs. \u201cSo it was with all of Nepenthe\u2019s previous replacements. Alternatively, you could choose someone else to rule in your place. It\u2019s your choice.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow long does it take for Nepenthe to become fully grown again?\u201d You ask. \u201cAbout a decade.\u201d Says Samantha. \u201cGive or take a year or two.\u201d This is a huge weight that has so suddenly befallen you. Ruling your own nation does sound rather tempting, even if it is only temporary. On the other hand, you\u2019re not sure you would be up to the job. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, what will it be?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sounds of the group were nearly gone until out of nowhere an ear-piercing wail started up behind you startling both you and Samantha. You turned to see Nephente thrashing and wailing like she had just been stung by a bee, the wolf guard as well as the others were having a tough time holding her still. You and Samantha quickly ran back to the group of guards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" you ask concern quite evident in your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know, she just started crying and thrashing\" the guard replies grabbing onto one of Nephente's flailing limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Empress please settle down, it's alright\" Samantha says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nephente please stop crying\" you say turning your attention to her small thrashing form. Near instantly she stops crying and thrashing, You as well as everyone else give off a small sigh of relief as she settled down, so you turned and started to walk back towards the doors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made it a foot before you felt someone grab your shoulder and you turned to see Samantha staring at you, \"where are you going, didn't you just see what happened?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Nephente stopped crying, now we can go choose her successor\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha gives off a soft sigh and turns toward the wolf guard \"Ila would you please hand him the empress\" she says. Ila eyed you for a second before sighing and reaching out her arms. You slowly and carefully take Nephente from her and the effect is near instant, Nephente gives of a soft contented sigh and cuddles herself into the crux of your arm her head laying on your arm as she near-instantly falls asleep as you hold her. Ila gave off a sharp gasp and you turned to see Samantha smiling softly at you, \"it looks like Empress Nephente has taken quite a liking to you, good thing you didn't want to be emperor as now you can't, you're going to be taking care of the Empress as she grows up\" she says matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait, I can't take care of her, I've never raised a kid, besides you said she's going to grow back to normal during those ten years\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she'll grow about an inch a day and should mature mentally about 2 years for each of the next 10 years\" Samantha replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing some mental math you froze as you made a realization \"how am I supposed to control a 90ft tall 6 year old?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't be taking care of her alone, all of us will be there to help you, after we find the next successor for Nephente of course, so for now you and Ila are in charge of her majesty\" Samantha says before turning and walking away. You just stood there stunned as Samantha and the 13 other guards walked away, turning as you felt a light tap on your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to leave\" Ila says leading you to the wall behind Nephente's throne, she pushes against one of the panels and it moves backwards a foot allowing her to slide it to the side into an alcove, revealing a secret passage. You honestly weren't surprised at the moment as this was easily the most tame thing you had seen today, Ila motions for you to walk forward allowing her to seal the passage back up behind the two of you. You heard rather then saw her grab a torch from the wall and ignite it, thankfully the sudden sound nor the light woke Nephente up. Ila took the lead position as the two of you walked along the passage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how long has Nephente, been doing this?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Centuries\" Ila replies \"we believe her body to maintain her immortality must revert back to childhood so she can basically rest and rejuvenate, without all the worries of the island and it's people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does, does she remember everything?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We believe she does, although when she actually matures back to normal is anyone's guess\" Ila says turning and sweeping the torch ahead as she saw some cobwebs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where exactly are we going to live, Nephente is going to be 150ft tall in 5 years\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it, that's actually the reason why we only live on one half of the island, the other half is covered by a set of houses for Nephente and her caretakers to live in while she grows back up, there's one for 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 and finally 300ft, the last house is mainly used inn the final days before she goes back to being Empress, sort of like a vacation house\" Ila replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really calm about this\" you say eying Ila, it was strange, you were mentally freaking out while she was acting like this was nothing more than a simple walk in the park. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, most of the guards were told about this, and we were trained from birth for this day to come\" Ila says. You couldn't do much else but nod as it made sense, if you were going to suddenly burst into flames to be reborn as a baby, you'd tell someone about it and make other preparations. Although that made you wonder why Nephente hadn't named a successor, but then again maybe she didn't have control over when she became a living pyre and it caught her off guard. Finally the tunnel opened up revealing an expansive jungle with what looked like no more than an animal trail snaking through the trees. Ila snuffed out the torch and threw it to the side before pulling out a sword and starting to proceed down the trail. You followed closely behind, not wanting to get lost as she was your guide, that and you were carrying Nephente. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took the two of you a couple of minutes to reach a clearing. Ila kept moving as she breached the trees, but you froze on the spot. Standing in front of you was a simple log cabin, single wooden door, two small windows windows on either side and a simple chimney, this had to be the first cabin Ila was talking about, but the sheer enormity of the structure still blew you away. Ila turned and you heard her loudly sigh before gently grabbing onto your shoulder and pulling you towards the giant cabin, \"Nephente's homes needed to be this large as she can always grow into them, but she can't become smaller\" Ila says pulling you towards the door. She lets you go long enough to open up a smaller door set in the frame of the much larger one and issues you inside closing the door behind you. Nephente chose this exact moment to wake up, her eyes scanning the enormous entrance area you found yourselves in, sadly she also chose this time once she was finished to start crying. Ila stared at you for a second, however since she didn't calm down you knew she wasn't worried that you weren't there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think she wants?\"</span></div></div>",

She also likes to gamble when she plays however, and if they can't answer the riddle, she eats them. If they can get it right, she owes them a favor.

Well the VERY little amount of floor showing. Most of the \"Palace\" was a HUGE pool of water that looked EXTREMELY deep (It's deeper than you could EVER imagine). \"Empress, I wish to speak with you.\" The Skunk  anthro who brought you here shouted. A few seconds after the Skink girl shouted this what looked like a giant human women emerged from the pool of water. Even though it was just the top half of her body she was still like 70 feet tall. \"Y-Yes Minora?\" The girl says in a quiet, shy, and soothing voice. She then layed eyes on you. She then reached her hand down palm up, and said \"Come closer little one.\". Seeing as how you were in some place you don't know, and you don't want someone that size mad at you. You walk up to her hand and get on. She then carefully lifts you up to her face and says quiet, shyly, and in a very soothing voice \"W-W-What are y-you?\". \"I-I'm a human.\" You manage to say. She shows a look of confusion ad replies \"Human... W-W-Whats th-that?\". You are now completely confused by her answer (You can only see her top half witch LOOKS human). \"I found him on the beach, and brought him to you, Empress.\" The Skunk guard who you now know as Minora said as she bowed. \"H-H-How did y-you get here s-small one?\" She asked. You then explain to here all about what happened with your boat, and how you were washed up here. \"Oh my! Th-That sounds a-a-awful!\" The Empress says in reply to your explanation. \"Would you like me to leave now Your Majesty?\" Minora asked. \"I'd l-like, y-yes.\". Minora then leaves the \"Palace\" and leaves you and the Empress alone.

This is not originally mine)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour boat is caught in a violent storm and you are thrown overboard. You wash up on an island, populated by anthro amazons. The amazons are ruled by their empress, a giantess anthro. Where the story goes, depends on who that anthro is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. The main character can be eaten, just no digesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2.There are now more than enough options for an empress, so no more adding any new ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Write at least 2 to 3 paragraphs per chapter <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Most of the amazons are ten feet tall, there there are a few that are bigger. The empress is always the biggest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. In most storylines, the males of the island are either slaves, hiding in the jungle, or non-existent. If there are males inhabiting the city, as citizens or not, make it evident early in the storyline<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. Sorry to any females reading this, but the main character is always male<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. No explicit sexual content. This isn't another fetish story, I want it to have actual plot. You can imply it, but don't graphically describe it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Have fun! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you read the story, you may have some questions as to certain elements of the story, such as why humans haven\u2019t found the island, or why the anthros speak English. Some of them may be answered in the storylines, but if you haven\u2019t read them, then just remember the MST3K theme song. Just repeat to yourself \u201cIt\u2019s just a story, I should really just relax.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the way, the official name of the island is \u201cAnthronia\u201d. Any other name for it appearing in the story is either incorrect or a misspelling.<br>\r\n  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd also, another writer by the name of \"Falcon\" has posted a copy of this story titled \"Island of the Furries\". This version has all the anthros at normal human height, and includes the characters of Eric W Schwartz. It's rather amusing to me really. Here's a link. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1764611-Island-of-the-Furries\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1764611-Island-of-the-Furries</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's all for now.
