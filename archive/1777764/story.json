And the banana smoothie looks good too... Add hash browns and eggs to go with the sausage links please. And a coffee. And a cheesecake.\" Nat said. The waiter writes the order down and hurries away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're a cheerleader?\" Nat asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm a cheerleader. I've been one since high school, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cool. I'm a chef in training. Been kind of a dream of mine since I was little. My Dad is a doctor and philanthropist, my Mom's a well known author.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen minutes of getting to know each other later, the food arrives. Kelly's one dish is placed in front her with her drink while a giant stack of pancakes followed by other multiple dishes is placed in front of Nat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mm-mm...\" Nat moans as she bites into her pancakes. She eats quickly, so quickly it doesn't even look like she is chewing her food. Kelly eats her fruit salad and tries not to stare. Nat finishes her pancakes and calls the waiter for a refill. She eats the rest of her food, slurping the smoothie and gobbling down the eggs, while she waits for her pancakes. The waiter comes back with another stack twice as big and Nat gobbles it down. By now, Kelly has finished eating. Nat finally finishes, and lets out a small burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me.\" She giggles. She pats her bloated tummy that rest on her jiggly thighs. \"You know, this is a waste of money. I'm gonna get my moneys worth.\" She flags the waiter and gets four more over sized plates of pancakes. She sets one in front of Kelly. \"I know you want more than just a fruit salad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's on me!\" Kelly gives in and digs in. She actually ends up enjoying the warm pancakes. Nat eats and until not a crumb is left on any of the three plates. He shirt now rises up slightly to show the girth in her belly. She looked like she was in an early pregnancy, her stomach was so tight. Kelly's hardly even bulged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNat insisted on paying for them both, and left a big tip for the waiter. She and Kelly left and went back to their dorm room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what?</span></div></div>",

Her breasts were only just into the B cup range, thanks to the 'dreaded' freshman 15 bringing her up to a modest 125lbs. She seemed genuinely passionate about sports, but also an even tempered girl outside of competitive sports. Unfortunately, she  also appeared to be horrendously absent minded, having nearly left her handbag behind were it not for Kelly scooping it up at the last minute and handing it back to her. She also was a tremendous tomboy, with her hair sheared nearly to crew cut length, baggy shirt and man jeans (although Kelly suspected that had more to do with a mishap with a boyfriends wardrobe than a preference). The girl also had a round face with blue eyes and a button nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're better off not on the team!\" Linda stated, almost insulting Kelly before explaining\"Most of the cheerleaders this year fulfil the stereotype in the worst ways. It would've been a nice change of pace to see an actually nice person on the squad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly decided to not leave Linda hanging \"Speaking of the team, why'd you choose to go for the soccer team?\" Earning a perplexed look from Linda, \"Why not try to be the 'nice person' on the cheer squad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda laughed loudly, earning the attention of several other pairs. \"Honestly, I'm not one to sit on the sidelines cheering, and I'm more 'one of the boys' than anything else.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis didn't surprise Kelly, who took in her ensemble and noted a distinct lack of any form of makeup on the girls face. She wouldn't have managed to make the very stringent appearance protocals and probably would've hated it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And here's the campus mess, my favourite place,besides the soccer field.\" Linda said expansively, earning a look of shock from Kelly as she indicated the large food court. \"What? I need a lot of food to keep me running.\" She said a little defensively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly couldn't help looking at her tomboy roommate like she was mad. \"Why would... what about boys?\" Feeling her point was clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boys? Some of my best friends are boys!\" Completely missing the point and also confirming some very dire suspicions that Kelly had about Linda's character.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, do you <i>like</i> boys?\" Kelly rephrased<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\" Linda exclaimed \"O-of course, just not all that much.\" She paused, looking slightly concerned, \"I prefer girls, in that way. That's... not going to be a problem. Is it?\" She took a slightly pleading expression. \"I'm don't force people in that way. I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I see, well, it's more of a surprise than a major problem.\" Kelly said, a little shaken. At least it was out in the open before something embarrassing happened. However, now Kelly was at a loss for any way to continue the conversation. Fortunately, fate was kind and offered an out in the form of a classically built young man waving a pair of girls jeans above his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Linda!\" He called, running towards the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nate!\" The redhead turned, \"Oh, I got our pants mixed up, again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, they must've got switched when we woke up at Ricks.\" The blonde boy said, handing them over. \"Who's your friend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Kelly, my roommate!\" Kelly waved \"Kelly, this is Nathan Balder\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just Nate, and the names from norse mythology.\" The boy, who had a rather thin, long face glanced at Linda \"Hey, is she...\" He left it trailing,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, she's just my roommate, for now.\" Linda turned and grinned at Kelly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't get too many ideas, girl.\" Kelly, said, eyeing her with mock defensiveness<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan adopted a overdone pained expression, \"Agh! Well, there go my fantasies.\" He voice then took a more cautious than jovial note. \"I don't suppose if you'd be up for a date with me, if you aren't with Linda?\" again adding the last line with a fresh dose of humor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly giggled, taking a likewise overdramatic thoughtful expression \"Hmm, give me your number and I'll get back to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair shared numbers with Nate saying, \"Thanks, you're more fun than Linda's roommate last year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously this sentence was a mistake, as the atmosphere seemed to drop several degrees after this. Linda's expression hardened, not quite angry but definitely displeased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'll be going now!\" The boy said quickly before walking away with suspicious swiftness<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that about?\" Kelly said, turning a questioning eye to the redheaded girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Freshman year roommate, Tabitha Cleane.\" The tomboy replied with a tersely and with rage disrupted grammar \"She wasn't understanding of my... interests and went way out of her way to be nasty, including spreading rumours and messing with my stuff. It got so bad I started only hanging with boys outside of my soccer team.\" She paused, gathering herself, \"I guess that's why I'm not a fan of stereotypical cheerleaders, you might say.\" She concluded much more calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLinda waved it off. \"It doesn't matter. Anyway, enough deep stuff, it's about lunch time, so I'll buy you something to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" Kelly replied.</span></div></div>",

After a bit of research, Kelly ascertained knowledge of an all female wrestling team on campus. Filled with elation Kelly immediately tried to find the team and join them. Being the most skilled girl on her high school team, she was certain she'd be accepted if not instantly made team captain. Wearing a black sports bra and gym shorts, Kelly joyfully rushed to the gym were the team was located, her mind was running with images of athletic girls wrestling and working out. Her excitment peaked as she reached the matted room, however Kelly's enthusiaism was swiftly replaced with consternation. What manifested before Kelly wasn't her fantasy female athletes but a room filled with fat girls in bikinis pressing their squishy bodies against each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um is this the girls' wrestling team?\" Kelly asked noticably bewildered causing one of the fatter girls turned towards Kelly and approached her. \"Sure is. You looking to join?\" asked the obese girl who had long flowing black hair, smooth white skin, and wore a jacket over her bikini with the title captain on it. \"Yes I wanna join the wrestling team. So if you could tell me were it is I'd appreciate it.\" Kelly said. \"Well look no further girl, you found it. I'm the captain, name's Sheri.\" stated the captain reaching her hand out to Kelly. \"Wait you mean that 'this' is the wrestling team?\" questioned a visibly irritated Kelly. \"Yup, we make up the school's illustrious sumo team.\" Sheri happily answered. \"Sumo? Um how do I put this but sumo's not really a sport. I mean you're all fat. There's no way ladies such as yourself could be viewed as athletes.\" Kelly scoffed. \"Hey whats that supposed to mean?\" Sheri replied converting her amiability into justified anger. \"Heh well everyone knows that fat people are helpless. Especially fat girls like yourself who can barely move. Theres no way that any of you could make it in real wrestling.\" stated the insolent Kelly. Suddenly all the fat girls gathered behind Sheri who than challenged Kelly. \"Oh really! You think fat girls are push overs huh? Well I challenge you to a match.\" \"Are you sure? I don't think it'd be good for your health tubby.\" the overconfident girl insulted. \"I'm more worried about your frail body.\" Sheri warned tying her long hair in a pony tail and removing her coat, leaving her in nothing but a bikini. \"Ha tell ya what if you beat me I'll join your silly little sumo team.\" added Kelly. \"Good but you'll be put on our strict routine and you must completely comply and adhere to our unwavering regiment.\" Sheri added. \"Deal\" Kelly accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly and Sheri entered the ring, with all of the sumo girls vehemently cheering for Sheri. The two girls face each other. Kelly now gets a good look at Sheri. Sheri was about 5ft4in weighing perhaps 250pounds. Her arms were laden with hanging flab, her belly was massive and covered her bikini bottom, her thick legs were wobbly but held her heavy body, her wide ass, graced with cellulite, stretched her tight bikini, and then there was her enormous bust staring Kelly right in the face. \"Begin!\" yelled a girl. Kelly rushed into Sheri, wrapping her arms around her fleshy waist. But Sheri's flab swallowed Kelly's arm. Sheri grabbed her smaller opponent and using her weight advantage took control of Kelly's body throwing her to the floor and pouncing on her. Kelly suddenly found herself buried under Sheri's fat, utterly helpless Kelly's arms couldn't liberate her. Feeling the pain Kelly tapped out and accepted defeat. Sheri's fellow teammates rejoiced her victory, bouncing their jiggly bodies in joy. Sheri than helped Kelly up saying \"Welcome to the team.\" with a smile on her face. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kelly read that she'd have to eat with the team four times a day, she wasn't permitted to exercise outside of practice, and she had to maintain a weight above 200 pounds. Kelly was horrified \"But  but I can't do this!\" \"Don't fret Kelly, Its real easy, just stick with us.\" Sheri said putting an arm around the newbie. \"Come on we've got one of our mandatory meals to go to.\" Sheri said pulling Kelly along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team enters the cafeteria, still wearing their wrestling bikinis but now covered by the team jackets. \"Here Kelly take a seat between Mary and Gwen I'll go get your meal.\" Sheri said.

The girls were still somewhat agitated from Kelly's earlier remarks. Sheri than came with a cart bearing their meals. \"Mmmm mmm\" \"Yum\" \"Finally!\" said various anxious girls licking their lips. Kelly stared at the food before her, a huge platter filled with pasta smothered in cheese, lots of buttered bread, and a huge milkshake. Kelly struggled to consume her unfamiliar dish but Gwen and Mary were happy to help scooping food up and cramming it in her mouth as was often with new recruits. Eventually the meal found shelter in her stomach rendering it swollen over her shorts. \"Good work Kelly you're well on your way to acceptance.\" Sheri announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere was Kelly a girl who routinely exercised and dieted assiduously now lounging about with her augmented gut unable to move. \"Good give your body rest help it convert all that food into fat.\" Sheri said rubbing Kelly's belly. \"Now meet here in 2 hours for another meal.

Her mother had made excuse after excuse about how she would grow out of her chubbiness, or that it was all just puppy fat that would melt away when she got through puberty. The pounds had refused to budge, and by the time she was thirteen, there was no other excuse Kelly's mother could make. Her daughter was fat. Her thighs rubbed together when she walked, and her belly jiggled with every step she took. Matters weren't helped by the fact Kelly had a love for food. Rich food, fast food, sweet food, there wasn't a single food type she disliked. Kelly would happily wolf down salads, her problem was that she simply had too much of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of that changed the very next summer, when Kelly's mother sent her to fat camp. Kelly returned slimmer, with a reduced appetite, and an almost distaste for the food she once loved. The pounds continued to come off over the next few years, revealing a lean, toned body underneath the flab; a lot of the boys who had once tormented her for being fat were suddenly interested, and the girls who used to make fun of her behind her back were suddenly whispering in jealousy instead. For all intents and purposes, being thin had changed Kelly's life for the better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was something still missing. Despite herself, Kelly couldn't bring herself to be happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt seventeen years old, Kelly stood at 5'4, weighing a fairly average 126lbs. She wore her dark brown hair long, two lone curls falling either side of her grey-blue eyes. Her skin was a little pale, and mostly flawless. She sighed as she tucked several strands of hair back behind her ear, gazing up at the student accommodation that was to become her home for the next three years. She was nervous, she had never been away from home before, and her parents had dropped her off at the train station just hours ago. She sighed, chiding herself for acting so childish, and slung her bag over her shoulder as she made her her way into the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she had gotten to the fifth floor, she was only just out of breath, her eyes glancing from door to door to try and find the apartment she would be sharing. On finding it, she retrieved the key she had been given, and pushed open the door. Right before her eyes was her room mate who she would be spending the rest of the year with.

To be fair, at one point Kelly had been fatter, but, right now, De outweighed her by at least 25 or 30 pounds. Not that it was a bad thing.

Part of Kelly felt ashamed of her weight gain after being told for so many years that being fat was bad, but with the lack of control over her eating habits she felt a rush over finally being able to eat whatever she wanted. Over the past week, her tastebuds had a new lease of life. Everything Kelly had eaten since she got to college tasted as if it was a whole new experience with each bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew this was part of the reason her weight had crept on already. There was just something about the exploring new flavours, it had become almost addicting. It also didn't help that at any opportunity she had, De would encourage her to have 'just one more bite' or say something like \"you've got barely anything left, just finish it off\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince De was a little big, she knew she was picking up some bad habits from her. The fact that De always piled her plate high, Kelly felt she had to fill her plate similarly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they got to the cafeteria, Kelly was practically ravenous. Her body was so used to being stuffed to its limit and the almost-constant snacking (De had what seemed like an unlimited snack collection) that her appetite had grown considerably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout batting an eyelid, Kelly piled her plate high with fries, adding queso, chilli and bacon on top before adding two fried chicken breasts. De smiled as she saw Kelly pile her plate high with unhealthy food, grabbing four large slices of meat feast pizza for herself before adding one to Kelly's plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly playfully scolded De, but didn't give it back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter less than a half hour, both girls had almost finished their overflowing plates of food, the only thing left on De's plate was the dry crusts. Even a mix of ranch and garlic mayo couldn't make their cardboard texture taste good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Kelly was polishing off the last mouthfuls of her rich banquet, De got up to grab them both dessert, her bloated belly sticking out slightly under her baggy tee. Kelly was unaware of the fact that her overfed belly was so close to touching the table, that her tee was almost exposing her gluttony to the few people surrounding them. Kelly had just finished her meal, leaning back and rubbing her tight tummy when De brought over a loaded sundae for each of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly wiped her mouth and groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"De, I told you I was giving up dessert!\" Kelly gasped, trying not to burp as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDe sighed, \"I know, but you can't make me eat dessert alone.\" She frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly huffed and gave in, grumbling as she grabbed her sundae and spoon and dug in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Later that night*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly struggled as they made their way into the dorm building, feeling winded after eating way too much food. She clutched her belly as they made their way to the elevator, not caring that her shirt was clearly not going to sit over her hard, heavy belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to their room, Kelly instantly collapsed on the bed, moaning into her pillow as her belly pressed into her mattress.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Making no attempt at all to learn how to cook, Kelly took advantage of her quite large allowance that her parents spoiled her with. The closest she got to making her own meals was buying cereals (cocoa puffs, kinds not special-K kinds) and chips and eating those out of the container. Actually, scratch that. She did prepare her own poptarts if she didn't want them straight out of the package. For all her other food requirements she went out to eat. Not having time to go somewhere of quality every lunch and dinner, most often she would just pull up to BK and get a Whopper with fries to go. Had she not enjoyed using the warm weather to swim, she doubtless would have gained more. However, as it was, she gained about 10 pounds (a bit less than 5 kilos) over the summer by the time she was just about ready to head off for college.</span></div></div>",

Chocolate chip pancakes, waffles, french toast, donuts, oatmeal, bacon, sausage, eggs, (whole) milk to drink, cinnabons, and biscuits with gravy. There was at least a full meal's worth of every food, and Kelly couldn't wait to dive in.<br>\r\nShe started with the pancakes, drenched in syrup with a heaping of butter melting on each one.

Disregarding the fork at hand, she simply rolled them up and ate them like empty burritos. Then she had the idea to fill the rolled up pancakes with what scrambled eggs she had left. She would put a big scoop of scrambled eggs onto a pancake, fold it over the eggs, and eat it from the end. The remaining french toast went in the same way. Kelly then noticed that though all the food was gone, there was still a bottle and half (she'd started with 3) of syrup left. Wondering what it would taste like by itself, she took the half full bottle and put it to her lips, squeezing until about an ounce of sweet, goopy syrup flowed into her mouth. She immediately fell in love. All these years she'd been wasting syrup putting it on pancakes! She then held the bottle above her mouth and tried to pour it in, not caring that she became a sticky mess, only caring about the deliciousness that made its way into her mouth. Wanting more, she put the full bottle to her lips and began to chug it as fast as she could while still savoring the taste. Kelly was now sprawled out on her bed wearing nothing but a tank top that had been pushed up nearly three inches by her belly, and some panties obviously straining to contain her new pudge. She was also covered in sticky syrup all over while drinking directly from another syrup bottle. This made quite the scene for her sister (a year younger than her, but same body type as Kelly had at graduation) who walked by the open door then. Seeing her sister, who has gained significant weight and was now on her bed scantily clad covered in sticky syrup surrounded by empty food plates and donut boxes, her sister knew then that she would give in to her deepest childhood desire, which was to become the largest woman in the world. Until now, she'd been too concerned about what other people thought, and struggled daily to keep her weight in check. But seeing Kelly in her exposed condition gave her the slight push she needed to pursue her life's goal. How does she want her sister to be involoved? Keep in mind Kelly is so far oblivious to any change in her weight whatsoever.</span></div></div>",

She had always thought that would be an asset, but her gangly frame didn't seem to be garnering the attention she had hoped for.  As a result, she made a decision around the holidays: she was going to become curvy by the time she went to college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought it would be easy - people got fat all of the time, especially at the holidays, right?  She feasted at family gatherings, and was constantly full.  She went to bed sweating at night as her body burned calories like a furnace.  Despite all of the turkey, ham, sweet potatoes, and enough cookies, cake, candy, and pie to supply candy land, she returned to school after her winter vacation at exactly the same weight, 115 pounds.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough she was frustrated, she was undeterred and decided to step up her game.  She bought weight gain supplements and snacked constantly.  By spring break, she celebrated a 10 pound gain.  While no one else noticed, Kelly could feel it.  The sweating at night had stopped, and she was able to handle her scheduled shakes and snacks more easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy graduation, she had added 20 more pounds, and she wasn't the only one who noticed now.  She had finally moved out of a size 0 and into a 2.  Her board-like body was developing curves; she had respectable breasts for the first time in her life, and her bony legs had become shapely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she wasn't done - she wanted to be CURVY, and this was just normal in her view.  So she continued her routine with great determination.  The summer made things more challenging because of the heat, but Kelly found that ice cream worked well as a go to snack food, and she packed it in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the summer, Kelly's transformation was complete.  On the day before she left for college, she admired her hard work in the mirror.  She wore a bikini that she had bought at the beginning of swimsuit season, and it was strained, but Kelly was loving it.  Her breasts had surpassed respectable and were now BIG, like almost DD BIG.  She had a poochy belly that mushroomed over a bikini bottom that her butt was forcing to act as a thong.  She weighed 164 pounds, and she was every bit as pleased with it as she thought she'd be.  What's more, she could shut down the plan - she was starting college as the attention-getting curvy girl she wanted to be, and didn't need to get any bigger.</span></div></div>",

While it wasn't the greatest tasting stuff in the world, it reminded Kelly of home and how she could do anything that she put her mind to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had tried to change too much too quickly, and a return to her pre-college diet was a step toward normalcy.  Only this was a new normal.  Unfettered by the schedule of a high school student, Kelly found that long hours studying at night meant extra time to eat.  Stress was an opportunity to take advantage of her \"all-you-can-eat\" dining hall plan, with a trip back through the cafeteria for an extra piece of cake or some soft serve ice cream any time she was feeling overwhelmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect was almost instantaneous as her confidence and class performance made rapid recoveries.  By the end of the semester, the question wasn't about whether or not she had recovered from her midterm mishap, but whether she would finish with the top grade in all of her classes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly found that putting the weight back on was much easier than it had been to gain it the first time around. In the first month, she gained back the ten pounds she had lost, and she was delighted that her clothing had resumed being snug in their fit.  The next three weeks brought seven more pounds and led up to a week at home for Thanksgiving in which Kelly reflected on how far she'd come in a year since making the decision to reinvent herself as a voluptuous woman.  The traditional Thanksgiving fare added four pounds that week, and Kelly's \"snug\" outfits had officially become tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't a big deal, because the two weeks that led to finals and finals week itself were spent mostly in sweats.  This both hid and enabled the addition of eight pounds of softness by the Christmas break.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was ecstatic.  She made the Dean's list for her grades, and she was happier than ever with her appearance.  She thought that her face looked more friendly with its chubby cheeks. Her boobs had continued to swell and now overflowed her DD bras.  Her belly was soft, round, and squishy, and her plumped up butt and legs couldn't even fit into her fat jeans anymore.  She looked exactly how she wanted to look, and entered the break with her self esteem at an all time high.</span></div></div>",

Little did she know that her second semester was far more intense than the first. Lots of homework, projects, and group meetings. Lots of inactivity. And when there weren't classes, Kelly felt responsible to attend parties and socialize. This meant lots of snacking and late night eating beyond her normal diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was worried about her weight, but was almost too busy to notice, that is until her winter sweats no longer fit. It was a wakeup call for Kelly as she was running out of clothes that fit. When you can't fit a pair of large sweatpants over your butt, you know something is wrong. By spring break, Kelly was pushing 205 pounds. She crossed the big 200 and didn't even flinch. Her stress levels were off the chart, but instead of not eating like she did in the fall semester, Kelly binged on fatty foods until she could think the situation through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly dedicated some time to the gym the next few weeks, but the time and effort spent were taking away from her grades. Sure she lost a whole 5 pounds, but that wasn't worth the price of her education. Kelly instead promised to keep herself in check of what she ate from now on. She might not lose weight, but at least she can maintain her weight until she can get back down her curvy weight over the summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out that colleges are really not a great place to watch your weight. You have to work hard to find healthy food. Kelly's college was more about saving a dollar on healthy food and instead serving the students junk. Kelly's promise to herself was short lived. With her attention focused on her grades, she ate what the school provided and then some. By the end of the spring semester Kelly was pushing 213 pounds. Luckily her added poundage didn't weight on her grades, just her wardrobe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was relieved that the semester was over. She was spilling out whatever clothes still fit and was in a real need to lose some weight. She knew that once she got home, she could hit the gym on day 1....that is...if she was going home. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelly got a call from her parents. It turns out Kelly's grandmother was going through some hard times and was in need of some help. Her grandmother operated and owned her own bakery for over 40 years. The bakery was what helped Kelly's family prosper in the last few decades. But nowadays, people were much more health conscious and that meant less business for her grandmother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly protested at first. She knew living with her grandmother was a dangerous thing for her waistline. Plus staying with her grandmother was going to be really boring. But it was at that point that her parents revealed that her grandmother was the one who took out a loan for Kelly to go to school and if the business sinks, so does Kelly's free ride to college. Feeling guilty, she agreed to move in with her grandmother for the summer, she just had to watch what she ate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrandma Iris was from the old country. She was a first generation immigrant who was very good around a kitchen. Her food was delicious, but by no means light. All her baked goods were loaded with calories and even her meals were quite filling. Growing up, Kelly avoided much of her grandmother's tempting goodies. In fact, winter break was a rare lapse of judgement for Kelly as she dove into all the goodies her grandmother made for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon Kelly's arrival, Iris immediately commented on how famished her granddaughter looked. Kelly was perplexed, as she had put on 19 pounds since the last time they met. She decided to put those thoughts aside as she began to unpack. Finally alone for the first time in awhile, Kelly sat in her new room and looked around at her new home for the next few months. Nothing special really. Two windows, a single sized bed that was a bit too firm, a vintage dresser drawer, and a nightstand. Kelly noticed that on her nightstand rested a plate of chocolate chip cookies with a little note. It was a welcome gift from her grandmother. Kelly thought it was a nice gesture, but she was on her best behavior. The cookies were left untouched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first few days Kelly ate minimally. Her grandmother cooked all her meals and they were more calorie laden than anything that she could find at school. Her grandmother encouraged her to eat more, but Kelly refuted to the best of her ability. Though the food smelt wonderful, she was holding back as much as she could. But it became harder to do as the days ran on. Food was hard to avoid in this house. Iris was always working on her baking and it was easy to find some baked good in most rooms. It wasn't until Iris found Kelly's cookies untouched in her room that things changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIris felt disappointed. She asked Kelly if she didn't like her cooking, as she noticed Kelly refusing to eat anything in the house. Kelly felt guilty after her grandmother went out of her way to make cookies for her. After all, her grandmother was paying for her college, the least she could do is eat her meals and nibble on a treat or two to make her grandmother feel better. Kelly set out the next day to make sure her grandmother noticed her cleaning her plate or eating a cookie. Their relationship grew from there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly's first days at the bakery were a little rough. For starters, Kelly was still adjusting to all her new weight. Kelly was very pear shaped. Her thighs, hips, and ass ballooned to almost a comical size compared to the rest of her body. Yeah she had a belly and showed more cleavage than before, but the weight really showed below the waist. And because of her size, Kelly was having a hard time adjusting to the new weight. Her hips brushed up along the sides of the narrow cafe tables aligned in the center of the bakery. If she ever turned, her bulbous butt would knock over a drink or touch a pastry. Bending down to grab pastries on the counters was much harder. Kelly didn't exercise much and lifting her 200+ pound body took real effort. But after the first few weeks, Kelly learned how to avoid disasters, while working at the bakery...well except for the disaster that was her ideal body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking at the bakery was too tempting for Kelly. The food was irresistible. And even if Kelly wanted to eat anywhere else, she couldn't. In order to help her Grandmother out, she had work on no wages. This meant all food and drink came from her Grandmother. But it really was the best food around. Just not the best for Kelly. With all the snacking at the bakery and the abundance of food at home, Kelly had packed on an additional 15 pounds by the mid point of summer. Perhaps luckily for her, Iris didn't own a scale at home, so Kelly was left to her imagination as to whether or not she put on weight. </span></div></div>",

Iris had tried for years to fatten up Kelly, but could barely get her to eat a sweet when she was a kid. But now Kelly was not only plump, she was hooked to Iris's cooking and baking. And while Iris was never one to be conniving, she knew her time was limited with Kelly and needed to take full advantage of having Kelly in the house for the summer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLate at night and well past dinner, Iris planned to deliver Kelly a little midnight snack every night. At first, Kelly declined a delicious slice of cake that was presented to her. But grandma Iris now knew how to guilt her granddaughter into eating and so her refusal was merely a formality. As the midsummer nights rolled on, the snacks got bigger. A slice of cake turned into a half dozen cookies. A half dozen cookies turned into a tray of brownies. Kelly was being stuffed like a pinata. And while the snacks got bigger, Kelly's appetite could not keep up. Insisting that Kelly finish what was made for her, Iris was left to force feed Kelly what she couldn't finish on her own. All Kelly could do was close her eyes as her grandmother shoved piece after piece of brownie into her mouth. Iris would rotate between force feeding and belly rubs until all the food was gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly tried her best to ignore her rising weight, but it was becoming rather hard for her to avoid it. By summer's end she had packed on a total of 40 pounds while at her Grandmothers. And those 40 pounds were starting to take effect. None of the clothes Kelly brought with her fit any longer. The last of the size 18 sweats met their untimely end at the bakery. It was a wakeup call for Kelly and a proud moment for Iris. Iris admired her work as she grabbed Kelly by the hips and smiled. Kelly was now more than just a bit curvy.</span></div></div>",

At 256 pounds, Kelly was now far more heavy than she was happy with. Sure she liked her body 60 or so pounds ago, but now pushing 250+ pounds, Kelly was finding everyday school life to be difficult. The desks were a tighter fit. She broke a sweat just walking to class. She got weird looks from her classmates. And she was hungry all the time. She knew she had to slow down her intake as well as try and get some exercise. And for the first few weeks of classes, she was able to better control her appetite and get to the gym which resulted in her losing 8 pounds. Without the pressures and temptations of her grandmother, Kelly thought she could finally get back in a shape she was happy about. That is until midterms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see Kelly, for the first time, had put her figure in front of her studies and her grades started to suffer. She had always been a straight A student, so when she found out that she was getting B's and C's in class, she started to get stressed out. That led to stress eating, which led to stress binging and suddenly she was back in the same situation she was in during her spring semester. Her exercise routine was thrown right out. She spent her late nights studying and binging until the early hours. Sometimes she stuffed herself so much at night, it reminded her of being at her grandmothers. She would rub her belly for comfort. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly also knew that she had to keep up with her friends, so weekends were dedicated to parties. As the semester came closer to a close, Kelly oftentimes found herself drunk at 2am ordering fatty foods from the campus's McDonalds and feeding herself until she fell asleep. Kelly waking up and finding french fries in bed was becoming more of a common theme.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe binging continued unabated until Kelly's clothes stopped fitting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I really need to slow down</i> Kelly thought to herself. But it was a fleeting thought as the comfort of food was Kelly's only mode of escapism from her school work and social life. She really should have listened to herself. </span></div></div>",

She found herself on the floor of her dorm room struggling to put on a pair of tights. They have been her go to pants for the semester and it didn't look like they'd last the semester. She had managed to get them up over her swollen thighs, though the fabric stretched so much it didn't leave much to the imagination. Her ass, her largest feature, was far too mammoth to get the pants around. She struggled with little progress. Sucking her stomach in was an exercise in futility. This was not a proud moment for Kelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer only success came when she lifted her belly to rest over the tights. Only then was there barely enough room for her titanic ass. Running late, she rushed out the door. If she was slim and in shape, she'd make it in no time, however, being as big as Kelly was meant that the walk to class was going to take considerable effort to get there on time. Sweating profusely she made it to class 10 minutes late. All the students were already working on their final exam. Exhausted and stressed, Kelly quickly grabbed her test and plopped down into one of the desks. The speed and impact of her ass was more than what Kelly's tights could handle. And within a split second, Kelly's tights split right down the rear. Kelly first heard the ripping of fabric followed by the slack of her clothes give way. Her underwear exposed for all to see. The students erupted in laughter and snickers as the teacher, who was unaware of the situation, tried to calm down the class. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly froze. Not knowing to leave or start the exam. Kelly couldn't concentrate the entire time and the result was a poorly executed exam. Knowing that she failed her final exam, Kelly sought to booze and food to cope. Ignoring that this kind of behavior was the reason why she was in this situation to begin with. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly woke up to a blistering hangover and a buzz from her phone. It was her mother. Christmas this year was going to be at her Grandmothers. When asked what she wanted for Christmas, Kelly's only response was \"Clothes!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Grandma Iris had a big grin on her face as she welcomed Kelly and her family into her home. She could tell that Kelly had been eating well over the semester. And it showed. 29 more pounds made their way to Kelly's body putting her at 282 pounds since the last time Iris saw her. And it showed. Kelly's hips started to inflate so much that her hips started to hang off of chairs more than they were hanging on. Her belly was still quite small in comparison to other features, but it had finally gained some recognition as she was now supporting a double belly. Luckily, her boobs had outpaced her stomach, but just barely at Ds. Her face grew softer, but still mostly maintained her thin physique. Her arms plump with fat and looking like sausages encased in her very tight shirt. Kelly's thighs were so supple, they shook when she walked. And her ass was so large, you could start to see it from the front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly knew she was in for trouble having to stay the winter break at her grandmothers. She narrowly escaped this summer and now she was back and fatter then ever. Perhaps luckily (or not so) Kelly hadn't weighed herself since she stopped going to the gym at school so she wasn't aware of what damage she had done to herself. But she knew that resisting Iris's fatty treats would take a lot of willpower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut grandmas are wise. Iris expected Kelly to come back and try to resist her oh so delicious treats. But nobody could resist Iris's strong milkshakes. Boozy calorie laden goodness. They had been a hit at the bakery over the fall and now it was Kelly's turn to try. Initially resistant, Kelly dove in once her grandmother whispered that there was booze inside. It was Kelly's only chance to get alcohol over the holidays with her parents present. Of course Kelly's was a lot boozier than what she sold in her store. Nevertheless, Kelly sucked down the drink and within an hour she was drunk. It was just enough for Kelly to put her guard down and graze upon grandma Iris's baked goods. Kelly was caught in her grandmother's web. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe days continued similarly. Iris would offer up a strong shake and Kelly would slurp it down. Iris would provide fattening foods to binge on and would force feed her and night. Kelly wasn't resistant to the force feeding as Iris often times washed down her food with a second strong shake along with a belly rub that Kelly kind of yearned for over the fall semester. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strong shakes were near additive to Kelly. While she initially did it for the booze, the taste was something she couldn't get out of her mind. She also started have weird dreams every night. They were usually very foggy, but Kelly would often remember herself getting funnel fed what felt like unlimited amounts of her grandmother's strong shakes as her belly swelled and swelled and swelled. And right as she thought she was going to burst, she would wake up in a cold sweat. It was always a bizarre experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Christmas came and Kelly could open her new size 22 clothes, it had been too late. Nothing fit! She had really pigged out this winter. She thought maybe this was a sign that she needed to lose weight, but that was until Kelly opened Iris's gift, which was some brand new stretchy size 26 tights. It was a moment of relief for Kelly as she had something comfortable to wear, though she tried to convince herself that this was just temporary thing and that she'd get her weight under control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords don't mean anything if there is no action taken. In Kelly's case, all her weight loss talk was just that. Talk. As Kelly was given some looser clothing, it seems to only expand her appetite. The binging only continued until Kelly had to go back to school. </span></div></div>",

There was definitely not one in the bathroom or in and of the bedrooms. Kelly searched up and down and just about every room until she spotted a box in the attic labeled \"Workout Stuff\". She dug through VCR tapes, weights, and bands. Right at the bottom of the box was a scale! Kelly dusted off the digital scale and checked it to see if the batteries still worked. She stepped on it....success! Now for the moment of truth...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nERR<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly looked down to see letters instead of numbers. Confused, she stepped off the scale and back on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nERR<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it broken? Kelly was sure the ERR meant error. But why? Disappointed, Kelly tossed the scale back in the box. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who keeps a broken scale anyways?</i> Kelly thought to herself. Had Kelly tested the scale with something else, she would have found that the scale was working fine. She also would have been shocked to find that all her eating over break has been enough to pass the scale's limits. At 302 pounds, Kelly was starting to get really fat.</span></div></div>",

Sure she had put on even more weight since last semester, but that was in the past. Time to kick herself into gear for a new semester. Except the ghosts of the fall crept up on Kelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly had become famous overnight on campus...for the wrong reasons. As it turns out students had taken film and photos of Kelly, ripped pants and all, during her finals. It was all over the school forums, people recognized her and constantly pointed and giggled. Even some students talking within earshot \"Has she gotten even bigger?\" \"She looks fatter in real life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly's embarrassment never left her. It only got worse. As classes started, students pulled out their phones when Kelly would sit down for class. They hoped to capture her fatness in real time. Her friends distanced themselves as people got ridiculed for hanging out with her. Kelly was becoming outcasted. In some cases, people would fold to the pressure and put themselves on a crash diet and exercise plan and show up those who once shamed her. But Kelly's response was to retreat to the only thing that made her feel good. Food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly didn't just retreat to food. She binged. She ate with vigor. Almost as if she was going on a crash diet, but in reverse. Of course Kelly wasn't intentionally trying to eat the school out of food, but eating triggered a happy response in Kelly's mind. She secluded herself from much of the campus as she only came out of her room for food and classes. She found herself getting drunk on weekends and stuffing herself to her limits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpring break came and while most students went away to a beach somewhere, Kelly found herself still on campus opting for a much cheaper, but more fattening adventure. With clothes getting tight, she decided to check out the new mall just outside of the college. It was there she discovered the food court. Despite her size, Kelly had never really tried fast food. She tried to resist as she went to the clothing store, but the smells of french fries pulled her in. The rest of the week was a downward spiral. Kelly stopped by each day and ate as much as she could from all the venues. She couldn't help herself. The food was far too comforting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't help her case that the mall didn't even carry any clothes in her size. She embarrassed herself in front of some store clerks desperately trying to get on a pair of tights up past her thighs. And so Kelly ate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy semester end, Kelly was pushing 345 pounds and showed no signs of stopping. Now all she needs to do is finish finals and her school year would be over. </span></div></div>",

She tossed the three empty pizza boxes on the floor from her desk, but her phone was not there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went back to check her bed, but only found a take out bag from the Mexican place she liked.

Kelly was now franticly looking around for her phone, getting winded from moving so quickly. She finally found it under the XXXL sweater she had on yesterday. 'Damn it's 5 o'clock! I missed everything!' Kelly slunk down on to her desk chair, her booty noticably hanging over both sides. 'I'm so fucked. How did this happen?' Kelly started to look through her phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had called in an order for burritos around dinner time, and the liquor store is right next to that. Then she noticed a call to the pizza place a couple hours later. The last call was to the late night wings place that's open when all else is closed.

Come, come.\" Iris lead Kelly into the kitchen where a very generous meal lay sprawled out on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'There is no use fighting it. I'm already fat, I might as well enjoy while I'm here.' Kelly thought as she plopped down on a sturdy chair. She started munching away as her grandmother constantly refilled her plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the table was cleared Kelly went to her room to unpack. It was at this time her grandmother came to check on her. \"Hi sweetie, how's the unpacking going?\" She asked her engorged granddaughter. Kelly just nodded as she continued to shuffle back and forth. \"I brought you a little treat. I've been working on my milkshake recipe, don't worry this one doesn't have booze in it, but the other pitcher in the fridge does in case you want it.\" Iris handed Kelly the gallon sized pitcher of thick milkshake along with a nice wide straw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving her to continue unpacking, Kelly gladly sucked down the milkshake continuously. It brought back happy memories from Christmas, and it tasted so good Kelly couldn't stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Kelly was done she went back to the kitchen to check on Iris. \"All set sweetie?\" The caring head of the household asked. \"Now that that's done maybe I can interest you in some dessert. Come, come, I just finished a few of your favorites.\" Again Kelly was led to the table where for starters there was another huge milkshake and a sinful looking chocolate cake. \"This is the boozy one.\" Iris giggled. \"And this chocolate cake is to die for.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly started sucking down the milkshake, the booze going straight to her head. As soon as she started to feel a buzz she dove into the moist and rich chocolate cake. She was getting flash backs to all the times over the past semester that she would go hog wild after class and stuff her face, or when she would get drunk on the weekends by herself and eat until she passed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe derived pleasure from the decadent indulging, it was the only way she knew how to be happy now, and her grandmother was more that willing to feed that life style.</span></div></div>",

I hired her when you went back to school to help me out. These old bones can't do it all you know.\" Iris laughed as she went into the back leaving Kelly and Victoria to get to know each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly didn't know where to start. This was a big change mainly because Victoria was a big girl, a very big girl. Kelly had pulled up and Victoria still dwarfed her and then some. The towering 600 lb lass waddled over to Kelly to shake her hand and make her acquaintance. \"Hi I'm Victoria,. It everyone calls me Tori.\" Kelly shook hands and introduced herself as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey chatted for a little bit, getting to know each other. They were about the same age and like some of the same music, but quickly the conversation turned to food and weight. \"You won't believe how relived I was when I saw that Iris's granddaughter wasn't all skin and bones?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" Kelly wasn't sure if she needed to be offended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh nothing, just us big girls need to stick together, right?\" Tori said with a smile. Kelly wallowed, she really was a big girl now, and she had been for some time. \"Your grandma was so good to me. I was down on my luck, no one wanted to higher someone like me, but then I met Iris. Not only did she give me an opportunity here, but the employee benefits rule. We never go hungry here, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly just looked at her peer, like looking into her future. Kelly was going to have to work her for who knows how long to repay her grandmother, she was going to have to live under the same roof as her, and Tori was the only person the whole time she had been in this town to be friendly towards her. She couldn't help think that one day soon she was going to be the next Tori.</span></div></div>",

All Kelly could do is wonder how much a big girl like her could pack away. Kelly knew her own limits we're enormous enough. Also they both had been snacking pretty liberally at work all day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir waitress came back to take their order and Tori jumped in to go first. \"Can I get the double Mac attack burger? And can I get loaded waffle fries instead of regular? Also why don't we get an appetizer sampler to share?\" Tori gave an approving glance to Kelly, but the larger girl was already nodding her head like this was a sure deal. \"Also a large extra thick chocolate milkshake.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for you miss?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was undecided. She knew ordering as much as Tori did was setting her down the path to 600lbs for sure, but she didn't want to scrimp out and have to sit here watching Tori eat. \"Can I get a double BBQ bacon burger with BBQ chicken fries on the side? Also a vanilla milkshake for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Large and extra thick?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\" A smile forced it's way on to Kelly face as she dreamt about all the empty calories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must like BBQ huh? Maybe we really should have gone there instead, huh?\" Tori chuckled. \"I'll have to take you there soon, you're going to love it. I've never eaten so much melt in your mouth meat before. And the sauces there... Oh so much good sauce.\" With every conversation with Tori, Kelly understood more and more how she had gotten this big. She was always eating, and always eating large. But Kelly couldn't judge, she had been acting the same way the past several months. Even more of a reason to fear approaching Tori size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe food came and the girls dug in. It was a series of grunts and moans and the two pigs attacked their meals. Burger juices we're everywhere, slurps of milkshakes in-between bites, and their pudgy hands were covered in grease and it didn't even matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir waitress came back with refills on their milkshakes, and they girls just kept on chomping until there was no more left. Finally taking a moment to clean their hands as the waitress cleared some of the dirty dishes. Kelly leaned back and sucked on the last of her second milk shake. \"Who's ready for dessert?\" The waitress chimed. Kelly wasn't really in the mood, but she knew she still had plenty of room, plus she couldn't turn down the chocolate lava cake Tori was showing her in the dessert menu. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'll have the brownie sundae please.\" Tori flipped the menu closed as the girls awaited their treats. Just like the burgers, Tori was not wrong when she said the portions here we're very large. The chocolate lava cake that came out was the biggest Kelly had even seen. It was like the size of two at a normal restaurant. Kelly dug in as Tori enjoyed her fudge brownies in her sundae.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori paid the bill and the two satisfied girls waddled out. \"Thanks again for that Tori, it was very nice of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, it was nice to actually have some company for once. Not a lot of girls to hang with around here if you know what I mean.\" Kelly did know what she meant, she meant fat. Not everyone would go out for such a calorie rich meal, and if they did they might never go back, but here was Kelly, already thinking about what she would get next time Tori brought her there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll see you at work tomorrow!\" Tori said her goodbyes as she dropped Kelly off at her grandma's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly walked in the door only to be met by her grandmother. \"Kelly I'm so glad you are home,...\"</span></div></div>",

Please just a few things to help your old grandmother not have to try and cram it all in the fridge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly disgruntled gave in, taking a seat at the table where there was a pile of serving dishes. \"Here just a little of this.\" Iris said starting to make her granddaughter a plate. Kelly started in on her grandmothers amazing cooking, and was soon sweeped away in a flavorful adventure that she couldn't help but continue. Iris filled her plate up, and Kelly worked hard to tear it all down. Kelly drifted into an eating frenzy, plate after plate getting polished off without her even thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter awhile Kelly started to slow down, she didn't realize how full she had gotten. She was still shoveling forkfuls of food into her mouth, but her chewing was much more labored. Her eyes grew heavy as the time passed and her stomach swelled. Kelly was startled to attention when her grandmother finally shouted out. \"Marvelous job my dear! These last couple of things I think I can find room for in the fridge. Thanks a lot for helping me out sweetie!\" Kelly just groaned, feeling how full and taut her stomach had become. \"Well you best be off to bed, another day at the bakery tomorrow.\" Iris chimed as Kelly slowly rose of the table. Heading to her room, she half dreaded another day working at the bakery knowing it was a minefield of sugary, waist expanding treats, treats she had absolutely no will power to withstand. But then there was also a part of her who couldn't wait to have a nice warm and delicious cinnamon roll first thing in the morning.</span></div></div>",

Despite their early arrival, Tori had already started her shift and had primed the place to open. \"Hey Kelly!\" Tori said exuberantly as her jiggly counterpart walked in through the front. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh hi.\" Kelly said with less flair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I warmed you up a cinnamon roll, I remember you mentioning yesterday they were one of your favorite.\" Tori's joy was unwavering. The large girl still held a big smile on her face, as she enjoyed the first few sweets of her day. Kelly begrudgingly took the cinnamon roll, knowing it wasn't the worst she was going to eat today, but there was also the part of her that was totally craving for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day played out like the many before it, especially like the previous day. Tori's constant appetite pushed Kelly to eat more than her fair share. When ever she saw Tori snacking away Kelly always grew envious that Tori could eat that way and not have a care in the world about it. This would cause Kelly to crave the same delectible and she'd have to get one for herself. Her rational was that if Tori was eating that much, it wasn't a big deal if she had some too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't a secret why Tori was so big, and Kelly was subliminally following in her footsteps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day rolled on, and there came a slow point where Tori pulled Kelly aside again. \"So that was fun last night, huh?\" Tori just reminding Kelly of how many extra calories she consumed, but also recalling the memories of how tasty those burgers were. \"Well I was thinking we could hit up that BBQ place I was mentioning tonight. You look like a girl who can handle her meat, am I right?!\" Tori chucked at her obvious innuendo. \"And I know you are strapped for cash, so it's on me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was taken aback by this girls continued generosity, but then again there were probably not a lot of tubbos as big as Kelly willing to eat like a pig. Kelly didn't have a reason to say no, despite her concern for her growing waistline, so she agreed, and at closing time they both hopped in Tori's straining sedan.</span></div></div>",

Kelly had a moment of shock, was Tori really a psycho and just being nice so she could lead her to a dark alley and take advantage of her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This doesn't look like a restaurant...\" Was all Kelly could muster, rasing her guard a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha I know, this place is kinda low key, only people in the know are aware of it. It looks crummy on the outside but trust me it's really nice inside.\" Kelly wasn't necessarily in the trusting mood at the moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite that Tori and Kelly made their way to the singular rusty door in the back of the building. Thankfully when they opened the wide door all of Kelly's fears we're released. The place was an actual nice looking restaurant. Much nicer than the run of the mill chain restaurants and even better than some of the hipster places that were popping up more frequently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn front of them stood the hostess podium, but Kelly wasn't sure why she needed a podium, considering she was wider than the small stand. This girl gave Kelly a run for her money in the weight department. Kelly couldn't help but stare as they stood in front of her, the hostesses chest rested on the top of the podium. Her knockers we're some of the biggest she had ever seen, looking like two full watermelons under her tight uniform. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You girls must be here for dinner.\" The hostess said in a playful tone, which Kelly found odd for a hostess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes ma'am!\" Tori replied back joyfully like there was nothing weird about that situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, the all you can eat special?\" Now she was just being rude Kelly thought. \"Of course you are, that's pretty much anyone here ever orders. Follow me.\" The hostess turned around, showing off her slack packed booty and sauntered off into the dining room. Kelly couldn't believe a girl her size would wear a uniform so small, but at the same time she couldn't take her eyes off her generous curves. </span></div></div>",

Looking up she noticed their waitress towering over their table holding a pad of paper with a pen. If their hostess gave Kelly a run for her money, this waitress was maybe approaching Tori territory. This girl was also wearing a skin tight uniform, maybe even tighter than the other girls, so all of her cascading rolls were on display. The girls booty was so big Kelly could see it from the front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was again in such shock that Tori spoke for the group. \"Hiya!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Tiffany, I'll be your server tonight.\" She said as she put some drink napkins down on the table. Leaning over, her fleshy chest flung right in front of Kelly's face. While not as impressive as her hostesses, the girl still had some serious knockers. \"Are you both interested in the All-you-can-eat meal tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the salivating look Tori was giving she took that as a yes. \"Can I get you both something to drink?\" Tori ordered a coke, so Kelly followed suite. \"Well let me get you ladies started with a basket for the table while you wait for your first course.\" Tiffany reached over grabbing a basket and sliding it onto the table before waddling away. Kelly was the first to reach for the fresh food put before her, she was more hungry for dinner than she thought. The large basket seemed to be filled with 8 buttered dinner rolls, but it wasn't until further inspection that there was more than meats the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this a burger?\" Kelly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah.\" Tori chuckled as she grabbed two of the sliders for her own plate. \"One of the waitresses told me once that they didn't want to just serve rolls here, so they decided to jazz it up and put some burger in between. So instead of just bread you get burger sliders to start your meal. They are pretty good too.\" Tori already polishing off her first, starting her second, and putting two more on her plate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before Tiffany had brought back their cokes, and as the eight sliders rapidly disappeared, their first course was on it's way to the table.</span></div></div>",

Sliding one in front of each of the girls \"Eat up.\" was all she said before leaving them to it. Kelly's eyes went wide as she had never seen so many ribs before, but this was only the first course, so she better start preparing herself. Tori dug right in without hesitation, getting warm BBQ sauce all over her fingers. Kelly did the same, sucking the tender meat right off the bone. Kelly was in flavor paradise, not only were the ribs cooked perfectly and they slid right down her throat, the BBQ sauce and spices were delectable, she couldn't wait to go back for another bite. And so rib by rib the girls went to town, occasionally stopping to suck down some coke. The platter was large, but it was no match for these two eaters, and in the blink of an eye there were only bones that remained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking their fingers, there was not a moment to spare as Tiffany was arriving with course number two. Up next was fried steak covered with country gravy. Kelly looked around for a fork and knife to start cutting it with, but when she noticed none was to be found Tori was already going at it with her hands. Kelly didn't want to be difficult so she picked up the steak started chomping. The steak was melting in her mouth, and the gravy that accompanied it went so well together. They each had two steaks, which were both gone in mere moments. Kelly appetite was really ramping up now, and she was eager for the next course. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany was there on the spot with two large plates of chicken wings, dripping in BBQ sauce. Kelly dove right in as the plate hit the table. \"If I'm not careful I might lose a finger.\" Tiffany joked as Kelly filled her mouth with juicy chicken. Kelly was in complete bliss as she stuffed her face. She didn't know what it was but once she got going something would take over and all she could do is eat. Eating made her happy, and all she had to do was flip the switch and she couldn't stop. And with plenty of opportunities to indulge, Kelly could not contain herself. </span></div></div>",

She was on a roll, and another plate would come out of the kitchen as soon as she finished what was in front of her. As the growing girl started to fill up, she started to regain her wits about her. Food was still her number one objective, but she started to take a moment to look around the restaurant. The place was nice, but it wasn't every big, and there were not a lot of tables, especially with how spread out they were. There were only a few other patrons in the establishment besides the two of them, and Kelly quickly drew some comparisons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing she noticed was there seemed to be a waitress for each table, and they were all fat girls. They ran the gamut from the size of the hostess to the size of Tiffany, but not one of them was smaller than Kelly. And it wasn't just the staff that was comprised of fat girls, just like Tori and Kelly themselves, all the guests were fat girls as well. The table closest to them sat two middle aged moms who looked like they had let themselves go long ago. They were each in the 450lbs range, bursting out of their mom jeans, and their rolls over taking their tight tops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe table next to them sat two girls about Kelly's age. They too were huge cows packing away plate after plate of meat, adding to their already padded bodies. They were dressed like any 20 somethings would be, but their large bodies asked for more coverage than they were being afforded. Their ham hock sized arms wobbled freely as they continually brought food to their mouth. Their tight tops wormed their way up, after failing to contain all their billowing midriff, allowing a few soft rolls to show. And their chests over flowed the cups of their bras, begging to burst out of the low cut neck of their tops. Despite their clothing problems, they continued on being chow hounds, attacking plate after plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last group in the restaurant broke the rule thus far. They were the farthest away, but Kelly could still make out what was happening over there. A girl her age sat in one of the restaurants standard reinforced chairs. She was wearing a sleek red evening dress, certainly more dressed up than anyone else here tonight. Out of everyone here she was the one who rivaled Tori the most. Kelly couldn't tell for sure, but this girl could actually be bigger than her new friend. Sitting across from the bulging red balloon was a scrawny boy, the only male in the whole building. He was watching as his date tossed back plate after plate. She was an eating machine, chewing through BBQ like it was her job. Her boyfriend was always attentive, waving their waitress over when ever she was getting close to the end of her plate or when she needed a drink refill. They had been there since Kelly and Tori had arrived, and she was still going full pelt as they started to slow down. Her dress was obviously starting to strain around her midsection, but she paid it no mind. Kelly felt like that wouldn't be the first dress to see some destruction due to her excessive eating habits.</span></div></div>",

I used to be your size, maybe even a little smaller.\" Kate reminisced. \"But then Jake came along, and all that changed. With his loving help I've grown bigger than I ever thought possible.

Tori was her best friend so she picked up the slack, and grandma Iris was always encouraging her biggest granddaughter to eat up even more. But all the sweets had made their mark on the young co-ed. Kelly was fat all over, with a busting rack and jiggly belly, but it was her rear that had been most impressive. And today it would live up to it legacy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was happily ingesting enough calories for a normal persons full day, when she reached into the display case for another lemon tart. Tori had noticed that Kelly loved wearing her Fat Ass pants as much as possible, even though she had clearly outgrown them. The waist band had to hide under her overhang of a tummy and the entirety of her love handles were on full display. The worst offender was her booty though, peeking out the top of the waistband at all times. Her cheeks were so wide at this point they had stretched and cracked the silk screened lettering on the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pants were on their last legs, like most of the growing girls wardrobe, but she hadn't given up on them. That was until today, when she bend over to grab that next lemon tart she could feel the stitches in the middle of her ass start to pull apart. She was in denial at first so she continued to reach in for her tasty treat, but this only worsened her problem. The ripping could be heard as it got louder. Kelly could start to feel a breeze on her exposed ass cheeks as the wide rip came to a stop as she clutched her treat and started to straighten back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori had heard the whole thing and came around the counter to see what had happened. There was Kelly, lemon tart in her mouth like nothing had happened. \"Are you ok?\" Tori asked. \"Was that your pants?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly had to swallow before giving her answer. \"Um, yeah I think.\" She said as she turned around so her friend could inspect her booty. \"Think you could grab me another lemon tart so I don't rip them any more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori just chuckled. \"Sure thing fat ass. Plus I think I've got an extra pair of pants in the back that should fit you.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelly, unable to stop her nonstop eating ways was quickly approaching her 600 lb goal, despite her apprehensions. Jake was making sure to do daily weigh ins so that everything would be on the up and up. \"That's five pounds more than yesterday. Quite impressive.\" Jake said has he read the weight total of 192. It would only be days until Kelly reached 600 lbs. Kelly was overcome with sadness that she was within 10 pounds of losing Jake and ran from the bathroom, or waddled vigorously, all of her gelantious rolls jiggling as she pounded down the hall to Jakes room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly threw herself on the bed, opening sobbing. It wasn't long though before Kelly was reaching for something to stuff in her mouth. Luckly she hadn't eaten all the donuts that morning and there was still a full box on her night stand. Between chewing and crying, Kelly looked like a big fat hot mess. Jake sauntered in to comfort her, putting a hand on her soft upper back. \"Sweetie you knew this was going to happen sooner or later. We've had a good run. I'm going to miss our time together, but I know you'll do great without me. 600 is not going to be your limit.\" All Kelly could do was sob and chomp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the dozen donuts were gone she felt a little better, and Jake was right she knew this was coming. Jake recommended she take the day off of work and just stay at his place while he went to work. Kelly agreed, she was far too emotional to work today. She called Iris and let he know and Jake made sure it get Kelly all set up in his bed with plenty of refreshments before he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly somberly munched on all the junk food around her as the minutes ticked by on the clock. Kelly knew she had turned into the ultimate fat ass, as she was now reaching the same weight as Tori. The only girl she knew bigger than that was Kate, and that girl was something else when it came to fat assness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake sent Kelly a text that he was having takeout delivered to the house for her for lunch, the feedee not allowing a prime opportunity to pass him by. When the bell rang Kelly heaved herself out of bed to go get the door. After being handed enough boxes to feed a dorm room of college boys, Kelly waddled back towards the bedroom. Along the way Kelly spied the industrial sized scale she was constantly using to check her weight. That was when a light went off in her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly squeezed her way through the tight door frame, taking her lunch in with her. With a slice of pizza in one hand Kelly examined the scale. \"There's got to be a way to adjust this thing.\" She said aloud to only herself as she stuffed half the slice of pizza into her mouth. She proceeded to try and fiddle with the scale, at least the part the stuck up high enough she could reach without bending over too far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not here. Must be down on the base...\" An idea Kelly wasn't too excited about. At almost 600 lbs bending over or kneeling were not easy activities. Usually she needed the aid of Jake to get up from something like that. All the more reason she needed to keep him around. So Kelly had to do what she had to do, and slowly lowered herself to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally able to access the panel in the back Kelly could see where she could make the adjustments she was looking for. \"Well my fat ass has been growing at least three pounds a day.\" Kelly spied her humongous lunch sitting over on the dryer. \"But it's going to be at least four pounds today.\" With that Kelly pushed the down button four times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling successful Kelly moved into position to get up, which in of itself was not an easy task. But then came the getting up part. Kelly had grown so fat so fast she wasn't used just how flabby her body was. Her first few attempts to right herself her futile. Being easily defeated, and thinking more with her stomach than her brain, Kelly reached for the towel hanging off the dryer. With a slight dug the sub shop boxes tumbled to the floor and Kelly happily munched away from her prone position.</span></div></div>",

Kelly spent the rest of the afternoon stuffing her face with all the junk food that Jake kept at his place. Now that she wasn't so concerned about her weight she felt free to hog out as much as she wanted, not that it really stopped her before. Jake returned that night, none the wiser what Kelly had done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning Jake helped Kelly out of bed for her daily weigh in. \"Hrm, only a one pound gain, that's less than normal. But hey it's still progress, right honey?\" Kelly just smiled as she knew all her pigging out yesterday had really lead to a 5 pound gain. If she kept this up she could really put on some serious weight without anyone being the wiser. What Kelly didn't realize was that with the kind of weight she was packing on it was easy to see how fast it was coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly went back to her regular shift at the bakery that day, but when she got back to Jake's that evening she snuck away to tamper with the scale once more. Every day that week Kelly ate to her heart's content, and Jake continued to record only a one pound gain despite how much the fat girl was eating. Kelly even tried to convince him that her weight was plateauing, despite the fact that she was looking bigger than ever, bulging out of everything in her wardrobe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day finally came that the scale read 599. Kelly knew this was her last chance. She had even already tried to prolong things but upping the adjustment to five pounds the day prior, but she had outdone herself and gained an extra pound herself. Since she knew this was her last chance she went for the gold and adjusted the scale by another six pounds. \"Wow 599 again today?\" Jake was surprised, as he had expected today to be the big day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See babe, I told you things were slowing down.\" Kelly barely able to keep her facade up. She had at least bought herself one more day, two if she played her cards right. But since Kelly was really almost cresting 630 pounds she was hardly fooling anyone.</span></div></div>",

You must know what it\u2019s like, you\u2019ve been a 600 lb whale for awhile now. The whole time I\u2019ve known you I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve gained a pound, and you\u2019re almost as much of a pig as I am.\u201d Kelly was now double fisting cinnamon rolls, as her lowest belly roll hung freely out of the bottom hem of her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be nervous that you are only one pound away from having to give Jake back to Kate though.\u201d Tori played along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno though, I feel like I might be able to keep him around longer than you think.\u201d Kelly replied with glee. But her smile was quickly dashed as a large form lumbered in through the front door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mammoth lumbering their way was none other than the humongous Kate, looking larger than ever. Kate was wearing her signature style, a long skin tight dress that showed off her each and every one of her rolls and curves. Unlike Kelly who was mostly bottom heavy, Kate\u2019s massive tummy was her show stopper. Her belly was quite the sight to behold, and even Kelly couldn\u2019t stop herself from being mesmerized by its glory. But it wasn\u2019t just her mid section that was fat, Kate was fat all over. Puffy rolls drooped from her arms, rolls piled on top of themselves all the way up her legs, at every angle you could see this girl was pure fat.</span></div></div>",

All Tori could do was cringe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh really know. I know that's what the result that Jake has been feeding me say, but for some reason I don\u2019t believe it. I was in your place before, and I remember blazing past 600 lbs under the care of Jake.

Some time it just takes some new equipment to find out the truth.\u201d This comment perplexed Kelly and Tori. \u201cSo that is why I had your grandmother install a scale in the floor of the bakery. I told her how beneficial it would be to know the weights of her customers as they continued to frequent her establishment. What she didn\u2019t know is that it is also a great way to keep track of the weight of her employees.\u201d Now Kate was the one with the grin, while Kelly was feeling redness rush to her face. \u201cAll I have to do is connect with my phone here.\u201d Kate reached into her bra and pulled out her phone. Kelly feeling like she had to do something quick reacted and tried to get off the scale in any way possible, like leaping onto the counter. Problem was, at her size she wasn\u2019t getting more than an inch off the floor for more than a second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd all set!\u201d Kate said as she had the massive weight recorded on her phone. \u201cNow we just have to minus the 600 lbs from tubs over here, and of course take away my generous 675 lbs.\u201d That last number caught Kelly off guard, melting at the thought of being 675 lbs. \u201cAnd that leaves us with\u2026\u201d Kate doing the math quickly. \u201cSix hundred and thirty pounds!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was shocked. The truth was out. The other shocking thing was she didn\u2019t realize she had gotten so heavy so fast. With all the scale fiddling she kinda had lost track of her true weight. And since she had not been concerned recently about going over 600 lbs she had been eating like a total hog, and the pounds had continued to come quick. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaughty, naughty Kelly. Did you really think you could trick me? I was gracious enough to let you borrow Jake, to develop into this beautiful fatty before me, and this is the pay back I get? Well I\u2019ll let you know there will be consequences. You\u2019ll soon learn how I deal with fat sluts like yourself.\u201d Kate was getting riled up, and it was starting to scare Kelly. \u201cSo watch your back, which will be hard since your ass is so big now.\u201d With that Kate turned towards the door, lumbering just as slowly as she had come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly and Tori were stunned. They stood there in silence for a moment until Tori decided to make sure Kelly was ok. \u201cYou alright girly?\u201d Tori asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn, she\u2019s a nasty bitch, huh?\u201d Was Kelly\u2019s response. Despite knowing that the jig was up and Jake now had to go back to Kate, Kelly was doing ok. \u201cBut yeah I\u2019m good. I mean I was worried about losing Jake, but hey I\u2019ve gained 30 extra pounds, so I\u2019m confident I can keep this fat train going all on my own.\u201d Kelly went back to eating baked goods, and the bakery was quite somber the rest of the day.</span></div></div>",

The massive melons dwarfed any other flabby feature the smaller girl had. Kelly found it hard to look away as the pair of zeppelins stared her right in the face. Kim\u2019s outfit was extremely revealing, which made Kelly all the more excited to start to work here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few plates Kim took a short break. \u201cSo why don\u2019t you start tomorrow after work. Just swing on by and I\u2019ll have a uniform ready for you, and we will get you trained up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwesome!\u201d Kelly replied as she swallowed the last of her burger, before another plate of brisket was placed in front of her.</span></div></div>",

She told Tori the good news that day at work, and her grandmother drove her over after the bakery closed for the day. She met Kim at the front like always and was lead into the back so she could get her new uniform. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure how many \u2018X\u2019s\u2019 to get you, but I\u2019m hoping this will do.\u201d Kim said as she pulled out a crisp new uniform. Kelly took it into a changing room and just like every morning she struggled to get changed. As Kelly grew she started to appreciate more the challenges that extremely fat girls had to deal with. It wasn\u2019t just splitting a pair of leggings, lugging around all this beautiful weight had it\u2019s burdens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe uniform fit well\u2026 enough, and was much prefered to the clothes she had been wearing the past several weeks. Kelly met Kim back out at the hostess podium. As Kelly came out of the back Kim got a good look at her in the skin tight uniform. The wide girl looked as good as the rest of the crew in the revealing outfit. Every bulge and roll was on display, and it wrapped around her wide rear with precision. \u201cDamn girl, looking good!\u201d Kim complemented her. Kelly was happy, as she knew the change of attire was doing wonders for her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks love.\u201d Kelly cooed as she joined Kim at the podium. \u201cSo what am I going to be doing anyways?\u201d Kelly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need you up here at the hostess stand to seat anyone who walks in the door.\u201d Kelly looked at where she would be standing and was dreading the idea of being on her feet the whole time she was here. She had been used to being on her feet all day at the bakery, but after Jake came into her life he had convinced her to get a stool to rest her tush and tried legs. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we have a wide reinforced bar stool in the back we can bring out here for you. I\u2019ve been thinking of using it myself, but at your weight I know it will help you out.\u201d Kelly was relieved, but was starting to become aware that she had gotten so big that people were going to have to make accommodations for her. Being fat is one thing, but Kelly was a serious wide load now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim went over some of the other details about the job, like seating guests such and so forth. It all seemed easy enough, but what Kelly really wanted was a free meal. So as Kim wrapped up what she had to train on Kim took it upon herself to grab the two of them a little grub. Kim scattered off into the kitchen, leaving Kelly to lean on the half way next to her to give her legs a slight break. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim came back with some pulled pork sandwiches, a bottle of BBQ sauce, and some milkshakes. \u201cThe hostess special.\u201d She said as she placed the tray in a reserved spot behind where Kelly was standing. Kelly dug right into her portion of the meal before asking what the hostess special was. \u201cOh it\u2019s just my usual. I always ask for a milkshake with my food, so they started calling it the hostess special. Expect them to give you a ton of milkshakes when you\u2019re up here.\u201d Kelly wasn\u2019t going to complain, she loved milkshakes, and these ones rivaled the miraculous ones her grandmother made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly spent the rest of the night shadowing Kim. Kelly was used to the restaurant being pretty slow when ever she visited, so she wasn\u2019t surprised that there wasn\u2019t a lot of traffic that night. It allowed plenty of time for Kelly and Kim to chat and munch on whatever they wanted. Kim also made sure Kelly had plenty of milkshakes to wash everything down all night.</span></div></div>",

Kelly was ecstatic as it was her first real paycheck in several several months. Plus Kelly loved working at her new job. She loved working at the bakery with Tori too, but at the restaurant she was surrounded by other fat girls who she was getting to know quite well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiffany, the widest server, was someone she got along with quite well. Tiffany was there pretty much every night so Kelly got to see her pretty often. Sally was another one who worked most nights of the week. Sally was about the same size as Kim, despite the fact that Kim used to be about 100 lbs less than her. The other two servers were only there a couple nights a week, mostly on busier nights like Fridays. But Kelly got along with everyone who worked there, even the cook, who she didn\u2019t know super well yet since she was always too busy to chit chat, but seemed nice enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeeks past and Kelly was loving life again. He days at the bakery were filled with tasty sweets and spending time with her best friend Tori. Then at night she would work the restaurant, eating all the BBQ she could enjoy, and wash it all down with delicious milkshakes. Then she would go home and do it all again the next day. Kelly now had the funds to buy her own clothes, which she loved to do. She no longer had to fully cover up her big beautiful body, and was allowed to let it all hang out even when she wasn\u2019t at work at the restaurant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the big kerfuffle with Kate happened, Kelly had learned that she had made her way up to 630 lbs. Since then she really hadn\u2019t had the opportunity to check her weight, but knew very well that she wasn\u2019t getting the same sort of gains she was getting back when she had Jake in her life. Despite her best intentions it was like her weight gain adventure had some to a screeching halt. But after a month or so of working at the restaurant Kelly started to notice some changes.</span></div></div>",

She first noticed it with the fit of her uniform. Her top wasn\u2019t fitting her as smoothly as it once was, it was really tight for some reason. She didn\u2019t pay it much attention, but as she continued to work and suck down her endless supply of milkshakes she felt the fabric around her breasts start to split. Her top already showed off a plenty of cleavage, but as the uniform ripped generous amounts of boob flesh became exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this was only the start. Kelly had to hit the mall to replace all of her bras, and within a week were starting to feel tight again. Kim had replaced her uniform top at work, and now Kelly\u2019s knockers were fully on display as she stood at the front of the restaurant. At the bakery, Kelly\u2019s growing girls bounced all around as the wide load navigated her way behind the counter. Kelly had gotten used to her body jiggling and bouncing more and more as she packed on the pounds, but this was a new sensation for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori couldn\u2019t help but make a comment. \u201cWatch where you are swinging those things!\u201d Tori hollard as Kelly shuffled by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry they are out of control!\u201d Kelly complained. \u201cMy ass was a challenge getting used to, but these two are a monster to handle, I don\u2019t know what happening.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI know it\u2019s so tough being a fat girl, having ass cheeks the size of beach balls and tits the size of watermelons.\u201d Tori joked. \u201cBut hey you\u2019ve transformed from just a little chubette to the walking wide load standing before me. Color me impressed. Just get those curves under control, k?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAy ay captain!\u201d Kelly responded. But it wasn\u2019t so easy. Day in and day out she worked her bakery shift and then moved over to the restaurant. Her swelling hooters seemed to be growing by the day. They had grown to the point where they were seriously starting to get in the way. Kelly found some relief in allowing them to rest either on the bakery counter or on her hostess podium. </span></div></div>",

One person who had no issue with Kelly\u2019s inflated zeppelins was her superior at the restaurant, Kim. Kim was more than pleased to have a new sweater busting girl in the joint. Kim was constantly complimenting Kelly\u2019s massive jugs, comparing them to her own sizeable bra boulders. Kim even decided that knocking knockers was their way of high fiving, giving her bust a bump with hers when ever she came out to check on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was fastly becoming quite the impressive sight, not that she wasn\u2019t a lot to take in already. The girl had the butt, a butt so round and perky that you could bounce a quarter off of it. Her fluffy legs accentuated the focal point of her rear, and her chub rub was something fierce. But since Kelly constantly dressed in skin tight leggings it wasn\u2019t a big problem. Kelly wasn\u2019t known for her belly as some of her large friends were. Girls like Tori and Kate had prize winning tummies, but Kelly at least was in the competition. With a stomach with rolls stacked on top of rolls, there was a tranquility to the vast ocean of blubber wrapped around her torso. Be it when she was working at the restaurant, or dressed in her street clothes, Kelly\u2019s stomach was never fully covered. Her tops were always riding up, and her love handles were so plump that they were a coverage issue. It helped that her work uniform slits and holes that allowed rolls and to poke out and get some air. Then there was her newest asset, her billowing chest. Kelly was used to have some big girls, but nothing like this. She had joined Kim in the megaton zeppelin category. Her widening breasts filled her vision. Despite her wide load of a body, her tits had grown so much they were obscuring most of her view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls at the restaurant praised Kelly for her stunning looks and killer body. Some of them even started to ask her tips on how to pack on some extra pounds. Kelly didn\u2019t know what to say since it was just old fashion stuffing that allowed her to blimp up from the scrawny freshman to the humongous girl she was today. \u201cJust eat a ton I guess!\u201d was her typical response. After reflecting a little more on the situation she had to give some credit to Jake for helping her reach the upper echelon of the fat life. It would have taken years to pack on even half the amount of weight Jake helped her gain. \u201cHaving a feedee really helped me get this big. If you can find one, then your waistline will really explode.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long after that Kelly noticed some of the girls starting to get dropped off by their new boyfriends. The two part time servers, Katrina and Natalia seemed to be the most eager of the bunch. I guess they were sick of being the skinny ones in the group despite the fact they both weighted almost 400 lbs each. Right after each of them got a boyfriend Kelly could see their waistlines see the kind of growth she herself had experienced. Sally didn\u2019t want to be left out either, and was trying her best to break into the 500\u2019s and more.</span></div></div>",

Of course most of that went to her chest, but she was still a pretty flabby girl. It had seemed up until recently though that Kim had stopped gaining weight. But Kelly noticed the stacked supervisor looking ever so wider these days. Kelly had to complement her bosses growing gut and back side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWatch out before you bust those pants girly!\u201d Kelly said as Kim waddled by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk! Between your backside and those boobs you\u2019ve had more wardrobe malfunctions than all of us combined.\u201d Kelly couldn\u2019t refute that, she was a clothing monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly waved Kim over so she could ask her about her recent gains in private. \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal Kim? You spending your days back in that office eating all our inventory?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKim was sheepish to answer but broke down and told her busty companion. \u201cOk fine, I\u2019ll tell you. I started seeing someone.\u201d Kelly gave her a look that said \u2018tell me more, tell me more.\u2019 \u201cHe\u2019s way into fat chicks, so when I told him where I work he almost creamed his pants. The thing is though that he\u2019s more into bottom heavy girls. He loves he girls, but he\u2019d much rather see those pounds travel down south. Just my luck that I\u2019d land a chubby chaser and he wouldn\u2019t be a boob guy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if he\u2019s into booty send him my way, I\u2019ve got enough to drive him wild.\u201d Kelly offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! No way. I\u2019m not even going to let him meet you. He\u2019d be all over your fat ass in an instant.\u201d Kim joked. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been trying to pack on a few extra pounds to try and fill out my figure for him. It helps that he loves to spoil me. He\u2019s an amazing cook to boot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh golly Kim, before you know it you\u2019ll be as wide as me.\u201d Kelly warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI look forward to the day.\u201d Kim said confidently. \u201cOnly then will I let you meet him.\u201d Kim chuckled again. \u201cLook you poor thing, you\u2019re low on milkshake, let me go get you a refill.\u201d Kim said as she slowly spun around towards the kitchen. Yeah she definitely had packed on some serious pounds already. It looked like Kelly had rubbed off on everyone around her, and everyone was happier for it. </span></div></div>",

Kelly was initially worried but Grandma Iris told her she could handle everything on a slow Tuesday. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori arrived at Kelly\u2019s grandmas house at noon, Iris worrying her little granddaughter was going to starve woke up extra early to make an unbelievable amount of pancakes, French toast and bacon which completely covered the dining room table and some counters. Kelly now being the profesional fatty she was managed to scarf everything down with 15 minutes to spare before her friend Tori arrived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori scooped her up in her sedan whose poor suspension squealed as the 640+ pound Kelly who was now so wide she was forced to occupy the backseat, the girls made their way to the Burger joint Tori originally took her too. She mentioned she had big news to tell her and that\u2019s why Kim couldn\u2019t come when Kelly brought up the idea of inviting her, they were planning on meeting up with her after a \u201clight\u201d lunch, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey arrived after an uneventful ride and Kelly waddled through the double doors very much aware of how her hips were now barely touching each side of the door. Tori followed behind checking out her best friends gargantuan booty squeeze through the burger joints double doors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori while originally bigger than Kelly felt dwarfed by massive beauty even though she herself was 500+ pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 2 big lasses had to sit at a table since a booth couldn\u2019t fit the both of them. Tori comfortably took up 2 chairs while Kelly overflowed 3 with her wide hips. Her upper belly spilling onto the table as the waiter came to take the 2 ladies order, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori ordered the lunch special 1st, something reasonably big for any normal person but just enough to keep Tori filled up enough before they went to inevitably eat with Kim after their 1st lunch. To Tori\u2019s surprise Kelly ordered the special challenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, we\u2019re going to eat with Kim after this, are you sure\u00bf\u201d Tori asked wide eyed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI havent eaten today\u201d Kelly lied and the. She ordered a side of onion rings and the bbq chicken fries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever you say\u201d tori looked at the wall which showed only one person had successfully managed to finish the 13 pound burger along with the pound of fries in 30 minutes and that person was Kate, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls made basic small talk until the onion rings and fries arrived to which Kelly immediately dig in, foregoing utensils and simply shoveling handful of fries and then a few massive onion rings. Jelly was so methodical that by the time she looked at Tori who was staring at her massive friend in awe she was finishing the last onion ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t want any did you\u00bf\u201d Kelly laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo but good luck the main dish is coming\u201d and with that a burger the size of one of Kelly\u2019s tits showed up. Kelly with the same gusto as the onion rings chowed down on the burger as Tori slowly ate hers. To everyone amazement in the restaurant Kelly finished the burger in record time beating Kate\u2019s personal best of 29:30 and finishing every bite in 19 minutes and 56 seconds. She had eaten 14 pounds of food in less than 20 minutes. She was incredibly uncomfortable as she sweated in her chair as she lowered her tights to free her lower belly and her crop top which originally made it to her belly button now just barely covered her massive milk jugs, <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey took her photo as she smiled with pride hiding her incredibly uncomfortableness and Tori finally told her the news she\u2019s been wanting to spit out since they got their. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to baking school Kelly, it\u2019s Monday through Friday so I\u2019ll only be working on weekends, I\u2019m kinda nervous but I\u2019m excited\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe overstuffed Kelly just looked at Tori shocked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYa I\u2019m nervous but I was too poor to go to school after high school but thank god your grandma hired me, because of her I have the money to start the program and I now know I want to run my own bakery someday, I\u2019m just so nervous, did you go to college after high school\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was reminded she made it to junior year before dropping out, she remembered being a pretty much straight A student until she messed that all up, everything was coming back to her. Her father and grandfather were engineers and she wanted to keep the tradition going, she barely spoke to her parents since moving in with her grandma. She was miserable in college and had friends for the 1st time and was reasonably happy here but she was filled with a sense of regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCongrats Tori, I\u2019m really happy for you, ya I did go to college but you start school next week right, let\u2019s talk about it later, let\u2019s meet up with Kim\u201d she said somberly <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori sensing the mood agreed and the 2 got ready to go, </span></div></div>",

The riser was shaking, and the creaking was now audible as Kelly went to down on her meal. \"Kelly, we might have a problem.\" Kim hollered, but Kelly was too preoccupied to hear. And before anyone could stop her it was too late and the legs gave out and the whole platform collapsed. This sudden jolt was too much for Kelly's poor chair, form which her ass was hanging over each side generously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly plunged to the ground, and the gang rushed to her side to help her up. \"Kelly are you ok?\" They asked, and the dazed girl found her bearings before starting to laugh. \"What's so funny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit I really am a fat ass!\" She continued to laugh, the crowd realizing she was perfectly fine. \"This booty just destroyed all of that.\" She continued as she pointed at the wreckage. \"Sorry I destroyed your throne, but not sorry, that was awesome! Jakey, maybe you can get me a couple of new chairs so I can finish, ok?\" Jake was more than happy to comply, and the gang was more than happy to pull up a new table and bring out a few hot fresh new dishes for Kelly to dig into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly ate deep into the night, only to be taken home by Jake after the meal. \"Kelly, you are something else.\" Jake complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A true fatty, huh?\" Kelly murmured as tried not to put too much pressure on her full stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fatty indeed. Not everyone would let them selves go like this, you are truly a special girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What can I say, college turned me into a chubster, with my aunts help I got fat, and you, you've helped me become a real fat ass. What's next blimp?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but that's still a ways off. For now let's stick with fat ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's perfect! I don't want you to call me Kelly anymore, call me Fat Ass, or Fatty, or Porker, or anything like that. It makes me really feel like a glutton.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good Fat Ass!\" He said as he grabbed a big handful of ass blubber. Fat Ass squealed in delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say it again.\" She pleaded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faaaat Aaaaaass.\" He said all drawn out while he continued to grope her behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh God Jake, take me to the bed room, I hope you stocked it well for tonight.\" She moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I did Fat Ass.\" Jake grinned.</span></div></div>",

Grandma Iris seeing this lack of willpower struck like a venomous spider when some easy prey enters its hunting grounds. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner, Iris made sure to make every old world recipe was brought back into circulation. With a little mix of southern american cooking, each fattening dish was presented in front of her ever fattening granddaughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly cleaned every plate that came her way. Even when she was stuffed and would try and hide in her room, Iris would find her, carrying and over burdened tray of snacks to hold her big girl over until her next meal. Kelly would not remain 345 pounds for long here, and by the end of the week she could already feel her clothes getting tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe week went by in blur of forkfuls of food and time drifting off to sleep with an over full belly. When the following Monday arrived, Kelly lumbered out to the breakfast table expecting to see a huge spread all for her like she had all week. Instead she was only met with a box of donuts, and her grandmother looking ready for work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna have to go quicker than that if we are gonna get to work on time young one.\" She said to her wide granddaughter. As much as Kelly didn't enjoy being fat, eating in and out all day and into the night was at least easy and she didn't have to lift a finger as her girth grew further before her eyes. Working was going to be challenging, or at least more than just sitting on her ever widening fat ass. Needless to say, she wasn't excited about this.</span></div></div>",

This time though she was well over 100 pounds heavier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bakery had a small staff, well small only in the number of workers it employed. Of course working at a bakery, it was hard to maintain a trim physique. Of course Iris was the owner and the head chef, but she had one assistant helping her in the back. Up front she had two other older gals running the show, and now they had Kelly to do all the grunt work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three women Iris had employed had fallen under the spell of her baking despite warning from their predecessors. A few years in though they had figured out how to manage their will power, only after gaining a couple dozen pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo them though, Kelly was fresh meat. Her short stint there during the summer was nothing. Back then she was just a chubby college girl home for the summer, washing down tables to help grandma. Now it looked like Kelly was going to be around for the foreseeable future, and there was certainly much more of her to see than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill disgruntled by the weight this place had caused them all to gain, the three employees made a pact to help break in the newest member of their family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when a nearly 350 pound Kelly waddled into the bakery that day she had no clue what she was getting herself into.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cJelly Kelly...\u201d god, what an awfully mean nickname. It especially hurt the feelings of a constantly mellow Kelly, who just wanted the chance to have some confidence, but the mean girls and even some impressionable boys wouldn\u2019t let that stand. <br>\r\nFor much of her life, Kelly had been overweight. She truly enjoyed sweets and comfort foods of varying types, but not so much as to fully indulge herself. In reality, she was constantly reminded that she\u2019d have \u201cincidents\u201d of heavy amounts of late night snacking ever since she was around preschool age. It all added up over time, unfortunately. She would do some activities after school, but the weight still wouldn\u2019t come off. Well, one would rightfully ask, where were the people to step in?<br>\r\nSee, that\u2019s part of the issue. Kelly had two wonderful parents who truly loved her immensely, but they were always out at work. Her mother was a sales team director at a local startup that needed to be on it for a majority of the day to build up credibility and get noticed. Her father was a well respected employee at a landscaping business quite a few miles away, and he was working extra tough hours to impression his boss to promote him to more of a manager role. Kelly was their only child. <br>\r\nThis left Kelly with little choice but to figure out an understanding of the world by herself at times. She certainly had found food to be more of an emotional stronghold than one normally would, as the lack of stimulation she\u2019d found early on in attempting to play with other kids all the way up to elementary school had left her inclined to do so. Her parents weren\u2019t apt at cooking whatsoever and thus left the menu largely consistent of frozen and easy to bake options, a big portion of that being ice cream. <br>\r\nIt was through elementary and the early parts of high school that a dependance was built on these bad foods for Kelly. In her mind, there were too many bad memories not to go to what she\u2019d always known. Kids constantly pointing fingers at her, calling her names playing on her appearance and size, and even some insensitive kids attempting to pinch her and make fun of her \u201cstretchy skin.\u201d But Kelly would never report them... she\u2019d never really been the confident type. She let the qualms of the bullies get to her, and ultimately, she\u2019d rather drown sorrows in desserts instead.<br>\r\nIt was in the beginning of summer after sophomore year of high school that Kelly knew she needed a change. She began to subscribe and play vids from workout channels. Despite what she though would be a rough start, Kelley had actually pushed through and got to a place where she was only now soft by comparison to her old self when the end of senior year came. <br>\r\nNow a new challenge was to come... college. The fear of a new set of bullies was on her mind, but she\u2019d have to move on from that somehow. What Kelly was most scared of was truly...  </span></div></div>",

As they parted, Meg noticed that Kelly had a ponderous look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for whether or not I wanna gain weight...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit, Meg wasn't in the clear yet.</span></div></div>",

What it'd feel like, what I'd look like, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why deny yourself such a pleasure?\" Meg still couldn't believe Kelly was interested in this sort of thing as well, nor why she kept it secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like you said: I was worried about what other people thought. Sure my parents loved me and told me they would no matter what, but the eyes of my peers was enough to drive me to maintain a somewhat slimmer figure. It was all about acceptance, we've all been there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but it just sucks that you had to put up with that.\" Meg leaned over and wrapped her arms around Kelly, pulling her in for a big hug, the blonde's front smooshing into the brunette's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't the best, but I got by. And hey, now maybe I can really cut loose and enjoy myself. With your help, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeg let out a squeal of delight as she bounced on the couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you'll gain weight?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you gain it with me.

Running her hands through her hair for the third time in 5 minutes, she checked the clock on the screen. Kelly had texted her parents last night, saying she wanted to talk to them about something. They said they would video chat with her once her father got back from work at 5. Sure enough, 5:01 her laptop started to ring as she was receiving an incoming call. Kelly clicked accept, taking one final deep breath to try and calm herself down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom? Dad?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this thing working? Goddamn computer...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Language,dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the screen won't turn on to- Hey! There's my punkin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hii daddy. Hi mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, sweeite! How're you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm alright. How's the house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's quiet with you gone. The dog misses you, I swear. A couple night when we've gone upstairs to bed, we'll get to the top of the stairs and he'll turn around, looking to see if you're walking up behind us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly couldn't help but chuckle at the image. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww! Where is Buster, anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he's sleeping on the couch. I'll go get him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get the dog for crying out loud. Anyway, what's this urgent matter you wanted to talk to us about? Anything to do with your writing major?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, daddy. I'm doing fine in my journalism classes. My professor says I've gotta cut down on my details, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always did like telling a scene in length. A bit too wordy, if you ask me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's this dilemma, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly looked away, the child still unable to face the parent for fear of consequence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, daddy, I met someone in my dorm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you, now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found the dog! Look! Look who's on the screen! Who is that? Who is that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly watched as the little terrier sniffed around the computer, clearly looking for a smell instead of a picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buster! Over here!\" Kelly clapped her hands. The black dog looked at the screen, Kelly now waving her hands in the air to keep his attention. Buster wagged his tail in excitement to see his missing friend. The reunion was short-lived, though, as the little dog began to wriggle about in his mother's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never did like heights. Down you go.\" Kelly's mother said, ducking out of sight to let the dog down on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Now where were we?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly was going to tell me about this boy she met in her dorm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A <u>boy</u> you say. It was only a matter of time, you know. The Duvalle women are well-known for drawing the eye of any men with their looks. You definitely seem to be developing our famous curves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was relieved that her parents wouldn't have a problem with her putting on some extra weight. Her mother and the women on her side of the family were very much known for being 'pleasantly plump,' though she wasn't sure any were as big as she was planning on getting. That only offered her some comfort, as she worked up the nerve to tell her parents the other part of the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's his name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Meg</font>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, the connection must be bad. Didn't get that last part. You'll have to speak up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meg, daddy. <b>Her</b> name is <b>Meg</b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe barely got that out before her eyes started to cloud with tears, her face turning red as she started to quiver in her seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly, honey, what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I was a-afraid that you would g-get mad at me 'cause-'cause I don't really like *sniff* boys th-that much and d-daddy was all about \"keeping the name a-alive\".\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brunette continued to sob as her parents looked on with worry. Her mother then looked at her father, her round cheeks flushed with anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was joking, kitten! You don't have to worry about \"keeping the name alive!\" Kelly, you can do whatever you want, see whoever you want. We'll support you no matter what. I just wish your brother wasn't so hopeless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John!\" Her mother exclaimed before assaulting his shoulder with slaps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly laughed with relief. \"Yeah, Danny is pretty stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say that, Kelly! He's got two more years of high school. There's hope for him yet. But your father's right: we'll always love you, and if Meg means a lot to you, then stay with her. Just don't let all that \"romance\" ruin your grades! You're there to learn, not get a girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly felt the weight of the world fall off her shoulders with her mother's approval. It was really important that they were okay with it, and she was glad to know she could pursue a relationship with someone she felt so strongly for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know what this means to me mom, dad.\" She was grinning from ear to ear, though still wiping a few stray tears from her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile was met with their own warm smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't ever feel like you can't talk to us about anything, Kelly. We'll always be here to help you if you need us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks you guys. Wish I could stay on to see Dan, but I've got class at 5:30.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For goodness sake's, Kelly! That's in ten minutes! You better get going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am, mom! Talk to you guys later! Love you! Tell Dan I said hi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will! Love you too, sweetie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you, punkin. Talk to you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly went about the room as if she were on air, grabbing her books and reaching for her phone to text Meg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Mom n dad approve!

Having met her now \"girlfriend\" Meg at the Buddha Buffet, the local Asian all-you-can-eat place, the two shared a long embrace before proceeding to attack all manner of fatty foods in the restaurant. By now they had both put away several plates of greasy cuisine, spending the time while their taught bellies digested talking about Kelly's recent conversation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd <i>your</i> parents take it? Or have you not talked to them yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've had this discussion before...\" Meg's eyes lowered, her brow furrowed. Kelly saw this, and slowly reached across the table until she was holding Meg's hand in her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeg looked up to see Kelly smiling wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. What matters is that we're together.\" Such a simple statement was enough to pull her out of her rut and think about how lucky she was to have someone like Kelly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Meg returned the smile. \"Hey, it's getting kinda late. How about we head home?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good\" Kelly yawned, stretching her arms out. Meg watched her shirt ride up slightly to expose some of her doughy middle. This caused the blonde's stomach to flip with excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two were leaving, walking very close to each other but not holding hands, Kelly turned to Meg and asked <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Are we talking 'pleasantly plump' or flat-out obese?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you when we get back to the dorm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot being one for surprises, Kelly was glad the walk back took only five more minutes. When they got back to the dorm, Kelly wasted no time removing her constricting clothing. The skirt and t-shirt fell to the floor, and in their stead she put on a pair of sweatpants, opting to not put a shirt on that would no doubt squeeze her body. Meg of course had no qualm with her girlfriend's fashion choice, walking behind her and lightly grabbing her love handles, giving them a shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this is was from our casual snacking, I can't wait to see how much you pack on when we gain on purpose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly giggled at her excitement. \"But how big are we gonna get with all this intentional gaining?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeg walked over to her desk and sat down. Kelly stood behind her as she opened her laptop and navigated through her favorites folder. She clicked on a link for a website that Kelly had seen before. On the screen was a well-known ssbbw who was proudly advertising herself as \"a quarter-ton of fun...and still growing\". She certainly looked it: she was as wide as the two girls standing next to each other. Her arms were as big around as Kelly's thighs, which trailed off to thick fingers. Her eyes were in a permanent squint from her large, round cheeks; her face was rounder, with a prominent second chin. Meg scrolled through photos of the enormous woman to show off the rest of her body: her breasts were almost as big as her head, and they sat upon a very large gut. It formed two distinct rolls that reached low enough to cover her crotch standing up, not too far from her knees. She had an ass that stuck out at least a foot, enough to easily support a few drink glasses. All of this mass was supported by two very large thighs that were almost as big as Kelly's waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoah.\" Kelly stared at the various photos, taken aback by her size at first, before she began to feel a twinge of excitement at the prospect of being that size, having body parts as big as that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It gets better\" Meg added, searching the folder for a link to a video. Another click brought them to a video titled \"ssbbw breaks chair!\" It started simple enough: the same woman was talking to the camera. Kelly wasn't concerned with what she was saying, her focus more on the various parts of the woman's body that jiggled and shook at she shifted her weight. Soon, the large woman turned and waddled over to the table behind her, which held a plate of cupcakes. Just as she lowered herself onto the comparably small wooden chair after plucking a highly decorated confection from the plate, the woman fell to the ground. The chair cracked loudly as it collapsed under the immense weight. This caused Kelly to jump a little in shock, looking down at Meg who was staring wistfully at the round figure now rolling around, trying to gain enough momentum to sit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want us to be able to do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? How much does she weigh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, <i>quarter of a ton</i>, <i>hello</i>? That's about five hundred and fifty pounds.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly overlooked the snarky tone, her thoughts more on the number. She imagined herself that size, looking over her enormous belly to try and see how much she weighed, the digital readout flashing 550 in bright red. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five hundred...\" she trailed off, lost in thought over such a high number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know it sounds like a lot, but isn't that what you want? Don't you want to feel all that fat on your body, just wobbling with every step? Don't you want a soft, squishy gut, or enormous tits, or that fine, fine ass?\" Meg's cheeks had a slight tint of red to them now, unable to contain her arousal while trying to maintain a convincing tone. Meg's squirming in her seat went unnoticed, the brunette trying to make a decision. Five hundred and fifty pounds was obese; what sort of health problems could she have? How much would it cost her to pay for food <i>and</i> new clothing? What if she looked really bad with more weight? This was all still new territory for her, and Meg seemed pretty set on what she wanted to do. Was the payoff worth the risk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Flicking on the light, she started to get out of her prom dress. Finally, after three years of drudgery, Kelly was finally free of high school, and posed to enjoy her summer, all leading into college.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing to University was a natural fit for her. Intelligent and hardworking, Kelly had been an honor roll student throughout her high school career, not that it always helped her out on the popularity scene. Still, she'd made solid, lifelong friends, dated a bit (though nothing had really stuck), and survived the grad speeches and prom afterwards. Pulling her black dress down her frame, she looked at herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly wasn't a tall girl, 5'2\" if she was lucky. She had strawberry blonde hair, a cute face, bright blue eyes, and a warm smile. She had an ample set of curves to her, with well rounded hips, a nice ass, and her cup size was easily a C, skirting awful close to a D. Only two parts of her physique betrayed that she was at all above her ideal weight; her thighs were a little rounder then they should have been, and her tummy was certainly soft, though no rolls were apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, any such weight was far from noticeable, and given she never worked out or watched what she ate, it was clear she had a very high metabolism. Her build had certainly never caused her any problems dealing with her peers. Eyeing herself in her mirror, and liking what she saw, Kelly looked at her desk and smiled at what was on top; a nearly full box of her favorite cookies, bakery fresh home made Oreo's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd developed quite a snack habit in the stress and run up to exams, absolutely none of it healthy. Pop, chips, cookies, cake, ice cream, fast food, you name it, she was scarfing it down while studying. Kelly was quite happy that she'd not gained a pound during what was essentially an extended binge throughout her last few weeks of high school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting in her computer chair, Kelly popped open the box. Grabbing a cookie and biting into it with a soft coo, she quickly finished the first and grabbed another. Then another. And another, all the while justifying it to herself. <i>I know I shouldn't eat these before bed, but they are so good! And I worked really hard the last while, so I totally deserve this. Besides, supper was so long ago, and all they had at the dance were snacks like chips and cocktail wieners. If I didn't eat now, I'd be starving. And I really don't want these cookies to go stale.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nConscience assuaged, Kelly finished off the box, licking a finger in order to wipe up all the crumbs from the bottom. Grunting only slightly as she got out of her chair, she laid back in her bed and rubbed her stomach, which was currently hard with nearly a full dozen cookies. Kelly drifted off to sleep, her body used to her large, pre-bedtime binges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kelly slept unaware, a soft gurgle came from her hardworking tummy. Her brain was sending signals throughout her body. She was done growing, and her overcharged metabolism was at long last beginning to slow down...</span></div></div>",

Lazy ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her Dad working as a stock broker and her Mom as a lawyer, Kelly didn't need to work over her summer to afford her place at school, so she decided to take it easy for the next few months before she had to study again. The fact she had the house to herself because of her parents' busy work schedules was an added bonus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, there were certain rules she had to follow; namely, if she made a mess, she had to clean it up. This, combined with her inability to cook, and the credit card her parents paid for her, meant Kelly was eating out for almost every meal. A day that involved McDonald's for breakfast, Taco Bell for lunch, delivery pizza for supper, and a burger run or two in between meals became fairly commonplace. Kelly also made sure the kitchen was permanently stocked with junk food of all varieties for snacking on while she lazed around the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd laze around she did. Laying by the pool, soaking in an inflatable, watching a movie or playing a game inside, Kelly almost never moved, save to get more food. With the exception of her food runs, she never wore any clothes other then her bikini, and even then would usually just throw a t-shirt and some sweat pants over top of her swimwear when she went out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was perhaps because of the string bikini and stretchy clothes that Kelly failed to notice her body's slow accumulation of fat. As her metabolism slowed, the divide between needed and excess calories began to grow, and her once stable physique was at risk. So far, her thighs and bottom were the sole receivers of her newfound pudge, hiding from the rest of her just what was coming due to her poor choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Kelly's summer went by as a perpetual feast. The only change she noticed was a nice, golden tan, until one day...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>Oh, c'mon, just snap together, damn it!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought went through Kelly's mind for the dozenth time as she tried and failed to do up her jeans. With only a week to go before school, Kelly had decided to make a run to the mall, and grab a few items she'd need for college. This was the first time she's tried to put on proper pants since her holidays had started, and the wavy haired blonde was running into an unforeseen problem. Kelly was certainly getting frustrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This is ridiculous! Why is this so hard!? Did these pants shrink in the wash or something!? There's no way I gained that much weight over the summer!</i> Kelly thought, though in the back of her mind, she was starting to worry that she had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad Kelly been more observant, or more conscious of the world around her, she probably would have noticed her gradual gain. She certainly wouldn't have wondered why she gained, as the reasons were quite obvious; namely, a combination of a complete lack of exercise, and the sheer number of calories she consumed in a given day. She also should have noticed a growing dent in the deck chair by the pool as her ass grew and grew. And then there was her computer chair. Her hips now touched the arms of the chair as she sat in it, and her large ass kept her further forward in the chair then she'd previously sat, as well as creating a large groove in the material of the seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving up with an irritated grunt, Kelly eyed her evil pants in the mirror. Without her trying to pull the two halves of the material together, her flesh kept them as far apart as it was possible to get. It was fairly obvious that there was no way she was going to be able to do these pants up. And they were tight! Granted, they'd always been tight on her, but now they seemed to fit Kelly like a second skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly eyed the opening in her pants where her flesh bulged out. The skin was still smooth and lacked any rolls, but it was clear as she turned to the side that her tummy now protruded a little from her rib cage. As she turned to the side, she finally got her first good view of her ass since the start of summer holidays, and it was quite an eyeful. She'd always been a big bottomed girl, but her badonkadonk had never stuck out quite that far before. Round and firm, her butt cheeks were still very tight, their new size evident now that she was looking. With her wider looking hips and rounder thighs, there was no question; Kelly had definitely put on weight over the summer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Still, it can't all be me. Yeah, I probably got a little bigger, sure, but at least some of this must be from shrinkage. No way I gained that much in just four months,</i> Kelly thought. There was only one way to be sure. And so, after taking a moment to remove her pants (freeing her poor, constricted thighs from their too-tight confinement), Kelly went to the bathroom to step on the scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned on the scale, and waited on the prompts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" it said. She looked at herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready,\" it said. As Kelly stepped on, she saw how her panties were stretched nearly to the breaking point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calculating,\" the scale intoned in its simple monotone. As if to add insult to injury, Kelly's stomach let out a hungry growl that seemed far too loud for such a small space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scale dinged to indicate it was done, and Kelly held her breath as she waited on her results. \"...</span></div></div>",

As she stood on the scale waiting for the verdict, she looked at her wider hips in the mirror, and the straining cloth barely keeping her decent. Once again, her stomach let out a loud rumble, pointing out that Kelly was normally on her second breakfast sandwich by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"161 point 8 pounds,\" the scale said in a tone that seemed almost mocking to Kelly's ears. The poor girl was almost shocked to a standstill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How!? How did I gain over sixteen pounds in four months!?</i> Kelly's rumbling stomach was all the answer she was given, or needed. She did a quick bit of mental math, coming up with four pounds a month, and blatantly ignoring that her holidays were in reality closer to 3 months and a week, which meant her per month gain was actually higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Okay, this stops today! I knew I was indulging a bit, but to gain that much...</i> Kelly thought, facing away from the mirror and looking over her shoulder, giving her newly enlarged rear a squeeze. <i>This is crazy. Okay, calm down. It's not too late. You can fix this. First things first, you've got to start eating less, and healthier.</i> Her stomach growled in protest to management's cruel and unusual demand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You shut up! You're the reason we're in this mess!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly walked back to her room, continuing her mental checklist. <i>And I'm going to have to start exercising.</i> Kelly dreaded the thought of the sweaty, breathless spectacle she would be when she started working out. She'd dropped out of gym in grade 10 the moment they let her, but if exercise would help her shed her unwanted poundage, then so be it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back to her room, she looked at her pants on the floor. <i>No way those will fit now,</i> she thought as she dug out her trusty sweats. Those still fit just fine; she'd have to get a lot bigger before she outgrew these babies. Luckily for her, she hadn't put on any weight above her waist, so her shirts still fit just fine. She added new underwear and pants to her shopping list. While she fully intended to lose the weight, she couldn't go to college without clothes that fit. She decided she'd also grab some exercise clothes for the campus gym. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Get in shape, and stay in shape! No more slacking off!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly repeated this mantra as she finished getting ready to head out. Grabbing her purse and keys, she headed out the door and hopped in her car.</span></div></div>",

That's not what I meant to do!</i> Kelly thought as another vehicle pulled up behind her, blocking her exit. <i>Darn it! Now what!?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she got closer to the speaker box, Kelly's stomach let out a loud growl, reminding her just how hungry she was. Unfortunately for her, Kelly had precious little will power where her appetite was concerned. <i>Well... I am already here. And I really should eat breakfast. Besides, it's not like it's junk food.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she pulled up to the speaker and rolled down her window, the clerk's voice sounded through. \"Hi! Welcome to McDonald's, can I take your order?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was about to order her usual when she thought, <i>You know, if I'm going to start dieting tomorrow, I should splurge a little. Enjoy my last free day while I can.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could I get three sausage McGriddles, three potato patties, and a large coffee, two cream, three sugar?\" Her spoiled stomach growled its approval at the up-sized order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter paying for and receiving her food, Kelly drove to the mall, eating the whole way there, and finishing off her sandwiches while she was parked in the lot. Given her usual order was only two sandwiches and no potatoes, she was feeling rather stuffed when she peeled herself out of her car. <i>Oof. Okay, that was a lot, even for me. Still, it's fine for today. Today is a cheat day. I'll work all this off tomorrow.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly walked inside, gingerly cradling her overstuffed belly. <i>Well, time to get some shopping done...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs night fell, Kelly winced as she took her clothes off and got ready for bed. She looked at her overfed tummy in the mirror. It was rock hard, and had entered full blown food-baby territory. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she had shopped, Kelly couldn't help but notice the smells of the food court. Despite how much she'd eaten for breakfast, she found herself all but drooling at the aromas, and her stomach began to growl only a couple hours after she'd finished eating. <i>Well, if today is going to be a cheat day, I might as well go whole hog with it...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she certainly had at that. She'd had two lunches in the food court, spaced about two hours apart. Later, she'd met up with her friends at a local All-You-Can-Eat Buffet, where she managed to scarf down four plates of food over as many hours, including two pieces of pie and ice cream for dessert. As if that wasn't enough, she stopped at Dunkin' Donuts on her way back home and bought an assorted dozen. She'd managed to eat half the box before she got home, and was finally too stuffed to continue. Leaving them on the counter for the morning, she'd made her way upstairs to her room to get ready for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly groaned softly as she felt her stone-like belly. For once, the noisy organ was silent, packed to the brim as it was with grease, fat, and sugar. <i>Now that was a last stuffing,</i> Kelly thought as she turned off the light and gently laid back in her bed. As she drifted off to sleep, Kelly thought about the donuts downstairs. Technically, her diet started tomorrow, <i>But it's fine. Those will count as today's, not tomorrow's. I'll finish those off, then I'll be good from now on.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kelly slept, her stomach let out a soft gurgle.</span></div></div>",

Kelly's stomach quickly worked through the empty calories and sugary coatings of the pastry, and began to growl for something of more substance. Kelly tried to ignore her hunger pains, but they refused to be silenced. And as she thought about it, there was still all the snacks she'd stuffed her parents' cupboards with. They certainly weren't going to eat it. It'd just go bad if she didn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Well... I did already pay for them, and it would really be a shame to just waste them all. And there's only a week of holidays left before the start of college. It's supposed to be a vacation, right? So, I might as well do and eat as I want right now, right? I mean, the damage has already been done, it's not like I'm going to gain so much more in just a week. And I've already got some new exercise clothes, so I can just start hitting up the campus gym once I get to campus. So, I might as well enjoy myself while I can!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so Kelly kept along as she'd been this whole time, eating and snacking while sitting on her unexercised tush in her string bikini. None of her daily binges were as large as her so called cheat day, but if anything, that was a hindrance, not a boon to her weight loss plans. Because she didn't eat as much as she had then, she had the means to give herself a false positive. <i>Sure, two McGriddles might seem like a lot, but at least it's not three...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf one thing had changed in the final week of her holidays, it was the number of times Kelly went to bed with a sore stomach. She'd bought a lot more junk food then she'd given herself credit for, and she really didn't want to waste any of it. And so, she spent her evenings snacking non-stop while watching her favorite movies, pushing herself just before the end to try and shrink the pile just a little bit more. Even with her natural ability to ignore the worst aspects of her unchecked gluttony, she knew this was not a good idea on her part. But, Kelly reasoned, it would only be for a couple of days, then the junk food would be gone, and she'd be going to campus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yes,</i> she thought, <i>Everything will get back on track then.</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelly let out a huff as she hung the last of her shirts, and slid her last empty suitcase under her bed. <i>There! All done!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly's dorm was a six bedroom apartment style, located off campus. Each apartment had a large communal bathroom, living room, and kitchen, but each bedroom was private. This, as far as Kelly was concerned, made the place absolutely perfect. The only downside she had was the fact that her apartment was on the 13th floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'd been planning on taking the stairs as part of my weight loss program, but that's a lot of stairs to climb a couple times a day. And the laundry room is in the basement... No, I'll just use the elevator. Save my working out for the gym.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking of the gym, Kelly broke out her campus map. Her dorm had a bus stop just outside the door. From there, it was a short bus ride across the river, where she'd be deposited right at The Corner, which was the name given the patch of the grounds where the Main Office, Dining Hall, and Library met. It was just a short walk to the gym from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother important thing on The Corner was the dining hall itself. While it was expected that people in her dorm would take care of their own cooking, students had the option to apply for the on-campus meal plan if, like Kelly, they had no skills or inclination to cook for themselves. This suited her just fine, and she'd promptly signed up for the meal plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, it was almost time for the first campus supper of the year. Grabbing her University bus pass, Kelly put on her coat and headed out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Not bad, if a little greasy,</i> thought Kelly as the elevator took her up to the 13th floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dining hall was set up as buffet style, with the kitchen staff constantly restocking trays as the students made their way down the line and emptied them. The selection had certainly been better then she'd been expecting. Ham, roast beef, chicken cordon bleu, quesadillas, those weird \"plant\" things people ate for some unknowable reason, and the list just kept going from there. Kelly had also learned 2 things rather quickly. One, if you want something, take it, since it probably won't be there when you get back. And two, if you want to go for seconds, you have to go to the very back of the line, so it was best to make sure you got it all the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe end result of this, of course, was that Kelly had heaped her plate with greasy dorm food. Add a couple of pastries, a bowl of pudding, a bowl of jello, a large slice of chocolate cake, and her rather overwhelmed glass of water, she had a monster of a tray when she sat down at her table. More then a couple eyebrows were raised at the mound of food she had in front of her, but if anyone was put off by her gluttony, it was quickly swept under the rug of her bubbly personality. Kelly had always been a friendly and outgoing sort, and could talk to anyone about anything. She was pretty sure a couple of the guys were already hitting on her, and it was only her first day! She was definitely excited at what tomorrow would bring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bump in her ride up brought her back to reality, and she held back a grimace as she nursed her packed gut. Her eyes had been bigger then her stomach this time, and though she gave it her all, she just couldn't finish everything she'd taken. Still, she'd made one sizable dent in the pile, and at least managed to avoid wasting any of her desserts. Whether or not that was a good thing is certainly up for interpretation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>At least I can get back to my room, get my clothes off, and stretch out,</i> Kelly thought as she got off on her floor. Fumbling with her key card for just a moment, she opened the door and was greeted by quite the surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed the rest of her room mates had arrived while she was out, and the one girl (a tall, leggy brunette who introduced herself as Susan) had decided to treat the apartment to pizza. And it was quite a spread, with half a dozen extra large pizzas with assorted toppings. Kelly subconsciously groaned at the thought of filling her body with even more calories. She was supposed to be on a diet, after all! Despite its almost painful fullness, her stomach still managed to let out a subdued growl, urging her on, telling her she could fit at least a slice or two in her belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I really, really, REALLY shouldn't. It does smell good, though. I think I'll...</i></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a smile, Kelly joined her room mates for a meet and greet over pizza. They all turned out to be really nice girls, and pretty soon, Kelly was joking and laughing with them like they'd been friends for years. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one thing that went wrong that night, and that was Susan had ordered pizza before talking to any of the other girls. Had she done so, she'd have known that three of the six were vegetarians and she wouldn't have ordered five of the six pizzas with meat on them. The end result was that there was a whole pile of pizza just to split between three of the roomies. Kelly tried to hold up her end, but it just wasn't possible. She was simply too stuffed from her campus supper, and only managed to eat four slices over the course of the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith most of the pizza being boxed in the fridge for whoever wanted it, the six new friends talked and drank late into the night. Kelly, much to her chagrin, was the first to call it, heading to bed around three in the morning. Locking her bedroom door behind her, she undressed and got ready for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>They certainly seemed nice. It'll be great having them as room mates for the year. And that pizza sure was good.</i> Kelly let out a burp as that thought passed through her mind. She rubbed her belly, which was currently as tight as a drum. <i>Not that I needed that. God, there's a lot of leftovers. The fridge is absolutely packed with the stuff.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curvy blonde laid herself back on the bed with a sigh. She set her alarm for six. <i>I'll hit the gym nice and early, and start working off summer holidays and today.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly woke to the sound of her alarm buzzing in her ear. Shutting it off with a yawn, she sat up in bed and stretched like a cat after a long nap. Today was the final weekend before the start of classes, so she should be able to get two days of exercising in before everything gets busy. She'd still have to keep it up after everything did, naturally, but for today she could experiment and take her time in a way she simply wouldn't be able to in the near future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHopping out of bed, Kelly took a moment to look at herself in the mirror. <i>Looking good! Okay, yeah, my tush is still a bit lumpy, but it looks like it's already shrinking. Add in some exercise and good food, and the rest of the weight will peel off in no time!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nConvinced unconditionally of her claim, Kelly got dressed and threw her gym clothes in a bag. Passing through the kitchen on her way out, her stomach let out its familiar grumble. <i>It's bad to exercise on an empty stomach, isn't it? I should have breakfast first, but the dining hall doesn't open until 8, and I haven't done any grocery shopping yet.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Kelly remembered the left over pizza in the fridge, and that all the girls claimed it was fair game to whoever wanted it. <i>There is no way pizza for breakfast is part of my diet! But, I am heading to the gym. Any extra calories that gives me can be worked off. And it'll be nice to actually enjoy it, not just force a couple mouthfuls down my throat.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done justifying it to herself, Kelly dug in the fridge for the loaded pizza. She put two slices on the plate, then thought better of it, and added a third. Putting the plate in the microwave, she heated the food for thirty seconds. Taking advantage of the cooking time to grab herself a glass of water. When the microwave dinged, she took her slices to the kitchen table, and sat down and ate her \"breakfast.\" All too soon, she finished off her plate of leftovers. With the knowledge that she was going to work out and that campus wouldn't be serving breakfast for almost two hours, Kelly decided almost immediately that she'd have a bit more pizza. The question was: how much?</span></div></div>",

Well, it does clear one of the boxes out of the fridge, which is good. And I'm going straight to the gym. I'll just run some extra laps. Besides, it's a little late to second guess yourself now.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe microwave dinged as she finished that last thought. Kelly ate her next three slices with gusto, and her happy stomach remained silent, enjoying the comfortable feeling of being full. She wished she'd had more time to savor the pizza, but her bus was due any minute, so she swallowed quite a few bites with minimal chewing. Downing her water, she pulled on her shoes and bolted out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bus came to a stop at The Corner, Kelly stepped off and took a deep breath of the early morning air. She'd more then managed to make it on time to her stop, and had a nice, relaxing ride to campus. Now that she was here, it was time to start reversing her recent weight gain, and get back into shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly began walking towards the gym. She was in a pretty good mood. The sun was shining, the birds were singing, the gym was closed for renovations... <i>Wait, what!?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly stood in front of the large campus gym. It was clearly locked, all the lights were off, and there was a sign on the door that said quite clearly: CLOSED FOR RENOVATIONS UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. There was also some spiel about \"sorry for the inconvenience\" and what not, but Kelly was not focused on that part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh no! What am I going to do now? How can you have a diet and exercise plan without exercise?</i> Kelly thought while her mind ignored the general lack of \"diet\" in her plan as well. Kelly chewed her lip a little in thought. Seeing a passerby on the sidewalk, Kelly said, \"Excuse me, do you know when the gym is supposed to reopen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's eyes widened a little at the cute girl before him. \"No clue, I'm afraid. Building's just too old. Apparently a rafter broke off and nearly crushed a guy. They've been working on it since last year.\" Kelly's heart sank as the man put finger quotations around the word, \"working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, do you know of any gym in town I can go to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a couple around, but they aren't cheap. Cheapest one I know is something like $500 a month, and at least one breaks $1,000.\" Kelly's jaw dropped. That was more then her dorm fees! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez! Well, thanks anyway,\" Kelly said sincerely, leaving the poor guy who was still trying to work up the nerve to ask her to coffee in the dust. <i>Well, that was a bust. And I was trying so hard to make this work.</i> Kelly felt a slight jiggle from her ass as she walked across campus. <i>Guess all I can do for now is watch what I eat. Like not eat an entire pizza for breakfast...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly groaned as that thought passed through her mind, and glared at her stomach accusingly. <i>I'd completely forgotten about that! Damn it! Damn it, you bottomless bastard! Why do you keep doing this to me!? Seriously, what am I going to do?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrated, Kelly sat on a nearby bench to ponder her predicament. She felt all too aware of how wide her ass was, and that it kept her from getting right to the back of the seat. She started to hyperventilate a little. <i>Well... okay... just calm down. Breathe. Panicking has never helped anyone. Damage is already done anyway, nothing I can do about it now. For right now, that's all you can do, just watch what you eat. Get some more vegetables in your diet, and cut way back on the desserts. And I should call Mom and Dad. I can't afford those gym prices, but maybe they'd pay for me. And for all I know, the campus gym could be running by next week. That guy said they've been working on it since last year. They've got to be close to getting it done.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFilled with a renewed sense of hope, Kelly got up from her seat. She didn't feel as large as she had only a few moments ago, and her stomach no longer felt like a ball of lead. <i>Well,</i> she thought, <i>since my gym plans have been ruined, I might as well tour the campus and figure out where all my classes are. And, bonus, all that walking is exercise!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Kelly took out her map and class schedule and had herself a private tour of the campus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Man, my feet hurt.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly once again rested on the same bench at the end of her campus tour. She felt bushed, but happy. She not only knew how to get to all of her classes, but she'd given herself quite the workout, easily cancelling out the pizza she'd eaten. Or rather, so she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Kelly was unaware of it, she was in absolutely terrible shape. Not engaging in any serious physical activity since Grade 10, and being very lackluster with regards to effort beforehand, will do that to a person. In actual fact, she'd only walked about three miles. Now, the average person will burn approximately 100 calories in a mile, meaning Kelly only burned about 300 calories or so over the course of her entire campus tour, which is honestly not all that much, especially when you realize that the pizza she'd consumed for breakfast had over 10x as many calories in it, just a little over 3200. This is to say nothing of its content of fat, sugar, salt and cholesterol, each one of which is well in excess of what an average person's maximum daily intake is supposed to be by a fair margin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlissfully ignorant of these facts and feeling a mite peckish, Kelly checked the time. Seeing that it was almost nine, and convinced she'd already dealt with the pizza, she decided to grab breakfast at the campus dining hall. She had already paid for it, after all. It'd be a waste not to use it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelly walked into the dining hall, which smelt amazing right now, and got her place in line. As she made her way down the line, she loaded her tray with pancakes, bacon, sausage, a large chocolate muffin, and some grapefruit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConvinced that she had prepared a healthy breakfast, Kelly sat at a table. Covering her grapefruit in a mountain of sugar, she spread a thick smear of butter on top of each of her pancakes as she ate her fruit. Once her pancakes had a sizeable amount of butter on each, she restacked them and reached for the maple syrup. In her defense, she did grab the bottle of light syrup and used that. However, she found the taste not to her liking, and promptly poured the standard maple syrup on her pancakes, leaving them absolutely soaked in the sugary substance. She used her bacon and sausage to soak up the excess syrup after she'd eaten her pancakes, and finally turned to her muffin for dessert. It was a huge, dark thing, loaded with chocolate chips and caramel; really, it was like eating a slice of cake with breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly, however, saw no problem with enjoying the terribly fattening muffin. In her mind, she'd been quite good today. She had gotten up early, and sure, the gym had been closed, but she'd gotten a good, long walk in. She'd eaten a proper breakfast with fruit and she'd used light syrup on her pancakes (in her mind, only watering down the light stuff slightly with the standard), so she was totally justified in eating her muffin for dessert. Unwrapping the delectable treat, she bit into the warm, gooey pastry. <i>Mmm, that is so good!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the huge size of the muffin, she finished it off quickly. Checking the time, Kelly saw it was nearly ten. With the gym currently closed, there was little reason to stay on campus at the moment, and her bus would be here soon. She got up and made her way over to the exit. A long row of rollers for busing your trays ran alongside the wall by the exit, and there were a couple of trays already waiting with their dirty dishes. One of the trays, though, had another of the chocolate-caramel muffins sitting on it, still in its wrapper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Now who would waste a muffin like that? If you're not going to eat it, why grab it?</i> Kelly thought as she looked at the treat. Looking around the nearly empty dining hall, she bit her lower lip as she looked at the tempting treat. She knew she shouldn't, but it was totally untouched. It wasn't like she was eating off someone's used plate. And no one was looking at her, so its not like she'd be judged for it. Decision made, she set her tray right beside the muffin one, and in one swift movement grabbed the sugary treasure. Unwrapping her second muffin of the day, she sunk her teeth into it as she made her way outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n******<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly's trip back to the apartment was uneventful. Few people were riding the bus this early on a Saturday, so she'd had nearly the entire vehicle to herself. As she got off the elevator on her floor, she slid her key card into her door and walked inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!\" Kelly beamed as she saw her room mates were up and at it. The girls were sitting in the kitchen in various states of dress, and the boxes of leftover pizza were spread out on the kitchen table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, you made it just in time,\" Susan said. In the short time they'd been together in the building, Susan was already becoming something of the apartment's matriarch. \"Grab a slice of pizza. We're clearing some room in the fridge, then after those of us that haven't yet showered do so, we're going to make a grocery run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly's stomach growled hungrily at the thought of more food even as she mentally froze up. Thinking of all she'd eaten so far today, Kelly said, \"I really shouldn't. I already had some leftovers this morning, and I had a bite to eat on campus before coming back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, c'mon, you can have a slice. Seriously, one slice. Every little bit helps.\" Susan seemed almost pleading in her attempts to make Kelly eat even more pizza. To be fair, the boxes did take up a ton of space in the fridge, and left little room for anything else. And it was good pizza, and totally free. Plus, her new friends needed her. Heck, three of them couldn't even touch the bulk of the leftovers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but just a slice.\" Kelly dropped her gym bag to the floor and joined her housemates at the table. The small circle of friends chatted about their plans for the day. Kelly told the girls about the campus gym being closed, and the fitness conscious amongst them discussed potential gyms in town and what to do in the meantime. As they talked, Kelly wasn't paying attention to how much she ate. Kelly...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelly Miller had been pretty big for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo, scratch that. She'd been pretty <b>FAT</b> for a long time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't always been so rotund. Granted, she'd been a fairly round child according to her Mom, which she then confirmed with a whole series of embarrassing childhood photos. However, Kelly had slimmed down all through elementary school. She was probably one of the fastest girls in school, though she didn't do much with it. She played a little soccer back then, but she never really took to it full time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but think that perhaps if she had, she might be a very different person then she is now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly had also grown like a weed throughout her elementary years. By the time she was in grade six, she was almost five feet tall, and she had reached 5'4\" by the time she entered Grade 8.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that was about where she stopped growing up and, unfortunately for her, when she started growing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she tended to pinpoint her expanding waistline to middle school, in truth it had its beginnings even before then. She took to video games at an early age. Her parents, Robert and Essy (her Mom hated being called Esther), did little to curtail their daughter's recreational choice. Both were working full-time and pretty terrible hours at that, leaving her elder brother Andrew to look after her fairly frequently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew was a fairly nice guy, though like many teens, was far from the most health conscious, and totally unable to cook. Supper with Andrew was either fast food or frozen meals, generally served in portions fit for a starving teenage male, and well in excess of what Kelly herself needed in both sheer quantity and calories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears of practice allowed her to keep up with her bro in terms of consumption, and her waistline showed the inevitable after effects. Even by the 8th grade, the fairly scrawny and lanky little girl had gotten pretty chubby, her ever-increasing height the only thing keeping her weight gain somewhat at bay. All the people she hung out with, from her brother to her friends, were gamers like her, so her physical activity was next to nil. No alarm bells were set off with her folks, as her grades were simply stellar. Why would they, or anyone else for that matter, worry about Kelly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the inevitable happened. Kelly reached her max height, and her body had to figure out what to do with all the excess calories she was consuming. Matters were made even worse when Kelly dropped gym class in grade 9, eliminating much of what little physical activity she had left. From here on out, Kelly was a growing girl, though in a very different way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was consistent all through the end of middle school and her high school years, steadily gaining a pound or two a month, with a large spike November through February. Kelly was constantly shopping for new clothes, but she seldom wore them out; she was simply outgrowing them again and again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiscomfort over her expanding body led her to try and eat her weight gain fears. Pretty soon, she was daily out-eating Andrew, and it was a sad day for her when she out-weighed her brother part way through Grade 10. Between that and the relentless cruelty of her classmates, Kelly's consumption only rose. Her mealtime portions expanded, and seconds became the norm. Likewise, she soon found herself constantly snacking during her gaming sessions, watching movies, even while reading a book or studying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer weight loss attempts always ended in failure. Kelly's poor willpower made sticking to a diet nearly impossible, and she always managed to end her diets even heavier then when she started. And to say her two or three attempts at exercise went badly would be an understatement. The last time she tried in high school was just after her boyfriend broke up with her for getting too fat. She barely managed 30 yards before quitting, and promptly went home and ordered pizza. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Kelly graduated, she weighed in at a whopping 270 pounds. She didn't think she was the biggest girl in the school, as some of the ones who played rugby were real monsters. However, thanks to being significantly shorter then those girls, Kelly looked far broader, and her jiggly frame was certainly far less capable. Waddling from one side of the school to the other left her winded, and the endless barrage of comments she received certainly made her glad high school was over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, Kelly spent her summer doing what she'd always done: play some games, read a little, and eat a lot. She didn't worry about the consequences. After all, she was already so fat. What more could she do to herself?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kelly groaned as her family's old analog scale settled on 330 pounds. \"Oh my f*cking God. Are you serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was currently only dressed in her underwear. It was a rather unflattering set in plain white, bought at the local big box store. She looked in the mirror as she contemplated the scale's blunt assessment of her mass. Her wide hips just fit into the narrow bathroom mirror, and she knew if she turned around, she'd see her large butt protruding far to the back and sides. Her thick thighs pressed firmly into each other, and along with her hips, forced her into a heavy waddle the few times a day she had to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving her gaze upward, Kelly looked at her heavy belly. Her gut was divided into a trio of large rolls. The lowest and largest of the rolls was beginning to droop heavily under gravity, and she had to physically lift it if she wanted to see her hidden panties, much to her embarrassment. Her belly seemed to be expanding by the day, laying claim to more of her lap every time she sat down. Annoyingly, her lap seemed just as eager to expand, and maintain the proper belly-coverage-to-exposed-lap ratio. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps the only positive Kelly could think of as her gaze rose further, was her breasts. As she'd packed on the pounds, her boobs had taken a fair share of her new bulk. The bra she was currently wearing was a D, and she'd clearly outgrown it, as her jiggly flesh was bulging from the top and sides of the cups. With their mass being mostly composed of fat, her boobs did little to support themselves, though thankfully (if that was the word for it) her belly was a more then adequate support for the lardy things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, any joy she felt from their girth was overshadowed by the rest of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms had thickened significantly, especially her upper arms. She reached over with her right hand and gave a jiggle to her left's sagging wing, noting with distaste just how easily the blubbery flesh moved. <i>\"Christ, even my hands seem a little chubbier.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked at her chubby cheeks and developing second chin, Kelly couldn't help but wonder and hope, <i>\"Maybe the scale is wrong? These old things were never exactly accurate. I mean, yeah, I'm big, but to gain 60 pounds in a summer is crazy. That'd be a pound every couple of days. There's no way that can be right. Right?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly thought back to how she spent her last summer before college. Staying up late playing games, sleeping in until ten or so. Grazing constantly on chips and snack cakes. Downing pop by the case. Bag of McGriddles for breakfast. Bag of burgers for lunch. Bucket of fried chicken in the afternoon, pizza late in the evenings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEating, eating, eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever moving more then the few steps between her computer chair and the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, except when she made a fast food run, and that hardly counts as exercise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly looked between the scale and her visage in the mirror. She ran her hand across her belly, giving her overstuffed rolls a shake. <i>\"... well, it may be accurate. God damn it.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlicking off the bathroom light, Kelly plodded slowly back to her bedroom, feeling her expansive cheeks wobbling with each heavy footfall. Squeezing through her bedroom door, she felt her hips grazing the frame as she made her way through. She settled into her computer chair with a sigh, feeling the arms dig into her wide hips as she did so. She powered on her PC, feeling her booty drooping over the side of her seat as she waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne the left side of her desk were two pizza boxes, both extra large pepperonis with extra meat and cheese. To her right was an open family sized bag of dill pickle chips and half a 2L of cream soda. She'd already started into the pizza when she was struck with a sudden desire to know her weight, and she grabbed another slice for her every hungry maw, hardly about to break her bad habits tonight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"If that scale is right, and I put on 60 pounds... I mean, holy shit. That's insane. I've got to do something and get this under control. Otherwise I'll be as big as a house by Christmas.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Tomorrow, though. Definitely tomorrow.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** *** ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kelly! Let's go! I want to get there before dark!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming, I'm coming,\" Kelly gasped as she heaved her flabby frame up the basement stairs. She'd been dutifully avoiding noticing how much more she'd been struggling with the stairs lately, and after several trips, she was really regretting that decision. Getting to the landing, she let out a final gasp, grateful she didn't have to take them again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a moment to catch her breath, she went outside. Her brother, Andrew, was waiting by his truck. Both siblings had black hair and blue eyes, and had clearly taken after their mother's Greek heritage. He was a fair bit taller then his sister, just a hair over six feet. He was also half her weight, much to her annoyance. <i>\"As if I needed a reminder just how fat I am.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew's truck was an old Chevy with a trailer cap over the box, and it was currently full with the two students' baggage. Despite being a fair bit older then his sister, Andrew was only a sophomore at college. Lacking his sibling's exceptional grades, Andrew had gone to work for a couple of years to earn the needed funds for school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly, meanwhile, had easily earned a number of academic scholarships, and was able to go on to post-secondary immediately out of high school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew raised an eyebrow at her as she loaded the last of her luggage. The bulk of the truck was easily his stuff, and his sister had loaded only a single duffel bag of clothes. \"Is that all you're taking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yes,\" Kelly answered, slightly red in the face, though she wasn't sure if it was from embarrassment or exhaustion. She didn't have the stomach to tell her brother that she'd gotten too fat for the bulk of her wardrobe. It had been quite a rude surprise when she started packing earlier in the week. Kelly had spent most of her holiday in leggings and a stretchy tank top, though she'd swapped out the leggings for a pair of her Dad's sweats when they split down the sides. Even though it should have been obvious, it was only as she was trying on her old clothes that the scale of her gain became readily apparent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was currently wearing her largest remaining articles, and even these had gotten rather tight. Kelly had stuffed herself into her largest remaining jeans, which were digging painfully into her waist. Her tank top was skin tight, and it was a struggle to keep her lower belly roll covered by the shirt, attempts at forcing the roll into her pants having failed utterly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was also wearing one of her Dad's hoodies, which thankfully was still a little large on her. <i>\"Except the sleeves,\"</i> Kelly thought as her body reminded her why she hated sleeves so much. She could feel a sheen of sweat forming on her skin already, her well-insulated body not appreciating the extra layer. However, she really didn't want Andrew to see just how huge she'd made herself in such a short time. Honestly, Kelly was just thankful that Andrew's own body ran so hot, as it was guaranteed he'd have the truck's a/c cranked the entire journey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not like I need to pack that much. I can grab anything I lack at the campus store. Well, shall we get going? We're burning daylight, after all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Andrew said as he climbed into the truck. Kelly let out a breath she didn't know she'd been holding and joined him in the front. As she sat in the truck, Kelly felt her booty spread across the seat. One cheek was squished by the door. The other, meanwhile, was trying to rise over the center counsel. She felt her blush get worse as she struggled to put on her seat belt, as the buckle was hidden under her butt a good ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arm fat had the sleeves of the hoodie skintight, and Kelly was worried her sweat was dampening the material noticeably. She looked at herself in the vehicle's mirror, not happy with what she saw. <i>\"Jesus, I look like the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** *** ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer humiliation get worse when, a couple hours into their journey, the Miller's stopped for lunch at a nearby McDonald's. Kelly pushed her diet plan once more back to tomorrow, and ordered a pair of double quarter pounders with cheese, a large fries, a large chocolate shake, and three apple pies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she devoured her considerable fast food feast, Kelly felt a large rip from the front, and her pants felt far looser and more comfortable afterwards. She discretely ran a hand under her shirt, making sure Andrew didn't see her doing it, confirming that the button on her pants had just popped off. Had it not been for her shirt and hoodie, the button would have ricocheted off the glove box of the truck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Oh my f*cking God.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n*** *** ***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of curiosity, where are the siblings attending college?</span></div></div>",

Kelly walked back to her room (much to her chargin) and plopped down on her bed. Then she noticed. One bed, one sink, one chair, and one desk. \"Yes! Yes!\" she jumped up and down cheering and also causing the room to shake.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly had for a dorm all to herself. One thing that Kelly loved more than food. Was privacy. Kelly could do anything (within reason) in her room and nobody would question or know about it. She celebrated by pulling out a rootbeer out of the minifridge and chugged it. \u00a0Kelly remembered all of the time she was over protected by her parents. She couldn't date, hang of with friends after school, or participate in sports. The explain most of her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'm finally *beeeelch* free.\" she whispered. Before Kelly knew it she had finished the whole six pack of rootbeer. Her stomach felt extremely bloated with rootbeer. Kelly quickly unfastened her shorts button and let her Buddha belly push out to ease some of the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly rubbed her stomach and slowly let out loud and soft belch's. \"Yep privacy is the best.\"<br>\r\nShe said with a smirk.\u00a0<br>\r\n\"What should I do now?\" Kelly thought to herself.</span></div></div>",
