Her short, petite frame was shown off well with her floral blouse and blue jeans, and while Paula didn\u2019t have the face of a supermodel, she looked plenty pretty to Jed. He was standing a few feet behind his girlfriend, his eyes on her short brown hair, cut into a bob, trying not to look bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t that Jed hated shopping, though he kind of did, but this thrift shop trip was eating into their valuable Sunday time. Jed worked weekdays, while Paula\u2019s shifts were from Tuesday to Saturday, so this was the only day they both had off together all week. Not feeling like dressing up, Jed had clad his tall, slim build in an old Star Wars shirt and some old jeans with holes in the knees. They weren\u2019t cut out, he had just tripped a few months ago while wearing them. He ran his fingers through his shaggy brown hair while thinking of a reply. \u201cYeah, it sure is...something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula rolled her eyes, but she could see Jed\u2019s point. While it was fun to browse this place, there wasn\u2019t much that she\u2019d actually want to buy. They were both still paying off their car loan and student loans, so money was somewhat tight. She was about ready to leave, when her eyes caught glints of metal on a shelf that piqued her curiosity. Walking closer, Paula saw two old coins on a shelf, one gold, the other silver. They looked gorgeous, but didn\u2019t have any price markers on them. Turning to the shopkeeper, she held the coins up and asked, \u201cHow much for these?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman tending the shop looked over, squinted, and shrugged. \u201cTwo bucks each would be fine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis interest caught, Jed walked over to see the coins himself, and he too immediately wanted to own them. He looked at Paula and asked, \u201cDo we want both of them, or just one?\u201d</span></div></div>",

The garbage needed to be taken out, the fridge needed to be excised of all rancid food, a shopping list for groceries, there was a lot to take care of. But Paula was staring down the barrel of a full week of work, of work she really wasn\u2019t looking forward to. So, instead of getting done what had to be done, Paula decided to push that back for later, maybe after Jed got home, and instead relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked over to the couch, laid down on it, relaxing her entire body, and turned on the television and their game console. Unbeknownst to Paula, as she flicked through apps to find the right show to binge, the gold coin in her pocket heated up, glowing, and the magic flowed into her. Her mostly flat stomach expanded out, giving her a hefty muffin-top that would turn into a pooch of a belly if she unbuttoned her shorts, and soon her entire body got a little larger, a little fatter. Her breasts grew with this, and soon her tank top grew to match her wider build, and the bra she\u2019d put on vanished, leaving her hefty breasts lying free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finally finding a program she was interested in watching, Paula found a way to relax even further, still unaware of what had befallen her body. As the show\u2019s opening was rapping up, she yawned and wondered why she had even considered doing all those chores. Why didn\u2019t she just make Jed do them?</span></div></div>",

Realizing she hadn't eaten anything yet, Paula stopped the streaming device from going to the next episode, got up from the couch with a stretch, and walked over to the kitchen. Her body felt a little more wobbly, from all the extra fat, but Paula shrugged that off without much thought, reaching the fridge and opening it up. They were at the tail end of their last grocery haul, and besides cooking essentials the only real edible things left in the refrigerator were leftovers. There were a few slices of pepperoni pizza from a few nights ago, the last slice of lasagna, and a piece of cheesecake in a to-go box from when they'd eaten out on a date a few nights before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, any one of those would have been enough to sate Paula for a while, maybe even until Jed came home, but she found herself grabbing all three of them and taking them to the table. It wasn't that she was ravenously hungry or anything. She needed something to eat, sure, but it felt like grabbing all three was just the natural thing to do. She started with the pizza, eating it cold instead of heating it up, and it tasted surprisingly good, almost as good as when it was fresh. Paula started eating faster and faster, not paying too much attention to anything except her own gluttony. While she ate, her waistline expanded out a few more inches, turning what was a little pooch of a belly into something more substantial, though not quite enough to hang down if left unsupported. At the same time, her skin changed hue, shifting from pale into a light pink, her ears moved up into her hairline and grew out into floppy pig ears, and her nose flattened out into a little piggy nose. After she'd finished polishing off the cheesecake, licking the last bits off her fingers, Paula noticed the change in her skin tone and looked down in confusion, seeing her much larger state. She wasn't sure what had happened to her, but she could feel the coin messing with her mind as well, changing her personality.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Paula's mind was reeling. She'd become some kind of pig person, and so fat! It was terrible, it would take so long to get back to normal! Then, as if a switch flipped, she suddenly looked at the changes in a different light. What was wrong about being a pig person? Nothing. In fact, there was something immediately freeing about it. Paula considered that she no longer had to worry about what she ate, after all, she was a pig. She didn't have to give a shit about her hygiene either, who would give a fuck about that, she was a pig! As if to cement that fact, Jenna strained for a second and let out a loud, obnoxious fart from out of her fat ass. The smell immediately reached her more sensitive pig nose, and it was one of the worst farts she'd ever had, but that just made her grin. Before, Paula was embarrassed whenever she passed gas, especially when it was smelly. But this was so much better. Being gross and crass, it just felt like so much fun. What was more, Paula knew for certain that, not only was it clearly that gold coin that had changed her, but it was also what was making her think differently, she was aware of how her personality had changed. Despite that, Paula liked being a pig, even if that was part of the transformation itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the door to the apartment opened and Jed entered, looking pale. \"Jenna, the coins, they're...\" Then he looked at the fat pig woman sitting in their kitchen, barely fitting into the clothes she'd been wearing when she transformed. \"Ah...I see you've found out. Your coin said Become What You Seek, right? What did you do that made you like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, Paula scratched an itchy spot on one pink boob as she started talking. \"Well, I was supposed to do chores and shit, but I was feeling lazy so I took a nap instead, that's probably what started this. Then I started eating a ton of leftovers, which is probably a piggish thing to do, so here I fuckin' am. I gotta say though, it isn't half bad at all, I love being a fat pig.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJed shook his head, frowning. \"That's because of the coin, dear. My coin says Shape What You Were, and I was showing it to Bill at work when he suddenly made a joke about how easy the lady managers had it, when suddenly it glowed and he'd become a woman in her mid-forties, and the manager of the store! Everyone there thought it was totally normal, only Bill and I remembered the truth. I took the coin back, but if we can find a way to reverse this we should help him too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPaula got up from the table, her body jiggling as she did so, and walked leisurely across the room to Jed, who wrinkled his nose at her smell. \"Yeah, I don't remember you having a friend named Bill, but I do remember you telling me how fucking hot your manager Billie was, so it definitely fucks with reality or some shit.\" Then, without really noticing, she let out a burp right in Jed's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geese, the coin really did I number on you, honey. You should take a bath, you...kind of reek. And I'm kind of pissed you didn't do any cleaning, you've had all morning, and the apartment looks disgusting.\" Jed didn't normally go off on Paula like this, but this situation was crazy and he was at his wit's end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response, Paula lifted her shirt off of her and showed him her flobby pink torso. \"<i>Honey</i>, I'm a fucking pig. I know I stink, I know the house is dirty, and I don't give a fuck. When did you become such a neatfreak? Why don't you just become a fucking ______ while you're at it?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The words had barely left Paula's mouth when a bright glow suddenly emanated from Jed's pocket. Perhaps it was triggered because Paula herself held Jed's coin's twin, or perhaps she was simply standing close enough to him when she made her remark. Regardless of the reason, the coin began to glow and reality shifted, with only the two souls standing there being any the wiser to how it had been altered. Where before there had stood a man in a rather traditional work uniform, now stood a woman. Not just any woman either: with an hourglass figure, large breasts, and a combination of clothes and body language that screamed domesticity, this woman was the platonic ideal of the classic housewife. The woman retained the brown hair they had as a man, but it was now much longer and styled in a way that framed his pretty face perfectly. Jed suddenly looked down at his changed body, shocked by what had happened. \"Oh dear,\" were the first words to come to his head and leave his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Paula looked on, shocked. She had just transformed her husband...into her wife. New memories started appearing in her head, of how the old, skinny Paula and Jen had met in college and soon become girlfriends, then life partners, than married. It wasn't long before they'd decided, what with how stressed Jen often got having to work, that Paula would carry that responsibility while she took care of the household chores and worked on more creative endeavors. Once all that information had settled in her mind, Paula was conflicted. Part of her wanted to try and reverse this, to get Jed back. But the other part of her thought this was fucking perfect. Now, Paula could have someone clean up all her messes so she wouldn't have to do any chores herself, and since Jed didn't seem to care for her bigger, crasser self, why should she exactly mourn the guy? But Paula knew that was the coin talking...and was struggling with whether that would effect her decision.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She leaned forward, watching Jed's pretty face wince from her smell, reached into his purse, which had appeared magically with the transformation, and snatched the silver coin right out of it. For a moment it looked like Jed was going to try and stop her, but Paula barked, \"No!\" and Jed froze. Looking over the coin blatantly in front of Jed, Paula said, \"Maybe I'll let you have this back if I feel like it. Right now, you need to clean this house, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe housewife looked around, seeing more clearly now all that needed to be done, and sighed. \"I suppose you're right...but I do want that coin back when I'm done!\" That last attempt at an ultimatum sounded rather weak to Paula, who just chuckled to herself before walking over to the couch and plopping down, her body jiggling in response. She watched trashy television, something she'd never done before but seemed completely natural now, while she waited, and after an hour and a half she found the television was blocked by Jed, who was looking at her and trying to put up a front of irateness. \"Well?\" he asked, hand out for the coin. Little did Jed know, it was time for Paula's plan to come into play.</span></div></div>",

After all, she was already pretty satisfied with how big and lazy she was, but there was the issue of Jen. Despite the coin altering their history, Paula didn't really find her sexy. She just wasn't into girls, and she didn't want to turn Jen back into Jed. No, there was a much better solution. Holding the coin more tightly, Paula said, \"What if I had been born a male boar-person, and I was your husband, Jen?\" Just as she'd expected, the coin flashed brightly and she suddenly found herself with quite the different body. She was just as fat, just as porcine, but now her boobs looked and felt different, not nearly as sensitive, and they were smaller. Really, they were just the fatty moobs a big guy would have. Her whole body was hairier, with a full mat on her chest, a forest under each arm, and enough pubic hair to make finding her junk more difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least, it would have been if she'd still had a pussy. Instead, Paula now had a thick, meaty cock and a pair of porky testicles. Looking over her changed body the new memories starting flooding her and Jen's minds: Paul was an uncouth, bossy, crass anthro boar who worked a security job where he watched security cameras all day. It was for the best anyway, with his awful smell and his terrible manners, few could stand to work with him directly. Jen, his wife, was the only person he ever showed much affection to, and even then he never held back around her, something she'd always apparently liked, enough to be his housewife anyway. Paul shook his head, still getting used to what he'd done, then smiled at Jen. \"You really want this coin back?\" Jen nodded fervently, and Paul laughed. \"Alright then...\"</span></div></div>",

I won't do that, I'm a man!\" Despite his words, a blush was starting to form as he looked at it, his mouth watering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis claim made Paul start laughing. \"A man? No. <b>I'm</b> a man! Look at yourself! The only way you can be a man is if you use the coin, and the only way you're going to get it is by sucking me off! Any real man would suck a guy off to reclaim his manhood, no problem!\" Looking defeated, Jed knelt down on his knees and started the one-eyed monster in the face. The smell was awful, but also musking in some way, making him start to feel hotter, but he pushed that feeling down, took a deep breath to calm himself, and leaned forward to talk the cock into his mouth. Despite his fears, sucking cock came to Jed very quickly, naturally, like it was something he'd been doing for years. The taste was actually pretty good, salty and savory, and once he started really getting into it he wondered why he'd been afraid to start. Suddenly, Paul's hands were in his hair, holding him down on the cock. \"Oh fuck, that's so good. I'm gonna fill your mouth, you slut.\" The newly minted boar-man hadn't been ready for the sensations, and before he knew it he was having his first male orgasm, filling Jen's mouth with his cum, which she dutifully swallowed. Basking in his afterglow, he looked down at Jen and asked blearily, \"So, still want to change back?\"</span></div></div>",

With no other rationalization than the fact that she hadn't gotten enough sleep the night before, she closed her eyes and drifted back to Dreamland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coin did not let this act of sloth go unnoticed, and began to change her accordingly. As she snored in blissful sleep, Paula's stomach grew larger, until it had become a round belly that stood out an inch or so from her waist, though not quite big enough to hang down from gravity. Her body on the whole become a little softer and rounder, but the next big change was unfolding as her shaven armpits and pussy grew thick, course hair. Just before she woke up, Paula's final change took place: her sweat glands began working a bit harder, coating her skin in a layer of sweat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRousing herself from a half-dream she couldn't remember, Paula sat up on the couch and yawned, when she was suddenly hit by the smell of her sweat and body odor. For a moment her only reaction was an odd sort of pride, but that faded quickly as she realized it was odd to have sweat that much from a small nap. Paula stood up and immediately noticed her center of balance was off, looked down, and was shocked to see her larger form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran to her bathroom and stared into the full length mirror. The woman that stared back at her was at least thirty pounds heavier than she normally was, and she reached down in morbid curiosity to sink one hand into her soft belly. Remembering the smell, Paula took off her shirt and raised an arm, only to find her armpit covered in thick, brown hair. She stripped completely, lifted her stomach, and saw her feminine mound adorned with a bush of shaggy hair itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled out the coin, and read the inscription: Become What You Seek. Had her laziness turned her into this...slob?</span></div></div>",

Curious about this, he opened his bleary eyes, looking down to notice there was something protruding from his chest, poking it, he noticed that it was jiggly, in his tired state, it took him a few seconds to figure out what happened. He surmised that somehow whatever was happening to Paula was spreading to him. He stood up, and took off his shirt to inspect, the shirt slipped past his head, whatever was on his chest got caught in it and it flopped down onto his belly, he swore he didn\u2019t have that before. Inspecting what was on his chest further, he noticed expanded nipples, \u201cWhat the hell, do I have... tits.\u201d He then looked under his arm and noticed scraggly hair that definitely wasn\u2019t there before. Fearing the worst, he slipped off his pants and underwear with bated breath, looking down, he saw a scraggly patch of hair covering some lady parts, realizing that he wasn\u2019t a he anymore, she was... oddly indifferent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    No longer being a man, Jed decided to give herself the name Jen, and decided to inspect her body. Of course there were her tits, which she guessed to be HH-s, they were flabby, soft, and sagged a little. Her belly was a very good size, sticking multiple inches out, enough to let her breasts rest on it. Her hips stuck out about three inches on each side, complete with love handles, definitely birthing hips, she decided to give them a hearty slap, causing half of her body to jiggle. This jiggling brought her attention to her ass, which, reacting to the jiggling, let out a small poot, which made her feel oddly horny, however, the ass itself, it was huge, like two ice cream tubs of lard were dumped onto a table and someone shaped them to look vaguely like asscheeks. She then brought her attention to her new cellulite pocked thighs, which were so large that they perpetually squished together, even when she spread her legs, which would probably be a lot from here on out. She was even shorter now, standing at about 4\u201911z<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    She grabbed and jiggled the new flab, getting pretty turned on by the whole thing, she\u2019d become so fat overnight, she even had the beginnings of bingo wings. However, all this movement made her sweat, like, a lot, within a few minutes of grabbing and groping, she was already covered in sweat and panting. \u201cFuck, why am I so tired, and why does this feel so good, the weight pulling down on me, the feeling of it all jiggling, and my smell, my god my smell, it\u2019s so, di-dis-disgu-hot.\u201d She said in a slightly husky, yet slightly feminine, voice, \u201cGod, I should get some clothes on.\u201d Jen picked up the clothes she was wearing, sniffing them, they smelled like she did, horrible, but she put them on anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Jen turned her attention to Paula, who was wearing a dirty tank top that showed off her whole armpit situation to the whole world, and a pair of panties, nothing else, but this turned Jen on for some reason, \u201cMmmm, Paula didn\u2019t look so good last night.\u201d Deciding to share the news with your slobby lover, you decided to...</span></div></div>",

Realty shifted, and where there was once a young man, there was now a young woman. Her uniform was largely the same, though changed to fit her new body. Her caramel skin tone remained, though it now came with a pair of large, soft breasts forming lovely cleavage in her polo shirt and a succulent ass that filled out her work pants excellently. Her face was absolutely gorgeous, with thick lips and eyes that drew in attention like a black hole. Her hair was long, wavy, and smelled like strawberries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked very, very confused, as did Jed, who didn't understand what was happening until the person asked, \"W-what happened to me?\" Then, the woman looked down at her body as if she'd never seen it before. Then her eyes met Jed's, and she could see how confused he was too. Before they could say anything, a customer approached the register and the woman automatically gave the middle-aged man with a small basket of groceries a dazzling smile. \"Hello, my name is Dominique, did you have any issues finding anything?\" Dominique checked him out like a pro, but Jed didn't miss the way she casually stroked his ego and gave him choice access the gorgeous sights of her body. Then, once the guy had left, she turned to Jed and hissed, \"What is going on? Why am I suddenly a woman?\"</span></div></div>",

All over her body, Paula looked like she'd packed on some weight, she must have been at least 250 pounds now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDominique was looking at her too, sympathy in her eyes. \"Looks like what you said about her having a coin too was right.\" Then, some other emotion flickered across her face, and she leaned over to kiss Jed on the cheek.

Perhaps, give me more warning in the future? If you want to?\u201d Then, realizing Jed was looking around at how clean everything was, Paula gave him a pleasant smile. \u201cAh, yes. Based on my new memories of today, when I started doing the dishes, it made me think about having to do the chores more often, like I was your maid.

The sadness almost immediately disappeared as if it had never existed, and Paula started with the underwear before trying on the whole outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid outfit was a red thong, a red push-up bra, a tight blouse that showed off both cleavage and midriff, and a pair of shorts so small it left little to the imagination. As she put on these clothes, her body changed to fit them. Her breasts expanded out, going from a 34B to a 32E in bra size, while gaining an hourglass figure as her waist cinched in and her hips and ass grew. Paula also grew half a foot, becoming quite tall for a girl, and her skin tanned until it looked like she'd spent days perfecting it's caramel tone, and her hair lightened into a bright blonde. Once the clothes were on, and the changes complete, she looked back into the mirror and saw what had happened.</span></div></div>",

Rather than answering the question he\u2019d actually just been asked, Jed instead asked a question of his own. \u201cHow do we turn her back?

It doesn\u2019t matter if she was _never _a bimbo, but the coin made her one recently, y\u2019know?\u201d Then, giving a cheery smile, she finished, \u201cThat all said, don\u2019t give up all hope. We may not have what you need, but there\u2019s a place in town called Spells R Us that should have something that can help, the wizard always does.\u201d With all the weird things going on, Jed had no clue if that was a joke or if the guy was really a wizard. \u201cThe only problem with him is sometimes his solutions aren\u2019t ones you particularly like.\u201d</span></div></div>",

When the guy leaned down to kiss her, she didn't resist, in fact she leaned in herself. Her neighbor put an arm around her waist and pulled her into his apartment, which hadn't really been set up properly yet, but he led her to a bedroom and there was a bed, and that was all they needed. They both undressed quickly, her eyes admiring his muscles and his cock, which was a little shorter than Jed's but thicker around. Their kissing became making out, which became oral, which became sex. She did make him put on a condom, after all, she didn't want to get pregnant.

And...wait a second, this had been a plain tank top, is hadn't been bedazzled to say \"Open for business\". The way she'd acted, it was so out of character for her, but at the same time it was a struggle to feel bad about it. Paula had never cheated on Jed, never even really thought about it, but now it came with a thrill. Jed was nice, after all, but variety was the spice of life. Paula shook her head, trying to dislodge these foreign thoughts...and felt the gold coin in her shorts pocket jingle around. Pulling it out, she saw it written once again, \"Become What You Seek\". Had...had this coin made her into more of an adulterous slut because she'd acted like one, been perceived like one? What did the coin Jed had with him do?

Using an taxi app, Paula waited impatiently for her driver until he had arrived, apparently some guy named Dan in a spiffy new sports car. She quickly left the apartment, locked it, then went up to the car in the parking lot of the complex. It immediately struck her that Dan wasn't exactly bad looking, a guy in his early thirties with short black hair and a thick beard. He was also driving a really nice car, which probably meant money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually, Paula used the backseat when taking cabs like this, but for some reason she found herself sitting in the passenger seat, as if that was normal. Dan clearly checked her out as she entered, and they shared some small talk as he drove her to the grocery store where Jed worked. The more they talked, the more Paula felt they were beading around the bush of their mutual attraction, until she couldn't take it anymore. When stopped at a red light, she gave him a coy smile, reached over to unzip his pants, freed his cock, larger and thicker than any she'd seen before, then bend over to take it into her mouth. Dan was clearly surprised, but he wasn't complaining. She sucked his cock like a pro as he drove, to the point where he let out the occasional moan. Paula was a little scared he'd crash, but instead he came in her mouth, which she swallowed with the satisfaction of being able to taste the delicious, salty semen this time, then delivered her safely to the destination. As she entered Jed's workplace, some part of her was embarrassed and confused as to why she'd done that, but in reality she knew why: Paula had wanted to suck the man's cock, and she had, and it was fun.</span></div></div>",

That jealousy had never gone anywhere, Jed didn't actually seem to like Diana much, but Paula couldn't help but notice that the feeling wasn't mutual. If she was right, it seemed like Diana very much liked Jed, though she had never been able to prove it. None of that matched with what Jed was saying. \"What I remember, and apparently no one else in the world does except me and Diana herself, is that she used to be a career mom, working here to support her family. Then, I was talking with a friend about her, wondering if she was any less of a hardass when she was younger, then the coin starting glowing and Diana had changed! And it seemingly changed reality too, all evidence shows this new reality as the right one.\" A curious look appeared on his face, and he asked, \"So, what did the gold coin do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, it felt like time had stopped for Paula. What was she going to do? Tell Jed that some guy thought she was the kind of girl who would sleep around and the coin made her be that way, that she'd fucked their neighbor and sucked off the guy who gave her a ride here? Jed sometimes worried about things like that, and even with the coin causing it, there was no way to know how he'd react. <i>Maybe he doesn't need to know,</i> Paula suddenly found herself thinking, her inner voice sounding more husky than normal. <i>I can just tell him something else, leave the sex out of it.

So, with a quick word to his supervisor, he got out of the last hour of his shift, then drove home with Paula. She seemed really happy that he wasn't angry with her, and halfway through the drive she decided to try unzipping his pants and giving him a handjob as a thank you. As much as Jed appreciated the gesture, he let her know that he was okay with doing sex stuff at home.

Derek was average height for a teenage boy, and with his pale skin and baggy anime t-shirt, it was clear that being outside was not his favorite activity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis best friend Jayden, on the other hand, was the tallest kid in their class, and his curly red hair made his freckled face stand out, as opposed to Derek\u2019s short brown hair.

A preserved dead animal, floating in a jar of formaldehyde sitting on the shelf, caught Derek\u2019s eye and he shuddered, suddenly wanting even more to leave the creepy store. \u201cDude, let\u2019s get out of here...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around and suddenly Jayden was there, grinning from ear to ear. He held up two coins, one gold and the other silver. \u201cI\u2019m totally going to buy these! They\u2019ve got some creepy inscriptions on them, they\u2019ve got to be magic or something!\u201d Before Derek could say anything, Jayden walked over to the man behind the cash register and pushed forward the coins. \u201cHow much for both of these?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner of the thrift store gave the items a critical eye, thought for a second, then said, \u201cI\u2019d be willing to let you have \u2018em for...five bucks each.\u201d The two teens looked at each other: they had ten dollars between them, just enough to buy both.

We're supposed to be guys! And, like, smart!

Like, if you don't want to be hot and popular like me, then you can just totally just hang with the losers!\" Bonnie said in her Mean Girl voice, and Derek felt his body changing as the coin flashed. The JEssica part of him screamed in terror as she faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek immediately felt heavier, and warmer. Looking down at himself he now saw that he was wearing a plain sweater that was draped over several layers of fat that now coated his body. His breasts were still large, though they lacked the firmness that his Jessica body had, now simply bloated from fat. Derek felt a pinch at his wasitline and looked down, seeing a pair of slightly too small jeans materializing across his plump legs and cradling what he knew was a massive posterior. Where once had been designer sandals were now just a pair of ladies's Converse sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek turned to look at his newly enlarged rear and was startled by the mane of impossibly curly, frizzy brown hair that slid into view as he turned. Picking at it with a pudgy hand that that no longer had fabulously manicured and painted nails, he could feel that in place of the silky smooth texture that his hair had while Jessica was now rough and course and barely maintained. He pushed the pair of thick rimmed glasses back up on his nose without even realizing it, and turned to stare at Bonnie as new emotions flooded him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone were the flirty, airy, fun thoughts and desires of Jessica, now the cynical and bitter thoughts of Tabitha took their place, melding with Derek's own in a way that he wasn't sure if he could tell where he ended and Tabitha began. Tabitha liked geeky things, video games, science fiction, and definitely fantasy, and knew more than Derek ever did about Physics. That was the whole reason that, in this version of reality, Bonnie was even being seen with Tabitha, the two girls being enemies. Predator and prey. Bonnie was here at Tabitha's house to tutor her and get her science grades up in return for extra credit, and unofficially so that Bonnie would lay off Tabitha and the rest of the loser girls that she hung out with a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh god' Derek thought as he looked up Bonnie, realizing that his new body was barely five feet tall. Bonnie smiled evilly with her perfect white teeth, and suddenly Derek was aware of the set of braces and a retainer in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, that look totally suits you! You could have totes been a hottie, but now you're a nottie!\" Bonnie giggled at her own poor joke as she retrieved a small mirror from nearby, flipping it towards Derek's face, \"Here, take a look at yourself 'girlfriend'!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek stared at his new reflection. His face was chubby and absolutely covered in freckles and several pimples and acne. A piggy nose and mouth that seemed just a little too large for his new face and beady eyes that seemed larger because of the glasses. The massive glasses dominated his face, and he quickly pulled them off, only to have the world go entirely blurry to where Bonnie, just two feet away, was a brightly colored blur. Derek slipped the glasses back on and the world swam into focus once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Derek said, his voice a feminine croak, throaty, husky, not at all like the sing-song perfect voice he had as Jessica, \"We're...we're supposed to be friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like L O L\" Bonnie said, her laugh a cruel cackle, \"As if! I would never, like, be friends with you! I'm totally was just here to get my grades up, you dork! But now I like, totally have a party to get to! You could have gone and we could have hung out but now you get to, like, be here all alone! But hey, I'll totes keep my eye out for someone for you! Maybe some other loser than can, um, like what were we talking about? Oh yeah! Like, some other loser that can get caught in your gravototional pull!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Bonnie turned and sashayed out of the house with the Coin, leaving Derek/Tabitha alone and on the verge of tears.</span></div></div>",

We have, like.... lives and stuff to go back to! Things we enjoyed! We don't have to be dumb bimbos just to be popular.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last remark was a mistake. Derek knew it instantly.

The balance of the world felt wobbly as his legs shifted about. The changes were climbing up him, slowly. He could feel his toes shifting as the heels transformed into combat boots. Legs lost a bit of care and shapeliness as fishnet pants formed along it. Her- <i>his</i> hips and butt were left relatively unchanged, but clearly diminished from the perfect hourglass they helped form before. And indeed, his chest soon followed, shrinking down quickly from their astounding size to a modest one. Clothes shifted from the bright, colorful skirt and top to shorts and a black top with a skull design. His pierced belly button and cleavage were still all for the world to see. Derek's only relief was the leather jacket that appeared on his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grabbed at his head as his hair shrunk from shoulder level to neck. It changed in hue from blonde to black to dyed purple like a lightshow. Piercings quickly appeared in his ear and nose. The thoughts of Jessica melted away into the darkness of the mind, bubbly delight giving way to darkness and cynicism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stumbled for a moment in the boots before the body caught himself for him. He could feel the new personality forming slowly. It was confused at first, but it was growing more defined and clear by the second. Instinctively, he felt himself search through the jacket to find a box of smokes. Quickly retrieving a cigarette, he light one up as his other hand went to his hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, who am I supposed to be now?\" The question came out more sarcastic than he expected, but with the anger at Bonnie's machinations so close and immediate, it felt natural to lean into the personality for now. \"No, wait, you'd have forgotten already, huh blondie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie stuck out her tongue childishly, still smug as could be. Still, Derek had a hard time taking her seriously at the moment. These boots gave her serious height over the princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big talk from the skank. How's it feel being, like, the new slut in town?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek felt like he should be horrified as memories of sleeping around with all sorts of students started filling his mind, but his outrage with Bonnie was letting the new personality take easier grip on his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Compared to the old slut?

Love the enthusiasm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie giggled maliciously. \"But <i>I'm</i> hot. I can get away with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure everyone's thoughts about you are very respectful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn right.\" Bonnie's good mood was vanishing, her glare increasing. \"I'm the queen of this school. You're, like, second-rate garbage in the alley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek- no that wasn't the name of this body, it was on the tip of his/her tongue- shrugged. \"Think what you want. I like sex, you like sex, we're all for boning down as much as we like. Just don't pretend you're better than me. You're just the silly, fruity, bitchy, self-absorbed Bonnie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took another drag from the cigarette and blew the smoke into Bonnie's face. As the gossip girl coughed, she let a little smirk crawl up her black lips. \"And I'm Ruby fucking Winters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie gave her a look of pure disgust. This was totally not how this was supposed to go! Ruby, like, didn't understand the social hierachy of this situation at all! She was the one who had the power!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More like... Slutty McSlut.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. You get 'em champ.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie huffed stomping her foot. \"Why am I even hanging out with a loser like you? I have <i>parties</i> to rock that <i>you</i> will never be invited to!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, you couldn't handle my parties.\" Ruby frowned, a bit of Derek coming out. \"Although, we technically haven't been to either of our parties....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Especially not you!\" She grinned again, seeing an upper hand in the conversation she didn't actually have. \"And while I'll be, like, the hottest shit in town, you'll be down in the muck being a giant losery loser.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh. Sure.\" Ruby tapped on her cigarette idly. \"Why don't you go off and get sucking at whatever guy you've got on a string tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie was about to quickly add some quick put-downs to really show it to Ruby, but reality was changing too quickly. Even if they remembered the people they used to be, at least partially, the world needed a reason for the two of them to be in the same room like this. And as the new memories rushed over them, the power dynamics would only shift further out of control.</span></div></div>",

The queen bee backed up right into the wall. Right where Ruby wanted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that really what you want to do?\" She brushed a hand down Bonnie's cheek, making the cheerleader shiver slightly. \"I could do that thing we tried last night again. You liked that, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie wasn't used to be the one lacking in confidence and was far too unprepared for the experience. \"I-It doesn't matter!

Of course he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica was leading him by the hand to the nearest bathroom, where she unzipped his pants and pulled out a half-hard cock like she'd done it a thousand times. Which was, like, totally silly. She might have gotten around a little, but there weren't even a thousand boys in the class, duh. Derek couldn't stop herself from taking the cock into her mouth, it looked so yummy and it tasted musky and salty and she couldn't stop enjoying it. The blowjob didn't last too long, it seemed like Mitch didn't have much in the way of stamina, but Derek couldn't care less.

Chesty, with a pretty face and long brown hair, but not enough to make her seem completely out of his league, and she had always carried herself humbly, like she wasn't above anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe geeky version of her was pretty different.

Her face was more plain, with freckles and large, thick glasses, and her hair was shorter and quite a bit messier.

She was blonde, though not quite as brightly so as Bonnie, and while she wasn't the prettiest cheerleader around, her freckled face and high energy made her the cutest girl in school to Derek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe greeted her friend, \"Hey Bonnie!\" with an accompanying hug, then turned to raise an eyebrow at Derek. \"And you're...Donald?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Derek, actually.\" They had five classes together, but he could understand why she didn't remember him. Derek...didn't stand out much. He extended a hand, the magical silver coin palmed inside, and concentrated on the change he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek had always had a fetish for anthropomorphic animals, but especially skunks. There was something raunchy about them, probably because of Pepe le Pew, but their ability to spray people, to douse them in disgusting liquid, aroused him.

Derek snapped out of his daze long enough to grab a pillow to cover his crotch, half to not upset his changed friend, and half to not stop the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of the two noticed the silver coin fall from her hands, rolling to a stop right underneath Derek's seat on the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie stopped her impromptu display and snapped her eyes straight to Derek, apprehension taking over her face. \"H-hey, you, like, remember me, right? Like, the guy me.\" Derek, unable to find words, simply gaped at her, fueling her fear. She chewed on her plump lip anxiously before a metaphorical lightbulb lit up her face. She turned quickly and bent over to dig through her backpack-turned-purse, unaware, somehow, that her skirt was stretching up, giving Derek a very good idea of what was under there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter tossing out several tubes of lip gloss and eyeliner \u2014 and throwing a strip of condoms as far away from her as she could \u2014 Bonnie emerged with a triumphant smile with her bounty: a bubblegum pink cell phone. Quickly unlocking it, she flipped the phone towards Derek, scrolling through a litany of pics. \"See, it's totally all those pics I sent you yesterday of Jen. Remember, she, like, fell over, an' her shirt flipped up, an' she totally wasn't wearing a bra, an' I got pictures of her boobies,\" she rattled on, a wistful smile on her face, unaware of what she was actually scrolling through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek's mouth got wider and wider as the images flashed by his face of Bonnie's <i>private</i> collection. Each one in a different place, each one with a different outfit, and each one carefully crafted to maximize teen boy boners. Derek took a second to burn into his memory each photo that he saw, and nodded in affirmation to the awaiting teenage wet dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBonnie gave a rapid round of applause to herself out of sheer joy, giggling, jumping up and down \u2014 before she realized how girly it was and abruptly stopped, her chest furiously jiggling for a whole two seconds afterwards. Trying to muster up all of the authority she could \u2014 that not being very much at all \u2014 Bonnie tried to set up a game plan. \"Alright, so we, like, gotta find that coin, cuz I'm totally almost sure that it made me into,\" \u2014 she gestured to her entire curvy silhouette \u2014 \"Like, this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm, like, pretty sure that the coin is still around here, cuz if it isn't\u2014\" Bonnie gave a brief shudder of terror, before continuing on her spiel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's totally gotta be around here somewhere, and you're gonna get your cute butt in gear and help me, or we're never gonna play...\" She squinted at the screen still flickering on Space Guys III defeat screen with abject confusion before resuming her pep talk. \"Or else we'll never play 'You Lose' together again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek took a second to collect himself before responding \u2014 the last five minutes have been a hell of a whirlwind for him, being both off-the-walls fucking crazy and something else that he didn't really want to think about. \"Yeah, d-dude, sure. But, could you stop the Laura impression? It's <i>scary</i> good, but it's a bit weird, you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek's statement was met with a long hug, and a 'You're totally the best!,' to his surprise.  But before Derek could even sputter, Bonnie let go of him as quickly as she embraced him, looking at her arms with a puzzled anger at their betrayal. She shook it off with a short shrug, heading to Derek's front door, much to his confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Bon\u2014 Jayden, why are we going outside? The coin mi\u2014\" He was interrupted by a peal of giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop being such a dummy, dummy! I remember my dadd\u2014 my dad took me to see...\" She stared vacantly off into space for a good ten seconds. \"To see this movie about some British guy who solved mysteries, and he always said that you totally gotta retrace your steps to solve a mystery!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd right before she went outside she said something really weird to Derek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, I know I look like her, but I'm totally acting normal, Der-Bear. Stop being such a goofball!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDerek couldn't help but feel some amount of dread in the pit of his stomach as he followed the ditz out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jayden held up the silver coin that had done this. \"Sorry Ms. Winters, but I don't agree.

Even her dirty blonde hair was nothing special, not like the girl from across the hall with a platinum blonde hairdo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t like Daisy was dissatisfied with who she was, not exactly, but sometimes she wondered what it was like to be other people, to feel life the way they did.

They were inscriptions on a pair of coins, one gold and the other silver, and the words on them spoke to exactly what she\u2019d been thinking.

Seeing no price tags, she brought them up to the register. \u201cHow much are these?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt looked as though this was the first time the lady running the shop had ever seen the coins, so she thought about it for a second before saying, \u201cTwenty dollars a piece.\u201d Unfortunately, Daisy was short on funds until her next financial aid disbursement, and with her long-term budgeting, she only had thirty dollars left of \u2018fun money\u2019.

Yeah, maybe if their teacher was some hot, forty-year old cougar, maybe then they'd look at him. The fantasy started invading his mind as he was lecturing. At this angle, they'd probably have their eyes on her ass, one that would fill out her beige skirt that was just short enough to give them the hope of seeing her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the fantasy played out in his mind, the reality began to change. His flat, boring butt filled out, his boxers becoming frilly panties, and his slacks turning into the exact skirt he'd imagined. As his legs were uncovered, they changed as well into the kind of thick, comely appendages he'd had in mind. Wordlessly, the entire class looked at their transforming teacher with curiosity and awe, unable to call his attention to his changes and possibly end the sequence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the teacher's fantasy continued. Oh, she would have such large breasts, shown off by an unbuttoned shirt and a cleavage-perfecting bra. Maybe she'd even occasionally drop a marker, acting like it was an accident, while knowing her lean down gave the entire class the perfect peek of her gorgeous mammaries. Sure enough, his shirt and jacket changed to fit the blouse he'd pictured, a bra appeared out of nowhere, and his entire figure shifted into a slightly plump build the perfectly supported a pair of ripe boobs. Her face was the last thing he pictured, just a hint of make-up to accentuate her natural beauty, with long brown hair that framed everything beautifully. Well, that and her trimmed pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so where once Thomas Morgendorfer once stood, now there was a female teacher in his place, one who suddenly realized the changes that had befallen him. Then his eyes turned to his students, who looked at their transformed teacher with rapturous eyes. One of them, a blushing young man in the front row, spoke up. \"We...we won't tell anyone if you don't, Mr., I mean, Ms. Morgendorfer.\" Suddenly, Thomas began to feel something odd...pride. The way they were looking at him, like he was the most attractive woman in the world, like they would do anything he said, it was intoxicating, it was so pleasurable!</span></div></div>",

Wanna join us?\" The questions sounded entirely sincere, and despite Daisy actively searching for some trace of cynicism or hidden social attack, she saw none. Of course, that made sense. Amanda may have been more focused on joining the right sisterhood than actually doing well in her classes, but she'd never struck Daisy as a rude person. In fact, reflecting on what experiences she had shared with the girl, Daisy was forced to admit, if only to herself, that Amanda was a very nice person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaisy's mind went into overdrive to fine some excuse to avoid this social interaction, but she couldn't find any. She was well ahead of all her assignments and readings, and it wasn't as if she had any prior engagements. Sure, she could just lie, but Daisy wasn't a fan of dishonesty, it made her uncomfortable. With no other avenues to freedom, she let out a sigh and said, \"Sure, sounds like fun,\" despite the fact the tone of her voice showed no expectation of enjoyment whatsoever. Then again, as much as she wasn't a fan of drinking or partying, some social interaction wouldn't kill her and it might be fun to get to know Amanda and Jericho better, both of whom looked quite happy that they'd have company as they got up and began leading Daisy out of the building. Once they were on the sidewalk and headed towards downtown, Daisy realized she didn't know where they were actually going. \"So, what bar are we heading to?\"</span></div></div>",

She'd never heard of the place before, but then again considering she never really went to out that wasn't much of a surprise. As they entered, Daisy was scared she would find the interior would match her expectations, that it would be like the only other bar she'd ever entered: dark, loud, and too small. It turned out her fears were unjustified, however. The Sweet Sister was brightly lit, full of booths that allowed for a nice amount of privacy, and while there was a flat screen near the bar, the volume was turned down enough to only be audible to those sitting nearby it. Despite herself, Daisy found herself smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was, up until she realized who Amanda was walking up to see. The bar was nowhere near full, but most of the patrons were around their age, sitting in booths near each other, all of them young women with great make-up and beautiful figures. Feeling a little uneasy, she and Jericho followed as Amanda came up to a girl sitting at one of the fringe booths. Throwing the girl sitting there, who had long brown hair and lightly tanned skin, a winning smile, Amanda introduced her companions. \"Hey, Rae! These are my friends, Daisy and Jericho!\" Turning back to face Daisy, she explained. \"This is Rae, she's a friend from high school who's in the Theta Gamme Beta's. Would you be up for hanging out with them?\"</span></div></div>",

Still, they found themselves talking and they actually had a lot in common. They were both smart people, they took a lot of the same subjects, it was pretty cool. Then, he let out a long-suffering sigh. \"What's wrong?\" Daisy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just kind of lonely,\" he admitted. \"I love Amanda, don't get me wrong, but I don't have any guy friends really, so there's so much I feel like I can't tell her.

Her build became a little wider, she lost the little breasts that she had, her hips narrowed, and the her genitals reconfigured themselves. A little change to her throat, adding an Adam's apple, altering her voice only slightly, and Daisy was now technically male, at least in sex.

He gave her a bit of a weird look when she came back, to be sure, but that was probably because she'd been in the bathroom too long. \"Anyway,\" he said hesitantly and Daisy got back into her seat. \"The other day, it felt like she was mad at me because I couldn't read her mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat absolutely sounded like the kind of foes someone would face in dating Amanda, and Daisy always hated it when people just assumed the other person knew what they were thinking.

It was then that Daisy remembered that Amanda was a science major, and she was clearly ready to apply the scientific method to this magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two ate, Daisy watched from the outside as what happened to her happened to the two sitting across from her. Both grew taller, larger, stronger, fatter, and generally bearier as they ate, until their burgers were gone and they were both anthropomorphic bear. Amanda was shorter than Daisy was, as well as chubbier with bigger furry boobs, while Jericho was taller than either of them, with powerful muscles. In fact, something about him awoke a different kind of hunger in Daisy. It felt wrong, after all the guy was Amanda's boyfriend, and currently a bear, but he was sexy as hell anyway.

Daisy was more hesitant. Every instinct in her body was screaming at her to go with them and fuck like she'd never fucked before, but rationally she knew this was something she'd never agree to. \"Daisy, you're going to come too.\" It was a statement. An order. Not a question. And Daisy obeyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three anthropomorphic bear people walked back to the dorm without any issues, no one seeming to notice that they were bear people at all, or if they did, that is was noteworthy. Daisy had a hard time thinking about that though, as the number one thing on her mind was how soaked her panties, and the brown fur inside them, was getting. Once they got to Jericho's room (it was the closest, after all), they started stripping as soon as the door closed. Daisy had never been into hairy guys, or larger guys, but seeing Jericho, fur, belly, and all, she thought he was the sexiest man in the world, and Amanda clearly agreed. They took turns sucking his bear cock, riding him, being plowed from behind while growling in animalistic lust, it was all amazing. </span></div></div>",

Like, that was mind-blowingly good, but are we just going to keep being bears?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell yes we are,\" Jericho told them, once again stating his wishes in a way that didn't brook argument. \"I've never felt this alive. Fuck being in a frat, the three of us, together, as bears? It's amazing as is, and if we get bored, we can add more bears to the pack with the coin.\" Daisy wanted to agree with him. Hearing Jericho being so in-charge really revved her engines, and he had a point, this had been pretty great so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut someone else disagreed. \"I have a better idea,\" Amanda said, her muzzle pulled up into a grin. \"We should play around with the coin more, see what we can do with it, how it works. I mean, we got turned into bears because the burger we ate had a beat themed name. Whatever magic is behind this either has a mind of its own, or it taps into how we think or something.

What were some things that really only meant things to her? Well, she thought, most people probably associated carrots with rabbits. But her mom, for some reason, had told her carrots made people fat, something that had stuck with her all these years. That would definitely prove whether the coin could read her mind or not. In a different direction, she could try making her own personal onomatopoeia sound for a dog bark, which apparently sounded nothing like one. If that turned her into a dog person, it would prove the same thing. So, would she rather risk gaining weight or becoming an anthro dog?</span></div></div>",

It really was pretty good advice, if not incredibly manipulative. \"Oh, by the way, that little bauble in your 'secret compartment' was a nice touch. If you do a good job here, I might even let you keep it!~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Typical for a harpy...</i> Ranma fumed to himself.

Acting like some witless tart would probably get more guys to sign up, and it probably wouldn't be so damaging to his ego. Just gotta slip into the role, and who knows? Maybe Nabiki would condescendingly pat him on the head and let him go with only 150 rubes signed on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma took a moment to shake out the nerves \u2014 making sure to not let anything in his suit slip out \u2014 before greeting one of the first guys with a loud \"<span class=\"cppink\">YOO-HOO~!</span>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBounding over to the sod, his attention firmly grasped, he made sure to add a little bounce to his step, watching the stranger's eyes going up and down. \"<span class=\"cppink\">Hey, mister, d'ya wanna go to our dojo? I <i>promise</i> that you'll love it!</span>\" Watching the man wordlessly nod and reach out for a flyer, he purposely fumbled the paper with an '<span class=\"cppink\">Oopsie!</span>' and bent over in front of the man, giving him a good view of the pale white globes down the corset. As Ranma grasped the paper, he felt a warm glow in between his breasts. Suddenly, his nails gained a pink coating to his surprise. <i>Did I always have my nails painted as a girl?<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"> I don't think so</span><span class=\"cppink\">I guess Nabiki put some on when I wasn't looking!</span></i> Holding the slightly dirty flyer out to the guy, it was accepted with a dazed 'Thanks' and a doofy smile. Ranma giggled in spite of himself at the guy's reaction, quickly thinking; <i><span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"><span class=\"cppink\">He's so silly~</span></span>Just a small laugh at a job well done, because <b>I AM NOT A GIRL.</b></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma continued his act for a few more hours, trying out variants and techniques to lure more <span class=\"cppink\"><span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">cute boys</span></span> unsuspecting jerks in. Sometimes he pulled the flyer from in between his <span class=\"cppink\"><span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">boobies</span></span> breasts and gave it to the schmuck, other times he bent over  to pick up the flyers he had dropped behind him at the hip, wiggling his ample butt in front of a gaping crowd, and countless other faux-flirty techniques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne he was particularly proud of was completely ad-libbed. He had accidentally crashed into a guy while lost in thought (A feeling that would become more familiar to Ranma over the following days). Ranma had a sudden idea mid-fall and shifted his weight to fall directly on the man. They landed exactly as he planned, where Ranma 'accidentally' had his boobs practically squashed against the guy. Then, when they both got up, he apologized with a \"<span class=\"cppink\">I'm, like, <i>soooooo</i> sorry, mister!</span>\" and offered him a flyer. But what Ranma did was a true testament to his adaptability, if he did say so himself. Before he gave the man the flyer, he laid a juicy kiss on the flyer, leaving a bright pink lip print. Doubt barely even crossed his mind before he thought \"<span class=\"cppink\">Wow, Nabiki is totally a superduper makeup ninja! <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">Ohmigawd I should ask her for advice</span></span>\" He shook his head to clear it on the tail end of that thought, he'd been having some weird feelings lately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That guy I crashed into looked familiar though, I didn't really catch his face though, cuz of all the blood coming from his nose. <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">What a disgusting pervert</span> <span class=\"cppink\">Oh no! I musta hurt him when we fell, I need to, like, go help him!</span> But before he could take action, he felt a hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Nabiki, with a sleazy grin on her face. \"Well, well, well. You're a natural at this, Ranma. I guess I don't even have to take your little charm there, because you did an excellent job!\" To her mild surprise, instead of giving some sort of snippy retort, Ranma just grinned and bonked his fist against his head, not betraying a single kernel of anger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<span class=\"cppink\">Thanks, Nabi, this was a lotta fun! I'm gonna go back now, cuz I'm mega-tired! Byeeee~!</span> Ranma gushed, before running off in one of the girliest ways Nabiki had seen, drawing the eyes of guys for streets to come. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabiki first thought, '<i>Ranma's acting weird. But what was <b>really </b>strange was when I felt his shoulder it's like it had no muscle-tone in it, which is exceedingly odd for a training freak like him.</i>' Shortly thereafter she dismissed it with a shrug. <i>Even someone like <b>moi</b> can make mistakes, and this is probably some sort of scheme to get out of this, which means more blackmail pictures for me if he welches!</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was odd that he didn't even ask about the hot water though...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Nabiki had Ranma</span></div></div>",

Things in his head just seemed... slower, more languid. Interrupting his thoughts, however, was a familiar weight on his chest. '<i>Huh,</i>' he thought to himself. 'I know Nabiki didn't <span class=\"cppink\"><span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">, like,</span></span> give me any hot water, but I <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"><span class=\"cppink\">totally</span></span> could have boiled my own bucket.

'<i>Things have been weird ever since \u2014</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis languid train of thought was interrupted by a sudden thump on his door. He shuffled over to it, yawning cutely as he opened it to be met with a familiar face. It was Nabiki, ice water glass in hand and a smug smirk plastered on her face. But even this was interrupted as she looked over Ranma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ranm \u2014 what are...\" She took a second to regain her composure. \"I see you're prepared for Phase B. Though, I do have to ask. Why are you wearing Akane's pajamas?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma looked down at his body. He was clad in bunny print PJs, the size a little too small for him, especially in the chest and rear. The resulting effect was that of some kind of slutty Halloween costume, the top unbuttoned midways down, and the pants being so tight they appeared painted on. Ranma gaped at this odd ensemble he was wearing and quickly tried to mumble out a response. \"<span class=\"cppink\"><font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">I saw it, and it looked so, like, cute and perf for me.</font></span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Nabiki asked, a genuine look of concern on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>What <b>was</b> that?</i>' he puzzled to himself before acridly snapping back with \"I <i>said</i>, I needed to make sure I didn't ruin my usual sleepwear with whatever you were prob'ly gonna dump on me!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabiki snickered to herself. \"Yeah, fair enough. You might wanna cover up in the future - you know we're lousy with perverts, and most of 'em don't care you're a guy.\" She poked him in the ample chest to emphasize her point. To her surprise, the martial artist covered his chest and giggled shyly. '<i>What is <b>up</b> with him?</i>' The same thoughts were going through Ranma's head, but they weren't quite <i>connecting</i> with anything. Things were just slower for him as of late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking off the confusion, Nabiki resumed her smug smile, with a touch of concern. \"Anyways, like I was saying, Phase B. You're gonna train with those shmucks from yesterday! Keep em coming back for something.\" She added a saucy wink to the last part, trying to bait Ranma to do <i>something</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her (slight) relief, Ranma's \"Okay.\" was coupled with a pout. <i>Normally he'd bitch for five more minutes, though. And are his lips pinker than before?</i>' Her greedy side quickly drowned that thought out, though, when she saw Ranma putting on his typical gi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no no no. We're gonna... <b><i>spice this up a bit.</i></b>\" she grinned, pulling the martial artist to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\"><span class=\"cppink\">Ooh, makeover!</span></font>\" a small voice cried in the back of Ranma's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~Later~~<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma picked at his clothes, partially weirded out, and some other emotion he couldn't place. Nabiki had given him a bright pink sports bra one size too small, and a pair of yoga pants. He put them on without much protest - for some reason. His body just felt a whole lot <i>softer</i>. His female form may have always been weaker, but now it just felt like all of its tone was gone. '<span class=\"cppink\">At least my butt is still nice 'n tight!</span>' flitted through his head, too fast for him to notice. His musing was predictably interrupted by Nabiki, clad in training gear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go, dummy.\" She flipped him a familiar gold disc.\"A little good luck charm, for being such a good bunny yesterday.\" The insult slid right off of Ranma, his pleasure at getting the coin overwhelming any other feeling \u2014 not that he noticed the insult. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not that the coin made him feel more confident, it's just that it felt <i>right</i> to hold. He slipped the coin right into his sports bra. '<i>At least it'll be safe there. <span class=\"cppink\">It's like a boobie sandwich!</span></i>' Ranma doubled over in laughter, at his joke, until Nabiki's sharp voice snapped him out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're getting customers, so look alive, bright-eyes!\" Ranma snapped to attention, sending some parts of him jiggling. and prepared himself for an impromptu lesson in Tendou Martial arts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the lesson...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It looks like all it took to be a good Sensei was to treat your students like dirt and make them do the same punches fifty times, and then make up some shit about grappling and call it a day. Right now her little income sour\u2014 er, <i>students</i>, were practicing sparring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Nabiki had to admit, Ranma sure was carrying his weight in the scheme. At least three-quarters of her students were lining up to spar with the busty redhead. Nabiki hid a snort. Using 'Ranni' as a pseudonym should've given it away in three seconds \u2014 it's too bad the guys were too distracted by the bouncy bits to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, Ranma was playing his part perfectly. During the sets, the water bottle he was drinking from had it's cap fall off 'accidentally' and soak his top through. He even took a few seconds to 'connect the dots' before giggling at the '<span class=\"cppink\">Silly mistake!</span>'. He even wrung out the bra while still wearing it, showing the bottom of those creamy globes to the agape class. It was weird though, she could have sworn that he was taller as a girl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sparring matches were what really got the guys' goat. 'Ranni' geared up to fight her opponents in a comically ineffective boxer's pose, bouncing on the balls of her feet, causing the guys to focus on other moving parts than her fist. But it's not like Ranma pulled his usual tricks and punched them out \u2014 he'd just punch them softly three times in the chest, and they'd put up their hands in mock surrender. Then, he'd hug them while jumping up and down, looking pleased as punch at the victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabiki'd swear that this wasn't an act, but for one of the fights. One of the sleazeballs didn't wanna play along with 'Ranni's girly punches and tried to grapple her. <i>'Probably trying to cop a feel directly, the dirty perv'</i> Nabiki thought to herself. But something familiar flashed in Ranma's eyes, and before anyone could blink, the guy was on the floor out cold. Ranma kept the steely look on his face before the same vapid visage flashed on, and he flitted about the dojo in a panic because  '<span class=\"cppink\">Like, one of my friends got hurt!</span>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabiki was a bit worried when he went out to run after, because '<i>He doesn't usually does that,</i>' but shrugged it off, as per usual. Ranma probably knew what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~Meanwhile, from Ranma's Point of View~~~<br>\r\n</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething just seemed wrong about what was going on. Everyone was looking at him funny just cuz of one accident. <i>'<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">What a bunch of sickos.</span><span class=\"cppink\"> It's just water, silly billies! No need to worry bout lil' old me!</span></i>' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even though he was doing it as a girl, Ranma was glad that he agreed to do this training session. This morning, everything seemed confusing and wrong, but now that he was <span class=\"cppink\">like,</span> training again, everything seemed <span class=\"cppink\">totally</span> okay again. And that was the most fights he'd ever won in a row! Everything seemed to be going his way! He giggled and absentmindedly patted his chest. <i>'<span class=\"cppink\">Like,</span> thanks, good luck charm.'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was out running after the training session. It just seemed <i>right</i> to do, and thinking about what to do was harder now for some reason. Slogging through all those boring thoughts was hard, as well as kinda creepy. There was one thought in the back of his head saying '<i>This is wrong. You should have beat them all in ten seconds, flat. Why am I doing this?</i>' It was kinda scary to listen to, so he just defaulted to the happy pink voice at the forefront of his mind. '<span class=\"cppink\"><i>We gotta run to keep our figure! <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">For all the boys.</font></i></span>' It said some weird stuff sometimes, but it felt natural to let the pink think. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma giggled at the unintentional rhyme before his run was suddenly interrupted by ___.</span></div></div>",

Sure, Nabiki was an actual girl, but out of the two of them, Ranma had done way more flirtin' with guys and he wasn't exactly going to change his MO because Nabiki though that playin' dumb would work better. Besides, Ranma was kinda sensitive about his intelligence, and acting dumb on purpose wasn't something he would ever be caught doing. After stretching for a second and reaching down to adjust the cups of the costume, making his boobs spill out a little more to really give the guys what they wanted, Ranma walked up to the first guy who walked by, who looked like a salaryman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanma ran up to the guy in a suit, making sure to put enough effort into his steps that his boobs were jiggling like crazy, then stopped closer than was normally appropriate and gave him a winning smile. \"Excuse me, sir, but I'd really like it if you could join me? Our martial arts dojo is a great place to stay fit, and I'd love your company\u2661\" To properly accentuate that last word, Ranma even fluttered his eyelashes as he held out a flyer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy blushed, and looked between Ranma, his breasts, and the flyer. \"I...uh...\" he stammered, and Ranma knew he'd caught the guy: hook, line, and sinker. Take that, Nabiki, who's the master of seduction now?! \"I've got to get to work, bye!\" With that, the salaryman ran away, without taking the flyer still in Ranma's hands. He stared at it, confused. How did that not work? Was Nabiki right? No, no that couldn't be it. Maybe he just needed to slut it up more, that had to be it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing another rube walking down the street, Ranma sashayed up to him, ready to do whatever it took to get him to take a flyer. But the coin nestled between his boobs hadn't let his earlier thought go, and as he walked his breasts grew a little larger, a little bouncier, and his already beautifully feminine face found itself covered in make-up that drew men's eyes and made them wonder what she was willing to offer. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Hello there, I'm a part of the Anything Goes Martial Arts Dojo, and I'd <i>love</i> it if you could join. I'll be there every day~</span>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis particular sucker looked like a university student out on a walk, and he was much less shy about Ranma's flirting. \"Oh really,\" he said with a not very charming smile, \"what exactly would we be doing, at this dojo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, Ranma would just insinuate something vague and sexy, but that had't really worked on the last guy, now had it? <span class=\"cgrape\">No, he was going to need to be specific.</span> Leaning forward, Ranma whispered into his ear, \"<span class=\"cgrape\">Well, we'd train of course, but that does have a tendency to get me all hot and bothered. Maybe when no one's looking, you and I can sneak out and relieve some tension in a different way, if that's okay with you, cutie.</span>\" It was only after the words left his mouth that Ranma realized that he'd basically just promised this guy sex. He was a guy, he wasn't going to do that! Then again, it wasn't like he had to deliver on the promise, <span class=\"cgrape\">and if he did, who would ever find out?</span> To no one's surprise, the guy took the flyer and winked at Ranma, and he was even reading it while walking down the street. Alright, one down, one hundred and ninety-nine to go!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the sun was setting, Ranma had actually managed to hit that golden number Nabiki had asked for, and along the way he'd promised a number of sexual favors to them. Nabiki was glad, confused a little, but genuinely happy, and reminded Ranma of the fact that what had just happened was only step one. Tomorrow, he'd have to actually teach these yahoos and make the dojo, and by extension Nabiki, money while doing it.</span></div></div>",

When <i>did</i> he put that make-up on? And why had he promised all those guys actual sex? Looking back on his day, Ranma realized how different he'd been acting, and how he'd been thinking. Just as he was straining to think of what caused this, he saw the light glint off the gold on the coin still trapped between his boobs. The coin! Hadn't it said 'Become What You Seek'? Was this stupid thing <i>another</i> magical artifact that was going to mess with his life? Ranma growled, then tried telling it in as many different ways as he could think of to turn him back to normal, but nothing worked. Embarrassed to tell anyone else what he'd done to himself, Ranma just sneaked into bed and hid, eventually falling asleep. <span class=\"cgrape\">That night, his subconscious gave him dream after dream of all the fun he could have, as a slut.</span></span></div></div>",

You had plenty of time to splash some hot water, grow your dick again and everything.\" Then she caught a glint of light in Ranma's cleavage, reached down, and looked for a second time at the gold coin Ranma had been carrying in there. \"'Become What You Seek'...what's that about?\" Then, she suddenly looked more closely at Ranma's face, as if seeing something new for the first time. \"Wait a second, you look different...spill the beans, or I tell my father about how much money you owe me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling half-awake and suddenly trapped, Ranma couldn't stop himself from sputtering out, \"<span class=\"cgrape\">I-It's magic or somethin', changes you based on how you act, I think.

Looking down at his body, <span class=\"cgrape\">Ranma wondered why he was so scared of the coin, of the changes. His female body had always been more pleasurable, and he'd always taken a perverse please in teasing guys. Why not do more than tease, it would feel good.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNabiki smirked as she watched Ranma's inner turmoil, than tossed him the same bunny-girl costume he'd worn the day before and told him, \"Your first class is going to be here soon, you better make yourself presentable.\"</span></div></div>",

Ranma tried to ignore the looks they were giving him, or how he found himself staring at them, but then someone put a hand on his arm. Turning to face them, Ranma saw it was the first person to take a flyer from him. \"So, you said something about one-on-one training, to relieve tension?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy to see the guy was even cuter than Ranma remembered, he grabbed him by the arm and took him outside, behind the dojo. \"<span class=\"cgrape\">I plan on delivering on that, don't you worry. How do you want it?</span>\" To Ranma's surprise, he pointed to the soft behind, recently engorged by the coin, and as the man took out his large, rock-hard cock, <span class=\"cgrape\">Ranma disrobed enough that he could rub the man's cock with the cheeks, giving him a sensual hotdogging. The sensation almost made Ranma lose his mind, and when the man came all over his back, Ranma happily scooped it up and licked it off his fingers, loving the taste.</span> That was one happy customer down, but there were so many more to go.</span></div></div>",

His posters of All Might were still up, but the rest of his favorite hero's merchandise was gone. Instead, the room had an orange pallet to it, a large wardrobe replacing his dresser, and his bed's sheets looked more frilly and soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering how this happened, Deku went to look back at the coin, only to see two large, soft breasts in the way, the cleavage shown through a low cut orange top. Deku's eyes went wide and he looked down at himself in more detail to see the body of a curvaceous teenage girl, one who's body rivaled the best of his classmate's. <i>Naw, screw that! My body is way hotter than those losers!</i> Suddenly, Deku knew what had happened: he was an entirely different person now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpecifically, he now had the memories of Izuki Bakugo, fraternal twin sister to his old friend. She had his fiery temper and a similar explosive quirk, though hers was less powerful with the benefit of more control over the explosions. She'd always been top bitch in every school, living high off her power and looks, but deep inside she'd always wanted to be a true hero, like her idol All Might. One day, after meeting him in the flesh for the first time, she risked her life fighting a villain and saving her brother, which earned the respect of All Might and led to her becoming his pupil, and the new holder of One for All.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeku's head was spinning, and he wasn't...she wasn't?...sure what was going on. He has two sets of memories, and he knew which ones came first and which ones were new, but it wasn't like he could discount his new reality. He really was Bakugo's hot as fuck sister now, and that seemed to be the truth of it.</span></div></div>",

Unable to look her in the eye, Iida stammered, \"Y-you shouldn't go shouting things like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout thinking, Izuki's face immediately stretched into a sultry grin, and she came closer, pressing her breasts against his chest. \"What are you going to do, Mr. Class President?

She had been talking about <i>important</i> things with Kyon, like what they were going to do after school. Aliens and creatures and mysteries to investigate. And the instructor got upset for no reason! Class hadn't even started yet and he was lecturing her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think it's ample time for you to mature, Suzumiya?\" He had raised a condescending eyebrow, just to complete the entire awful look. \"As a growing woman, you should learn to behave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyon did his best to avoid looking too sympathetic to the teacher's points, but Haruhi still caught the smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are my years to be free, aren't they?\" She glared right back. \"I can do whatever the hell I want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph,\" the teacher hmped. \"Hopefully, you'll learn to be less boorish and more... refined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he left her fuming, with no opportunity to retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew what he really wanted. He wanted her to be \"ladylike\" and \"polite\" and giggle about clothes in magazines. He never scolded boys like Taniguichi for his pervy remarks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe huffed as she continued her march down to the club room. Well, being \"boorish\" was fine with her. She had never understood the nonsense around gender roles that people touted. As far as she was concerned, boys were primarily people who bugged her with confessions and date offers before she knew anything about them. But they also got away with a lot more than she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, if people were gonna to call her a rude punk, she'd be happy to be a rude punk! Why did she have to get so much hassle just because of the way she was born?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coin glowed in the pocket of her skirt as she stepped before the entrance of the SOS Brigade room. Her height increased, eyes reaching the nameplate on the door more easily. She stretched a little, feeling her arms toughen into stronger muscles as she did so. Her chest added to the strength, as abs formed easily from the more feminine chest that it once was. She adjusted her hairband, failing to notice how much shorter and more manageable the hair was quickly become. Nor did she notice her tougher chin and traces of a shave. All she really noticed was that her clothes felt tighter somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer grip on the doorknob was stronger than before as she strolled into the club room, swagger more confident than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whaddya doing lazing around for?\" bellowed the deep voice of the handsome, athletic man before them. \"We've got strange sights to investigate!\"</span></div></div>",

The perpetual smile of Koizumi slipped into an open mouth with narrowed eyebrows. Even Nagato managed a blink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe handsome teen known as Haruki Suzumiya strolled past them easily, clapping his hands together. His male uniform fit him well, outlining his build naturally. \"C'mon- you call yourselves a Brigade? We got work to do!\" It was her same boundless energy with somehow even more aggression pushed into it. Her usual confidence almost seemed threatening with testosterone layered underneath it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikuru, of all people, was the first to breech the subject. \"Su-Suzumiya...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned swiftly to leer at her, with a wink. \"The one and only. You miss me?\" His tongue was practically waggling out of his mouth. Mikuru eeped, covering herself reflexively. Suzumiya could only cackle in his usual amusement. \"Come on! You call yourselves men? Let's get going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Commander...\" Koizumi finally managed. \"Not to question your incredible judgment, but is there anything else of importance you might be forgetting?\" It wasn't quick the natural level of subtle Koizumi could usually accomplish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruki frowned, looking at himself for the first time. He did feel... different. Something had changed. Something important. He rubbed his chin, feeling the traces of facial hair against his palm. Had he forgotten to shave? He could've sworn his cheeks were usually softer than this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Hadn't he been wearing a skirt earlier?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he quickly shook the thought of his mind. That would be far too strange. Wouldn't it? Maybe? He felt his confidence wavering and he didn't like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope! Hurry up- last one to the front of the school has to pay for bus fare!\" And he raced out the room quickly, away from the threats to his new existence. He somehow managed another leer at Mikuru's chest as he did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyon turned immediately to his most trusted adviser. \"Yuki, what the hell's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe resident alien interface close her book slowly. \"At 3:16 PM, the Integrated Data Thought Entity observed an energy spike from Haruhi Suzumiya. Unlike many of the energy spikes, it appears to have remained around Haruhi Suzumiya herself rather than force itself upon the world. There als-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoizumi was already checking his phone. \"Its only 3:18. She must have only just now changed. And I'm not sensing any new Closed Spaces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what, that really is Haruhi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it would seem...\" The philosopher turned to Mikuru. \"I don't suppose you've gotten any messages from your own organization.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikuru fiddled with her skirt anxiously. \"Nothing yet. I don't think they consider it important...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoizumi stroked his chin. \"I always wondered if the future even cared about gender. If they've passed the Singularity where you're from, gender might be considered rather trivial.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's classified.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on.\" Kyon quickly lifted up his hands. \"We're getting off-topic. Why on <i>Earth</i> did Haruhi do... <i>that?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who can say? Every day, we are inundated with reminders of our gender. We've invented roles and stereotypes and social structures around them. Perhaps Suzumiya grew jealous of the benefits of the male life. Or perhaps she simply grew tired of a female body. Or perhaps, she's abandoned both. Maybe this body, as masculine as it appears, is the closest to a genderless specimen she could achi-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh brother</i> grumbled Kyon internally. <i>The last thing we need is another lecture from the wannabe philosopher.</i> He refocused his attention on Yuki. \"I don't suppose you know what she's thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNagato considered the request carefully. It seemed Kyon and the others had little interest in learning of another data spike surrounding Haruhi's acquisition of a small gold coin. She filed away the information for later, just in case. \"Haruhi Suzumiya is currently experiencing an influx in testosterone, among other biological changes. A few synapses in her brain have altered, particularly in areas featuring names and similar memetic information. She, or rather he, likely considers himself completely male and used to the social expectations that title offers on Earth. Haruhi Suzumiya is now Haruki Suzumiya\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKoizumi nodded slowly. \"Then there we have it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, we may have it, but what are we supposed to do with it? We can't let her- him go around like that. Its not like anyone else knows... 'Haruki.'\" Kyon made sure to shove airquotes around the name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But pushing the matter may shock Suzumiya and lead to far more drastic changes.\" The esper shrugged pleasantly. \"I say we indulge our new Commander and await an inevitable return to her normal self.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if he doesn't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No use pressing our chances too early, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyon groaned. The philosopher always wanted to play things safe. He was getting sick of it. But maybe he had a point. What else could they do, with someone as powerful as Haruhi- Haruki going this off-course?</span></div></div>",

He had to remember that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the club quickly rejoined Haruki outside the school. Kyon was last, of course, and once again the onus of payment during Haruki's new hunt fell on his shoulders. In many ways, Haruki's excursions were about the same as Haruhi's. He demanded attention and wouldn't take no for an answer. Everyone had to acquiesce to his commands. It was still hard to deny him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, there were differences. Haruhi had little interest in romance or attraction or anything. Her goal was always adventure. Haruki? Haruki was....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruki was a normal, horny teenage boy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis libido was clearly maxed up to the highest rankings. Kyon felt himself getting riled up as Haruki sneaked glances at Mikuru and Yuki. He'd nudge Kyon whenever a particularly stunning looking girl walked by. He made little whistles and cracks that Haruhi never indulged in before. It was like talking with Taniguchi, only if Taniguchi had some muscle and charm on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruki clicked open a soda can, watching as the other Brigade members searched around the park. \"God, have you ever seen anyone as hot as Asahina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyon grumbled noncommittally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be like that. I've seen you looking too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't prove anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruki grinned a smug ass grin. \"Yuki ain't too bad either. Not my type, but cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyon couldn't argue with him there, no matter how much he wanted to. He sipped from his own can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gonna make a move?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe choked immediately. \"I- what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruki cackled, slapping him on the back with strong, painful hands. \"Don't tell me you haven't noticed? She's <i>always </i>all over you. Asahina will do anything I say, but Nagato? She only really listens to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dammit. When he says it like that, it would sound like she's into me. Why does Haruhi always have to be observant about the worst things?</i> \"I'm pretty sure she'd sooner date one of her books.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strapping lad snorted. \"Point, point.\" He took another sip, eyeing the brigade members again. \"It... kinda feels like we're missing something though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyon eyed the leader carefully, doing his best to maintain a neutral face. \"Oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Like... like another girl.\" Haruki nodded slowly. \"Yeah. Our club needs... three girls. Not two. I mean, the shy klutz and serious bookworm are perfect for any club. But we need someone else to fill it out right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis might be his chance. If he could influence Haruki the right way, he might turn back into Haruhi. He couldn't believe he was thinking it, but he'd much rather the powers of the universe be in her hands than in the hands of a typical boorish teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you can find another somewhere. Just gotta look close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruki nodded even slower. He was rubbing something in his pocket, feeling the grooves of a little coin in his hand. \"Yeah... Look close....\"</span></div></div>",

Feeling bored with nothing much to do, she surfed the web a little on the club room computer. Then, she saw it: some site about 'monster girls'. It was definitely some kind of fetish thing for online weirdos, but Haruhi was intrigued nonetheless. She went to the site and saw tons of different designs, but the one that stuck out the most was a blue-skinned succubus. The art was really well drawn, and there was just something cool about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaruhi's eyes drifted over to the make-up kit she kept in the club room, and spent the next half hour making her face the exact shade of blue as the drawing, while at the same time trying to replicate the sexy seductress make-up job the monster had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she worked on that, without her noticing, the blue from the make-up began spreading into her skin, from her face down to the rest if her body. Haruhi's already well-sized breasts jumped up in cup sizes until they were at least as large as Mikuru's, and her shapely butt expanded until it was fully heart-shaped. Just above said butt a tail ending with a spade grew out, and her fingernails became longer and sharper, dangerous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when she'd finished with her face, marvelling at how well it had come together, that she noticed the blue skin on her hands. At first she thought she'd gotten the make-up on her hands by accident, but then she looked closer, then down at the rest of her body, and saw she'd truly become a succubus.</span></div></div>",

But even a rational person would find themselves jumping to impossible explanations after transforming into a monster, and something from the website that started all of this jumped out to Haruhi. \"Wasn't there something about a Monster Girl Virus...wow!\" she shouted, smiling like the sun once more. \"I was feeling kind of sick this morning, wasn't I?\" In fact, she'd only sneezed once, while starting at the sun on her walk to school, but her memory tricked itself, fabricating a morning of aches and a mild fever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opened quietly, and Mikuru entered timidly, clearly unaware her erstwhile tormenter was already in the room. Then she noticed the succubus in a sailor uniform standing in front of the mirror and froze. \"M-Ms. Suzumiya?\" The time-traveler was baffled. What had the focal point of a massive time-quake done now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a reason even Haruhi couldn't understand, she found herself staring into Mikuru's eyes and walking towards her. The upperclassman couldn't move, like a deer frozen in headlights, and Haruhi smiled as she reached her, then leaned in for a kiss. Internally, Haruhi was confused. Not exactly upset, just confused. She was pansexual, so Mikuru's gender wasn't an issue, but while her body had always been sexy as hell, her personality had never been actually worth the trouble of getting involved, at least to Haruhi. Not that any of that interefered with the kiss, which Haruhi was quite enjoying, and by the way Mikuru was blushing, her mouth agape as Haruhi pulled away, she wasn't the only one. Then, she remembered: she had the Virus! Of course, no such virus existed, but Haruhi believed it did, and so it suddenly did...and Mikuru had caught it.</span></div></div>",

As that was happening, her skirt and panties started feeling tight, until finally her ass burst out of her clothes as it grew out behind her. Mikuru let out a squeak of fear and covered her eyes, unable to watch it any more. Haruhi, however, had no such issue, and watched the transformation with awe. The transformation was quick, taking only a few minutes, but when it was done Mikuru looked entirely normally from the waist up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, just where her torso would normally meet her hips, her body transitioned into that of a horse. Mikuru's horse body had a soft brown coat, and the addition of it added several feet in height to her. Her horse legs were strong and muscular, and Haruhi walked over to her behind, where a tail was swishing around, so admire her horse ass and horse pussy. Apparently not content to just stare, she reached out a blue finger and stuck in inside Mikuru's pussy, admiring its size. \"M-Miss Suzumiya!\" Mikuru cried. \"Please don't t-touch me there!\" Tears started falling down Mikuru's face as the truth hit her. \"I can't believe I caught the Monster Girl Virus...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Haruhi has 'seen proof' of the realness of the Monster Girl Virus, reality altered even further. It was now a known, recent condition, and a small portion of the population were now monster girls. No one knew where it came from, and despite their best efforts, no one had been able to reverse the transformation. Haruhi did not know any of that, having just assumed it was real herself, but this explained both Mikuru's reaction...and that of another member of the SOS Brigade who entered at that exact moment to the bizarre scene of a succubus fingering a centauress.</span></div></div>",

Then, it as his entire body started the shift into a bright blue color, his features themselves began running, becoming gelatinous. Before Kyon could even react, there was a blue puddle on the floor, soaking in Kyon's school uniform, with a glowing rocky core in the middle. Then, the mass started to pull up again, stretching out into a humanoid form. It lacked legs, instead continuing from the middle of the torso to the ground as a single body, and it was also decidedly feminine. The blue body had small breasts, probably around the same size as Nagato's, and the build was slight, with narrow shoulders. The shade of blue hair came from the head, but it was still all one mass, with simply the shape and light details to suggest a difference between 'head' and 'hair'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a nose poked out in the middle of the face, and slight bumps for ears on the sides, the last detail to come in were the eyes, blinking open and looking surprisingly human, the pupils an almost supernaturally bright blue.

Then they fixed onto Haruhi, full of ire. \"Well this is just great!\" Kyon said, his voice emanating from his face without a mouth. \"Now I'm stuck like this too, thanks Haruhi!\" His eyes went to Mikuru, who was looking at the slime girl with fascination. \"I'm so sorry this happened to you as well, Ms. Asahina.\" Looking at himself again, Kyon said, \"Koizumi and Yuki already cancelled from coming today, luckily. Haruhi, we'll use your phone to let everyone know what happened, then we'll have to quarantine ourselves in here for twenty-four ours, until we're not contagious anymore.\"</span></div></div>",

But compared to actually living out those hours, it was nothing. Asahina, of course, was nothing but an angel to Kyon, and once they knew Haruhi had actually fallen asleep for the night, they talked a little about what had happened. There hadn't been any nearby cases of the Virus that they knew of, so Haruhi probably wished she'd contracted it for some reason, causing the whole situation. Kyon didn't bring up that fact that he'd met Asahina's older self, after all he'd been told not to, but Asahina the Elder wasn't a monster girl, so this must have constituted a change to the timeline. That, or they had a way to reverse this in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it was Haruhi Suzumiya herself that made life hard for Kyon and Mikuru. Even though she'd shown signs of improvement, the reality warper still had difficulty not treating others as though they were her playthings, and when that mixed with a demonic influence and an increased libido, that meant she tried 'doing stuff' with both of them several times. That stopped once Kyon made it clear that sexual assault of anyone was unacceptable, and that he'd stop her by any means necessary, including filling up her orifices until she caved. After that, Haruhi behaved a little better, and shortly before they were free she offered an apology to Kyon and Mikuru, both for spreading the Virus to them and for her behavior. Once the twenty-four hours were up, they went their separate ways. His parents weren't exactly thrilled to find their baby-boy was now a gelatinous teenage girl, but his little sister enjoyed poking him and watching his slime jiggle, so that was something.</span></div></div>",

I was getting stares, still wearing my guy's uniform over my slimy body because I didn't own a girl's uniform, but they weren't necessarily surprised stares, they were more the 'oh, poor Kyon' kind of stares. Then, before I knew it, Taniguchi was walking next to me, like usual. What wasn't usual was that his eyes were looking everywhere except at me. Come on, man, I'm still me! Just because I caught a freaking virus doesn't mean I'm suddenly someone else entirely!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt my words, Taniguchi turned to look at me, actually blushing a little. \"Sorry man, it's just...you're pretty cute. At least a B on my grading scale, y'know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason at the time I couldn't comprehend, my first reaction was to fake a frown at him and ask, \"What do you mean a B? I thought I was cuter than that?\" Once the words left my...well, I guess my face, since I didn't actually have a mouth or vocal chords, it hit me how weird what I'd said was. I was trying to ignore my transformed body, but I'd just called attention to it, acted like a girl. And while I was thinking about that, I suddenly found myself thinking that Taniguchi was actually kind of cute, that he might be a good boyfriend. I tried to play off like my comment was a joke and we awkwardly switched subjects to our usual banter, but after my homeroom teacher, Okabe, gave me a girl's school and PE uniform, to change into later, I sat down at my desk, in front of Haruhi. Well, sat isn't really the best word, but my body was in the seat and sloshing down to the ground under it. My fearless brigade leader looked miffed, so I asked her what was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned her demonic eyes to me and said, \"At first I'd thought how cool this Monster Girl Virus was, but I forgot about the side effects. My libido's been stupid active, and I keep wanting to take guys to the bathroom to bang them.\" I'd never heard about this side effect, not having studied up on the virus much, but Haruhi's words made me consider how nice it would be to get fucked, my body absorbing their semen for food. I realized I needed to give her, and myself, advice.</span></div></div>",

You think you have it bad? You just became a succubus, I lost my original gender when I became a slime girl. If we try fighting these instincts all the time, 24/7, then we won't have enough brainpower left for anything else. We might as while try to act natural. Plus, I bet things will be less boring that way.\" She looked surprised that I'd taken this stance, but she really shouldn't have. After all, I was the master of giving up. Class started not long after, and she never responded to my little speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second we had a ten minute break between classes, Haruhi sped out of the classroom, but before I could really consider that Taniguchi came up to me. A lot of the guys had been giving me looks during class, and I actually felt kind of flattered. Whether that meant I made for a cute girl or that they all had slime girl fetishes, I had no clue, but either way it gave me this weird, bubbly sort of happiness. \"Hey, Kyon, could I talk to you out in the hall?\" I nodded, because sure, why not, and I followed behind him when it hit me that I was a girl following a guy somewhere.

You were right, just because you got that virus doesn't mean you're someone else. Are we cool?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" I told him immediately, then I lowered more of my body onto the floor, enough to put my head level with Taniguchi's crotch. Some part of me was freaking out inside, but it was like I'd told Haruhi earlier: fighting this was too much work. Using my gooey fingers, I unzipped Taniguchi's pants and reached through his underwear to feel his hard, hot cock and pull it out into the open air. I'd never actually paid much attention to my friend's cock before, but it was a little smaller than mine had been. That didn't matter though, I still wanted it. I leaned forward, shoving the cock inside my head roughly around where my mouth would normally be. It felt weird, having this warm piece of flesh inside of me, but it felt natural, good. I was able to massage it, stroke it, using the inside of my slimy body, and in a little over a minute Taniguchi had cum inside me, his white seed visible for a few seconds before it disappeared, digested. I leaned away, pulled his cock out of me, then looked up at him with a smile. \"Now we're cool.\"</span></div></div>",

I had just sucked off my friend, and I knew that should've been freaking me out, and it kind of was, but it had tasted so good, felt so good, and so much of my mind was telling me to just enjoy it. I didn't really notice, but by the time we got back to class, there was a satisfied smile on my gooey face. Haruhi had a similar smile herself, and when lunch came around I turned my head around and asked her what had her in such a good mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a second she looked conflicted, on odd expression on Haruhi's face, succubus or no, but she eventually settled into her usual Chesire Cat grin and told me. \"My urges got too strong, so I grabbed some rando near one of the less used bathrooms and had him pound me.\" Her eyes suddenly looked a little farther off as she continued. \"I don't know why I hadn't been doing this before the Virus, really.

It seemed like the only possible way out would be through breaking or bending the bars, but Bowser himself was perhaps the only person in the world strong enough to do so. Still, with a faint hope in her chest and a magical coin around her neck, Peach tugged as hard as she could on the bars, trying to bend them in opposite directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gold coin hanging flush to her chest could read her thoughts and obliged her. Just when she was about to give up on this foolish enterprise, Peach felt the bars start to move, if only ever so slightly. Surprised, she dedoubled her efforts and watched as slowly but surely the metal groaned and moved. What she didn't see was a large turtle shell forming on her back, or her shoulders widening as her build become thicker and more hardy. New strength surged through her, the bars bending quicker, as her arms grew more muscular and the muscles all over her body followed suit, expanding and compacting. The smile on her face became a snarl as her face elongated out into a snout filled with razor sharp teeth, her pale fleshy skin replaced with scales, and her bright blonde hair turned a bright red. The whole she was making was almost large enough for her growing form when her stomach began packing on some pounds, growing a small budgy belly that was accentuated by her now larger breasts. A tail grew, spiked, and slithered out of her shell, and the last things to change were her hands and feet, growing claws and scales themselves. As Peach surveyed her handywork, now able to escape the cage, she looked down and saw the body of a Royal Koopa, not too different in size and shape from Bowser, was now her own.</span></div></div>",

She was a Royal Koopa now, just like Bowser, and she knew that should terrify her. She'd never met a member of that class of koopa who hadn't been an arrogant blowhard, too obsessed with themselves to think about any of the people they hurt. But to her surprise, she didn't feel scared at all. Instead, Peach felt...awesome! The strength, the power, flowing through her new body, flowing through her mind, it was intoxicating. She could kick Bowser's ass right now, if she wanted to. She could kick Mario's ass! She could kick anyone's ass! Peach suddenly started laughing uproariously, small bouts of flame coming from her maw as she did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf this was how Royal Koopas felt all the time, maybe she'd been wrong in the first place. They weren't arrogant, they weren't cocky, it was just her perspective. To a weak, sniveling, worthless human, of course that's how Royal Koopas seemed. But being one now, she knew the truth: they were just amazing. She was stronger than anyone she'd ever met, and Peach knew that like it was a fact, like how things fell with you dropped them. Looking back, she envied Bowser now. While Peach had been a princess, a goody-little-two-shoes waiting for some guy to rescue her, he'd been out there, kicking ass and taking names, doing whatever he wanted and damn anyone who had a problem with that! More than anything else, Peach was excited to live a life like that now, one where she just took what she wanted, a life like Bowser's.</span></div></div>",

It glowed brightly between her scaly breasts and began to change her once more. Peach's hair became shorter, and more wild, as her reptilian face lost any amount of femininity it had once possessed. Her entire body got larger, thicker, more powerful, with a rotund stature that made it clear she wasn't someone watching her weight. Her breasts themselves ebbed away into the solid wall of chest she'd claimed, and her genitals were the last thing to change as she suddenly stood there looking at the coin falling to the ground with nothing to support it, her clothes completely shredded, a complete physical copy of Bowser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the gold coin, Peach realized it was what had done all of this to here: Become What You Seek. She'd wanted to be strong enough to escape, then to be more like her captor, and both had come true. \"Grahahaha!\" Peach roared, laughing loudly. \"This is perfect! Now I'm the epitome of bad! The most powerful man in the world! No one will ever kidnap me again. In fact...I might start kidnapping people! Bwahahahahahaha!\" Peach had no problem with the change in gender, with any of this.

He hadn't eaten anything all day and was going to spend his last dollar on a nice cheap burger before he would let himself worry about the fact he hadn't gotten a case or a paycheck in months.  Well that wasn't true, he'd taken on a number of cases for friends and neighbors but they couldn't afford another lawyer and knew Phoenix didn't have the heart to charge more than they could afford.  But good will does not pay the bills.  As the weight of the world was starting to bare down on Phoenix he passed a small shop where there was an argument inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I demand you lower the price!  This is outrageous!  I can find better products than this in a trash can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then go to a trash can where you belong you filth.  Leave my shop!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not until I get some money back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't leave now I'll curse you so hard your children will suffer!\"  Phoenix looked into the shop to see a very frustrated looking old man waving what seemed to be voodoo doll in the customers face.  Phoenix was surprised to see that he recognized that customer, it was prosecutor Paine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have you arrested and your store shut down!\"  Paine squeezed with his familiar shrill voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gentlemen!  Please calm down, no need to fight!\"  Phoenix decided he needed to step in before this escalated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll happily leave if I get my money back.  This was supposed to give me my hair back but they did nothing.\"  Paine slammed down a silver coin on the counter.  The shop owner rolled his eyes, \"Than you should have gotten the gold one, it cost the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care about coins, just give me my money back and I'll find some other not shabby shop to give my money too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No refunds!\"  The old man said intently looking ready to do something bad with the voodoo doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gentlemen!  No need to fight!  Paine, how much was the coin.  We'll try to work something out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1 dollar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix stood stunned for a moment, \"1 dollar?  Really?\"  Paine nodded and Phoenix groaned, \"Fine, I'll give you the dollar for the shop own, will you leave peacefully?\"  Phoenix said as he shoved his last dollar into Paine's chest.  Paine took it and considered, \"Fine.  But I'll keep an eye on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good for you.\"  The old man growled as Paine left the shop.  Phoenix went to check on the old man, \"Are you ok sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am sonny, I could have taken care of him myself, but I don't like to flex my muscles unless I have to.\"  The old man said as he cracked his fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, well, have a nice day.\"  Phoenix said as he turned to leave thinking he might have some stale cereal leftover in the office.  But the old man stopped him, \"Wait!  I can't let you leave empty handed, please, look around my shop.  Take whatever you want free of charge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I couldn't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please take what you wish, I insist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix gave a glance around the shop to see if there was anything he could get for the office but decided against it, he didn't want to take advance of the old man's kindness.  He looked down at the coins the he knew were being sold for cheap and decided they were the best way to take payment without taking anything too valuable.</span></div></div>",

Help me Nick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"$200!

Ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\"  Maya and cheered into the phone, \"See you soon Nick!\"  And with that the spirit channeler hung up.  Sighing and figuring maybe he'd be able to eat some untouched leftovers for his supper, Phoenix made his way to Tres Bien and approached the owner/chef Jean Armstrong.  \"Hi again Jean, I'm here to help out with working off Maya's debt.  Do you want me to wash the dishes in the back or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sparkle in his eye and a voice that was trying to be youthful and feminine, the large man said, \"Oh no no non, I can not allow anyone to see the kitchens for my secret recipes!  You will work here in the front as a waitress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, you mean a waiter.\"  Phoenix said feeling his temple throb a little bit.  \"Vetever!\"  Jean said with a flourish as he skipped back into the kitchen.  Phoenix saw that Maya was already in the orange maid like uniform that brought in a number of customers on it's own.  \"Nick.  You came!\"  Maya seemed to have tears in her eyes as she hugged Phoenix.  \"Yeah, it's no problem.  It's a slow day at the office anyways.  So, I don't suppose I have an appropriate uniform or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya led Phoenix into a changing room that had a free locker with a female uniform inside.  Phoenix grimaced at it.  There was no way he'd be caught dead in such a thing.  But he wasn't going to serve food in his suit so he took off his signature blue jacket and defense attorney pin.  As he hung it up a small gold coin fell out it's pocket.  \"Oh yeah, forgot about this.\"  Phoenix looked at the coin and saw that there was some words engraved on it but he could worry about that later, he had work to do.  So he pocketed the gold coin and took the frilly apron off the female uniform and put it on to protect the rest of his clothes from whatever came out of the kitchen and got to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first few customers went poorly as Phoenix almost spilled the...food(?) onto customers.  But he tried his hardest and almost by magic he began to get better.  He was balancing treys with ease after a few minutes and even was going the extra mile by refilling drinks without even being asked and checking in with customers.  He wasn't sure what was coming over him, it was like something inside him was leading him to be a better waiter.  But something inside him was making him feeling queasy.  Maybe he was breathing in too many fumes from the kitchen.  And after about an hour of serving Phoenix felt that something building up in him getting strong.  Feeling like he was about to burst Phoenix ran back to the changing area and sure enough Phoenix began to change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started with his pants oddly enough, they began to turn from their signature blue to a bright orange color and what's more they began to fuse together and shorten until they became like a skirt that went above his knees.  Then his white button up shirt began to change until it too was orange and fusing with the skirt to become one dress that with he frilly apron looked quite fetching if it were on a woman.  And soon it would be as Phoenix felt a build up in his chest, he tried to will it to stop but it finally burst out until he had a pair of breasts that might C cup.  Phoenix's spike hair began to soften and started to grow and grow until it flowed down to below his shoulders.  Phoenix looked on in confusion as his arms, legs, and face began to soften and shrink becoming more feminine.  And finally as if everything else wasn't enough he felt a something change around his pelvis as though something was being absorbed into a new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix felt a relief as the energy he felt like he'd been carrying for an hour finished it's work, but this wasn't right.  He was no longer himself.  Sure with a form like this he could be a better waitress and make more tips, but he couldn't, or at least shouldn't be thinking like this now.  As Phoenix tried to comprehend what had happened to him he heard something behind him.</span></div></div>",

Not that he could really call it his body anymore with the beasts filling out the top that would give his old mentor Mia a run for her money.  Along with the breasts he now saw a cascade of black hair in his face that at least seemed to stay back in a semi-pointed position when he pushed it out of his face with his new hands with long fingernails that looked like they'd cut someone if he wasn't careful where he was pointing.  Phoenix's hands drifted down as he tried to figure out the extent of his sudden and surprising transformation when he heard a trey drop behind him.  Phoenix look around to see the shocked face of his assistant Maya Fey still working off her debt for her meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-n-n-Nick?!\"  Maya said with her mouth wide enough to fit two of her favorite hamburgers.  \"Maya?  I can explain...actually I can't now that I think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nick why didn't you tell me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell you what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That you're a superhero!\"  Maya's look of shock had suddenly turned into a look of glee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A..what?  I'm not a superhero Maya.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you just transformed into a whole new person in front of me!  I've only seen superheroes on my Saturday morning super shows do that before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Maya, those are cartoons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not all of them.  I watch things that look like real life too, like the Steel Samurai the Warrior of Neo Olde Tokyo, or the Pink Princess who...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maya!\"  Phoenix cut off his rambling assistant in a voice that was much more shrill than his normal tone, \"I didn't do this on purpose, something must have made me transform...wait a second.  That coin!\"  Phoenix reached down for his non existent pants pockets but did find small purse at his feet.  He quickly picked it up and emptied it's contents.  There was some lipstick, his cell phone which was now was now held together with pink tape instead of blue, an empty wallet (at least that didn't change), and a coin purse with one golden coin jingling inside it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it!  This gold coin I got from that weird shop.  I think because I was working as a waitress to help you it turned me into one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you know what this mean Nick?\"  Maya asked oddly seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That if I act like a lawyer I will turn back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaya nods her head before giving her thoughts.</span></div></div>",

I can show you how things can be even better!  Just watch Nick!  Spirit Saphire Samurai Channeling Justice away!\"  And with that Maya swiped the coin from Phoenix's hands and ran off.  \"Maya!  Wait, I need that!\"  And Phoenix left the back room and tried to chase after Maya but a soft yet firm hand grabbed Phoenix's shoulder to stop him.  \"Oh mademoiselle, you still must work off mademoiselle Fey's bill since she has already left.\"  The large and pink clad owner and chef of the Tres Bien restaurant Jean Armstrong had a grip on Phoenix's shoulder and wasn't letting go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice in the back of Phoenix's head said, '<span class=\"cpink\"><i>It's very rude and unprofessional for a waitress to leave before her shift is up.</i></span>'  Phoenix shook the voice off but looked at his boss for the night and said, \"Yes sir.\"  So Jean went back to the kitchen and cooked up more...delicious treats for his new waitress to serve.  And serve Phoenix did.  With a smile on his face that wasn't forced he carried the treys and glasses with grace and beauty that had not been there earlier in the evening.  Phoenix didn't even flinch when a certain red nosed customer kept dropping his silverwear as Phoenix passed to get an up skirt look.  He just smiled and acted like a professional waitress as though he'd dealt with customers like this for years.  When the store finally began closing up and Phoenix had a moment to himself in the back room he said to himself, \"It might be a good thing Maya took the magic golden coin with her, if I'd held onto it and kept serving I might have become a waitressing machine in both mind and body with no turning back.  Man that's scary.\"  Phoenix shuttered at the thought of wearing the orange waitress outfit for the rest of his days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for today he had no choice.  Jean was so grateful for the help that he said Phoenix could keep the outfit, what he was going to have to do anyways since his waitress outfit was his normal blue suit magically transformed and he had no backup outfit.  As Phoenix left Tres Bien he began counting the cash he had made from tips.  \"I hope this doesn't magically go away if...no when I turn back.\"  Phoenix said as he put the case into his purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unfortunately for Phoenix, he wasn't the only one to see this.  In a shadowy ally that Phoenix had to pass, a hand reached out and pulled Phoenix with him.  \"Give me the money girl and nobody get's hurt.\"  Phoenix was frozen, he'd been a woman for a few hours and he was already a damsel in distress.  Phoenix didn't know what to do, even if he was a guy he didn't think he could fight this guy off.  Panic swept over Phoenix as he just stood paralyze before what happened next.</span></div></div>",

But however that all turns out will be up to you Mr. Wright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, wait, how did you know my name?\" Phoenix turned and saw that the old man was no longer behind the counter at all.

This is going to be a rough one.\"  Phoenix began to wonder how long his stash of ramen back in the office would last him before another case came up.

Phoenix was glad Edgeworth thought of him well enough as a peer, but would it have killed him to call Phoenix a 'friend', or take a note from Gumshoe and go 'pal'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing Edgeworth, I'm on my way.\"  Phoenix said, thankfully the porsecutors office was just a few blocks from the weird and mysterious shop where he got that silver coin so he wouldn't have to call someone to bum a ride.  Phoenix got to the office, and after getting a few weird looks from office workers who only seemed to look at his defense badge, Phoenix made it to Edgeworth's office.  Although if you asked Phoenix it looked more like a small house with the stuffed bookshelves that went all the way up to the 15 foot high ceiling and extravagant looking objects like an fancy chess set and an old globe that looked like it belonged in a museum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah there you are Wright, pull up a chair and begin going through that stack of books please.  I'd like to start with possible formatting the way evidence is handled between both attorneys and the police.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right to work?  Not even stopping to say hi?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgeworth didn't even look up from his book, \"If pleasantries are needed, and they aren't, then they can be at the end of this work session.  I have Gumshoe scheduled to bring in tea and scones in 2 hours.\"  <i>'Is he just your personal butler at this point?'</i>  Phoenix thought as he sat down in a chair the might cost more than all the furniture in his office and began to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a rather productive couple of hours, the two lawyers read silently only talking to propose ideas that would be met with discussion for the betterment of the current law and trial system.  The two stopped working when Gumshoe crashed through the door and dropped the tea and scones on the table only to leave in a rush claiming he thinks he might have seen someone jaywalking and wanted to give them a stern warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the work done for now Edgeworth poured the tea and offered some to Phoenix as he said, \"I must apologize for the frightful mess of the office.\"  Phoenix looked around but didn't say anything, after all a 'messy' Edgeworth office was much nicer and organized than the Wright and Co. office on it's best days.  \"It's no problem, we've all been there.\"  Phoenix said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm sure your office is well organized, after all you do have those assistants of yours who I'm sure are a great help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, Maya and Ema are fantastic.\"  Phoenix said while thinking <i>Although keeping the office clean isn't their strong suit.</i>  In order to keep conversation going now that Edgeworth had actually opened up Phoenix said, \"I wish I could help you out with that.\"  In that moment the magic of the silver coin activated enveloping Phoenix, Edgeworth was so busy with his tea he didn't even notice that Phoenix was starting to grow younger to about 18 years old.  And what's more he began to take the form of his usual assistants, namely he began to feel a pair of breasts growing beneath his blue suit.  His spiky black hair began to grow as Phoenix picked up a silver platter the scones were on and watched as his face became younger and more feminine.  Finally a final change happened as his clothes began to change.</span></div></div>",

He did his best to ignore it and help her, going through the routine stiffly and awkwardly. But as the tricks went on, Apollo felt himself relaxing, and not minding the clothing as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat neither realized was that, trick by trick, Apollo was changing. His thin legs filled out with either muscle and fat, giving him shapely thighs and would catch men's eyes. His bony butt expanded until it jiggled and barely fit in the costume, giving some ass cleavage to anyone looking at him from behind. His build lost what little angular masculinity it had, replaced with narrower shoulders and smooth skin. His nipples stood at attention as the skin beneath then raised up, fat building until two large breasts could be clearly seen in the costume's top. Apollo kept his sharp eyes and antennae, but the rest of his face was beautified until he looked like a gorgeous woman, and his hair grew out until it fixed itself magically into a ponytail. One last change assuredly turned Apollo from a man into a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the last trick was done, and Trucy stood ecstatic and satisfied with her act, Apollo applauded with uncharacteristic enthusiasm and pranced around the stage, his breasts bouncing with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as if a spell had suddenly ended, both noticed Apollo's changes. \"Polly! What happened to you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't as if Apollo had any answers for her. His mind felt numb, and then he felt the weight of the coin he'd placed in a secret chest compartment inside the costume, now rubbing against his bouncy boobs. He pulled it out, and realized the truth. \"I acted like an assistant, so I became one?\" Something about that seemed wondrous, magical, <i> fantastic</i>, but Apollo held onto his other reaction: \"I need to change back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this coin did it, huh?\" Trucy asked, walking up to Apollo...only to snatch the coin out of hand and make it disappear into thin air. Apollo freaked out, but Trucy held up a finger. \"You said you'd help with the show, and I'm holding you to that! On stage with you like this, the show will be amazing! So until then, I'll keep the coin safe. You're on vacation, Polly, so don't be Apollo Justice, be Pauline Justice!\" With no other choice, Apollo agreed.</span></div></div>",

Regardless of the complete alteration of his physical form, he was still Apollo Justice, and he was here with Trucy Wright, perhaps the person who he trusted the most in the entire world. So long as she was there to watch his back, Apollo knew everything was going to be alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrucy giggled, but it wasn't the usual disarmingly cute giggle that Trucy used like a targeted weapon of adorableness. Apollo had spent enough time with her that he didn't need Athena's ears to hear that this was an awkward 'I hope you're not made at me' giggle. \"About that...I kind of have a test coming up and already pinky-promised a friend I'd spend the afternoon studying with her. Just be at the Wonder Bar at nine for the show, and half a great day, Pauline!\" Before Apollo could even reply to anything she said, Trucy had left the Wright Anything Agency. Apollo stood there in a gorgeous female body, clad in leotard that showed off his bouncing cleavage quite well and came with matching fishnet stockings, alone in the room, but after a few seconds he just laughed. He'd been abandoned enough over the years that he'd learned to cope with it, especially when he knew the person leaving him was someone that genuinely loved him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a few breaths to let out any negative emotions he had over the whole thing, and then he left the office himself, locking it up behind him, to head to the place he always went when he wanted to feel alone. Apollo Justice had always been a very private guy, doing his best to keep his personal life and professional life separate. It wasn't like he didn't like his coworkers, he really did, they were all friends and in one case the closest thing in the world he had left to a family member. Some people thought it was because of his first mentor, Kristoph Gavin, or because of being an orphan, forced to grow up in a harsh environment after everything with Dhurke. Maybe either was a little responsible, but on the whole Apollo just thought of himself as a private person. And when he wanted to really be by himself, Apollo's number one local was a place no one in the Wright Anything Agency had ever heard of: Jeffrey's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a small pub, owned by some guy whose family had been passing it down from generation to generation ever since they immigrated from Germany in the 1800's. It was the kind of place that was never bursting with patrons, but never really empty either. Apollo was the kind of person, a guy with a professional appearance who was short and not traditionally masculine in the slightest, who was basically treated like they were invisible in a social setting like this, and that's why he went: to be alone. After walking in, going up to the bar to order his usual, a non-alcoholic beer, and finding his favorite table, Apollo sat down and tried to be alone with his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, that was proving harder than usual. Normally, Apollo didn't get a second glance from anyone, unless it was at his hair. But from the moment he walked in, Apollo became very aware of the looks he was getting. Most men had their eyes locked on his bouncing boobs and his succulent ass, clearly enamored, and while a few women were giving him the same, the rest had expressions that Apollo read as 'look at this slut'. At first Apollo was blushing, but that faded quickly, any embarrassment sliding away like water off a duck's back. Maybe it was because, being a magician's assistant, Pauline was made for the stage, but whatever it was Apollo struggled to focus on his thoughts when he found himself admiring the appreciation he was getting from men in the bar, even leaning a little more forward to give them more of a show. It was inevitable that one of them would come up to him soon and try to get into his pants, and he was trying to suss out how he felt about that. Before the coin changing him, Apollo was, at most, a Kinsey 1.5, and he didn't want to forget who he really was and subsume himself entirely into a different identity. On the other hand, he was <i>really</i> liking the looks, and hadn't Trucy told him to embrace being Pauline Justice? She usually gave solid-ish advice, maybe he should listen to her.</span></div></div>",

With that in mind, he began actively trying to ignore the stares he was getting from so many of the bar patrons and went back to sipping his non-alcoholic beer with focusing on his own thoughts. For one thing, he was only able to take this break thanks to it being a week-long holiday in Khura'in, and the day after he flew back he'd be thrown right back into that never ending slew of court cases. Being the only defense attorney in a small country was stressful, to be sure, but it was also appealing. Plus, while he missed his friends here, Nahyuta, Rayfa and Ema were all there with him, so he wasn't really alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, the sexy girl at the bar, sitting at a table for two by herself, was smiling while looking off in the distance, and someone decided it was the perfect time to try and keep her company. Just as Apollo was going to start mentally preparing for his next case, whose trial started the day after he got back, a man came over and sat across from her. \"I hope I'm not intruding,\" he said, grinning ruefully at her. \"I just thought you looked a little lonely, could use some company.\" Then the man extended a hand to Apollo. \"I'm Justin Case, and you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man's words broke Apollo out of his thought process and he was suddenly blinking, trying to catch up on who this guy was. He had a bit of the typical 'hipster' look, with a short cropped beard, carefully messed up hair, and a red and black plaid button-up shirt. And after putting all that together, his first thought was, 'Wow, this guy is really cute.' His second thought was, 'Oh crap, he extended his hand!' and so Apollo quickly grabbed the guy's hand with his own dainty, feminine own and said, \"I'm Pauline Justice, and I wasn't lonely, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin laughed, and it annoyed Apollo how cute he thought it made him look. \"My mistake then.\" From there, the guy started making small talk. At first Apollo tried to seem uninterested, but as they bounced from topic to topic, he couldn't help becoming more invested. He started laughing with Justin, and once he was really starting to get involved his eyes couldn't stop running over what he could see of Justin's body, making him wonder what he'd look like without those clothes. After all, he was clearly here to talk because Apollo was a hot girl in a sexy outfit, so there was definitely interest there. When he finally asked why Apollo was wearing that costume, and Apollo explained he was an assistant in a magic show, something about Justin's face shifted, making him look almost hungry. \"Well, I might stop by and check out your show then.\" Then he leaned closer and whispered, \"Unless you'd like to make me disappear right now. My apartment is a block away.\"</span></div></div>",

Internally, Apollo knew this was weird. After all, he was a guy! Regardless of how his physical form had been played with, inside he was still himself. But at the same time he wasn't. It was impossible for him to deny his attraction to Justin, or the fact that this body and the personality that came with it was becoming more and more natural to him over time. It was only until tonight, right? So why stress about having a little fun, especially when he wouldn't have a chance to do it this same way ever again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJustin was a man of his word, his apartment building really was only a block away, and soon they were in his apartment. It was small, but well decorated in a tasteful and quirky way. But Apollo could not care less about the apartment's decor, not really. The second they were inside, Apollo came closer and kissed Justin, full on the lips, with as much passion as he could muster. When they both came up for air, all Justin said was, \"My bed's this way.\" Once he showed her to the right room, she pushed him onto the bed and started undressing him. Apollo hadn't realized until just then how horny he was, how much he needed to fuck. The hours flew by. She sucked his cock, he ate her out, they fucked until he came inside her and then cuddled while he recharged, then fucked some more. When they were finally both too exhausted to continue, Apollo felt absolutely perfect. Still riding on the high of her afterglow, she wondered why this was supposed to be a big deal. Sex was fun, it was fulfilling, it was something she hadn't done in a while and never had it felt this good. Her revery over the act hit a wall when she saw his retro alarm clock and saw it was eight thirty...she had half an hour to get to the Wonder Bar!</span></div></div>",

That done, she turned to look at Justin again, who was almost done getting dressed himself. Blushing, Apollo told him, \"I'm sorry to leave so suddenly, this has been really nice. I'd love to get your number...\" Part of Apollo questioned why she was getting this guy's number if she'd be turning back to normal soon, but that  quandary was easily ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEspecially when Justin's response was to close the distance between them, kiss her in a way that made her want to swoon, and tell her, \"I'll give you more than that. Would you care for a ride to your destination?\" Apollo teared up and nodded, and before too long they were on the road, each one having the number of the other now in their contact lists on their phones. A quick kiss goodbye sealed Apollo's infatuation with the guy, and she entered the bar five minutes early. The show went off without a hitch, and Apollo felt completely at ease with her body now.

Her small breasts faded away into a widening chest, into the large pectoral muscles being built. Any trace of softness left her body, replaced by hard muscles. Her face lost its cuteness, with a large chin that was soon covered in stubble. Something changed under her clothes as well, definitively changing her sex, and when all was said and done the magician on stage was clearly still a teenager, but the kind who looked like he would be invited to a fraternity once reaching college. Trucy was buff, strong, hairy, and very male.</span></div></div>",

Why not keep it for a while longer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she was loathe to admit it, Apollo knew Trucy had a point. Being this other person, it had been such a new experience.

Maybe staying like this a little longer wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.

It was slightly amusing and deeply concerning that a three dollar purchase could bring about so much change merely in a day. \"Worst money I ever spent...\" He grumbled to himself, his grousing only serving as a reminder to his new feminine reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Irritably, he tried to shove his hands into his pockets, forgetting that his new ensemble had nothing of the sort. Before sending him out with the coin \u2014 which he was genuinely grateful for \u2014 Trucy had assembled a new outfit for him. It was some outfit of Trucy's, a blue dress with three buttons on either side. It was certainly better than that showy assistant's uniform, but unfortunately Apollo's new voluptuous body wasn't exactly Trucy's size, firstly causing almost every new curve of his body being displayed by the tight fabric, and secondly forcing him to wear the assistant's outfit underneath as 'support,' as Trucy had put it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could fully parse what that meant, he arrived at People Park, the designated rendezvous point for him and Mr. Wright. He had went over the case details briefly, apparently some shmuck named Stuart Pidman had been caught skulking about the park right around the time some festival fireworks had gone haywire. Normally the police'd chalk it up as an accident and go about their business, but since the Kitaki family had been funding the whole festival, they <i>insisted</i> that it must have been sabotage. \"The  police may not catch the crook at first, but at least they know when the Kitakis want something, that they <i>get something</i>.\" Apollo snidely mused to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting around the gates for a minute or two, Apollo was greeted with a spiky-haired man in a bright blue suit practically sprinting towards the gate. <i>'The old Detention Center Dash,)</i> thought Apollo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're Pauline, I presume.\" said Phoenix, having mostly caught his breath after a minute's break. \"I'm really sorry about the short notice, but I really needed an assistant for this outing. They're barring the crime scene in two hours, Ema needs someone to grouse and do forensics with or she gets all pouty, I need to be briefed on the evidence by the detective, and I forgot my Magatama at\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quite all right.\" said Apollo with a warm smile. Typical Phoenix, burning the candle at both ends again. \"I may be an...\" He wracked his brain for the one-second backstory Trucy gave him. \"Illusionist by trade, but I've always been interested in crime scenes. Odd hobby for a gu \u2014 GIRL like me to have, I've been told.\" They both shared a laugh together, Apollo secretly hoping that Phoenix didn't see through his paper-thin backstory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey chatted for a bit as they went into the park, Apollo not entirely engaged due to his shock at how tall Mr. Wright seemed now. After their conversation came to an end, Phoenix gave Apollo a short briefing on their individual tasks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'm going to go talk to some witnesses and the detective, while you'll be a deputy forensic investigator with Ema over there.\" Phoenix jerked a thumb towards some scorched ground where, sure enough, the Snackoo crunching cop was crouched near. \"Again, I'm sorry that I can't personally show you my investigative technique, but the new detective in charge gets antsy with more than one 'Dirty Defender' gets near their witnesses.\" Apollo gave an inward sigh of sympathy. Some detectives were pains to deal with by yourself, let alone with more than one person near 'em. He nodded his affirmation to Phoenix, earning him a thumbs up in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo was walking away before he heard Phoenix cry out to him. \"Hey, wait up a moment!\" Turning around, Apollo put his hands to his mouth in surprise at what Phoenix was holding. It was the golden coin \u2014 Apollo not even realized that it had fallen from his 'Victoria's Secret compartment' when he absentmindedly shoved it in there. \"I think you might have dropped this earlier, Pauline \u2014 I saw it glinting on the path just a second ago.\" Apollo reached out for the coin, profusely thanking Phoenix, until he jerked it back. \"Umm... Are you sure you don't want me to hang on to this? I don't think you have any pockets and the other ways to keep it safe are.... less secure.\" Phoenix mumbled the last part, a practically luminescent blush on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo thought for a second and said... </span></div></div>",

Apollo looked down at the coin and breathed a sigh of relief, he didn't want to think what would have happened if he lost the coin and he didn't want anyone to accidentally activate it, or worse, lose it.  So Apollo once again stuffed the coin down the front of his magician assistant costume.  To make sure the coin would be dropped again his fleshy chest he jumped a few times and actively shook his chest to make sure it was nice and secure.  Satisfied that he was going to lose it this time he looked up and was horrified to see Phoenix was still in front of him with eyes wide as apples and with a face just as red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo felt his face flush and decided the best course of action was to run, so making a line straight for Ema and ran for it.  Phoenix just looked at 'Pauline' running with her fishet clad legs and mumbled to himself, \"How is a spirit channeler the most normal assistant I've ever had?\"  Before he cleared his head and went to work on the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEma the meanwhile finished one of her bags of Snackoos and was about to open a second when the peculiarly dressed 'Pauline' ran up with red face.  \"Pretty young girl in the middle of a crime scene.  Let me guess, Phoenix has a new assistant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo very ready to push what had just happened out of his head  simply said, \"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you be careful.  Phoenix's assistants have a tendency to be accused of murder or something at some point.  I know that from personal experience.  Phoenix will do everything he can to get you off, but I just thought I'd offer the friendly warning if you wanted to get out now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo felt a little insulted, \"No way, I'm never giving up on Mr. Wright.  He needs my help and no matter what I'm going to help.\"  <i>'Even if I turn into a girl thanks to a magic coin.'</i>  Apollo thought silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say I didn't warn you, we've got some evidence against Stuart Pidman but it's not the most solid, so the Kitaki's are ready to accuse anyone who so much as looks at them funny.  In fact they've got that son of theirs Wocky has been bugging me every few minutes asking about if we caught 'The wack jack that stabbed our fireworks in the back.\"  Ema sighed and opened up her Snackoos and began her stress eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll see what the evidence says, let's take a look around.\"  Ema and Apollo took a look around the crime scene.  But Apollo was getting frustrated with himself.  Every bit of evidence he found instead of analyzing it like he normally would he instead presented each piece in a grand show as though on stage for a show thanks to the magic of the coin and training from Trucy.  Together they found a footprint that probably belonged to the suspect along with a strange firework that didn't match the brand the Kitaki's were using.  But as they began to analyze clues something unfortunate happened to Apollo.</span></div></div>",

Even though he already knew most of Ema's techniques he was just happy to be having a relatively normal interaction today.  And with the darn coin that caused his problems nesseled up against his boobs he still couldn't believe he had, Apollo was determined to act like a good defense attorney to hopefully bring about a change back to his normal body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo eager to do his job he first started with the suspicious footprint.  Apollo poured the material into it to get a cast of it and then when it hardened they had a perfect copy.  Ema still in tutorial mode told Apollo, \"Now that we have a copy of the footprint we can compare it to others in our database.  But just so you can understand we'll start with you.  Go ahead and put your foot into the cast so we can run a comparison.  Apollo looked down at the footprint that was clearly bigger than his now small and dainty feet and with a showman's kick and flourish put his fishnet covered foot into the cast.  As Apollo did this he felt please, he felt something warm in his chest and felt like the coin was beginning to do it's magic.  <i>'Goodbye Pauline, hello Apollo.</i>  The defense attorney thought as the coin did indeed change him, but only his feet to slightly grow them to perfectly match the suspicious footprint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for Apollo, Ema was busy eating Snackoos and didn't notice the magical change take place and when she looked down only saw a perfect match.  Her eyebrows raised in surprise and casually asked, \"Say Pauline, what were you doing last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last night?\"  Apollo thought in a panic, before a few hours ago 'Pauline' didn't exist so he quickly just said, \"I was just home alone watching tv.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\"  Ema said and seemingly with some reluctance said, \"I'm afraid I'm going to have to bring you into the detention center for questioning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You what?!\"  Apollo said in a panic not knowing what was going on, this had to be a bad dream.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just a precaution, I'm sure with Pheonix helping you out he'll find some evidence to prove you innocent in no time.  But for now please come with me.\"  As Ema escorted the confused and panicked young defense attorney/magician assistant Apollo cried out, \"Mr. Wright!

Not because he was still wearing the magician's assistant outfit alone with Trucy's way too tight outfit, but because when he was arrested he had to turn over everything he had, and the only thing he had to take was the magical coin.  All Apollo would do was pace around the room and awkwardly adjust his outfit that felt like it was so unfamiliar to his body.  Apollo thought of the worst case scenario where he'd have to go to court, but how was he going to defend himself?  He as 'Pauline' had no alibi for the crime at all.  Would Phoenix even be able to help defend him?  And if not how could he defend himself without his attorney's badge.  All these thoughts and 100s of worse ones pounded in his head when a guard came up to his door.  \"Miss, you're free to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo didn't even fully process what the guard told him, \"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're free to go mam, you've got yourself a good lawyer to get you out of this.

How did you know I was innocent?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe in my clients, when I looked at you I just knew I could believe in you Pauline.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Mr. Wright.  That means a lot to me.  But how did you do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I looked at the crime scene more and all of the evidence and realized some things didn't make sense as far as the Kitaki family goes.  I realized that Wocky had the same size shoe as the footprint left behind.  I confronted him about it and after presenting some evidence and telling him that a pretty young woman was going to jail for him he confessed he messed with the fireworks to 'make it more jacked' and it went wrong.  When the Kitaki's learned what happened they dropped all charges.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo was amazed at what Phoenix had gone through in just a few hours to save him, but then he remembered he shouldn't be surprised.  After all, work like this was why he admired Phoenix in the first place.  \"You're amazing Mr. Wright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhoenix turned slightly more crimson and the two stood in awkward silence for a while before Phoenix finally said, \"Heh, you've had a long day, how about I take you out to dinner, my treat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo felt his stomach rumble and realized he hadn't eaten anything all day.  \"That sounds great Mr. Wright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, call me Phoenix, or Nick if you like.\"</span></div></div>",

Still thinking about the offer Apollo said, \"Well, I guess some nice noodles would really hit the spot after today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, actually I was thinking something a little more fitting a celebration.  There's a French place around the corner.  I know the chef and owner and I think you might like it.  Besides, I'm curious to see how much better the food is since I haven't been there in years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo couldn't believe his ears, Phoenix was offering to take him out to something that would probably cost more than all the meals he'd bought in the last few months.  <i>'Well, if he's proposing something like this it must be a special occasion.  Who am I to turn down the offer?'</i>  Apollo smiled in surprise at the idea of his mentor actually willingly spending money and said, \"That sounds great Mr. Wright.  Oh sorry.  That sounds great Nick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two members of the Wright Anything Agency walked down from the detention center a few streets down.  Along the way Phoenix told 'Pauline' stories about the neighborhood and about the people.  Phoenix seemed to have a story about everyone he knew, mostly about how he had to get them out of legal trouble.  But he was saying it very matter of factly and not in a bragging way as though he were just telling stories about old friends.  Apollo couldn't help but be impressed, it reminded him once more why he looked up to and admired Phoenix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they got to the restaurant Apollo nearly gagged.  It was the pinkest and girliest place he'd ever seen with over the top designs and a strong flowery scent that almost knocked Apollo on his round butt.  \"Well, I guess business must be going well, he's gotten even more elaborate.\"  Phoenix said chuckling to himself.  Phoenix looked at 'Pauline' to gauge his companions reaction.  Apollo thought about being snarky and asking why Phoenix would bring him to a place like this, but then remembered he was a girl right now.  <i>'Am I supposed to pretend to like this stuff?</i>  Apollo thought before seeing Phoenix awaiting a response.  Apollo put on a showing smile befitting a stage magician's assistant and said, \"It looks possitivly magical.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat down and both let out a gasp upon seeing the prices on the menu, but Phoenix put on a brave face and made as though it were no big deal.  Phoenix went ahead and ordered the French Cuisine for Two since it was the cheapest thing on the menu.  A very large and effeminate man named Jean Armstrong practically skipped out of the kitchen and placed a single large plate of spaghetti with a single meatball on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't this italian food?\"  Apollo asked.  But Phoenix simply replied after tentatively tasting a noodle, \"It's better than what was being served here before, so I'm not complaining.\"  So the two began to eat the overly priced meal before something happened the rattled Apollo.</span></div></div>",

You just keep practicing our routine, got it?\" That was the last thing he heard from Trucy before she went out the door, coin in hand.... Or magic panties, whatever. The point was that Apollo didn't have the one thing that could turn him back, which induced enough anxiety without considering that Trucy had a hold of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously gnawing on a magically manicured finger, Apollo tried to sit on the couch and watch some TV, take his mind off of things. But, thwarting his attempts to focus, Apollo kept glancing at the magic equipment left to the side. Apollo had no illusions about it, his role at first was to be the awkward guy in drag, distracting from the real sleight-of-hand Trucy had set up. But besides that, it was fun working with her, showing the empty hat to an imaginary audience. And the idea of everyone's eyes on him now \u2014 it sent a shiver up his spine, but he couldn't quite tell if it was fear or anticipation. Having almost completely forgotten about the television, he hungrily affixed the equipment with his eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, the hat is completely empty!'</i> The imaginary Trucy in Apollo's head bellowed. Apollo took it upon himself to comically slap the top of the hat, mock shrugging when nothing came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>And a three, two, one \u2014 whoa!</i>' Here, Trucy would stumble as her classy automaton, Mr. Hat appears, almost as if he conjured himself from the headwear. Here, Apollo would part his lips into a cherry-red 'O' of surprise. 'Boy folks, it sure was cramped in there!' Trucy would use her impressive ventriloquism abilities to joke with the crowd, Apollo tittering along with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>We've all seen this whole rigamarole before, am I right folks? So let's cop to the classics and make the assistant disappear!</i>' This was the showstopper, the new spin on an old classic. Apollo would lie in the box \u2014 using the sofa for a makeshift one in the meantime \u2014 and lift up a stockinged leg, running his hand down the smooth surface as if to taunt the audience, tease them with what they never could \u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he could finish the trick, realize that he had subconsciously adjusted his routine to be <b>much</b> more feminine, or even stop his coy teasing of the imaginary crowd, he heard the door creak open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was...</span></div></div>",

And so the first thing Athena saw as she opened the door was a magician's assistant seemingly trying to seduce... no one? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena stood stock-still for a few seconds, mouth hanging open before she roused herself to action. Apollo was on his feet, trying to explain to his ex-associate what was going on, but before he could think of anything, Athena was already pushing him to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait! I can explain!\" he managed to get out while being propelled by the surprisingly strong redhead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really sorry, but whether you were trying to seduce Mr. Wright or m-me,\" A red flush coloured her tired face. \"I really don't have time for this.

She looked him up and down, and just as quickly whisked him back inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat Apollo down on the couch, fixed him with a stern glare, and said: \"Alright, either you're gonna give me the name of your plastic surgeon, or I'm throwing you out of here on your <i>culo</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><div align=\"center\">~~One harried explanation later~~</div><br>\r\n</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's basically the size of it.\" Apollo finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena's mouth was hanging wide open. \"Whoa.\" She opened and shut it a number of times, flailing her arms around, trying to find the words. \"I never thought magic was <b>real</b>! I mean, I always thought Trucy had some <i>je n'ais se quoi</i> but making <b>you</b> into <b>this</b>?\" She gestured vaguely at Apollo's ample chest, of which he was now keenly aware. He covered it with his arms in embarrassment. \"And your lipstick! It's <b><i>Red Like Roses</i></b>! You could wait in lines for days at Phesora and not get a single tube, and you got it for free! This magic coin is one hell of a fashionista. And...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo tuned her out for a bit. Athena always rambled when she was excited, and she'd run out of steam in a minute or five. What he really needed to think about was that impromptu magic show he put on. Why did he have the routine down pat after one rehearsal? And why did it feel so <i>good</i>? He quickly looked at his new form. A chest that already was a bit of a strain on his shoulders, a bottom that was like a heart shaped pillow, and long legs that made up half of his new form. He'd certainly look at a girl like this. So why did he <i>want</i> to be looked at? It wasn't some kind of burning fire consuming his thoughts, but it just felt <b>nice</b>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, Justice, snap outta it.\" He was shocked out of his musing by Athena's fingers snapping in front of his face. \"It doesn't matter whether you're dorky old Apollo or this knockout, all that matters is that you're finally back, and we're gonna celebrate.\" Athena affixed a mischievous smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-where are we going?\" Apollo stammered out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my dear, sweet Apollo.\" Athena teased. \"_____________.\"</span></div></div>",

I forgot you were coming today!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horned attorney returned the hug with a bright smile, then looked around, showing her his annoyance. \"So, where's everyone else?\" It wasn't like he would necessarily hate waiting to see Mr. Wright until later, but he had been excited to spend some time with Trucy. After all, she was probably the person she felt the closest to out of everyone in the office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, they're at Trucy's magic show, at the Wonder Bar. Buuuutttt...\" she said, elongating the last word and she turned around, shuffled through some junk on her desk, then pulled out a metal necklace, one very similar looking to her own Widget. \"I wanted to show you this!

The witness in the trial was some bellboy, one insignificant enough that his name wasn't even listed. As his testimony started, Apollo was stunned as he actually could hear the man's emotions as he spoke. Was this what is was always like for Athena? It was almost difficult to tell where the witness's emotions ended and Apollo's began. He was clearly nervous, unaccustomed to being in court, and just as Apollo could begin hearing notes of happiness towards another witness, the changes began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hair changed first, the color lightening and the follicles working overtime, lengthening his hair out. Apollo's trademark horns were swept back, and the hair pullet itself together into a side ponytail just as his bangs adapted into the same wave as the coworker sitting next to him, completely unaware of what was happening to the man beside her. His boyish face feminized, his Adam's apple disappeared, and it wasn't difficult for his thin from to change just enough to be recognizably that of a woman, though an especially physical one. He became stronger, his arms and legs getting added muscle and definition, and his thighs expanded out with a supple layer of fat to make him all the prettier. His ass grew into something shapely and his chest grew two reasonably sized breasts. Just as his cock and balls withdrew inside, becoming Apollo's pussy and womb, his clothes began to change as well, the reds replaced with yellows. When all was said and done, Apollo looked exactly like Athena Cykes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the testimony ended, they both took off the headphones, Apollo still marveling at being able to experience her ability first hand, when they both realized what had happened. \"Apollo! You're...me!\" Athena exclaimed, amazed to be seeing a complete copy of herself. Apollo himself didn't know what to think, not as knowledge of psychology, traumatic memories that weren't his own, and fluency in several new languages flooded his brain.</span></div></div>",

An impish smirk made its way onto his face. \"You started five years too late to be following his cases, <i>junior associate.</i>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena flicked him on the (large) forehead, grinning ruefully. \"I'm gonna go get some other cases of his and some equipment in the back \u2014 you just load up the program, desk jockey!\" Emphasizing the last part with a playful poke to the chest, she returned into the clutter of boxes in the back, with a few crashes and muttered curses betraying her presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo, with some fiddling, managed to boot up the old laptop \u2014 and gave a start when the fancy U.I. of an unfamiliar program flashed onto the screen, accompanied with a familiar voice. <span class=\"cbgreen\">Hello, and welcome to Twidget v 0.1.2c, programmed by the <b>beautiful genius</b>, Athena Cykes!</span><br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"You should be careful if you ever put this on the market,\" Apollo shouted into the storage space. \"You could be sued for false advertisement!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA frizzy head indignantly poked out of the storage room. \"At least I'm prettier than you, Polly-boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo chuckled to himself. This playful banter was something he didn't quite get in Khura'in, most of the people treating him delicately, what with being a rare new creature introduced into their midst \u2014 a defense attorney. It was nice to joke around with a person face-to-face, not through a video call. He clicked the surprisingly intuitive interface and brought up the file labeled PA-6 \u2014 The State of California v. Maya Fey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body behind Athena's head managed to extricate itself from the sardine tin that was the storage space. \"Behold the fruit of...\" She counted some unknown sum on her fingers. \"Forty-fou\u2014 wait, forgot about Daylight Savings Time \u2014 Forty-five straight hours of work! Managed to make it look all pretty, too.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo gave a whistle of admiration. Fussing about with the new device, he asked, \"So, can I just wear it around my neck, or is this some kind of weird circlet?\" As he fiddled with it, the golden coin in his breast pocket shuddered so softly, it was imperceptible to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena shook her head no, before producing two pairs of bulky headphones with a manic gleam in her eye. \"Just a necklace, but we gotta wear these hi-def headphones. They're all synced up already, so we can start the test right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat across from each other in the twin red couches, headphones resting around their necks. \"If there's any weird feedback, just give a shout, Pollo. Don't want to ruin those eardrums of yours.\" Apollo gave a hesitant nod and strapped on his headphones in time with Athena. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two closed their eyes listening to the case, Athena to focus, and Apollo to <i>feel</i>. He practically knew all of Mr. Wright's cases by heart, but this would be a new experience. He had experienced the nervous rush of ripping a perjurer's testimony apart, but <i>feeling</i> that would be new, as well as the feelings of career criminals. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe judge spoke. Mr. Wright and Mr. Edgeworth spoke in turn. Then the first witness stepped up to the stand and the ride began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo had never looked into April May \u2014 except for the few blushes and embarrassed cough upon seeing her in the videos \u2014 but he was learning more about her than anyone else had for a long time. She was smarter than people gave her credit for \u2014 though not by a lot. All of her testimony was accompanied with a burst of fear, her not being sure if the statements 'stuck'. She wasn't very confident in her words \u2014 reserving her pride for a more <i>somatic</i> aspect of herself. Every giggle and wiggle she let loose was carefully calculated, each with a small twitter of joy when a glance lingered for too long. She couldn't have told you the name of the governor, but she could wrap someone around her little finger with her somehow sensual confusion. Apollo may not have liked her \u2014 it was hard to, knowing her role in this case, but he <i>understood</i> her, and that was good enough for the coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt started on his knee, a small pinprick of lily-white skin amidst the otherwise tanned skin. And, impelled by the will of the coin, it spread, crawling up and down his leg, spreading the color across his entire body, along with a new texture to his skin, kept soft by a strict regimen of moisturizer and beauty products. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next step likewise started on his legs, condensing fat and muscle into a new shape, pumping fat to round out every part, leaving no sharp edges, but sufficient muscle to prevent dimpling of any kind. It reached further up, first sucking his 'equipment' into a feminine fold, then set upon its next task, gathering skin and flesh for the new derriere. And so it was sculpted by the invisible hands of the coin, the hips slowly jutting outwards, and the flesh of the buttocks becoming <i>denser</i>, more cushioned, enough to protrude, but not enough to sag. It hugged the seat of Apollo's pants, practically sealing itself against the cloth. Following this, the core of his body compacted, causing a small shortness of breath that he attributed to Miss May's own excitement. His waist was combed inwards, causing an amusing juxtaposition of his new lower body filling every ounce of his pants, but his own waistband not even reaching his new feminine core. His arms lost mass, the fingers thinning, and the upper and lower arms narrowing as well. His shoulder cinched inwards as if in a vice, going completely unnoticed by the entranced Apollo, with his neck following suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe coin went to work on his face, tightening his chin into a softly rounded point, along with his nose. Apollo licked his lips nervously, April May being cornered in her testimony, the labial flesh plumping a moment after the tongue ran across it, and the small coating of saliva becoming thick, waxy, lipstick. His sockets widened along with his eyes, the lashes surrounding them lengthening visibly, and the thick bushy brows thinning in turn before an explosion of pink hair colored his scalp and brows, stopping just at neck length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Miss May's pride decided to make itself manifest on Apollo. It started with two pinpricks of fat, slowly forming behind his own pecs, kneading itself outwards, gaining flesh and mass, enough to lift his shirt from his midsection entirely. But that was not enough, the fat flowing into the new bags until they settled with a small satisfied jiggle, pressed into discs by the restrictive shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis clothes underwent the next transmogrification, his tie unraveling itself and sneaking its way down the entranced Apollo's shirt, forming something that was <i>like</i> a bra, but possessed too little fabric to be classified as one. It could push its contents up, but did nothing to prevent movement, setting its motile substance quivering at the slightest provocation. His clothes lightened and split at the chest and leg, exposing the soft pale flesh of breasts and thigh. Apollo, sensing the new change in temperature, shivered and crossed his legs, neither noticing the new soft smoothness of his legs or the shake of his boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis spine softly shortened and curved, putting his wide new chest and bum on display, and certain synapses connected and sparked in his head, telling him how to tease, flirt, and toy with those who were drawn to him. How to lure them in and have them 'take the bait'. Of unconscious movements to put assets on display, and just as quickly whip them away, to whet the appetite. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo and Athena were shocked out of their reverie by the scream of Miss May on the recording, just as the coin tightly nestled itself between his new 'funbags' as April would have called them. Athena blinked once or twice, her eyes hazy from being closed for so long. Why was Apollo so... pink? Rubbing her eyes, she cleared her murky vision, and dropped her mouth in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" said Apollo, a second before his breathy voice caused him to take inventory of his new self. He looked straight down, into the grand canyon of his upper torso, paled, then let out one of the highest screams that the Wright Anything Agency had heard, to the dismay of Athena<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"What... How... I'm...\" He stuttered, pretty mouth tightened into a pink circle of shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena, having recovered from the aural trauma, pointed at the screen. \"Y-you're that pink girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo directed his gaze away from his newly painted fingernails to the laptop. He took a moment to process the new information and then...</span></div></div>",

Would he ever be able to find this brand of lipstick again? All these thoughts and more swirled through his head, simultaneous and conflicting and successive. This clamor was so overwhelming, that when Athena poked him on the shoulder and asked, \"You okay?\" It all came out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena had no idea what had happened, so the girl-she-thought-was-Apollo's outburst was surprising, to say the least. After the newly pink lawyer had spouted out a list of increasingly desperate questions \u2014  one of which was about her new shoes, oddly enough \u2014 he collapsed into her arms, sobbing. The next fifteen minutes consisted of comforting the curled up mass of pink on the couch, mostly through soothing pats and whispered assurances that everything was going to be alright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Apollo sat up on the couch, cleared his throat, and hugged Athena. ('<i>I can't believe he has bigger boobs than me now</i>', she thought, the offending objects tightly pressed against her.) \"Thanks, 'Thena.\" he said plaintively. He danced a pink nail around his equally pink lips, trying to think of what to say. \"I know that this little guy,\" He fished Twidget from its comfortable lodging in his chest. \"Prob'ly had something to do with... this.\" Apollo pointed at himself, finger unintentionally trained at his large new assets. \"So I was thinking that all we need to do is play some recordings of me!\" He finished, with a bright smile. He grimaced for a second and shook his head, pink tresses fanning out. When he opened his eyes again, they seemed... clearer. \"Sorry, Athena, head's doing weird things to me.\" He noticed Athena fidgeting around a bit. \"...Whats up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAthena gulped and gave Apollo the bad news. \"I requisitioned court recordings of your cases, but they're going to be here in three days. We just have Phoenix's cuz he made copies of them a long time ago.\" Apollo's left eye twitched involuntarily. Seeing this, Athena quickly went into damage control. \"But there's still stuff we can do! We could ________!\" To her surprise, at her suggestion, Apollo giggled and nodded, a slightly vacant look on his face. Looks like they had plans for the weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She'd been trying to get Trucy or Pearl to go with her, but Trucy wasn't into that sort of thing and Pearl didn't feel comfortable with the idea. Apollo himself wouldn't normally be too interested in the idea either, but when Athena brought it up to him, he agreed immediately. They took a bus over to the building, House of the Rising Steam, and after paying were quickly separated from each other for individual massages. Suddenly all by himself in a small room with a massage table in the middle, Apollo hesitantly took off April May's clothes until he was stark naked and, without looking at his goods any more than he absolutely needed to, wrapped up his chest and hips with a towel each, before laying on the table face down and waiting for the masseuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft alone with nothing but his thoughts, Apollo tried to do a little self-reflection. It was kind of difficult, because a large part of him wanted to just relax and not think, probably the April part of him, and even his more true-to-self mind couldn't deny he needed it. Apollo had always been a tense guy, and he was on vacation. Suddenly, the door opened and someone walked in. Apollo's face was still in the hole in the table, staring at the floor, so he didn't know who this person was. \"Well, well, well,\" came a rich masculine baritone, unfamiliar but quite pleasing to Apollo's ears. \"It's not every day I get to lay my hands on a work of art like this. Let's get started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost women Apollo knew would have blushed at flirts like that, but Apollo just grinned. After all, he knew what the guy was saying was true: his body was a work of art, and a sexy one at that. The massage started in the middle of Apollo's back, the man's firm and rough hand using a variety of techniques as he worked. As it continued, Apollo's mind got more and more hazy, and he barely noticed when the masseuse reached his butt. Apollo was no expect on massages, but he was pretty sure this guy wasn't supposed to cup and grope his ass in addition to the usual massage tricks. Not that Apollo was complaining. Normally, some guy manhandling him like this would make him feel very awkward and concerned, but he was so relaxed, so out of it, that he just enjoyed the sensual feeling of a man explored his large, soft ass. The guy never said a worn when he was done, and Apollo was so dizzy-headed that he didn't notice he was alone, that the massage had stopped, for several minutes. When he rose from the table, stretching slightly, he felt just as home in this woman's body as he had in his normal one, and he walked languidly into the next room to find out what the next activity was with a smile on his pouty lips.</span></div></div>",

Once he was alone in a new room, all that had managed to stick was that it was a mud bath and he'd need to be naked for it. Sure enough, in the middle of the room, was an large basin inlaid to the floor, filled with some sort of mineral mud. Apollo thought it was a little gross, but if it was supposed to help his skin, he couldn't help but try it. As he stripped once more, this time not even trying to avoid looking at his pink-haired bush between his legs or his succulent breasts, it didn't occur to him that he wasn't going to be living in this body long enough to make a difference how he treated his skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce nude and ready, Apollo slowly immersed himself in the mud, which was at a perfectly warm temperature: not at all cold but not hot either. Once his was down to his neck, able to sit on a small ledge on the inside of the tub, he closed his eyes and relaxed. The mud felt great on his soft skin, and he wondered if it would feel as good in his old body, though he doubted it. So entranced by the relaxing warmness, Apollo didn't hear the door open as someone else entered, stripped, and got into the tub with her. As a second body settled into the mud, the mud level rose and Apollo felt it, opening his eyes to find a man who looked like a professional athlete, muscular with a chisled face and perfectly coifed hair, leering at him. \"What, didn't you know these are unisex?\" he asked her. Apollo stared at the man, suddenly conflicted. Part of him wanted to run away, get dressed, and leave the spa. The other wanted to stay and see where this went.</span></div></div>",

An hour or two ago, something like that would have shocked and appalled him. Now, it was just a tease towards what he wanted. It was only a brief exchange of lips, and he continued, \"This is your first time then? Good. You know they won't be back to check on us for another hour, or even more if we request it? They're very...discreet.\" Then he drew forward even more, his erection pressing up against Apollo's leg, and they started kissing in earnest. There was nothing romantic in it: they let passion rule their bodies and came as close as possible, making out so hard that it seemed as though they wouldn't be satisfied until they occupied the same space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they finally came up for air, so to speak, the man rubbing one of Apollo's breasts while Apollo stroked his cock, feeling it's shape and size with satisfaction, Apollo started to say, \"My name is A-\" But the man put a finger to his lips, and he understood: no names. There was no need for them here. Instead, Apollo smiled out of pure delight and leaned against the wall, opening his legs for the stranger. \"Fuck me.\" It was an invitation the man couldn't deny, and as he filled Apollo up the entire world fell into place. Right then, at that moment, there was no Apollo Justice. That person had disappeared in the Wright Anything Agency hours ago. No, she was April May, and she was here to fuck. After they enjoyed themselves for a while as they were, April decided to change it up. \"Back off,\" she whispered, her voice full of lust, and while it was almost physically painful to be empty after truly knowing what it was like to be full, it was worth it so she could turn around and bend over, presenting her bubble butt to the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhoever this guy was, he didn't have to be told twice. Before April knew it, she was full once again with the man's dirty hands holding onto and squeezing her mud-covered ass. \"I've gotta say,\" he said between thrusts, \"You're quite the slut, even for this place.\" Even as she heard the words, April knew it was true. She was a slut, and she loved it. The two fucked more after that for quite a while, changing positions or backing off as needed, until eventually the man came all over April's face. She almost laughed as it happened: an actual facial, and in a spa! Of course, once he had cum, the man couldn't leave fast enough. Typical. April looked back at her own previous life as Apollo with scorn. Men were so easy to charm, so easy to take.</span></div></div>",

Money, gifts, their cocks, it was all hers. When the attendant finally entered and helped April clean up, there was no longer a doubt in her mind: she wanted to stay April for at least a week, maybe forever. Apparently the next, and last, part of their treatment was manicures and pedicures with Athena. April entered first, lying down and extending her arms and feet so they could be made even more wonderful. When her friend finally entered, her face was as red as a tomato. Unable to help herself, April asked, \"Have a good time?\" Athena's response was a mumble, completely inaudible. Putting one hand to her ear, she asked, \"A little louder?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was nice,\" was all Athena managed to squeak out before getting set up herself, and their nails started to be pampered. They were silent for a while, and just when April was getting ready to break the silence, Athena beat her to it. \"I...I didn't know this was that kind of place. I'm really sorry Apollo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all April could do not to roll her eyes. \"Athena, dear, there's no need for a 'sorry'. I enjoyed myself too.\" Athena gasped, but April continued regardless. \"I'm leaning into it now: I am April May, complete slut and loving it!

Back in Europe, she'd been able to drink is most countries.\"Stupid US drinking laws...\" she mumbled under her breath. Just then, two guys came up to them.

Apollo feebly struggled, not because he thought he could overpower the energetic redhead, but as a small show of defiance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surprise!\" said Athena, a toothy grin on her face. \"We got tickets in the mail from that Klavier friend of yours, and we thought we'd surprise you with a concert for your first day back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say that we're friendly rivals at <i>best</i>...\" Apollo groused.

Apollo unconsciously took advantage and began to shimmy his legs and shake his now expanding hips.

It seemed there were some things not even magic could change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo with his eyes still closed and having not yet noticed his changes kept getting more and more wild in his dancing, after all he was loving this music more and more, until he found that he had bumped into someone.

With his cocky/charming smile he told the crowd his plan.  \"Ya my musical family, it is a song from the heart, a song of love.  But ze words would just be words unless I had someone to sing them to.  Do I have any volunteers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a near riot in the crowd as thousands of excited fan girl's tried to get Klavier's attention so he could serenade them with a love song just for them.  But once again the booming female voice from the back area stood out, Klavier made eye contact with the lovely young woman clad in Gavinner's garb with wonderful brown hair that had two odd horn shapes in the front that reminded him of a certain someone.  Klavier made his decision, there was something special about this girl, something magical even and he was drawn to her.  With an air of confidence, Klavier made his way towards Trucy's crew where the brown haired girl was waiting.  He smiled his million dollar smile that was on posters and merchandise world wide and offered his hand to the girl.  Instantly the girl screened and shattered a few ear drums of the security guards around her.  Klavier brought the girl out on the stage onto one half of the giant scales of justice prop.  \"What is your name my liebling?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My friends call me Polly sometimes.\"  Apollo said unable to believe this, Klavier knew him, why was he asking his name?  And why was he so excited to see him, to be talking to him.  Klavier usually was someone Apollo tried to avoid at all cost, but now he couldn't look away, he loved his music so much.  And what was he saying earlier?  He was going to sing a special song to a special someone?  Was that him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ya Polly, I want you to take my hands, look me in the eyes, and enjoy the ride.\"  Klavier winked as the band began to play and the scales of justice began to rise, and Klavier began to sing.  Apollo was entranced by his words, they were the words of a man talking to the woman he loved, the woman he wanted to marry.  And nothing, not the law, not the earth, not heaven nor hell would break their powerful bond.  Apollo was thrilled to be getting a personal moment during a Gavinner's concert, after all, he was their newest biggest fan.  But Apollo wondered why Klavier picked him instead of a girl?</span></div></div>",

The attention was nice, but crowds like this got annoying after a while. Some girl saw him when he was staking out Okumura Foods and sent out an alert to the 'Akechi Fan Club '<span class=\"clred\"><i>All it takes are a few fake cases and the sheep are following me around like I'm holding hay!</i></span>' A voice laughed in the back of his head. Goro quickly silenced it \u2014 this was a time to be the Detective Prince, not the Black Knight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\" A voice quavered from the front of the store. Akechi looked askance at the source \u2014 he hadn't actually wanted to talk to anyone today, so <i>this</i> was certainly inconvenient. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, he put on his most winning smile and approached the counter. \"Hello there. My apologies, I was trying to hide, and your stor\u2014\" He stopped, realizing how suspicious he sounded. He quickly backpedaled. \"Ah, not in any criminal sense, I assure you. Just a horde of fans. You see, I'm \u2014.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goro Akechi.\" The old man finished, to Akechi's mild annoyance. '<span class=\"clred\"><i>YOU THINK YOU CAN INTERRUPT ME, YOU DODDERING FOSSIL!</i></span>', The Knight in his head screamed, just in time for Akechi to shove it back down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw you on the television.\" The storekeep grasped Akechi's gloved hands with his quavering pair. \"Y-You don't realize how much you've done for me... For this country!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<span class=\"clred\"><i>That's right old fool, lick my boots. It's what you pawns are best at, anyways.</i></span>' For once, Akechi let the Knight stay around for a bit. He did have a point this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man continued, tears in his eyes. \"M-my son. He was on the train that crashed in April.\" Akechi's smile dropped quickly. The Knight was silent.  <font class=\"size25\" style=\"\">\"And to think you found the man who did it.</font> <font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">It's heroes like you that let an old man me know</font> <font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">that our country is in good hands.\"</font> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkechi could barely recall the following ten minutes. They were vague shapes in his head \u2014 he managed to fix his smile back on his face, the old man cried for some time, and said more things to him. Akechi smiled and nodded, but everything that came out of the man's mouth sounded like  static. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe old man folded something into his hands, and Akechi politely opened the door, waved goodbye, and promptly vomited into the nearby trash can. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe feebly looked at what the old man gave him.

Akechi shoved it into his pockets without a second thought and began the trek home, flipping the barely-used hood over his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople who looked at him on his way back didn't see a gallant Prince or a fierce Knight.

It shone bright enough to stop his weeping, bright enough to match the sun outside, bright enough to send everything into darkness in its absence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything that surrounded him was nothing. There was no point of reference, no way to get your bearings, simply an absence. There was nothing to see, touch, smell, hear. All that there was was an insurmountable feeling of <i>pressure</i>. No actual substance to press down on you, but the anechoic <b>nothing</b> there to smother all sense. He tried to breathe, but no air moved. It remained still. He remained still. All was still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as rapidly as the void had materialized, so did something else. The color was a welcome change from nothing at all, and Akechi greedily drank it all in. The room was small, but emanated a sense of coziness, not claustrophobia. The walls, ceiling, and floor were all made of a plush blue material. And oddest of all, a short squat man with a long hooked nose sat in the center. Akechi recognized the man almost immediately and went to shout \u2014 but nothing came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgor gave a start. \"Oh!\" The voice that came out was certainly not the deep, <i>unsettling</i> rumble that Akechi was used to, but was a reedy almost-whisper that held a grandfatherly tone to it. Igor cleared his throat. \"Pardon me, I haven't much for visitors ever since my rival proved a most poor sport.\" He chuckled to himself, before looking left and right, as if for someone. \"I am sure that he shall meet the same fate as countless others have before him, but for now, we must do with minimal accouterments. Now, what brings you to this room?\" He did not wait for a response but merely squinted his eyes for a second, before widening them in surprise. \"Oh my. The pawn of my rival, pulled across time and space by...\" He rubbed his chin in contemplation. \"A third party, shall we say. But we must not neglect your own dissatisfaction that led you down this twisted path. A tragedy indeed...\" He trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkechi fumed in the absent space where he maybe-resided. Igor raised a conciliatory hand. \"I do not mean to assume your past nor struggles, Guest, I merely was making my own observations. But I do have something to offer you. It is a chance to walk a new path, paved by your own choices, not that of powers that conspire to toss you aside like a broken plaything. Would you accept this deal, Guest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoro raised the space where his eyebrows might occupy. Did he deserve a second chance? Probably not, he had killed more people than anyone else in Shido's twisted conspiracy \u2014 something about this room promoted self-honesty, apparently. '<i>But that wasn't the question, was it?</i>' Akechi mused. He may not deserve it, but he sure as hell <i><b>wanted</b></i> it, and that would be good enough for now. He nodded his not-head, at which Igor's grin grew slightly wider for a second. \"Lovely. Even though it may interfere with the game between my rival and myself, I am truly honored to place another piece on the board. I am afraid that this may be the last meeting you have with me or my ilk. You may not be a Wild Card anymore, but you are certainly still a player.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgor conjured a card, one with an image of an angel pouring water, and held it in his hand. As swiftly as he materialized it, he crushed it in his hand, and wafted the dust towards the Akechi-space. And then everything went black, save that of Igor's final statement to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~You truly were a remarkable guest.~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe darkness dissipated much faster than it did beforehand, leaving Akechi gasping. He woke up  a bed, covered with a thick comforter. His eyes flicked left to right, his heart beating like a hammer. The room was certainly different, its walls smaller than before, and the floor generally disheveled. It seemed to be a studio apartment, a massive downgrade from his previous penthouse. '<i>It doesn't matter as long as it's different.</i>' He repeated over and over again in his head. His hope spiked when he saw a tearaway calendar on the far wall. He <b><i>needed</i></b> to see if it wasn't too late, if Shido wasn't. His scramble to the wall was abruptly stopped when all of his weight redistributed itself incredibly oddly. In short, he fell flat on his ass. Which was a lot softer than normal. And the liquid sloshing on his chest was weird too. His mad rush for the wall was exchanged for a mad rush to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkechi poked and prodded in mounting horror at various parts. His lips were larger, his eyelashes longer, his hair darker and silky smooth. Everything that wasn't a complete change was just different enough to be disconcerting. Even moving was weird.  Everything just had a new <i>softness</i> to it that wasn't there before. He didn't even want to look at his chest, which was well enough concealed by a large baggy t-shirt, <span class=\"cviolet\">used as makeshift pajamas.</span> He froze. How did he know that? Was he losing his mind? Akechi took a deep breath in, and tried to collect himself. He was Goro Akechi, sent back  (<span class=\"cviolet\">Sadayo Kawakami</span>) in time by some weird \u2014 there it was again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe prodded at the new voice in the back of his head \u2014 mostly used to balancing the Prince and the Knight, this type of one was new. It didn't provide 'commentary', like the always-angry Knight, but it also wasn't some other mask to wear, like the Prince was. What he quickly found out about it (to his great relief) was that it wasn't some angry parasite trying to subsume him. It was like a teacher, there to guide him through the new unfamiliar processes of his new life.  With a bit of prodding and experimenting, he found out who he was in this brave new world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cviolet\">You're a teacher at Shujin Academy. You're a Japanese teacher, and you try to stay away from Kamoshida, because...</span> The voice faded into static at this point, at couldn't be pressed any more. <span class=\"cviolet\">You work a part time job to pay the bills, and you CANNOT get close to your students. Not again.</span> No further questioning could press this point either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut more importantly than some minor troubles, Akechi learned something vital. It was April 9th, and he would have to sit in on the orientation of a transfer student tomorrow. If he pressed deeper, the voice gave him lesson plan upon lesson plan, the flood of which nearly overwhelmed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he also found out was that the voice could also serve as a handy autopilot for the things he <i>absolutely</i> had no idea to do. If he just kept his head up and let his mind go blank, he could have the voice put on a bra without having to look at the new globes on his chest, take a shower without him having to actually <i>touch</i> all of his... 'new parts'. It could even get dressed without his input! All in all, it was a small favor he was incredibly thankful for. '<i>Thank God I don't have to deal with all of this shit at once.</i>' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the shit he <i><b>did</b></i> have to deal with was immediate as it was important. What would he do next?</span></div></div>",

Barney's apartment was bright and colorful, while still being just as ostentatious and over-the-top, with pink and yellow replacing the previously dominant darker colors. What was really different was, standing in Barney's place was a woman. She had long blonde hair, a gorgeous face with plump lips and expertly applied make-up, large breasts that were barely contained in the tank top she was wearing, a tight stomach shown off with the rest of her midriff, an ass that could clearly be seen through the boy shorts she had on, and legs that were completely free of hair and perfectly toned while still looking soft and curvy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, a second later, they all knew who she was. This was Bailey Stinson, though when she was pulling her 'Bimbo Play', she went by Bunny. She'd been their friend for years, and had been with more men than anyone they knew. She often came off as kind of dumb or eccentric, but once they'd gotten to know her they had realized it was all a calculated act, one meant to lure in as many guys as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, they still remembered Barney, and the conflicting sets of memories were definitely weird. Bailey smiled at them all, showing off her perfect pearly white teeth. \"See! I'll be Bailey for a week, and by the end of it if any of you feel like I'm a 'slut' or think of me as more gross than guy me, I'll owe Lily five hundred bucks!\"</span></div></div>",

She was arrogant to the extreme, but she was the best, right? The coin he carried in a pocket began to glow brightly, and in an instant Sokka was someone completely different. He was a young woman of around the same age, late teen years approaching true adulthood, with an athletic build that emphasized combat over beauty. His skin was the same shade of Water Tribe brown, but far smoother and more well-kempt than it had been before. More than his gender, Sokka knew the life he had just been granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough not technically royalty, Sorra of the Water Tribe enjoyed being called a princess. The most powerful waterbender in the last hundred years, Sorra outshine her sister Katara in both skill and beauty, though even Sorra herself knew her sister's social skills were useful on occasion. With a tactical mind and the surety of genius, Sorra was ecstatic to take the fight to the Fire Nation. Sokka shook his head, trying to sort out how different his life was now, and yet he, she, could feel the water in a nearby stream the same way she could feel her own arm, as if it was an extension of who she was. Was this what bending was like? It was difficult not to laugh, and Sokka wasn't even sure why she was stopping herself. She was now perfection incarnate!</span></div></div>",

The two were complete contrasts in every way: different personalities, different pasts, different hard light body projections. Sometimes she made Pearl want to tear her hair out, but Pearl couldn't deny that she admired the Gen. Sometimes, if she was being completely honest with herself she often wondered if being made as a lowly Amethyst, even a malformed short one, would have been a better life than being a Pearl, traded from owner to owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Pearl's immense surprise, her gem began glowing softly, and no one saw as the world around her reformed, her gem changing shape, hue, and classification. When the glow died down, Pearl found the world was looking much larger, and looking down she saw breasts much larger than usual, her form's color now a dark purple, and she was now wearing the T-shirt of a human band and what Pearl was told were called 'booty shorts'. The clothing was tight enough to show off Pearl's now pudgy stomach and thick thighs and ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn entire lifetime of new memories spawned in Pearl's mind: she was now Thyst, a gem made from the same kindergarten as Amy, and with the same defect. A little more smart and cautious than her sister, Thyst was still crude, rude, and carefree. She'd fallen in love with Rose Quartz, and was devastated by her loss but had made up for it by mothering Steven more than anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPearl shook her head, standing on the sidewalk trying to figure out the two lives in her head, when the Crystal Gems turned back to look at her, confused. \"Thyst?

But slowly that wonder faded away. Instead, she became more interested in the argument the two gems near her were having. Peridot was trying to explain the plot of some episode of a human television program, but Amy was interrupting her with inane questions and comments at every turn. Before, Pearl may have been confused as to why Amy was acting this way, but Thyst understood that it was a joke to rile up Peridot. Unable to stop herself, Thyst joined in and it became even more hilarious. Pearl didn't laugh very often, but Thyst it seemed would chortle at nearly anything, and she couldn't deny it was fun.

J Jonah Jameson, Peter's boss, was calling him, most likely about getting pictures of Spider-Man 'menacing innocent businessmen' or something. Scared to let it go to voicemail, MJ picked up the phone and answered the call without thinking. \"Parker!\" came the gruff sound of Jameson's voice. \"The photographer for Fisk's trial came down with something, cancer I think. Anyway, I need you at the courthouse yesterday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervous, MJ lowered the pitch of her voice a few octaves and answered quickly, \"Uh, yes sir, Mr. Jameson sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJameson didn't hang up. Instead the call continued, a silence hanging in the air that made MJ's heart almost stop. If he figured out this was her, and that Peter was somewhere else, he might get suspicious. \"Is that really you, Parker? Your voice sounds different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane cleared her throat, and unbeknownst to her the vocal chords in it reconfigured into an exact match of Peter Parker's. \"Sorry about that, sir, I had a frog in my throat.\" Mary Jane was impressed by how much better her impression had gotten, not noticing that it was now perfect, or that the perspective of the room was subtly changing as she grew taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waited tensely, starting to feel her pants fit oddly as her legs lost their womanly curves and grew more muscular. \"That's one hell of a frog!\" MJ let out a sigh of relief, one that also expanded her waist a little, losing her overall hourglass shape and gaining a six pack in the process. \"By the way, I wanted to talk to you about those pictures of the wall-crawler from yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore than anything else, Mary Jane wanted the call to end, both to save her the stress and so she could investigate the odd feelings she was getting, which were getting stranger as her breasts lost themselves in a sea of muscle as her shoulders widened and her pectorals replaced them. But she had to keep her cover up. \"Sure, what's the issue, JJ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a grunt on the other end, clearly of annoyance at the nickname, and MJ couldn't help snickering under her breath as her arms became larger and stronger, her hands and fingers losing their dainty softness. \"We published them because there wasn't much else to run, but I'm going to need more than the menace crawling on a brick wall! And the lighting was godawful!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary Jane had no knowledge of photography, aside what few bits of jargon she had picked up from Peter, but as her beautiful face morphed into that of her husband's, and her long red hair faded into his short brown curls, she somehow managed to come up with, \"Sorry about that, the flashlight I had with me was the wrong wattage, and I only barely managed to snap a few shots before he swung away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...Apology accepted! Now get to that trial, pronto!\" The call ended just as Mary Jane's womanly parts folded out into their masculine equivalents. Desperate to know what had happened, she ran to the bathroom to see Peter, wearing his usual clothes, staring back!</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, the coin she had been been idly holding in her hand began glowing with a brilliant radiance, and Harry watched in astonishment as his best friend changed completely. Where before was a plain teenage girl with frizzy brown hair, buck teeth, and little in the way of make-up or fashion sense, was now the kind of girl boys spoke of in whispers. Her long, blonde hair was only the hint of a wave, carrying a perfect combination of volume, bounce, and sheen. Her skin was almost supernaturally smooth and blemish-free, her lips plump and inviting, her teeth pearly white and straight. Despite the fashionable robes she was wearing, the girl's curves could not be contained lightly, the hint of bouncing breasts here and of supple thighs there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as if they both remembered something they had forgotten, new memories fell into their minds. She was Heirmoigne Grang\u00e9, a french transfer student who had been at Hogwarts since Harry's first year. Despite her Veela-borne beauty, she was a kind girl who ended up befriending Ron and Harry early on, and who he knew Ron had a crush on. She was the smartest witch in the class, while also drawing everyone's eyes and earning the jealousy of every other girl. Heirmoigne blinked her gorgeous eyes, looking down at her new body. \"Oh my,\" she said, only a slight accent to her speech.</span></div></div>",

After all, as much as she told herself that looks didn't matter and that her brain was all she needed, suddenly becoming an incredibly sexy woman wasn't something she could entirely dismiss. Still, this wasn't her life, and this coin was clearly some kind of Dark Magic artifact of some kind to cause this. \"Harry,\" she began, elongating the final vowel without even noticing it. \"Please, go and find Ron, then meet me back here. We need to find a way to fix all of this.\" Still somewhat transfixed by her newfound beauty, Harry nodded and dashed off, leaving Hermione in the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading off to find books regarding ancient artifacts, both evil and benign, it took a while before Hermione noticed she was swaying her hips far more than normal as she walked, sashaying in a way that felt natural but also naturally displayed her beauty. As she was reaching up to a high shelf to grab a thick tome, Hermione heard the sound of something falling to the floor, and turned around to see a group of seventh-year Hufflepuff boys looking at her, completely bewitched. Their eyes were drinking in her beauty, and there was something intoxicating about how it made her feel. Of course, intellectually she was quite annoyed, but it was hard to separate the feelings properly.</span></div></div>",

Anyway, it was the morning, and I was waiting for grasshopper to get out of school so we could work on her training more. 'What's that?' you may be asked, 'How does magic superstar Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden not having anything to do?' Well, first off, where did you learn my Name? And second of all, I'm kind of a boring guy. I was between cases, and trust me, I don't have a lot going on socially. With nothing else to keep my mind occupied, I went on a little walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople are too down on Chicago, if you ask me. Sure, it's dirty, and crowded, and the mob's got their fingers in way too many pies, but it's home. And, not three blocks from my hole-in-the-wall apartment, there was a thrift shop. It was a great place to find paperback books, my favorite hobby, and the owner's a swell guy. Just as I'd picked up a full load of books and was heading to the register, I saw a couple of old coins sitting on a shelf. My heart stopped for a second, but after I checked it was clear neither was an ancient Roman denarius I picked them up. They had inscriptions on them...Become What You Seek...Shape What You Were...they sounded magical to me, and with that in mind I reached out a little with my mystical senses, and quickly felt the thrum on some heavy duty mojo. I bought the coins and took them back home with me, before sitting down with my old pal Bob the Skull and asking him, \"What in the hell are these?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of inspection and indignant snarking, the knowledge spirit living in the skull turning its orange eyelights to me and replied, \"I don't know, boss.\" That threw me for a loop: Bob knew a <b>lot</b>, which meant these things were either really obscure or recently created. \"I can tell you this: there's nothing immediately dangerous waving a red flag at me, so I'd say experimenting with them is the best idea.\"</span></div></div>",

I have a lot of long days, and since it was looking like this might be the rare smooth sailing sort of afternoon, I felt like I had a date with <i>Pawn of Prophecy</i>. I slipped the coins into a pocket as I climbed the stairs into my apartment's living room and threw myself bodily onto my worn, comfy couch, let out a yawn, and began reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I didn't know at the time was that the coins I had slipped into my pocket, while not containing any ancient fallen angels, were the kind that paid attention to what the person owning them said and did. Words and actions have larger meaning in the magical community, especially to the person doing it. I was purposely shirking my duties as a wizard to relax and enjoy myself, and I knew it. It was the kind of behavior I associated with teenagers, who in my experience are all too quick to take the easy way out and put off what needs to be done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point in my life, the avatar of such actions had become my apprentice, the young Molly Carpenter. She was a good good who had made some bad choices, and I almost laughed to myself as I began the book, peering at the world map on the first page, that I was definitely making a Molly move. The coin, specifically the gold one, as I later found out, made some kind of psychic connection with its owner, and was activated whenever they did anything they consciously knew was outside of their usual behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll be honest, I was really engrossed in my book. So engrossed, in fact, that I didn't notice as my body began to change. It was only after the fact that I realized my height was truncated, my masculinity turned into femininity, breasts grown, booty acquired, clothing altered, and sex changed. About two chapters in, I shifted a little in my seat as I began to feel like the book was getting a little dull, and felt the bouncing and jiggling of the boobs on my chest. Moving the book to get a better angle, I looked and saw, clad in a stylish t-shirt and a bra, I had my very own breasts just sitting there. Looking further down, the jeans I'd had on had become some sort of leggings. Or jeggings? I don't know. Regardless, there I was, laying on the couch and suddenly a woman.</span></div></div>",

Bob the Skull didn't react at all, which was good considering I didn't look like myself, but in a breathy voice I snapped, \"Bob you bonehead, wake up! Not dangerous my ass!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what a sweet one it is, Harry,\" the spirit of intellect replied as his eyelights lit up once again, focusing lecherously at my new form. \"A complete transfiguration into a different human body, fascinating. Was it on accident, or were you secretly more feminine than you ever let me know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnger flared through me and before I could stop myself I reached out with one hand and shouted \"Forzare!\" A blast of pure kinetic energy shattered a mug filled with pencils sitting just next to Bob, and I hoped he understood exactly where the line was with me at that moment. Setting my dainty jaw tightly, I grumbled, \"I don't have any mirrors, Bob, so tell me what the damages are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cough came from the skull, which was pretty weird considering he didn't have lungs, and after a few seconds of looking at me he said, \"You're jailbait, Harry. You've got bodacious boobs, a thick ass, a gorgeous face, and it's clear to anyone looking at you that you aren't legal yet. Though I don't think most men will care.\" The thought of a man looking at me, getting hard with desire for my feminine form, came out of nowhere and to my surprise is felt good. Like being told you're a sex god kind of good. \"What exactly were you thinking about when this happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought about that, doing my best to shove any obtrusive, non-Harry thoughts into a box labeled \"DO NOT OPEN\", and realized something. \"I was putting off doing any experiments to relax and enjoy myself. I consciously knew I was putting off something necessary, and for a second I thought about Molly...that can't be it, can it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, Harry, I've got no clue.

Even if they believed me, which they might not, I'd never live down accidentally magicing myself into jailbait. Under self-imposed house arrest, I went to lay back down on the couch and read my book, but a few pages in I had to set it down. It was hard to concentrate on the words, it just felt like I had no energy to expend on anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt then hit me that I was in a teenage girl's body, an especially hot teenage girl's body, with boobs and everything. Not only that, but there wasn't any ethical dilemma that would have come if I was some kind of exact copy of someone else. I'll be honest: teenage hormones were flooding my brain at that point, and when combined with the remaining masculinity in my brain, it's pretty obvious what I did next.

I only found out a few months later that he'd thought I was another one of those young people in over their heads, staying at my place for safety while Harry Dresden, badass wizard, was out fighting evil. Losing control and taking me like that, even though he only bit off a small piece, was so shameful for him that he didn't want me to see him for quite a while. When I finally explained all the details, let me tell you he did not know how to handle that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, I didn't know any of that at the time, and my teenage heart was brusied by his sudden departure. What, was I just a quick suck, good for a blow and that was it? My burgeoning female pride was injured, and I quietly resolved to try and pretend that never happened as I got dressed and went back downstairs to the lab. Bob was eyeing me immediately, his eyelights showing quite a bit of interest. \"I heard some fun stuff happening up there, babe. I wouldn't expect you'd be so quick to lose that virginity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing on my inner Dresden, I gathered up what energy I still could and gave the skull a hard stare. \"One, I'm still Harry, Bob, and if you give me any more little nicknames I'm handing you to Mab. Two, my virginity in this body is intact, thank you very much. Three, don't ever ask me about what just happened. Four, give me some info on the coin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then, Herr Fuhrer, I think I've mostly figured out the enchantment on these coins.\" I was interested enough in what he had to say that I decided to ignore the Hitler joke. \"It seems that whenever a mortal is in possession of the coin, any choices they make with their Free Will are closely examined by the coin, and compared to their sense of self. If the person does something they relate in any way to a certain person or a stereotype about certain types of people, the coin transforms them into what they were thinking of, and it affects the mind as well.\" I'd already seen that in action myself. \"Conscious thought won't affect it either, it's entirely subconscious. If you want to change back, you'll need to do things that you think are stereotypically Harry Dresden.\"</span></div></div>",

In the end, I kept going back to my favorite place in the world to spend time, the home of the greatest beer in the world and a damn good steak sandwich. Not exactly in the mood to try and drive to MacAnally's, considering I was in the body of a teenager whose face didn't match my license, I decided to walk to the pub, which I sometimes did anyway when the weather was nice. I mean, it wasn't, but what's a girl to do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of my new sex, none of my clothes would fit me, so I was stuck in the skinny-jeans tank top combo that left my 'goods' on display for anyone willing to risk statutory. I got a few catcalls and comments, and I tried to feel upset at them, but something about this new persona apparently really liked being hit on like that. Once at the pub, I was happy even with the light air conditioning inside, as it proved quite the respite from the overwhelming heat outside. Brushing the sweaty bangs out from in front of my eyes, I told Mac, \"I'll have some of your beer and a steak sandwich.\" He didn't question me for an ID, which upon reflection made me wonder if the bartender somehow knew it was me. Before too long, I was drinking the finest alcohol on earth and chomping down on a delicious sandwich, hoping it would change me back.

As I would learn quite soon, my hair style changed, becoming one of those trendy new styles where one side of the head was buzzed down to next to nothing, the rest of it longer and more wild. An earring appeared in my right earlobe, which was suddenly pierced, and my clothes lost a lot of their mass as they became more skimpy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSee, as it turns out, the coin was hitting on the fact that, if I saw a teenage girl just walk into a pub and start drinking beer and eating a steak sandwich, I wouldn't think \"Hey, that's Harry Dresden in a girl's body!\".

Samantha's restrained tits spilled out into tiny bikini cups, hardly capable of hiding her nipples. Her belly oozed free void of any sort of concealment. Rebecca than looked behind to see her mother's one piece getting swallowed up by her two quaking butt cheeks until only a very thin string remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-Did your ass just eat your swimsuit?\" Rebecca quivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... don't .. know\" Samantha answered looking at her exposed body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrinkage of Samantha's swimwear confused the mother and daughter but equaling confusing was Samantha's total lack of modesty. Rebecca stood there witnessing her mild mannered mother standing in the open in a revealing micro bikini unperturbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um aren't you bothered by your revealing bikini. You've always hated displaying too much skin.\" Rebecca stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. I never would've worn something like this before. In fact the mere thought of being seen in something like this made me shiver. But oddly enough, I feel no shame right now. In fact I'm absolutely enjoying this.\" Samantha concluded her words with a lascivious smirk paired with a striking pose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that the other kids swam up the Samantha and Rebecca who...</span></div></div>",

The shopkeeper knows not their true value, and will happily give it away for a pittance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecome What You Seek\u201d: This gold coin, with its title inscribed on the surface, has a light mental enchantment on it, making those who take it want to keep it on their person at all times. That is nothing, however, compared to its true purpose. While having the coin with them, the users choices become something more: at moments that go against the way they normally act, they will physically and mentally transform to fit their action. The user will remember who they used to be, but as the actions stack up and the changes continue, users tend to prefer what they've become to what they were. However, at no point does reality change to fit their forms, with the exception of clothing changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShape What You Were\u201d: This silver coin, also with its title inscribed, has none of the mental compulsions of its sibling. Instead, were one to hold it and concentrate on a different way of living, something they could have done that they didn't, or any other kind of other life, reality will reshape to fit the wish. The user and those watching the change will keep their memories of the previous reality, but all others will never know how things once were. The person changed, usually physically and mentally, will over time begin to identify more and more with their new world and see their true past as more and more of a dream, knowing it was real but feeling distant from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGo as hard as you want, but please no making only one option and always leave the last option as \u201cSomething else\u201d or anything to that effect. Please also be aware I also object to content that is offensive in content or whose standards of grammar and spelling are under par. By offensive, I mean overtly and cruelly prejudiced content, incredibly violent content, and sexual content involving characters far below the age of consent. Offending content will be obliterated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdding substantively (250 words or more) to an existing storyline will give you gift points equal to your word count, so long as it does not violate previously mentioned rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to TFWright for the idea that inspired this interactive, namely the main plot of their hit visual novel \u201cPirate\u2019s Fate\u201d. It\u2019s on Steam, and if you like this sort of stuff you should definitely give it a look, maybe buy it.</td>",
