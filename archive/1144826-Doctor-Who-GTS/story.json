You have never been one to savor the moment. I am after all 650 years old. This old body needs a rest once and awhile from all that traveling about and besides, Madame Tussauds is too familiar. I did help her gather together her original models, or have I already told you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMany times, grandfather. Remember, I posed for her as Jeanne d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Arc.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, yes, I keep forgetting, but let us enjoy the ambience of where we are, shall we?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, grandfather, did you notice something odd about this place? Does it not feel almost like the TARDIS, larger on the inside than it is on the out?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNonsense, girl, no one else we know of outside of Gallifrey possesses that type of temporal technology. The chameleon circuit alone on such a craft to allow it to pose as a museum would have to be extremely powerful like that of a Mark IV at the very least.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know ours is just a barely functional type 40.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA fact I am painfully aware of, Susan!\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSorry, grandfather.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThough you may be right about one thing, something is amiss about this museum and its exhibits. There are 10 wax figures on display here and the first one looks remarkably like myself, if I may say so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a slight resemblance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHush, now! I know I am flattered, although I am somewhat perplexed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, grandfather, your reputation precedes you. Maybe it is on loan from Madame Tussauds.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat may very well be the case, though they likely would have to take it out of storage, and that seventh figure looks vaguely familiar, as well. I keep thinking of the Hand of Omega for some reason \u2500 oh, oh never mind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSeems like the game is afoot, grandfather.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou do know I gave that phrase to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, do you not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, grandfather, I was there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh.

Checking all the doors and windows it appeared they were all boarded up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is odd\u201d Ian said now trying the door, it turned and Ian Chesterton stepped out into a street, a very desert like street. All the houses were in a state of disrepair. \u201cCome and look at this Doctor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor went out to look, Barbara hesitated and watched Susan go upstairs to explore before joining Ian and the Doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Susan went upstairs she had a look in every room and had a quick look around. She took a few steps forward when something crunched underfoot. She took a step back and looked at what she had stepped upon. It looked like a tiny doll, she knelt down and picked up the thing, it felt clammy and almost real. It was a horrible doll that looked like someone dying of hunger.<br>\r\nSusan gasped and dropped the doll to the floor, it was actually a tiny human person<br>\r\nSusan turned and ran down the stairs looking for her grandfather to tell him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor, Ian and Barbara were outside in the twin suns, one was brighter than the other and they were both setting. They were outside for no more than a minute when they felt their skin start to feel dry. Then there was pain and all three screamed. The three looked around and saw that everything was starting to get bigger, or appear to get bigger. They were all shrinking!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three saw Susan framed in the door looking right at them. For some reason she was not shrinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay back Susan!\u201d the Doctor shouted as she watched the Doctor, Ian and Barbara shrink until she couldn\u2019t see them anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shadow moved  over the street, Susan could hear a tiny squeal for screaming that stopped once the suns had set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan emerged from the house and walked towards three tiny dolls standing in the middle of the road, three dolls that looked like Ian, Barbara and the Doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere we go again\u201d said Ian to the Doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh well, we have an advantage this time\u201d the Doctor said nodding behind Ian \u201cSusan hasn\u2019t been affected.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan turned to see an amazed looking Susan as tall as a 100ft story building walk towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrandfather, Ian, Barbara!\u201d she said in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSusan! You\u2019re normal\u201d Barbara shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSusan, get back!\u201d Ian shouted \u201cWhat got us might get you to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Ian\u201d the Doctor said \u201cI think we shrank because of the light from those suns, now that they have set we need not worry about the same happening to Susan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t hear you\u201d said the giantess. Very gently she laid her hands down on the ground for Ian, Barbara and the Doctor to climb on. Susan then stood up and raised her cupped hands up to her chest.

The next, the Doctor had gone from a white haired gentleman into a bohemian brunet. But life was change and Sarah Jane could accept that. Odd day aside, she was ready to get back out into the universe. If only the Doctor could resist making poor Harry Sullivan look like a fool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor.\" Sarah nudged as a warning before she doubled over, clutching at her stomach much to the worry of the two men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sarah?\" They both asked, rushing towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. I'm fine.\" She waved off before she stood upright. Instantly, she noticed something was very wrong, most notably that she was now level with both her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear.\" The Doctor gasped before he turned to Harry. \"Have I gotten shorter in my new regeneration? My second body was a bit shorter than normal I grant you but I don't think a physical change should take quite this long-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or do you maybe think that Sarah Jane is growing? The effects that caused K-1 to grow might have had a delayed effect on Sarah's human biology?\" Harry asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. That's probably it.\" The Doctor smiled before he turned to the now 10 foot tall girl, \"We should probably get you outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think?\" She asked before ran out of the lab, feeling her clothes starting to rip, rushing past the shocked UNIT agents, emerging outside at 15 feet tall, her clothes shreeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well that seemed a bit premature.\" She noted before she suddenly felt herself shooting up to 20 feet, the remains of her clothes falling all around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Harry,\" The Doctor said in a far too casual tone as Sarah continued to grow \"I owe you an apology. It appears you were quite on the mark about Sarah's growth.\" The medical doctor didn't answer, too focused on the now 40 foot Sarah's breasts. \"Harry?\" The Doctor asked, snapping his fingers, \"I'm giving you a rare compliment. You should take it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor what is the meaning of-\" The perpetually irate voice of Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart began before he trailed off, noticing the 50 foot tall and naked Sarah Jane Smith who smiled awkwardly as she tried to cover up her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's quite clear that Sarah Jane is now ten times taller than she normally is.\" The Doctor casually remarked. The Brigadier rubbed his temples as he tried to fight off a migraine. \"I'm going to leave you to this and quarantine the area.\" He muttered as he went back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah rolled her eyes as she knelt down, one arm still trying to hide her breasts from Harry. \"So any ideas?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None.\" The Doctor instantly replied, shaking his head. \"It will take some time in the lab.\" Without missing a beat, he smacked Harry upside the head, shaking him out of his lusty trance. \"Come along Harry. Back to the lab.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I supposed to do!?\" Sarah snapped, shooting back up to her full height before covering up her breasts when Harry's eyes returned to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just wait here.\" The Doctor waved off before dragging Harry back into the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well isn't that just wonderful.\" Sarah deadpanned. \"Just wait here.

As the dumb blonde tries to figure out how to salvage her evil plan, Sarah is dumped in a cell with an equally large and naked Clara Oswald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Sarah was supersized by the Time Lords who intend for her to be the Doctor's weapon on his mission to avert the Daleks' creation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Something in the water causes Sarah to get even bigger.</span></div></div>",

Rose Tyler, who was the daughter of the woman  who had personally bitch-slapped the Oncoming Storm.  Rose Tyler had seen many strange worlds with her journeys with the Doctor.  The two were very closer...almost like a couple even.  But they weren't a couple. Far from it.  And yet, there was an attraction.  The Doctor simply wasn't interested in Rose that way, but Rose was only human.  After Rose had 'saved' her dad from being killed, the Doctor was furious with her.  However, when it was all over, the two grew closer.  <br>\r\n       Right now, The Doctor was showing other worlds to Rose that was light-years away from Earth.  The Doctor admitted that his favorite planet was Earth, but there were a lot more interesting planets out there.  Rose was enjoying her travels with the Doctor.  <br>\r\n       \"Where are we going next?\" asked Rose after the pair had visited a planet where the trees could move and talk.  <br>\r\n       \"Dunno, really\" said the Doctor.  \"let's go where ever the solar wind takes us\"<br>\r\n        He fiddled about with the console of the TARDIS, and they were gone from the planet they had been on.  About a minute after, the TARDIS jerked around wildly.  <br>\r\n          \"What's happening?\" asked Rose, holdig onto the console and trying not to fall down.<br>\r\n         \"Something yanked the TARDIS out of...\" the Doctor's voice fell as he examined the read-out on the console.<br>\r\n          \"What can yank the TARDIS around like that?!\" asked Rose.  The jerking stopped then, as quickly as it begin.  <br>\r\n          \"Very few things\" said the Doctor.  \"we're landing to find out what\"<br>\r\n            <br>\r\n<br>\r\n           A blue police box materialised on a big grassy plain.

It was an unclothed foot, and was about the same size as the TARDIS.  The Doctor and Rose looked up to see the foot belongs to a woman in a fur bikini. The woman had red hair and big green eyes.  <br>\r\n          \"Um..\" said the Rose.  \"I think we're in trouble\" </span></div></div>",

The Doctor ran over to her, worried something awful had happened, but after a close inspection, she seemed to be fine. Roseclimbed back on her feet.

In a mater of seconds she was taller than the Doctor, her clothes growing tight. Eventually she burst out of her jeans and her top followed suit shortly.

After about two hours of reading he heard a faint voice shouted Daddy. he put a bookmark in his book and started to look around the TARDIS to see if he could find anyone. Then when he got to the table where he had left the glass dish there was a woman sitting in it. She looked human. She had chest length brown hair, brown eyes. But the most striking thing about her was that she was only an inch.<br>\r\n  \"Hello Daddy,\" she said</span></div></div>",

How did it go today?\"<br>\r\n  \"Nearly sold out of everything.

She was picking up things from time and selling them to people of different times.<br>\r\n  This was pretty serious. If she picked up the wrong thing then it could damage time.

She wanted to get out but she knew what would happen if she did.<br>\r\n  The Captain opened the cell and the Doctor left it and went back on the deck. They saw the sun coming up and they saw the crew working.<br>\r\n  A few hours later they saw something over the horizon. They thought that it was an island at first. But the Doctor knew that there wasn't an island there on the maps. The Captain picked up his telescope and took a look. It was a giant squid.<br>\r\n  \"Squid people!\" shouted the Captain. \"Everybody into position.\"<br>\r\n  The ship then went towards the squid. The Doctor thought that this was a suicide mission.</span></div></div>",

It was far bigger than they had expected and it was a lot more violent. They fired at it but the cannonballs just bounced off it. It charged at the ship.<br>\r\n  The Doctor had to think quickly and he realised that Lisa was probably the only thing on the planet that could stop the squid. He looks at her.<br>\r\n  \"Ok Lisa you're gonna be a big girl for Daddy,\" said the Doctor.<br>\r\n  \"A really big girl Daddy,\" replied Lisa.<br>\r\n  He then went over to the port side of the ship and he smashed the dome that Lisa was in. He then threw her out to sea before she started to grow.<br>\r\n  When she hit the water she shot up and in seconds she was her 3,000 foot state. The crew watched as she walked towards the squid. The first thing she had in mind was keeping the Doctor safe.<br>\r\n  \"You won't hurt my Daddy,\" said Lisa.<br>\r\n  The squid then began to wrap its arms around Lisa.

She then threw it over the horizon and it seemed to go out of the Earth's atmosphere along with the other Daleks. She watched it go out of sight and she looked down at the Doctor. He could barely see him so she squatted down to him. She then picked him up with her little finger and brought him up to her level.<br>\r\n  \"There you go Daddy no more mean Daleks,\" said Lisa.<br>\r\n  \"Well remind me to let you have a mountain of sweets when we get back to the T.A.R.D.I.S.\"<br>\r\n  \"Ok Daddy.\"<br>\r\n  But before Lisa walked back to the T.A.R.D.I.S she took the troops back to the trenches. She wanted to take the Germans out but the Doctor forbid it. He didn't want to interfere with time anymore. Besides they would win by themselves.<br>\r\n  When Lisa got to the T.A.R.D.I.S she was put back into her dome and taken into the mind room. There she was released but everything still seemed normal to her. She sat down on her bed and started to think about the Daleks.

It looked part computer generated part machine. It was slightly smaller than Lisa at full size. It also looked humanoid.<br>\r\n  Lisa grew to her maximum size and the others prepared themselves for the fight of their lives.<br>\r\n  \"This is all you could bring?\" asked the Phalanx. \"You must really be desperate.\"<br>\r\n  \"No we have enough power to kill you,\" replied the Ancient.<br>\r\n  Lisa went to attack but the Phalanx easily fended off the attack. Ronan also attacked. He was the strongest person on Earth but to the Phalanx it was nothing. Ghost Rider tried to wrap his fire chains around him but it failed.<br>\r\n  The Phalanx saw the Ancient fleeing and he laughed in triumph. He then saw Lisa on the ground.

When she did there was a small tremor and she picked up the boy and raised him to her level.

To them it was all fun and games.<br>\r\n  But then Lisa began to feel a burning feeling at the bottom of her spine. She stood up with Jake and Mr Wiggles still in her hands and she looked at her back. The pain was getting worse and she was almost in tears. Then she noticed something. There was something poking out of her mini dress. It was getting longer and eventually it broke out. Lisa watched as it grew into some kind of tail. It looked like one that a monkey had.</span></div></div>",

Now he had just saved them, and the entire planet of Bargos, and even Trekleffi couldn't deny it. But that still didn't keep him from grinding his teeth at everything foreign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the inside, the Doctor and his old friend and companion, who he had recently needed to help him ... well, as the Doctor had said, \"Let's just keep this between you and I so that we won't spoil the whole ... time vortex line of events, ok?\" Of course, coming back from it, Captain Jack couldn't resist one final tag along. And who knew that the famed \"Peace Planet of the Retrilian Universe\" wasn't exactly that friendly? The things they teach you in school these days. They were just retreating from the planet, after saving it from the real invading spies who had used their deep unfounded aggression to plan a secret attack.

A little old, embellished, but certainly right. It can do just about anything. Not even it's guardians really know. It's said to have been able to contort the spine, shrink the mind .... and, oddly enough, give those who touch it an odd looking hair doo.\"<br>\r\n\"Doesn't sound that bad,\" Jack grinned, \"I've been looking for a new look!\"<br>\r\n\"Jack, we'd better be careful.

Maybe the ancient guarders of the sludge that had hit them knew what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jack had successfully climbed over the sturdy yet soft and pungent walls and then simply let go and fell to the ground, almost like flying. It was fun from this height. He landed on a red soft, but dusty, carpet at the bottom. The blades looked like old and musty weeds found on strange planets, but somehow Jack could feel that these weeds were a bit too close to home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden there were massive quakes and creaks and then two loud booms hit the ground. Jack heard a frightening roar throughout the land, echoing against the sky. Then a loud, powerful and ever present godlike voice spoke, in a welsh accent,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HMMMMM...... I THOUGHT I HEARD SOMETHING..... GUESS IT WAS A BAD DREAM..\" Jack then, gazed upwards into the sky to see a sight that filled with extreme fear, and a strange sense of joy. He then looked around him and saw the slow wiggling of the purple and red. He put two and two together and yelled as loudly as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the doctor was confused by the yelling, and the earthquakes, and all of the noise going on outside. He figured that this Gwen must've been a very loud person or something. Or possibly that Jack had just done something stupid. He was concerned and so tried quickly to work out what he could in the TARDIS... but his thoughts were interrupted as he felt his ship leaning side ways and falling along ways. But the fall was not vertical, but at an angle. Worried, the Doctor opened the TARDIS doors to look out at the situation, and formulate a plan. But instead of finding Jack or a Kwalerian Centaur Beast from the Fourth Templaro of Csal, he was greeted with a huge purple and red stripped fuzzy long creature wiggling its five covered limbs and coming closer and closer towards him at every slide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor stood there awesruck and bewildered at the new being, unsure what to do first; while Jack knew what was going on and ran towards the \"tunnel\".

He watched in fright as her gigantic, powerful leg draped in fading jeans rose high above the skies, causing sprinkles of dirt and rubbish hiding in between the shoe's cracks to fall down like rain. As she pounded across the plains that were her bedroom, Jack followed closely by her monolithic black and white trainers, gushes of wind blowing against him from the colossal stomps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack tried pounding the side of the trainers in hopes that Gwen might notice him all the way down there, but of course she didn't. She kept walking through the hallway, probably towards the door. She was going to go outside -a place filled with danger - massive rows of shoes stomping about, tires rolling by as quick as lightning. He had to get her attention fast, or he might be lost in the traffic of people and cars outside. But looking all the way up, past her legs, long stretches of arms, at the very top was her lovely angelic face, absolutely oblivious to his plight. How could he get her attention?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, as he was sprinting, he noticed no stomps alongside him. Looking back, and all the ways up, he could see her holding a moment to think. This was his chance - as quick as a scurrying mouse, Jack climbed onto the old rubbery side of her shoe, and holding on tight to the little of the ledge he had, he pulled himself upwards, continuing to the top of Mt. Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he reached the top of the shoe, he could hear,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YEAH, I THINK I'LL JUST GRAB A QUICK CUP BEFORE I GO...\"  and the ride continued. Being on right on her foot, he was pulled all the way upwards into the air, hanging on tight, and then began falling way way down, hanging on for dear life to her fuzzy, warm sock. When the first stomp had finished, he hid under her pant leg, right near the warm sock, so that he could be safer from the crashing footfalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waited it out, in the warm alcove until the steps stopped. It would now be safe for him to continue climbing up. But would that be a safe thing to do? Why not stay here and tell the doctor what's going on - he'd know what to do, wouldn't he? But maybe it'd be a good idea to get her attention, in case we need help from something of a greater size. Jack thought about it, and then took action...</span></div></div>",

So Jack crawled a little bit closer to the inside of Gwen's shoe, the side of it, and began yelling out loud to his brilliant, but unseen friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doctor! Are you ok? Is everything alright down there?\" There was no answer. So Jack tried again, this time louder, \"Doctor, can you hear me?!\" And this time, his voice echoed deep down into the trainer and bouncing off of her massive foot sent a muffled yell to the TARDIS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore, upon seeing the wiggling and ferocious foot, the doctor had rushed quickly back into the TARDIS, and had simply waited it out, trying to get it started again but to no avail. Meanwhile outside, the slender second toe and the heavy big toe of Gwen had surrounded the TARDIS and at every step the entire world of her shoe would tilt forwards, sliding the TARDIS back against the front wall, where the toes would squeeze it between them. The doctor was kind of dizzy from all of the walking and shaking, but was thoroughly excited when he heard Jack's voice. At least that meant that he had survived. He couldn't quite make out the words though, so the doctor instead pulled out a cell phone he had give Jack, just in case of emergencies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Jack was punching angrily against the mighty and impenetrable foot of Gwen, he unexpectedly got a phone call. Confused for a second, he then realized who it must be. Answering it he smiled and said,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are we going to do, Doctor?\"<br>\r\n\"What, no hello? No, how are you? No, how's it down there inside a stuffy old shoe?\"<br>\r\nJack laughs, and playfully adds,<br>\r\n\"Well, how is it?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, could be worse. All though, I have to say, it doesn't exactly smell like roses in here. Not that it stinks or anything, it's just a bit strong. This is your Gwen, then I suppose?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I could tell her a mile away. But what are we gonna do? Is the TARDIS functioning normally again?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, no. It's actually stuck.\"<br>\r\n\"Stuck?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Won't move. Which given the effect the goop had, would mean that we have to get it to a place with as little living material as possible. And this isn't quite the place.\" Gwen starts absentmindedly shaking her foot a little, causing quakes for her two shrunken friends. Jack tries to hold on tight to the fuzzy sock,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, how're we gonna get you out of there?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, you could try getting her attention, you know her, so maybe if you..\"<br>\r\n\"I'll try!\" Jack immediately said and did the only thing he could think of at the time. He began punching once again against her foot, hoping that she would notice him.<br>\r\n\"...That was just one suggestion..\" The doctor tried saying over the phone, \"I'm not sure if you should go right ahead and..\"<br>\r\nBut looking up Jack could see it had no affect on Gwen's face, she looked straight ahead, not noticing anything down at her feet. He was about to try another suggestion when he saw, out of the blue, a shadow hovering over the sock that could only belong to Gwen....</span></div></div>",

Its as quick and unseen as a bomb, and twice as powerful. Luckily for Jack, she only gently rubs the sock all around, deeply, to try and eliminate that annoying itch. Unfortunately however, these \"gentle\" strokes were smothering Jack between the smooth and silky ridges of an enormous index finger and the soft fluffy dyed cotton of her warm stripped sock. It did hurt a lot, and would've possibly killed anyone else, but this was Jack, and of course, this wasn't the only time he'd been close to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of pain, the finger was lifted upwards and began flying back into the sky. But Jack acted quickly, and thought about hopping on the finger for a ride. If he was on her finger, then he could probably much more easily be able to get her attention. Since getting her attention was key, Jack needed to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then again, it might be dangerous and although, he could never die, he might be in no condition to help the doctor escape from his stuffy tomb of doom. He thought about falling far down, and then basically losing any chance he had of getting her attention. Having to start all over again from the very bottom.

As her finger rose at great speeds, the wind rushed passed him as he scooted himself up, now having tight fists full of the fleshy underside of her index finger. Jack felt a very uneasy feeling, as he opened his eyes to stare down upon a gigantic kitchen table, suspended just below a goddess,s chin by her mighty yet elegant digit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above the monolithic woman exhaled deeply, blowing gusts of wind all across the land; causing dark red tidal waves in the ceramic stadium below. Then the ride got even bumpier as he hung on for dear life, as his vehicle cascaded down into the the sea of tea at a very daunting angle. Jack belted out a \"Whoa, Nelly!\" loudly as if calling a horse, to try and keep his cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe searing hot rows of steam flew at him as his journey ended just barely before the ravine. He waited, still hanging onto her finger, as Gwen just casually held her cup. But Jack didn't even get time to recuperate before the entire stadium, his ride, and himself were jolted upwards into the heavens to greet a glistening pair of lips parting contemplatively to make sure everything was ready before swallowing her ocean in one mere gulp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, extremely strong gusts of wind battled and battered anything standing in it's way. Toppling everything to the ground, to the devilishly hot pit below. Jack held on as much as he could, but was caught unaware. As he smelled Gwen's strange odored morning breath wheeze over him, he could barely hold on, Hurricane Gwen might have had the better of him...</span></div></div>",

He looked up to see her massive menacingly gorgeous goddesslike hill that was her bottom lip lower and give him a very clear, much too close view of her monolithic rows of bonelike teeth and the pink fleshy walls of her cavelike mouth. As the tide met her lips the sea was sucked into her mouth by her powerful vacuum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack found himself helplessly being drawn in as he yelled out to her, \"Stop! Gwen! We need your help!\" but she wouldn't stop as she continued to innocently slurp. Jack had been whisked in with the rest of the current. He struggled to swim backwards but it too much. He grabbed onto the inside of her lip as long as he could, watching in horror as his sea was sucked down to the bottomless pit. But then suddenly, it stopped. The final trace of tea had gone down, leaving Jack intact but hanging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's a woman who likes her tea,\" he tried ot joke to ease the troubles.As he waited there, he heard a loud goddesslike voice surrounding him utter \"Oooh.

He thought of trying to climb up, always a better idea to get up to her ears and try and tell her, than being stuck down in her mouth where he could be swallowed at any second.

But if the polarity would be reversed, it can cause lifeforms to grow.\" With that, the scientist shoved the device down Clara's skirt and up her bum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH! Bloody hell!\" The former human cursed. \"And <i>why</i> do you need me to grow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We require the power of Time Lord regenerations to fuel our lifespans. But we need a large amount of your genetic material for our geneticists. And you're barely 5' 2\".\" Clara glared at the scientist. She hated jokes about her height. They made her so mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his cell meanwhile, the Doctor paced as he wracked his brain to escape before he heard the sounds of a scuffle and bodies being tossed around before the door was kicked inwards. \"Doctor come on!\" Clara called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clara how did you-\" The Doctor trailed off when he saw his companion was now 15 feet tall, her clothes barely fitting her frame. \"Explain later, run now.\" Clara said before she grabbed his arm and led him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A TCE?\" The Doctor asked when the two found an alley to hide in. Clara nodded. \"Right, well I can probably get that out of you.\" Clara smirked a little as she thought of the Doctor hovering over her naked arse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't get emotional.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Clara asked, somewhat insulted. His reasoning became clear when Clara felt herself shoot up to 25 feet tall, her clothes ripping to shreds and letting the whole city see her naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why.\" He deadpanned as Clara lowered her hand for him to climb on. \"Should I start running?\" She asked as deadly looking ships advanced towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a bad idea.\" He answered. Not needing to be told twice, Clara bounded off, her massive size taking them across the city in seconds. Before they got out however, a ship fired an electric attack that struck her shoulder. Thankfully, her now Time Lady physiology allowed her to stay conscious but that didn't mean it didn't hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clara,\" The Doctor began. \"Stay calm. Don't-\" The Doctor was cut off as Clara began to rumble again and doubled in size up to 50 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara only spared a cursory glance at her body before she leapt over the city walls, through the wilderness, and back to where the TARDIS was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a slight problem.\" The Doctor said as she let him down near the TARDIS.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.\" Clara said as she started at the police box, now no bigger than an iPhone to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might have to leave you here.\" The Doctor said, looking up at the massive schoolteacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?\" She screamed (making his ears ring) before she ballooned up to 100 feet. \"This would be so cool if they didn't want to dissect me.\" She muttered as she laid down in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clara, listen. Time travel without protection is very dangerous. You could freeze, get ripped apart, burn, become a child, or even an old woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah but I'm huge now.\" She said. \"I'm pretty sure I'll survive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not gambling your life on \"pretty sure\" I lov... very much value you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww.\" Clara pouted, quickly picking up on what he'd meant to say. \"I very much value you too.\" She planted a kiss on him. \"But seriously, take me home.\" She pointed over her shoulder to the hovering ships. \"They're coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor pondered what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) He can't risk Clara. He'll come back for her but for now, she stays behind, trying to hide from the Drahvin while still growing. Her anger at being left behind causes her to grow to 200 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) They risk it and they wind up on Earth. But Clara's still growing and a threat to her fragile, little, planet.</span></div></div>",

As she let go of the ship, she tried to shake loose the ice that had formed on her beautiful body but, not used to her new size, felt her sizeable rear cheeks slam themselves into her flat. \"Well I'm not getting that security deposit back.\" She muttered as she sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't have to worry about that if you'd listened to me.\" The Doctor scolded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah wasn't staying there.\" Clara replied as she lifted the Doctor and the TARDIS up to a building for the sake of both their necks as she tried to curl in on herself. \"So any ideas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well since you're so big, I can't materialize the TARDIS around you. So no using my lab.\" He muttered as he scanned her with his sonic. \"I could try reversing the polarity of the TCE's neutron flow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, neutrons don't have polarity and second please don't. Every time you suggest doing that, things wind up a thousand times worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes well it's the best option we have right now. Not at your size, we'd need some special equipment so I suggest heading to UNIT.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UNIT!?\" Clara snapped, her voice cracking more than a few windows. \"UNIT can't even navigate out of a paper bag. How can they fix this?\" With that surge of emotion, Clara felt herself shoot up to 200 feet tall, her body smashing into the buildings in the alley. \"At this point, I'll try UNIT.\" She conceded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'll be doing everything via the TARDIS, I just need some backup equipment that they can provide.\" He explained before a silver light shot out from the TARDIS and struck the gigantic schoolteacher. \"There. Perception filter so you can walk there no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara pulled herself to her full height, debris falling off her, the Doctor now coming face to face with her womanhood. \"Can I say that you seem very unfazed by this?\" Her voice boomed from above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we've both seen weirder.\" He dismissed as he entered the TARDIS and vanished. Clara nodded her agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, Clara took a few steps forward into London. She couldn't imagine what would happen if anyone she knew saw her like this. Much to her surprise however, no one paid her any mind. The cars below driving around her massive feet as though they were nothing more than potholes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that she was a Time Lady, she felt no shame in saying it \"Humans are <i>idiots</i>.\" She muttered as she walked. \"Nothing to see here. Just a giant naked alien woman.\" She shouted to no reaction. With a mischievous grin, Clara smashed her breasts against the Shard, grinding up against the building. She could feel the glass, shattering against her flesh but no one even glanced at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" She smiled as she skipped over more London landmarks, occasionally letting her thighs slam into something or flicking off the tops parts of building just to see if anyone would notice. If this was truly all it took to rain destruction across Earth, she truly wondered how the planet hadn't been conquered already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head as she passed through an alleyway near Coal Hill, soon this would all be over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Clara gets to UNIT but finds that the Cybermen have invaded, and are now targeting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) While walking through the alley, Clara gets her inviting hips perfectly wedged between the buildings. While Clara grows even bigger to free herself, this shatters the perception filter and she's now visible to her nearby colleagues and students.</span></div></div>",

Next to a running a running river, a faint light was shining through nothing and slowly, a blue box was slowly taking shape as  came in focus. The noise died out as the light flashed away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue box has a door which swung opened. Slowly a man leaned towards the entrance, holding onto the door for support. The man's whole head was glowing in very bright yellow light, making it impossible to see his face. His hands was glowing the same. The man suddenly lost strength as he fell forward and into the river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the yellow light died down, the man climbed onto his hands and kneels and looked at the area he was in. He looked confused at what had happen and after a few seconds he remembered who he was and what had happened to him. The man took a deep breath as he looked at his hands as saw that they looked different than what he remembers them. \"Now this is different\" said the man to himself as he looked at the rest of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man then put his hands over his face and felt that it was different, he slide them higher and felt that is hair was also different.

He noticed that he wiggled it very far, making it as if it was broken. \"In all of my regenerations  not once did I have a nose like this\" said the man known as the Doctor. Doctor looked at his reflection again and saw that he has a slightly long ginger colour hair. He also saw that his eyes were deep blue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Doctor could looked at his reflection some more it began to rain down hard. The Doctor looked up at the sky and saw that it was covered in dark clouds. \"Charming\" said Doctor as he smiled at the sky as the rain was falling upon his face. Doctor climbed himself up from the river and sat down on the bank. He fell onto back, while laying on the bank, he looked at the scenery, still with a smile on his face as he said out, \"Charming in deed\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the Doctor just laughed as he climbed back onto his feet and then looked at the blue box known as the TARDIS. He walked towards the TARDIS and entered. \"Hmm, where to go and who to see....\" said the Doctor to himself as he walked towards the controls. \"Ah I know\" said the Doctor as he pulled some leavers, pushed some buttons and spinned some a helm like leaver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that loud noise began to echo all through out the TARDIS. \"Well...what to do...what to do?\" asked the Doctor as he looked at the damp clothes he was wearing. \"Might as well have a change of clothes\" answered the Doctor to himself as he walked towards the wardrobe room. He walked inside and saw that it was filled with clothes he once wore in his past regenerations . \"Ah...this will do nicely\" said the Doctor as he found some clothes he wish to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter changing out from his wet clothes and put on his new clothes, the Doctor walked towards the controls and looked down at the clothes he was wearing which was a black pianist coat, a white shirt, baggy blue trousers along with black boots. \"Hmm, not there yet\" said the Doctor as he put his hands on his hair,\"Might as well sort something out with this\" as he grabbed hold of hair as he walked towards a mirror.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of a mirror, he found a tub of hair gel, rubbed some of it together with his hands and slide them through his hair. Making the hair spiky, some of the spike lean forwards while the rest spiked backwards. Just then the noise that the TARDIS was making stopped. Doctor looked towards the control with a smile as he walked towards it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally here...where ever here is\" said the Doctor as he had no idea where he set the TARDIS  to be as he randomly send it anyplace as he couldn't decide where to go. \"Well then, lets see where I am today\" said the Doctor as he walked towards the doors and opened them to the unknown.   </span></div></div>",

The trees grew tall, making it hard to even see the top. He saw what he could tell to be brown leafs falling down the tall trees, making him that it was autumn where ever he was located. The Doctor looked at the leafs and noticed that they appear to be larger then they should be. He took one step outside the TARDIS, breathed in the fresh air of the alien planet had to offer him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly made his way towards one of the large leafs, knelt down and picked on of them up. \"My word...if I wanted to I could in fact turn one of these leafs into a kite...\" said the Doctor as he examined it and saw that it was the size of kite. He looked around himself and saw that there were fallen leafs all different sizes. Doctor then dropped the leaf in his hands and slowly took a few steps away from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear...oh deary me\" said the Doctor to himself as he noticed that something doesn't feel right. \"Well with that fact I'm starting to talk to myself this early in my new regenerated body,\" said the Doctor as he grabbed hold of his collar and he felt one of his two hearts hurting, \"I knew I should have waited till I'm through progressing the regeneration stage\" Once he finished saying that, when he hiccuped a mist that shone bright light escaped from him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charming\" said the Doctor as he hiccuped again and the same thing happened again. He rushed his way towards the TARDIS but with each hiccup cased him to feel weak with his legs. The moment that he reached the doors to the TARDIS, he felt himself spinning round, with his back against the doors and slowly slide down onto the ground. He kept on hiccuping as he looked up at the tall trees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then he heard the sound of footsteps, he darted his sight towards where the sound came from and saw a silhouette which slowly grew large as it was heading towards him. The Doctor couldn't do anything, he felt weak and he had no strength left as each hiccup he did made him feel so. He eye sight went all blurry and then they grew heavy. Then everything went all black for him.\"Charming in deed\" said the Doctor as he passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly he could hear a voice, the Doctor opened his eyes slightly and saw that he was no longer within the forest but he was somewhere else. Doctor took note that he was have been out of it for a few hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah I see that you are awake\" spoke a woman's voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Doctor darted his eyes towards the owner of the woman's voice and saw that it belongs to...    </span></div></div>",

In reality they are not that huge, but for someone that has been a man for over 900 years it is a shock. The doctor gets up and strolls back into the TARDIS.</span></div></div>",
