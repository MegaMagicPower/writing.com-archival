She notices a boy about 16 years old staring at her as she walks by, not wanting to miss a chance to become a boy\u2019s fantasy for the night she walks up to him and bends over giving him a perfect view of her cleavage. \u201cIf you help carry my bags when I\u2019m shopping I\u2019ll give you a reward.\u201d The boy immediately got up and agreed to. For the next hour Angela went around buying clothes and other stuff while this kid who\u2019s name she learned was Parker carried her bags around. Then she got to the store she saved for last, her favorite store to buy her bra\u2019s from. Parker was hesitant to follow at first but eventually followed. Angela looks around and picks a few bras out, a pink one, a white one, a pink lace one and a black one with pink lacing around the cups and a pink bow in the middle. Once she purchased the bras she pulled Parker into one of the dressing rooms and started to take her shirt off. \u201cPants off, I told you I would reward you if you were a good little boy.\u201d For the next few minutes Angela gave the best tit fuck she ever had. She unclasp the bra and hands it to Parker with a piece of paper with her number and address on it \u201cyou can keep it if you want and if you ever want to help again just give me a call\u201d she winked at him as she put her shirt back on but notice it took a little bit more effort. Parker could have sworn he saw her breast grow a little bit during the tit fuck but didn\u2019t pay to much attention as he put his pants back on and carried the bags out to her car. Without her bra Angela\u2019s breast jiggle and bounced with every step and she loved the stares she got from guys and girls with smaller breast. She says bye to Parker and drives off back home.</span></div></div>",

Parker couldn\u2019t hold his lust in and went to pay her a visit. Knowing her bra size from the bra she gave him, he went out and bought her another bra with this one being a purple lace one with little fluffs around the cups. When she answered the door Parker thought he had the wrong address as the lady who answered had breast about 2 cup sizes larger and a more plump ass with thicker thighs. It was only when this woman said \u201coh hello Parker, been a while since I last saw you. Dropping by cause you wanted more? Well come on in\u201d that he knew it was Angela. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat.....\u201d was all Parker could say as he entered the house. Angela was in one of the bra\u2019s she had bought at the mall, the pink one that she bought to replace her old one. Parker also noticed that most of the bras she had bought were on the floor around the house with the straps snapped or the middle snapped. \u201cIs that for me?\u201d Angela said whole pointing towards the bag. Quickly he hands the bag over and she takes out the bra and reads the tag. \u201cSuch a cute bra, but I think I\u2019ve gotten bigger then a 38dd since I last saw you. But I\u2019ll still try it on.\u201d She tries to unclasp her bra but is having a little trouble, so she decides to take a deep breath. The already strained bra couldn\u2019t take the pressure and snaps. The bra lands on Parker\u2019s head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela puts her breasts into the cups and tugs on the straps to clasps it but can\u2019t quite reach it herself so she asks Parker for some help. Instead of going behind her he wraps his arms around her while pressing his chest into hers, it takes a few moments but they finally get the bra on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a snug fit but it\u2019s pretty nice feeling bra, now come have a seat\u201d Angela points towards the couch. Parker walks over and sits down in the middle of the couch. \u201cAs you can see I\u2019ve been growing a little, I don\u2019t know why I am but I do know that when I grow I become very horny. I know how much you love my body so I\u2019m willing to make a deal with you. You keep buying me clothes and I\u2019ll keep fucking you.\u201d Angela then sits on Parker\u2019s lap, feeling his boner through his pants. Parker can\u2019t help himself and grabs her thighs but can\u2019t get a good grip since they\u2019ve gotten a lot thicker. It\u2019s only now that Parker also notices all the pairs of shorts and panties all over the floor, Angela\u2019s ass had double in size since the mall incident. </span></div></div>",

I know you picked it out for me so I don\u2019t want to snap it but I don\u2019t think we can get it off now.\u201d So standing in front of him she takes in a deep breath. The bra strains but doesn\u2019t doesn\u2019t snap instantly, her breast were slowly bulging out the cups. Smiling a little Angela mentions \u201cthe fluffs kinda tickles a little, feels kinda nice.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the bra couldn\u2019t take anymore pressure and snaps off, landing on Parker\u2019s head. Now with the bra off Angela sits back down \u201chere let me help you\u201d she removes the bra from his head and starts grinding against his lap again. This time Parker couldn\u2019t concentrate as her breast bounced around as she moved back and fourth.</span></div></div>",

She had a hard time but eventually got her panties off that Parker didn\u2019t even know she was wearing since they were lost in her ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela took off Parker\u2019s shirt while he took off his pants and boxers. Once his clothes were off Angela hopped onto her bed on her back, her breast wouldn\u2019t stop jiggling back and fourth from the vibration. Parker not wasting a moment quickly followed suit and started to thrust into her. Not wanting him to cum inside her right away she took his manhood and squished it between her breast and starting going up and down. As soon as he said he was gonna cum he shot his load all over her breasts. Angela just moaned when he laid her down and started thrusting inside her again as he kissed her breast. Having already ejaculated one time not as much came out this time but Angela felt it and organism.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAngela, I don\u2019t know what to say, that was fantastic and I\u2019m glad you were my first.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cWe should probably clean up but I\u2019m feeling a bit tired so why don\u2019t we rest for right now.\u201d Angela replied through her breaths as she was coming back from it all. Parker just took her offer and used her breast like pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFew hours later<br>\r\n<br>\r\nParker woke up first and started to lightly play with Angela\u2019s breasts as she slept. She felt her breast being touched in her sleep as her hand slowly went down to her vagina to masturbate in her sleep. Once she finished she had woken up and smiled at Parker. They both got up and took a hot shower together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving him help again she was able to get the bra back on and got the panties back on. \u201cSo do you have any clothes that fit you or are completely out of clothes?\u201d Parker asked while he stared at her. She goes to the closet and pulls out a nightgown, pair of black jogger shorts and a crop top. \u201cI\u2019m not completely out, I got these.\u201d<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Before her growth it reached down to her knees but now it barley reached over her ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngela tried to pull it down a little more but almost pulled it over her breast so she stopped. After a few minutes of Parker and Angela talking and playing with her new curves Angela decides they should go out on a walk or something. She takes off the nightgown without ripping it and puts on the crop top and shorts, she would be better off without the top as it basically looked like a second bra at this point and her shorts held by some miracle.</span></div></div>",

First, you can\u2019t switch partners, get what you get and don\u2019t throw a fit. Second, no leaving the park, don\u2019t worry this place is big there are lots of different environments to it. Third, you have to stay within thirty feet of your partner. Fourth, no killing, maiming, or doing any kind of harm that would require immediate medical attention, I know you ascended and apprentices are immortal and junk but I want this to be fair. You can slow down your opponents in other ways. Fifth, no removing things that are stuck to the ground, you have no idea what kind of hoops I had to jump through to organize this. You can\u2019t use any objects that you didn\u2019t find in this park. Any questions?\u201d Primus asked, noticing Light Blue Diamond raising his hand. \u201cYes?\u201d \u201cWhere are Jerry, Teddy, Leroy and Alfalfa?\u201d The smallest Diamond asked. \u201cVery good question, I have people spread out as referees to make sure no one cheats, also cheating will result in being kicked out and no desert, this applies to everyone. Now for the pairings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrimus pulled out a top hat and reached his hand down. \u201cCentury and Elsa\u201d  the two people named looked at each and nodded recognizing each other\u2019s prescience. \u201cLight Blue Diamond And Black Diamond\u201d Light Blue looked over to the older diamond and blushed, Black Diamond not noticing (or did she?). \u201cRen and-\u201c <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u2019Please say Tali, please say Tali\u2019</i> Tali thought closing her eyes. \u201cZero!\u201d Tali looked down and saw Ren was now gone.

As you know there are the regular angels, dark angels, guardian angels and shoulder angels. Now most people think shoulder angels are just hallucinations when someone was under intense pressure to do the right thing, they are semi-correct. Shoulder devils were just holograms done by demons as a way of screwing with the angels, who were invisible to everyone but the ones they were trying to help. But nowadays demons don\u2019t do that much regarding making humans or most mythical beings do the wrong thing. The thing with shoulder angels was that they are normally tiny, there are times angels are born tiny for reasons currently unknown and they found a use for them helping people make the correct choices. Morgan himself was a tiny angel being twelve years old (a rather young twelve mind you). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll young angels take an exam to see how talented they are and what do you know he was a genius. So the person in charge of the shoulder angels, Matt, offered Morgan a job being a shoulder angel. Morgan accepted without hesitation. His family was concerned about him getting hurt despite the fact angels are extremely durable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was reading the packet he was given to see who he would be giving guidance to. All it said was the name \u201cZero\u201d Morgan was slightly worried as normally the packets would have much, much more information.

Not that her kid would notice, she had Alice to keep her occupied and the twins, the problem was her. She was bored and she had no missions from the boss as she had the week off, not even 10 was around for her to piss off, usually by sending 32 at her, it gave her, her monthly dose of Super/Luther collateral damage, though she wasn't allowed do that in the castle/home base any more because Kaos and TARDIS got tired of having to put the building back together after the feuding duo tear it down around them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was pulled from her boredom by a pulse of light magic and twitched, Kaos and through him the Apprentices and Ascended were technically Chaotic Neutral, but again through his blood they were at least 20% demon, with Zero it was probably closer to 65%, so an angelic being would cause her to twitch and itch.

At least Miranda and Hook did, she never understood where the Boss got his funds and considering how he has casually mentioned working for both HYDRA and the Death Eaters in the past, she probably doesn't want to know, instead focusing on taking off the serpent's head as the metaphor goes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisarming was a technique several apprentices and ascended took rather literally, mostly just because they could, in this case after a bounce that moved her behind her attacker, her long fingers dug into his shoulder joint and ripped the arm with the weapon right off. She then kicked out his stance and wrapped her arms around his neck about ready to snap it....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop, don't kill him\" Zero stops and flicks her head around so quick her hair glitches through her shoulder angel, who looked unfazed by the minor inconvenience of solid matter passing through him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she hisses quietly, her victim a little busy trying to breathe despite her vice like grip so wasn't going to notice her talking to <i>'herself'</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've ripped his arm off and beat him up, do you really need to kill him? Isn't that a little much? Can't you just let him off with a warning and a painful reminder not to do this again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero actually does roll her eyes this time \"The only thing that stopped me going monster point and chewing my way through this level 1 Magikarp's internal organs was you, the fact you'd be disturbed and I didn't want to spend tomorrow killing the angels that your report send to purge me\" she whispers, then a wide grin appears on her face \"One moment please\" she then pulls the human so both are staring eye to eye \" Hey Diaz. I've thought about trying out a little bit of a Ghostrider battle plan, so any chance you could tell me who you've killed, who's lives you've ruined, that kind of thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man chuckles and spits in her face, the frown now on her face makes even Morgan grimace<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I don't have to kill you quickly you know, I just need you dead. I can rip off all your limbs break your jaw, tear open your guts and feed you your intestines if I wanted to, and if you piss me off. So answer the bloody question\" she orders, grinning when she see's the fear in his eyes before he also smiles<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I don't fucking know\" he says with a laugh \" You hear those screams? Smell the burning?\" he asks and Zero wrinkles her nose, having just noticed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, so it is. I've always been more a Cetral than Starling girl and the things I've heard made me think this place was just always a shithole. What's the point?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all because of me, It was a means to an end and got me to my target but a lot of people are dead, dying or suffering because of me. Was that what you wanted to hear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero's eyes flick over to Morgan who looks conflicted, on the one hand he'd be taught killing was very wrong, and as a shoulder angel should argue against killing in anything other than self defense. On the other hand the person here was clearly a very bad person, someone who could become a demon if left unchecked. This was really a seraphim job not a child angel's and even Zero sympathised with him for getting someone like her as his 1st assignment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And let's not forget the kids..\" even as an angel Morgan didn't see Zero's hand tear his head off and throw it through the reinforced doors she'd phased through like 10 minutes ago<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck?\" Morgan swore accidentally, it seemed Zero was rubbing off on him in a bad way<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The boss has very few rules, and with the exceptions of like 5 reality types, children are not to be harmed (For the record, worlds like Avatar and Pok\u00e9mon where the fighters are kids are examples of those exceptions), and only him being on his honeymoon with the new ladies is stopping the Boss himself atomising this bastard if he were to know. I actually did him a favour\" Zero spits before with a click of her fingers produced a royal purple flame at the tips which she drops on the body that erupts into flames as if doused in gasoline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe portal jump back to the EU was silent, though Zero could still feel Morgan's prescience on her shoulder so knew he hadn't left yet. It was then she saw the time \"ah shite, it's 5 to nine. There anything I need to do so you can get home, punch in void gate co-ordinates? Tear open a Garganta?\" she asks with a tilt of her head to the angel who shakes his<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I'm good, I've got a teleporter, it'll bring me straight home\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero blinks but then shrugs \"Okay, then we just need to go onto the balcony, Miri's security system means non terrestrial... if you can call a pocket dimension built by an Eternal being terrestrial... warp tech can't function as a way out. Way in is fine as the other security systems, aka anyone in the castle at the time, make short work of any intruders\" she explains before moving to the balcony at the top of the tower. From there she gently moves him from her shoulder to the railing at which point he removes his clicker and disappears<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTomorrow?</span></div></div>",

As you know the exams were yesterday and we were reviewing Morgan\u2019s scores and were astounded about how well he had done.\u201d Miss Aether explained, Morgan doing a silent sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe exams were sort of a combination of an IQ test and a career placement test to see what were the best possible careers for the kids and how well they would be at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow well did Morgan do?\u201d Chrom asked feeling proud of his youngest child. \u201cI believe Mr. Meese can answer that.\u201d The principal said; there was a poof and a short angel wearing a white T-shirt and white shorts appeared in the room. He had brown hair and brown eyes and was short but if you looked closely he was somewhat muscular. \u201cI am Matthew Meese, I am the head of the shoulder angel department, Morgan here got a perfect score on the shoulder angel section of the exam. So I have decided to offer him to become an official shoulder angel.\u201d The short angel said with a twinkle in his eye. \u201cI accept!\u201d Morgan said without hesitation. \u201cMorgan, sweetie what if you get hurt?\u201d Robin asked with concern. \u201cNot to worry, all shoulder angels are equipped with an emergency button in case if things south. If the button doesn\u2019t work there is a separate button that sends a distress signal to headquarters and we\u2019ll send a team of highly qualified angels to assist.\u201d This seemed to sooth the worries of Morgan\u2019s parents, \u201cWell if Morgan wants to do it and Morgan will be safe I will allow this.\u201d Robin said Chrom agreeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan was pulled out of his flashback. He was somewhere dark, damp, both warm and cold at the same time. Morgan patted his sides to see if he could find the distress signal or the emergency teleporter.

Any idea why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZero shrugs \"Z and I were  VERY sexually active, when your wife is a hot red head and a witch it makes sense, and I suppose I've always enjoyed causing mayhem and killing things, makes me a monster but I don't really care\" she sighs deeply as Morgan reaches the end of her spine, sitting at the base of her tailbone to take a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Zero decides to feed her little masseur as a reward<br>\r\n2) The pleasure from Morgan's massage has gotten Zero hot and bothered, time to make an angel fall the fun way<br>\r\n3) Zero senses another apprentice, and decides to see if the others can see Morgan too, through their shared link via Kaos. Turns out they can and they find Morgan adorable :D</span></div></div>",

It had gotten a lot calmer these days, mostly because the woman had taken to shoving Lapis in her cleavage when she got energetic, which oddly enough made her think of Pink and Pearl, seriously if they were any other country they'd be a disgrace to nobility with all the staff screwing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay then, I'll send someone to collect some cakes fit for the most important people... and Blue' she teases, getting chuckles from Lapis and an eye roll from Blue, as well as a weak water whip which bounced of Black's barrier spell. The Queen to a nation of millions, sticks her forked tongue out and laughs before walking out the door, luckily Blue was the calmest of her sibling, and was used to Black's random nature and possible insanity,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere to next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bakery, where Morgan and Ren have to make a selection of treats not just for the customers in the mixed size bakery, but also fulfil the royal request<br>\r\nThe court, where Black Diamonds loyal advisors... argue like children and tell jokes like they're all still in their teens.

As well Yellow realized she did have something in common: both were merciless fighters (well of course during training they didn\u2019t kill anyone but other than that they didn\u2019t hold back). Yellow thought it would be best to try and get Light Blue to become a spymaster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, Light Blue I think I have an idea of getting you a role.\u201d Yellow said watching LB\u2019s interest peak. \u201cWhat is it, what is it?\u201d Light Blue asked excitedly. \u201cHow would you feel about being a spymaster?\u201d Light Blue tilted his head. \u201cWell, it sounds neat but Bux is the only kingdom that has more giants then normal sized people\u201d (as in they have more women of course but the ratio of men to women was very close but compared to other countries their giant to normal ratio was at least 20 times higher). \u201cI have heard from Grima that Tharja\u2019s potion shop does have several interesting things, maybe we could find a potion that allows you to shrink and grow back so that the training I give you would still apply. On top of that your time magic would be useful even when you are normal sized\u201d Yellow points out. Light Blue contemplated before speaking \u201cI\u2019ll do it!\u201d Getting a smile from his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell out of all the siblings I never thought I\u2019d see the \u2018Titan of Lightning\u2019 in my shop.\u201d Tharja mused with a dry tone, as Yellow walked up to the counter. \u201cHi princess, hi Light Blue\u201d Yellow looked down seeing Morgan on the counter. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a potion.\u201d Yellow said, setting the prince by Morgan. \u201cMy, oh my, if it isn\u2019t the \u2018Time Magician\u2019 Tharja said with a creepy smile. Yellow slams her hand on the table, causing the blunettes to fall over. \u201cI said I\u2019m looking for a potion.\u201d Yellow growled, Tharja chuckling as she turned around facing a large shelf filled with potions. \u201cI heard you, everyone who comes here wants a potion, what kind of potion do you want, something to give you big muscles, a potion that allows you to consume larger quantities of alcohol without getting a hangover?\u201d Tharja asked with a sly grin. \u201cI need a potion that allows the person who drinks it to shrink and grow back to normal size.\u201d Yellow says surprising Tharja but thankfully for her she was facing the opposite direction so no one saw her reaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do believe that I have the potion in stock, 175 coins.\u201d Tharja said, the sound of money being placed on the counter being music to her ears. Tharja grabbed a small bottle (well small to her, it would be the size of those science bottles with round bottoms) with her fingernails and placed it by Light Blue. \u201cHow do I know that it works?\u201d Yellow asked with suspicion, Tharja sighs before shrinking down to twice Morgan height. Somehow standing on the counter. Tharja then grabs Morgan and hugs him to her chest. \u201cYou see it works, right Morgan?\u201d Tharja asks teasingly pressing Morgan closer to her. \u201cAnything I should know about the potion before I leave you to do who knows what to Morgan, who by the way is the son of the captain of the guard.\u201d Yellow asks, while she thought that Chrom was too much of a pansy (AKA nice) she did respect him and thought of him as a good friend (Yellow is the general, Chrom is the captain of the guard). \u201cYeah, once someone drinks it, while they will be able to manipulate their size right away it would be best to wait three hours before doing so or it will cause some unintended side effects.\u201d Tharja said still not releasing her grip on Morgan. Yellow motions for Light Blue to grab the potion before grabbing him and leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYellow and Light Blue were in the meeting room. \u201cOkay drink the potion and we\u2019ll start the training. Light Blue nods before drinking the potion, which tasted like a combination of honey and cinnamon. \u201cNow while I don\u2019t specialize in stealth, my idea is that I close my eyes and I\u2019ll count to a 200 like in a game of hide and seek. Your job is to sneak out of the room without getting caught, I set up a bell outside which you\u2019ll ring.\u201d Yellow explains before closing her eyes, her younger brother going off to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Yellow stopped counting she searched the entire room and kept a vigilant eye searching for her brother. Two hours later, she heard the bell ring. She left the room and saw LB. \u201cGood job kid, now let\u2019s get some grub.\u201d Yellow said with a proud grin before grabbing LB and shoving him down her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYellow walked into her favorite tavern \u201cHell and Heaven\u201d (The naming behind is because there has been an equal amount of deaths and marriage proposals that took place at the tavern, that number is currently 35) At the counter was Yellow\u2019s favorite person who worked there: Tifa Lockhart. (Note: I have never played a Final Fantasy game, I watched a death battle that had Tifa in it and I remember it said she worked at a bar.) \u201cThe usual\u201d Yellow said placing the money on the counter and going over to a private booth (By private it just means there was a fancy curtain that blocked it off from the other booths.) Yellow sat down and took LB out of her shirt and placed him in front of her. Coincidentally Tifa opened up the curtain and set down a large steak and a large mug of mead. \u201cThanks Tifa\u201d Yellow says, the woman nodding before leaving and shutting the curtain.  Yellow cut up the meat allowing to Light Blue to take some, her brother deciding not to mention her preferred chicken over beef. Yellow ate some of her steak before downing her mug and slamming it on the table. \u201cHas it been three hours yet?\u201d Yellow asked, with a tint of red on her face, impatiently wanting her brother to test out the potion. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, I think I\u2019m pretty sure I have twenty minutes left. \u201cTest it out now, you\u2019re a Diamond, nothing is going to go wrong. \u201cOkay, sis, whatever you say.\u201d Light Blue concentrated before he shrunk to only a couple of inches tall. \u201cNice, now change back\u201d Yellow says with a wide grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight Blue takes a deep breath before concentrating once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However for Light Blue, Black never showed any sign of wanting to harm him. In fact when Light Blue was four he was kidnapped by a group of female Buxans (That is what the people of Bux were called) who believed the Diamond family didn\u2019t deserve to rule the kingdom. Rather than send out members of the royal guard (oddly enough this was the year Chrom was appointed, just a disclaimer, Chrom is the captain of the royal guard, Yellow is head of the military and does have control the Guard,) Black took care of it herself, she stormed their base and only two people left that building alive, Black and Light Blue. For two weeks Black didn\u2019t let Light Blue leave her sight. The point was while Black was scarier when she was angry Yellow was more likely to get angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to what was currently happening Yellow smiled a wicked grin as she picked up Light Blue as she laid down. She gently placed the youngest diamond upon her stomach. \u201cI would like you to massage my stomach.\u201d Yellow purred, Light Blue closed his mouth to prevent any form of weakness from showing. However he couldn\u2019t help protesting. \u201cT-t-that\u2019s more of Morgan\u2019s thing, I\u2019m just the youngest prince who isn\u2019t good at anything.\u201d Light Blue stuttered trying to throw Yellow off. Yellow pet Light Blue\u2019s head with her index finger. \u201cOh don\u2019t be silly, Black told me all about Morgan\u2019s classes.\u201d Light Blue was nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of months ago for whatever reason Morgan convinced his friends to take a class taught by him about how to massage. It only lasted a week and they practiced on dummies (they were very life like  thought) and on the last day was a test, which was to demonstrate what they learned on an actual person. Black was the person Light Blue was assigned to. That happened because, Grima was the person Morgan used when he gave demonstrations during class. Apparently Grima told Black about it. Everyone passed the test, except Chihiro but that\u2019s only because he passed out before he even began. Black said that she wouldn\u2019t tell the others. Apparently that wasn\u2019t the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing resistance was futile the Prince knelt down and began to work. Light Blue he wasn\u2019t as good as Morgan, but according Yellow\u2019s noises he was doing a good job. Light Blue would admit that Yellow\u2019s skin was soft. Light Blue would\u2019ve enjoyed his sister\u2019s affection earlier if she didn\u2019t suffocate him. Light Blue looked over and saw Yellow\u2019s arms stretched out behind her and her tongue lolling. Light Blue smiled and and continued his ministrations. Yellow\u2019s stomach growled loudly causing the young diamond to fall over. Yellow sat up and licked her lips looking at her brother. \u201cI\u2019m hungry, dear Little blue. Do you know what I\u2019m hungry for?\u201d Yellow asked talking slowly, Light Blue shook his head. \u201cWell, right now I really want to eat\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Ready? Begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina and Kjelle ran as fast as they could, Lucina going faster as she was more flexible and did more cardio compared to Kjelle. Kjelle wasn't necessarily flexible but she was tough being able to take blows from the traps (non-lethal traps, they weren't monsters, and plus they didn't want a rebellion, they definitely could of handled one but it just had too many drawbacks).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina waited about two minutes till Kjelle made it to the finish line. \"Very nice, I believe it's time for the second test.\" Pink Diamond said with Light Blue on her shoulder. \"Yellow decided to combine our tests which is why there are four instead of five.\" LB explained to the girls who nodded. \"Now for this test there are time when there are attacks that occur while you are asleep and you don't have time to get dressed.\" Pink started off \"As well there are times you are surrounded and they won't fight fair and will fight you all at once.\" Light Blue continued \"So the two of you will have endure one minute of fighting against a horde of enemies while wearing what you wore while you were sleeping last night.\" Pink explained, she and her brother both snapped their fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime was re-winded fourteen hours (it being two in the afternoon) for the girls so they were now in their pajamas (they still knew what was happening and stuff) Kjelle was just wearing underpants, Pink making a dumb face when she saw her six pack. Lucina was wearing actual pajama's,  but they were a couple of sizes two small on her. The reason for this was Lucina was allowed a certain number of nights when she was allowed to sleep with Morgan but since her maternal aunts (Chrom had two sisters, an elder one and a younger one who was normal sized like lapis) and Tharja and occasionally Noire (the Nocturnes had to live with Lucina and her family after a spell went wrong and their house imploded...and then exploded.....and it started raining pugs, it was a very weird day) were somewhat needy/selfish and would steal Morgan in the middle of the night. Because of this Lucina bought a pair of pajama's that were too small so it would make much more difficult to steal Morgan. And Lucina slept with Morgan yesterday. A dozen of holo Pearls (yes LW those are a real thing, look it up) appeared holding swords and were surrounding the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Lucina and Kjelle were tied as they both defeated the same amount of holograms in the same amount of time. Once all of them were gone the girls were wearing their normal outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went into a another room where Blue Diamond was standing by three podiums (like those fancy ones in museums or in that spongebob movie with Neptune). \"Hello girls, a part of being in the royal guard is choosing who is the best person for a specific task, however if you do get accepted you will start off as rookies but once you have a couple of years under your belts you could be assigned your own platoon. For today's test you will have to decide which tasks you believe would be best for some of our rookies.\" Blue moved out of the way revealing that on the pedestals were Loyd, Mickey and Pyro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this is easy, the green haired guy would be a messenger, black haired guy would be cannon fodder and the one who looks like he wants to start a fire would clean the stables.\" Kjelle said matter of factly (fun fact while all of the horses are normal sized, occasionally they would have size magic used on them so they can be used by female members of the royal guard, other fun fact most of the royal guard are women for obvious reasons which means all of the men who are in it have to be <b>REALLY</b> talented to be a member, so you know that Chrom is a tough mother trucker if he's the captain).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just so you know you only have one guess, you just used it Kjelle.\" Blue said with a twinge of disappointment, not that Kjelle noticed. Lucina hummed, biting her lip before speaking. \"I believe that Loyd would be good when dealing with a raid as he is good at setting traps, Mickey would be best suited for hunting down people in a chase while Pyro would be best suited for taking out multiple enemies at once.\" Lucina said, getting a smile from the boys. \"Now for your final test I would like Kjelle to go in the white door and Lucina to go in the black door.\" Blue explained to the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina saw Black Diamond (she also had a bit of chocolate on her face) when she entered the room. \"Hello Lucina, for your final test we asked Morgan for his assistance which he agreed to lend. What you have to do is to identify which Morgan is the real one, as cloning is a fickle thing all of the clones are capable of saying one thing, in return I used a spell on the real Morgan so he can only say that word also. Once you believe you have found the real Morgan you will kiss him and all of the fake Morgan's will disappear and the spell on Morgan will be broken.\" Black diamond explained before fading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina than noticed that on the ground were hundreds of Morgans. <font class=\"size5\" style=\"\"><span class=\"cblue\">\"LUCY!</span></font> The Morgans cried before swarming the giant Blunette. Lucina tensed up at the Morgan's swarming her body saying her name over and over again. Lucina closed her eyes and focused before getting an idea. Lucina laid down on the floor before speaking \"The real Morgan is the one who will go as close as close to me as physically possible.\" Lucina felt the Morgan's crawling over her body but she only felt one go on her lips. While Lucina's magic knowledge wasn't as great as some other members of her family (oh yeah Lucina can use magic, and so can Chrom) she knew two things about clones, one they weren't as durable as the real thing, two they would do anything they can to live. So only the real Morgan would go near her mouth. Lucina puckered her lips and pressed Morgan down as she made dramatic kissy noises to be funny. Lucina felt all of the other Morgans' disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucina stood up and shared a smile with Morgan. \"You know I would of been really sad if you didn't choose the real me.\" Morgan said with a cute smile. \"Well it's a good thing she did.\" Lucina turned around and saw a smiling Black Diamond (the chocolate on her face was now gone.) \"The testing is over, Myself, Yellow, your father and some of the members of my council and the higher ranking members of the guard will discuss whether or not you and Kjelle passed or not, for the time being go home and rest.\" Black Diamond said, Lucina and Morgan both bowing before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

Light Blue made it to the dining hall panting but did arrive in time to stop his sisters from eating the treats?</span></div></div>",

LB would have tried to see them or respond in some way, but the sweets clearly had an effect on Blue's breasts and belly, meaning he was trapped by a large wall of soft fatty flesh which he was slowly sinking into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Give him here, I doubt he's that great' Yellow grumbles but Blue clearly ignores her twin<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh you're so adorable, it's always so hard to treat you like my brother, rather than my son' at this Light Blue squirms his way up so he could look her in the eye, even if his only response was<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hm?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack laughs, and LB was surprised that the cake's magic actually managed to make Black look healthy in terms or weight rather than death's door level emaciated 'Mother died giving birth to you little squirt, Blue as a mother to a 4 year old child was the most experienced, I'm sure you know we all tried raising you, but it was always Blue who did the bulk of the work. Naming you Light Blue Diamond was Queen Prisma's last act, Blue clearly took it to heart, especially as even Yellow knows she's your 2nd favourite sibling, she'd prefer fav, but who can really compete with Pink eh?' he smile was gentle and Light Blue knew she was telling the truth, it had always just been him, his sisters and his niece, he didn't have any memories of parental figures and none of the others ever talked about them, other than Black when giving him and Lapis their history lessons.

He laughed just a little, how could he think she of all people didn't care about him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'My turn, stop hogging the brat' LB's pleasant experience was ruined the moment things turned from blue to yellow: Yellow had the Amazon physique, muscles on muscles, which meant even Morgan's sweets couldn't stop her solid abs from being rather uncomfortable to be rubbed against, at least she had a soft bosom atop her pecs. With an unsatisfied grunt she moves him to her now much plumper ass, LB holding in any screams as he was rubbed against a wall with the consistency of jello 'He might make a nice cushion though' Yellow teases, getting slapped for her troubles<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He's still our brother, even if he's small and fragile' Blue scolds 'He needs to be protected, you swore an oath to the family when Black made you Captain of the Guards and I shouldn't NEED to remind you of that to stop you trying to torture your own blood'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Are you saying my ass is that bad, bitch? At least it has shape and is firm, you'll need a wheelbarrow before LB's of age' Yellow sneers, then both older diamonds gasp when tendrils of shadow wrap around their throats, Light Blue dropping to the ground, luckily landing on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Sisters please, don't fight like this' Black sighs 'At least use the arena like normal people if you want to beat the shit out of each other so badly. Besides, LB still has other sisters that want to show him we care...' her smirk turns feral and LB curses Morgan and Ren for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho's closest to LB, and therefore gets to play with him first?</span></div></div>",

But it can\u2019t be any old <br>\r\nthing like hair or nail clippings, it has to be _____.\u201d Morgan said, Light Blue flinching, it will be <br>\r\nawkward to get that from his sisters but it is better than Black actually making him the Minister of <br>\r\nCuddles. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n<b>This Melees Winner Is: Light Blue Diamond! </b><br>\r\n <br>\r\nWhat are the DNA samples Light Blue has to collect? <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was also the father of fellow demigod and Morgan's best friend Noire, the mystic archer having the dark purple hair of the Great Old One's human form, though for Morgan's sanity she didn't have his blood red eyes or mildly scaly skin, instead having amethyst coloured eyes like her mother Tharja, and the body of a 20 year old at age 15, not that Morgan can say much, given his divine blood gave him the lean build of a boy of around 15, despite being 12.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes Lord Kaos?' Morgan greets, the way he did all the Gods except Robin who insisted he call Mom (not that he had a problem with that)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Grima is getting antsy, she's worried what Ganon will do with the power to tame Dracolisks, so she's added a couple other demigods to your quest: Noire and Century'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorgan blinked, it made sense Noire would be involved in this, Serpens would have no reason to interfere if it didn't, but playing messenger was odd, even if it were for Aversa, who was the godly parent of Century Comic, making them cousins, though the slightly older boy looked much frailer, most likely due to his father San Comic as well as the rest of his family being quite skin and almost skeletal. 'Okay, anything else?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Just that Ganon has been seen near the Valley of Maleficent, so unless you hear otherwise that's the best place to start' Morgan groans internally, the Valley was on the other side of the region to the Demigod camp and was the site of Grima's taming of her steed of which the Valley got it's name. it was also basically a dragon preserve, meaning if he got there, he would have plenty to chose from in terms of 'scaly critters'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Thank you' Morgan replies with a nod to which Serpens smiles before turning serious<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You get my daughter killed on this quest because you weren't ready to lead and got over eager, I'll tear out your eyes and heart' he hisses before fading into black smoke, Morgan shivers because despite being Robin's son, Kaos was on another level, having been old when the Gods were still maturing (Basically he's a titan to the sister's Greek Gods, he's part of the old guard so to speak)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing deeply he rechecked his supplies, weapon and armour before meeting up with his team, all who were ready to fulfil the will of the Goddess Grima, slayer of Naga the child eater (just kidding... or am I? Yeah I'm taking the piss). Retrieve her enchanted saddle from a monster following the orders of Ganon before he tames his own dragons and the Gods have to interfere themselves<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happens next?</span></div></div>",

Georgia was an attractive girl, with dark skin and a tall stature from her father and curly hair and brown eyes from her mother.  She had an athlete's build, lean and muscular, although already her metabolism was starting to mature and deposit some cellulose in her buttock area.  She was going on and on about timing requirements and breathing techniques, but Jill was only half-listening.

Jack knew the type; if his life continued the way it is, he'd end up cut off from all social contact.  Jack liked people like this; they presented him with a vacuum in which he could build anything he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn,\u201d said Tyler, watching footage from the day's volleyball game.

She can expand or contract her foreskin at will, or form a vacuum seal to act as a sort of condom, capable of being filled with anything that comes out of her urethra. Her ass is also quite huge, and her pubes stretch across her taint and reach to circle her anus. She has amazing powers too, being able to alter her own body any way she sees fit, or changing someone else\u2019s body with a single touch. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, instead of being reanimated with her former teammates, because she still lived on, she decided to reveal herself, anding the war and subjugating all. She was the undisputed goddess of the world, and her first act was to dominate the bitch who nearly killed her.</span></div></div>",

Now allow me to return the favor,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemari\u2019s clothes disintegrated, leaving her completely naked, desperately trying in vain to cover her shame. Tayuya laughed at how embarrassed her new fucktoy was becoming, \u201cNow how should I start? I could stick your face in one of my pits, or I could pin you under my big fucking balls, but I\u2019d love to have you eat all my dickcheese!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said this, her foreskin pulled back, revealing an ungodly amount of reeking smegma. Temari tried to pinch her nose, but her fingers didn\u2019t clamp her nostrils shut, they stopped just before making contact with her nose. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll do all of that in order, now come sniff, bitch.\u201d Temari couldn\u2019t control herself, she began walking towards Tayuya, and despite her best efforts not to, stuck her face right into her right armpit. The stench was overwhelming, yet she was compelled to inhale the odor and even start licking the hairy underarm. After a few minutes, she switched yo the other pit, which was just as horrible, even though she had experienced one already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemari finally removed herself from the armpit, and now had another look at the monster cock of her tormentor, the foreskin had once again covered the end, and in fact had stretched, and like a condom, seemed to be filled with something that stretched it out, \u201cYou\u2019re pretty good at tonguing armpits, that was one of the hest orgasms I\u2019ve had in a while. Ahhhhhh,\u201d so her foreskin actually was holding in her jizz? And it began expanding again, but based on the satisfied noise she was making, and the fact that she wasn\u2019t erect again yet, \u201cAre you pissing yourself?!\u201d \u201cWhy the fuck not! There\u2019s nobody to stop me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, everyone else seemed frozen in time. Either she had somehow placed everybody under a massive genjutsu, or she actually stopped time! Tayuya\u2019s foreskin suddenly began contracting, yet none of the fluid that was sloshing around inside seemed to be spilling out. Soon her smegma coated glans was once again visible, and now had even more vile cocksludge caked on, \u201cNow lie down and let me teabag you, if you liked my pits, you\u2019ll LOVE my ballsweat!\u201d Tayuya said somewhat sarcastically.</span></div></div>",

Tayuya stepped over to position her sack above the sand kunoichi's face, \"This is perfect, there's no way your mouth can fit my nuts, but you'd better open wide anyway.\" And as she said, Temari's mouth opened, just in time for Tayuya's scrotum to cover most of her face. The blonde's nostrils were infiltrated by pubes, forcing her to smell the rank ballsweat. Her mouth couldn't fit much, but it made for an easy sweat receptacle. Tayuya shifted herself from time to time to change which parts of her balls were where, as well as raising and lowering them. Eventually, she was done using her unshaved nutsack to torment her current plaything, now it was time for the main event. Temari rose to her knees, her face only 3 inches from the tip of Tayuya's schlong, \"Hope your stomach isn't too full from all of my sweat, cause that was just an appetizer, you've just won an all you can eat serving of dickcheese!\"she shoved her stinking rod towards the sand slut's face, causing her to reel back, \"The longer you put this off, the nastier my cock gets, so unless you're already a perverted whore who WANTS me to be as stinky as possible, you'd better hurry up. I know your mouth isn't big enough yet to get around my shaft, so you'll have to lick every square inch of smegma off with just your tongue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemari reluctantly leaned in, and stuck out her tongue. When her tastebuds reached the foul substance, she felt the urge to vomit, as if she had just tasted poison, but nothing came out of her mouth but distressed sounds, unable to stop herself from licking away the rancid filth from the behemoth of a penis she had been so unfortunate to have encountered. Nearly an hour after she started, Temari had finished, Tayuya's previously smegma coated wasteland of a cock had been licked spotless, but this was still only the beginning of Tayuya's dominance. \"How are you feeling, Bitch? Bet you wish I never returned, but I don't really care what you want, I care about what <i>I</i> want, and right now I want that whorish mouth of yours to fit anything I decide to put in it,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemari was changing. Her lips and jaw became numb, and when Tayuya thrust her cock at the gaping maw, it slid in effortlessly, despite how thick it was. Tayuya then pulled her cock out and instead had Temari's mouth envelop her scrotum, a previously impossible task. \"I wonder who I should fuck next?\"</span></div></div>",
