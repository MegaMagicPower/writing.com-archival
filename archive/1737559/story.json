Another day at his after-school job was done, and there was only the short run back home before he could collapse onto his bed. It had been a long day, and while he usually enjoyed the jog back home, it had been a long day for him. He shook his head gently as he moved through, wiping a bit of sweat from his forehead as he slowed to a walk, trying to catch his breath. He always seemed to stop at the same place, and he knew the path well enough that he could recognize when it was time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wouldn't have been surprising to anybody who had seen him. The creases on his clothing and the dirt over his face and legs made it clear that he was outside quite often. He wore a plain green shirt and a pair of jeans, but the sleeves and legs were frayed at the ends. His hair was a disshelved, tangled brown, and he had a few cut and scrapes along his body. If anybody had seen him, it wouldn't be surprising to find out that Gavin had been down the dirt trail dozens of times, and could recognize every tree along the way. The run was always a brief one between his home and town, and he usually took a break around halfway along it. He gazed along, spotting a couple of familiar trees before his eyes passed where the dirt path seemed to branch off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe path shouldn't have been there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavin stopped along the dirt trail he was on, looking at the ground. He glanced around for a moment, shaking his head to try to clear his mind. However, when his vision settled again, the new path was still there. He approached it quietly, trying to look at it. Although it was barely a path, it was quite clear that someone else had been there. The brush that was normally there had been cleared away, and the branches and leaves on the ground were worn in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe checked his watch, glancing at the time before turning back to the trail. There would be plenty of time before it got dark, and the trail seemed clear enough. Although he didn't know how it got there, it didn't seem too rough to follow. Taking another glance at the area before he stated to walk again, Gavin began moving down the new path. However, it only took a couple of moments before he stopped again, a subtle noise sounding from around him. He turned to try to get a quick glance around, but didn't notice anybody nearby. He swallowed hesitantly, before deciding what he would try to do.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Shaking his head and dismissing the noise as the wind, Gavin quietly began walking, doing his best to follow the trail. Although it was clear that someone else had been traveling down the path, he found it difficult to stay on. There were simply too many spots where the path seemed to vanish, only to reappear a few feet away. Luckily, Gavin had enough experience outdoors to realize where the path was, and where the ground had remained untrodden. He did his best to move quietly, a little apprehensive of what might've been around him. However, as he moved, he couldn't pick up any sound past the few that he made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he kept moving, Gavin began to jog again, the path becoming clearer now that it had gone a distance away from the road. Something felt odd about it, but he continued at a quickened pace now that it was clear. He glanced around as he moved, trying to keep his bearings straight as he pressed onwards. Despite the odd turns that the trail seemed to take, he continued moving. It soon became clear that someone had done a quick job in trying to cover their tracks, but he couldn't imagine why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly stopped. It was clear that he wasn't the only one, the sound of crunching leaves and twigs echoing far too long when he did. His heart began to pound as he heard the sound approach, completely sure that someone else was nearby. He glanced quickly, trying to pinpoint the source of the noise, but the movement between the trees paused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there?\" Gavin spoke clearly as he looked around, but there was no response. He turned quietly, trying to look around before shouting again. \"I know you're here, so just come on out! Look, whoever you are, you don't need to worry, I'm just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't have a chance to say anymore. Gavin felt something push firmly into his side, knocking him off of his feet and onto the ground. He felt something pressing him down, his arms barely able to move. He tried to turn, but found it difficult to move, and could barely figure out what was pushing against him in the confusion of the moment.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Without a moment to spare, Gavin quickly struggled against the weight pressing down on him. Though the attack was sudden, he could manage to barely lift whatever was pushing against him. Without a chance to look, all he could identify were the scales almost scratching against his front. With an effort, he pushed back, only to wince as he felt something scratch deeper over his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an effort, he managed to push the creature back. Heaving his weight into it he did his best to try to get the creature pinned to the ground, only to receive a sharp pain on his arm. It felt like he had been bitten, and he could barely react. He did his best to use his other arm, striking at the beast and feeling its grip loosen. Without losing another moment, he shook himself free before both of his hands pressed down, doing their best to pin the beast. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as they went downwards, he could feel his hands pressing and scratching the scales. It was tough to push down, but even as they dug into his palms, he continued to shift and hold. His weight pushed forward, Gavin nearly on his knees as he half-pushed, half-fell against the creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough he held the creature firmly against the ground, he wasn\u2019t in any condition to celebrate his success. His clothing was torn and scratched, and what was still intact was coated in a layer of dirt. Panting a little for breath, he looked down to see the creature that he was holding. </span></div></div>",

He shook his head a little, half-convinced he was imagining something, but when his vision re-focused, the creature was still there. He began to raise his hand, planning on wiping his eyes, but the feeling of the creature\u2019s limb moving after made him quickly push down upon the green scales again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tried to look over the dragon\u2019s patterns, a little bit curious. Most of its body seemed to be covered in dim brownish scales, almost faded away despite the afternoon sun on it. The dragon\u2019s head was shaped a little longer than Gavin would\u2019ve thought, and its eyes were a deep yellowish green as they glared back up at him. He took his time inspecting over the dragon, his breathing slowly calimng down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his pulse quieted, all Gavin could do was look at the creature, trying to figure out what he might do. However, though he remained silent, the dragon began to sound out, growling quietly. His voice made Gavin jump a little, but his weight remained firmly against the dragon. As the dragon continued, Gavin\u2019s alarm began to subside. Though he didn\u2019t know for sure, he could\u2019ve sworn hearing a bit of hesitation in the creature\u2019s voice. He paused, his grip loosening a little bit. Lost for words, Gavin only managed to spit out a quiet question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2019re a dragon, right? \u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon\u2019s eyes widened for a moment, a bit of surprise clear in his gaze. His struggling seemed to cease, and he gave a small nod in response. Gavin nodded in return, speaking quietly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cO-okay\u2026 And you can understand me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother nod. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow. Okay\u2026 Um\u2026 Can you talk?\u201d Gavin\u2019s throat was a little dry as he asked, but he tried to ignore it, noticing the dragon\u2019s mouth slowly open\u2026</span></div></div>",

Though he had half-expected a response, the dragon\u2019s voice had surprised him. Even though the creature was still small (at least, for what a dragon might be), his voice had been surprisingly deep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay\u2026 And you\u2019re a male, then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon only gave a small smirk as he tried to move back onto his feet. \u201cNaturally.\u201d He stumbled a bit and winced, Gavin automatically reacting to hold him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEasy! Don\u2019t think you\u2019re-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet go of me!\u201d Gavin nearly dropped the dragon upon hearing him shout, his hands moving back enough to at least soften the fall, the dragon flat on the ground with his limbs outspread. \u201cWhy are <i>you</i> trying to help? You\u2019re the one who-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI only pinned you because you attacked me, and I didn\u2019t mean to do it that hard. Besides, you didn\u2019t exactly leave me in good condition, either.\u201d Gavin\u2019s tone was a bit bitter, his hand carefully moving to examine his own wounds. However, after a couple of moments, he paused as he saw the dragon glaring at him. \u201cLook, I\u2019m sorry, okay? But I\u2019d rather not leave you like this, and you\u2019re not in any condition to move. Will you at least let me try to check your legs?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Gavin\u2019s gaze shifted to the dragon\u2019s left forelimb, an eyebrow raised. \u201cFine\u2026 Just take a look\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavin nodded quietly, slowly moving closer. The dragon continued glaring, clearly suppressing the desire to bite Gavin the moment he had gotten close enough. He paused for a moment before carefully letting his hand touch against the dragon\u2019s scales, close to where his hand had been earlier. The dragon winced as he carefully took it, moving a little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t seem like anything\u2019s broken\u2026 Just a sprain, I think. I can\u2019t be sure, though.

I\u2019ll try to make you a sling or something, though to be honest I\u2019m not really sure how that\u2019s supposed to work for you.\u201d He worked in silence, the dragon watching curiously as he worked, struggling a little bit as Gavin tried to fit it along his neck. \u201cThere\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon nodded quietly before turning to look at Gavin. \u201cThanks.\u201d With that, he slowly tried to limp off, moving a little bit awkwardly. </span></div></div>",

It just didn\u2019t seem right that he had a dragon in front of him, and the last thing he would see is it limping somewhere, maybe even getting stumbling onto someone else. He raised his voice a little bit as he shouted towards the dragon. \u201cYou need some help?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon paused, growling quietly. Gavin shook his head as he stood up. \u201cFine, I get it, I get it. Take care of yourself, then.\u201d However, before he could take more than a step, he heard the dragon\u2019s voice again. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 This way.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavin turned back, to see the dragon lifting his good limb up, pointing it through the brush. \u201cErm\u2026 I think I can lift you, if that\u2019s alright\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon gave a begrudging grunt before nodding. \u201cFastest way, right? I\u2019d rather have a human take me back than stay out for longer. Just hurry.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach the dragon quietly, letting your arms slide under his body. With a bit of an effort, you manage to lift him up in both arms. He shifts a little bit, his back curling a little as he tries to get comfortable in your grip. You wince as you feel his scales brush against you, a couple pushing against the scratches you already received. It takes a few moments, but he eventually settles down, Gavin just glad he was no longer shifting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo? Going to move sometime today?\u201d The dragon\u2019s voice had a bit of impatience to it, and Gavin simply sighed as he started to pick his way through the underbrush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat how you treat everybody doing you a favor?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon looked down at the ground, avoiding Gavin\u2019s gaze. \u201cSorry\u2026 You\u2019re the first human I\u2019ve seen, so\u2026 No idea. I heard you guys attacked or ran whenever you found out about us. When you had me\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh\u2026 Sorry\u2026\u201d Gavin chuckled and let his hand give the dragon a light squeeze, pressing into his scales firmly. \u201cHonestly, I can\u2019t blame you. I mean, a dragon? I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s seen you guys for ages, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you scared someone, or got spotted as some hunter\u2019s target or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh? You mean, I\u2019d scare you if\u2026\u201d The dragon cleared his throat a bit before he began to growl. Though Gavin had heard it before, he still couldn\u2019t help jumping a little bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, you would.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon broke into a smile, chuckling to himself as he turned on Gavin\u2019s arms. \u201cGood to know. I\u2019ll just use that next time. Much easier than jumping someone.\u201d He gave a small sigh, turning to avoid a stray branch as he looked at Gavin. \u201cGuess I should be glad that you weren\u2019t one of the guys who would attack me, then. Well\u2026\u201d He looked towards the sling on his body, shaking his head. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t hurt me too bad, at least.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavin turned for a moment, suddenly focused on the path instead of the creature in his arms. \u201cSorry\u2026 I\u2019m honestly surprised didn\u2019t just fly away after that. Heck, that sure would\u2019ve made getting you back a whole lot easier.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon chuckled and responded quietly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He turned his head slowly, looking back up at Gavin. He signed quietly and nodded. \u201cOkay\u2026 I guess I have to get used to humans sometime. You could\u2019ve done a lot worse when I jumped you, so\u2026 I guess it\u2019s fine. But nobody else, okay? You tell anybody else, or have anybody follow you here, and I\u2019m not gonna show up again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavin chuckled and bent down, moving eye level to the dragon. \u201cGot it. The fact that you\u2019re here is our secret, then. I\u2019ll try and be here the same time tomorrow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d better.\u201d Though the dragon grunted a bit, he gave a small smile as he looked at Gavin\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m just a bit surprised, though\u2026 Thought I\u2019d be able to eat a human before I actually met one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, no eating me, okay?\u201d Gavin chuckled, his hand patting the dragon\u2019s head without a thought. It took him a second to realize what he was doing, but before he could pull it back, he heard a quiet growl. However, though he began to pull back, he realized that it was much calmer than the ones he had heard the dragon make earlier. \u201cErm\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon suddenly pulled his head away, shaking his it violently about. A blush was clear on his face when he finished his display of shaking off the feeling. \u201cDon\u2019t just\u2026 go about doing that! Just\u2026 ask first or something! Just because I like it doesn\u2019t mean you should\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavin just chuckled quietly, nodding as his hand moved back, his eyes glancing on his wristwatch along the way. \u201cAlright, then.  I\u2019d better head back as well now. I\u2019ll try to meet you here at around the same time, okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee you tomorrow, then\u2026 Erm\u2026 What\u2019s your name, human?\u201d The dragon had already moved off of his feet, taking off a few feet into the air and flapping rapidly as he began to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s Gavin.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cLezorin? Are you here?\u201d Gavin walked into the area, a couple of plastic bags in his hand. He glanced around the area a couple of times, trying to make sure he had walked into the right spot. Although the distance from the road wasn\u2019t that long, he had simply followed the faint trail that had been there the last day. However, there were more than a couple of times where he paused. He didn\u2019t want to go all the way and end up stumbling on where else Lezorin might\u2019ve been, but he could only wait so long. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused to sit on a nearby log, resting for a moment and looking around the area. He closed his eyes, wondering where he might\u2019ve gone. It was possible that Lezorin wasn\u2019t even out yet. Dragons couldn\u2019t wear watches, and it was completely possible that he had come earlier, or would be there a bit late. The area seemed familiar enough that Gavin couldn\u2019t really look elsewhere. It was possible that he should just wait for the dragon here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his thoughts were interrupted by a sharp growl. Before he had any time to consider it, he felt a heavy weight pressing against his back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOomph!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands pushed forward against the ground as he tried to keep his chest from hitting his knees. \u201cLezorin? Please tell me that\u2019s you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha this time!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavin slowly bent back up, Lezorin sliding gently down his back as he did. \u201cCareful\u2026 I might be wearing a new shirt, but the scratches still sting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo? Your back\u2019s fine, and I didn\u2019t even damage your shirt! You can\u2019t complain about that!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavin winced a little bit and let the dragon slide down, shifting enough to let him get a decent seat on the log. \u201cMaybe, but I\u2019ve still got a couple of huge scratches on the front. I\u2019d rather not touch those if I can help it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHumans sure take a while to heal, don\u2019t they?\u201d Lezorin chuckled as he moved, shifting his nose into the bag. \u201cI mean, it was just a few scratches, and they weren\u2019t that deep!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you\u2019re not exactly fully healed, either!\u201d Gavin gave Lezorin a gentle nudge, his bad limb shifting slightly as he continued digging his nose through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot fully, no, but mostly. I probably could\u2019ve managed for the day, but-\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019d still want to visit anyways. Even if you can survive without food for long enough, something tells me it\u2019d be a bad idea to have a hungry dragon next to the road I take almost every day.\u201d Lezorin growled as his teeth tore at a package, almost ignoring Gavin to try to rip it open. He watched the dragon continue tearing and biting at it, before chuckling to himself, reaching  over to pick up the bag. Lezorin\u2019s mouth hung on to it for a moment before opening. \u201cJust let me open this one.\u201d As he tore open the pack, he looked at Lezorin. \u201cWhat do you eat, anyways? I brought a couple of bits of meat, but I have no idea which you can actually eat.\u201d </span></div></div>",

Can eat berries and fruits and stuff, but it\u2019s not the best stuff for me.\u201d Upon hearing the package tear, Lezorin leapt at Gavin\u2019s hands, the package of jerky on the ground as he chomped on its contents. \u201cMmmmmm\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope that works for you\u2026 I can\u2019t really hunt or anything on my own, and I honestly can\u2019t say what processed food might be like for you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLezorin finished the bag within the few seconds, shaking the bag off of his muzzle before turning back to Gavin with a chuckle. \u201cI\u2019ll be able to swallow a person whole, with whatever they\u2019re wearing or carrying at the time.  I think my stomach can handle it.\u201d Gavin looked a little nervously at Lezorin, who simply grinned in return. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon took a step closer, growling quietly. His tongue slipped out for a moment, and his muzzle slipped underneath Gavin\u2019s shirt, his skin feeling the saliva on Lezorin\u2019s tongue. The sudden motion forced Gavin\u2019s mind to alarm, his balance quickly slipping away as he fell onto his back. His hands reached forward, trying to hold Lezorin away, but-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a rather loud laugh, Lezorin getting up on the log with a wide smile as he sat there. \u201cSeriously? You seriously thought I\u2019d bite?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, how am I supposed to know?\u201d Gavin tried to hide his embarrassment as he moved back up, Lezorin moving back to the bag. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come on. I sure can\u2019t swallow you whole yet! Besides, even if I could, I wouldn\u2019t want to eat <i>you</i>!\u201d Gavin turned, a little confused and uncertain of whether to be grateful or insulted. Lezorin just chuckled as he kept digging in, pulling another bag out. \u201cAfter you found me and caught me, there really wasn\u2019t anything I could do. Far as I know, you could\u2019ve killed me while I was like that. Dragons aren\u2019t exactly common, so I\u2019d imagine you\u2019d get a huge bit of attention for that.\u201d He sniffed at one of the bags before pulling out a package of raw chicken, expectantly dropping it into Gavin\u2019s lap. \u201cInstead, you helped me back up, carried me halfway home, and fed me. Or, you\u2019re feeding me now.\u201d Gavin sat silently, but another nudge from the dragon made him chuckle and work on removing the wrapping. \u201cPoint is, you were good to me because you could be. It\u2019s not like I was threatening you, or I was about to eat you otherwise, but you were still good to me. Think you deserve better than just getting dropped down my throat, even when I get big enough for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks.\u201d Gavin gave a sigh of relief as he tore the plastic off, placing it gently near Lezorin. \u201cTo be honest, I was kind of worried about that. Lezorin was quickly chewing again by the time Gavin moved his hands away. \u201cGuess I\u2019m lucky that I met a dragon like you\u2026 Well, extremely lucky, since meeting a dragon is lucky enough. Meeting one that\u2019s not going to eat me really ups the bar on that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLezorin just continued eating as he looked back at Gavin. \u201cJust be glad you had a chance to talk before I\u2019m big enough to start eating humans.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, come on. You say that like it could happen any day now!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLezorin chuckled and shook his head, taking another bite before speaking with a rather large grin. </span></div></div>",

It\u2019ll slow down after a year or so, but it never stops when we\u2019re apart from other dragons. Weird, huh?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavin nodded as he picked up the bag, placing it on his lap as his hands dug through it. \u201cA little bit, yeah.\u201d Lezorin looked up expectantly at him, and Gavin\u2019s eyes glanced back towards him. However, he stopped, placing the bag onto the ground. Lezorin gave him a confused look as Gavin stood up.  \u201cHang on for a minute, then\u2026 Can you stand here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLezorin turned his head curiously, but shifted off of the log, standing up. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWant to get a good idea of how big you are now. About\u2026 My knee, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile on all fours, yeah. Hold still!\u201d Lezorin jumped a little awkwardly forward, Gavin taking a step back reflexively as he saw. However, in a moment, he felt Lezorin\u2019s weight gently pushing into him. He winced a little as he felt his claws pushing against his abdomen, one of the scratches stinging. \u201cUp to your chest like this!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavin gave a slight cry as the pain made him lose focus, falling backwards onto the ground. Lezorin landed a little roughly on his body, just laughing quietly as he did. \u201cHey, watch the scratches, okay?\u201d Gavin gingerly put his hand to his front, pushing Lezorin into his lap as he tried to sit up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLezorin only laughed as he settled down, sniffing at the bag again as he sat there. \u201cWell, now that you know how big I am now, I should probably warn you\u2026\u201d Lezorin paused as Gavin shifted back up, doing his best to crane his neck upwards and make himself appear taller. \u201cI\u2019ll be your size within a month!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavin raised an eyebrow as Lezorin held his pose. \"Seriously? A month?\" He chuckled as he reached into the bag, opening a bag of chips for himself. By the time he had pulled it closer, Lezorin had already stuck his muzzle taken a fair bite from its contents, crumbs spilling from the bag and onto the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!\" Lezorin eagerly sat there, his tail wagging gently. Gaving couldn't help but smile, almost comparing the dragon to a dog as he watched him. \"At least, that's what my parents said... That I shouldn't have problems with humans by then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, I believe you.\" Gavin chuckled as he took a couple out, chewing quickly. \"I mean, right now, I'm sitting with a dragon on me. I really don't think I'm in a position to doubt you.\" He smiled as he felt Lezorin's grip pulling at the bag in his hands, but he just lifted it a bit higher, the dragon's maw almost dangling for a moment before it slipped off. \"I guess that's why you're eating so much now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, and human food is pretty good!\" Lezorin only kept smiling as he sat there, looking eagerly at Gavin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but you can't have all of it... That's partially my food for the week or so.\" Gavin only chuckled as the dragon turned his head away. He nearly finished the bag before dumping the rest of its contents onto Lezorin's muzzle. He glanced at his watch as the dragon quickly shook the food off, eagerly slurping up what was left. Gavin picked up the bag before speaking again.</span></div></div>",

Just bring a snack for me!\" He gave his wings a few flaps, a little more steady as he hovered up to Gavin's eye level. \"And don't tell anybody, okay?

After managing to steady himself, he rose, looking down at Gavin and almost growling a bit. \"You'd better not!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavin only chuckled again, nodding as he picked up the bag. \"Same place, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you here.\" Lezorin began flapping again, slowly managing to move away from the spot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time until the next day was a lot smoother this time. The wounds on Gavin's body were no longer stinging, and he had plenty of time with the weekend off. A bit of curiosity made him wonder about what the dragon might've been doing, and after breakfast, he decided to leave in the morning to get a better look of the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrabbing a few things in his pack, Gavin followed the familiar trail into the area. He yawned as he felt the sun gently on his face, shaking off the last traces of sleep that remained. He casually moved to the meeting spot, deciding to use it as a reference point before getting another look at the area. </span></div></div>",

It took a moment before he could find the trail again, but he had an easier time following the path. It looked as though Lezorin had become more careful, and there were few traces of him approaching the road this time. However, Gavin didn't have a problem tracing the few tracks that the dragon had left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved slowly, the trees slowly growing more familiar to him as he moved. It wasn't too hard to push through, though it was clear that Lezorin had been flying more. It took a while for him to follow along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he had to pause as he heard Lezorin's growl.

He swallowed as he kept moving, but Lezorin didn't seem to budge as he came into Gavin's sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spotted Lezorin on the ground, munching softly on something. Though he couldn't see what, he gave a small sigh of relief. Gavin was amazed that he hadn't been spotted yet, and continued moving closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLezorin definitely seemed distracted by his meal, but Gavin didn't know if he could get any closer without getting noticed. Instead, he decided to step out a bit more into the open, speaking rather clearly. \"Hey, Lez! Busy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had expected a response, but apparently, Lezorin hadn't even heard that. The dragon simply continued to munch down on his meal. Gavin began to approach slowly, but Lezorin was still clearly distracted. As he moved closer, he could hear his clear growls and his mouth chewing firmly at his meal. Gavin stopped a couple of feet from the dragon, even moving in front. He bent down to try to meet the dragon's eyes, but couldn't force his gaze upwards. Lezorin was staring intently at his meal, as though it might still run away at any moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Lez!\" Gavin almost shouted as he tried to get his attention. Lezorin definitely heard that time, his entire body springing upwards. However, before Gavin could say more, Lezorin had begun moving, and before he could properly react...</span></div></div>",

Lezorin shook his head firmly before speaking. \"Don't... startle me like that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavin carefully let Lezorin back onto the ground, his hand trying to check for any scratches on his face.

However, as he struggled, he was unable to make it move, the beast feeling far too heavy for its size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an effort, he managed to turn the beast over. However, before he know it, he felt its weight down on him again. He made an effort to shout, trying to shift it off again, but found his shoulders firmly pinned to the ground. All he could see was the dark fur of the creature as he struggled, a blur of it moving against him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavin did his best to try to strike at the thing, but his wrist could barely move before he felt a sharp pain against it. He shouted, trying to throw a punch with his other arm, but was unable to make a good impact. He heard a brief sound of hesitation, but a moment later, that arm was pinned against his body. He found himself unable to move either of his arms, and it was impossible for him to do more than struggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe winced, his body held as he notice the beast's head approaching him. He reflexively closed his eyes, the creature's breath washing over his face and growling quietly. He tensed up as he felt it, uncertain of what he could still do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as the seconds passed, the creature didn't seem to do any more. Uncertain of what was going on, Gavin paused to try to take a breath. The sound he heard made it quite clear that the beast still had him, but there wasn't a thing he could do about it. A few more seconds ticked by before he dared to open his eyes, getting a close look at what held him. </span></div></div>",

It certainly wasn't easy, considering the fact that there was a wolf's head held a few inches away from his. He didn't see how he could possibly move away, but he didn't want to end up provoking it. All he could do was nervously hold still as he watched the creature, closing his eyes as he felt the beast's growls against him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swallowed, bracing for the pain that he knew was coming. There was nothing he could do against it, and his body just seemed to tense as he closed his eyes. The seconds passed, and while he did his best to stand it, it was impossible for him. The feeling of the beast's paws on his body kept him to the ground, but closing his eyes only managed to heighten his worry. He slowly opened them again as he looked at the wolf. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhere along the line, the beast had gone quiet. His gaze had met the wolf's eyes, and the creature no longer seemed to be bearing its teeth at him. He swallowed again as he looked at it, uncertain of what he could possibly do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat in silence for a minute, simply staring at one another. Gavin tried to shift and pull away from the beast's grip, but there was still too much weight on his side for him to move free. He winced slightly, but stopped moving as he looked at the creature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-so... Y-you're not a normal wolf, are you?\" Gavin barely managed to speak at it, and he saw the beast's ears give a small twitch. The creature gave him a momentary look of amusement, as if it didn't expect Gavin to notice. It seemed to give a small nod, and Gavin felt the weight on his body lessen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beast's paw remained on Gavin even as he pulled back slowly. Gavin just sat and watched the creature, and as it pulled away, something odd about the creature slowly became more apparent...</span></div></div>",

It seemed to thicken and lengthen, pushing out against his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't just his arms. His his torso was stretching and pushing out as his limbs shifted, slowly turning more humanoid. Its fur seemed to shift subtly, and its legs spread back as he moved onto his knees. Gavin could hear a forced growl as the creature pushed up, his neck bending and his body stiffening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGavin felt his body freeze as the transformation seemed to finish. The creature still easily looked down at him, holding him firmly in place. The beast was easily a couple of feet taller than him, and from its weight and build, there was no way that he would be able to make it budge. All he could do was stutter out a few words. \"Y-you're... a werewolf...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You catch on fast.\" The creature grinned at Gavin, its voice deep, a hint of a growl still in it. Gavin swallowed and nodded as he looked over it. Its body pushed out, each muscle showing through the fur, and its voice's tone clearly identified it as a male. Gavin only swallowed again as he felt the creature's muzzle close one again. \"Much easier to talk like this...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I guess?\" Gavin really didn't know how you were supposed to react. However, he had to wince a bit as the wolf shifted. \"C-could you let go of me? Starting to sting...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf's hands seemed to move down, still holding Gavin tight as they moved onto his legs. Gavin inspected himself, grunting as he tried to sit up. \"T-think I'm bleeding a bit... You didn't scratch me, did you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf only gave a laugh, just loud enough for it to echo against the trees. \"Worried?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Erm... Sort of... I don't... I don't know how this works... If you injure me... Um.. Getting scratched is supposed to transform me or something, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swallowed, but the wolf gave another loud laugh as he looked at you, before responding...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Yes, I only thought about writing one branch so far. I'll join other branches if someone has an interesting post, but for now, I'm primarily going to focus on the one. <br>\r\n__________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeen writing a lot in other interactives, so I thought I'd give writing this a try. Feel free to add, but I'll try to have at least some chapters done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe setting is a fairly standard modern setting, but not everything is as it seems. Creatures that you might see are the standards of fantasy and myth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd prefer to be loose with the rules, but here are a few brief guidelines. If you feel like there's a good reason to violate one of them, go ahead, and I'll try to avoid unnecessary edits, but going against these are more likely to lead to edits/deletions: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. The rating's 13+. Keep that in mind whenever you're writing. <br>\r\n2. <b>Try to avoid creating \"choice chapters\"</b>. It's easier to find another area to work an idea in than for a reader to go through 10 consecutive \"Yes/No\" options. If you want more space, you can open it up with more general actions. <br>\r\n3. In general, paths are self-contained. Using a character or concept from another path is fine, but re-introduce them to avoid confusion. <br>\r\n4. Try to at least write a couple of paragraphs. Short entries are fine, but ones that are only a sentence long probably won't be of decent quality. <br>\r\n5. I reserve the right to edit or delete chapters as necessary. I'd prefer to only edit my own chapters, and I'll try to send the author a notice for anything I do to it, but if something's ridiculously inappropriate, I won't hesitate in changing it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'll only add more guidelines if it becomes necessary, but use your common sense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeel free to message me with any comments!</td>",
