For weeks they started rumors that they were going to rebel and put everyone (particuly those snooty jocks) in their place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jocks on the other hand felt that the nerd's pathetic attempts to scare them was luaghable but when they saw the those geeks weren't joking they knew there was going to be a battle but they were comfortable enough with their pysacal prowess that the nerds were no threat to them<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the day of the Battle arrived many bookworms stated it would be just like the French Revolution but since hadly anyone had read Les Miserables no one knew what that meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow who are you?</span></div></div>",

Two jock anthros, an elephant and a rhinoceros held you in place. Brendan took out what looked like a laser gun from his pocket and shot you with it. The first thing you noticed when you looked in the mirror was your hair. The medium length blonde hair you haid was changing color to a deep black. Once it had stopped, the hair retracted almost completely into your skull, and you were now sporting a buzz cut. The hair in the middle started to rise up slightly fron that, and it forned a short mohawk. Stubble started to grow on you where you couldn't grow anything before, and a five 'o clock shadow was now on your face.<br>\r\n\"What is your name?\" asked Brendan.<br>\r\n\"Ichabod Crane.\" you replied. 'What a stupid question.' you thought, 'He knows me.'<br>\r\n\"No, I don't think that's right.\" said Brendan.<br>\r\nYou couldn't stop yourself from saying \"No, it doesn't.\". Ichabod had never seemed right. People shouldn't have called me that. It wasn't my name.<br>\r\n\"I think your name is Gunther Leary.\" said Brendan.<br>\r\n\"Well, of course.\" you said, \"That is my name.\". On the inside, you were gasping, but you had no control. Ichabod wasn't you. He was some kid stuck inside you. You are Gunther. No one is Ichabod. There is no Icahbod Crane, he doesn't exist.<br>\r\n\"Now Gunther, what do you like to do?\" asked Brendan.<br>\r\n\"I like school, and I like plotting against the jocks.\" you answered.<br>\r\n\"Since when? The only thing you like about school is the football team. What's your IQ?\"<br>\r\n\"My IQ is 160. But that doesn't matter, I only care about football.\"<br>\r\n\"Listen carefully Gunther,\" started Brendan, \"Your muscles are too small. They are going to increase in size for every IQ point you lose. All you will be able to remember is basic things, and football. You will be huge and dumb by the time the transformation is over.\"<br>\r\nYou look in the mirror and see your muscles start to grow. Important things like chemistry and math seem to loss their importance to you, and soon you've forgotten about it.\"<br>\r\nIn about 2 minutes, you look and notice you seem to have stopped.<br>\r\n\"Now Gunther, what is your IQ?\" asked Brendan.<br>\r\n\"I dunno! Not like I care!\" you exclaim.<br>\r\n\"And about plotting against the jocks, why would you do that? You are a jock!\" asked Brendan.<br>\r\n\"I dunno.
