You barely had time to see her Bunny butt come at you before your head was enveloped inside it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed, trying to struggle and get out, but the lopunny had you in a position which stopped you from moving! She twisted her hips over your shoulders, before her pucker started to slip over them too! you were about to finnaly get your hands in the position to push her off, but your arms were suddenly pinned to your sides by the lopunny's muscles.

She sighed happily as she tugged you up inside her rear more and more, inch by inch. Eventually only your feet were left outside, and soon your toes would be shut inside, her pucker slipping over them like a prison door as it sealed you inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wimpered, but knew she would probably let you out... untill you remembered something... you read about these creatures in one of your biology classes. Creatures that can take an entire creature inside of them... you then paniced. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis lopunny had pulled you inside, but it had known an ability that locked it's prey inside, so that escape would be forever possible...

It was then that I noticed that she did not have on the dress that most Gardevoir's had on. Instead she was naked and her white breasts shown under the sunlight and her green nipples contrasted her white breasts quite nicely. The next thing that I saw was that her ass cheeks were as big as her breasts and her hips was wide enough to fit her rear without making them look like two pieces of flesh being attached to her rear. all other of her kind she had the standard green hair and red eyes with the spike wedged in between her lovely assets.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Just great...\" you mutter under your breath as you raise your backpack above your head to act as a makeshift umbrella. Today certainly did seem like a good day to go camping. The sun was up high as there was hardly a cluster of clouds looming above earlier this morning. That all changed however once you managed to make it halfway through the forest. Ill prepared and uncertain as to just where to head to avoid the torrent of rain, You quickly make your way underneath a tree branch to get a good view of your surroundings. \"come on.\" you groan as your eyes scan about the floral landscape of the sea of trees. As your eyes begin to scan towards the right, you soon manage to find a large cave entrance hollowed within what looked to be a mountain side. Unsure about the supposedly dry area, you slowly make your way inside the mouth of the cave to gaze curiously into the darkness. Your eyes slowly start to wander about the interior of the rocky structure as you couldn't manage to spot any sign of life residing from within. \"Perfect.\" you mumble with a smile as you slowly begin to enter into the recess of the mountain side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few yards within the cave, you decide to stop and rest seeing as how no stray raindrops from outside were landing inside. With a small shiver, you quickly try your best to swipe off the clinging droplets of water that bombarded your entire body. As you vigorously attempted to dry yourself off, you were starting to quickly regret not bringing along some sort of towel in your backpack. Despite the lack of a drying cloth, you luckily manage to get rid of most of the moisture, with the exception of your hair and damp clothing. Exhausted from your arduous hike and the dash underneath the torrent of rain, you lean back against one of the hard rocky walls to catch your breath. As you took the moment to enjoy your rest, you eventually turn your head to gaze out at the mouth of the cave to gaze upon the downpour from the storm. As the droplets continued their ceaseless descent down to earth, you begin to wonder just how long this storm will keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a long sigh, you lay your head back lazily seeing as how you were basically stuck within this cave for the time being. Still worn out from the hike, your eyes soon begin to get heavy as they slowly begin to close on their own whim. Just as you were about to embrace a small siesta however, an odd sound emerging deeper from within the cave suddenly attracted your attention. \"w-wha?\" you stammer as you quickly back away from the darkness in surprise. You could've sworn that you checked inside the cave and couldn't find anything. With shaky hands, you slowly reach to the side of you backpack to fetch your flashlight. Unsure as to just what lied deeper within the cave, let alone if it would take trespassers lightly, you reluctantly turned on the light while moving it towards the roof of the cave. The light did manage to illuminate the area from its vantage point, but as it did, it only revealed that the cavern was much deeper then expected. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCuriously, you get up as you slowly lower your flashlight to shine deeper into a dark chasm. \"huh...\" you mutter ultimately surprised by just how deep this cave was. Whether it was due to curiosity or something akin to stupidity, you slowly begin to make your way deeper into the earthly structure. At first you thought this cave would end not too far off, however after what seemed like minutes passed by you still found yourself descending deeper into the strange abyss. Midway through the tunnel, you soon recognize an entryway into a humongous stone chamber. \"w-whoa...\" you gaze in awe as you slowly shine the light to the left of you. Just by seeing how far the light made it to the farthest section of the chamber, it was clear to that it was hundreds of feet away from your current position. you could only imagine just how huge this odd area was in total.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were taking in the sights, an odd sound suddenly emerges from behind you. A great shiver runs down your spine as what sounded just like a loud moan resonates from your back. Slowly, you nervously begin to turn your body in a complete 180 in order to gaze upon the source of the strange noise. Once you manage to turn your form around however, you were suddenly greeted by a shocking if not mesmerizing sight. Lying right behind you was what could only be considered a giant! or giantess to be precise. Her body was adorned in a light orange tint of fur as her abdomen and chest carried a light cream colored marking. As your eyes met with her large ample breasts, you quickly notice that she was completely in the nude, with the fur acting as a sort of cover for her private areas. Upon gazing more towards the right, you soon manage to gaze upon a massive vulpine head resting upon crossed furred arms. Long locks of red hair swoop down from behind the familiar three ringed bun as they immediately end in slight curling forms. The color and overall form of the giant pokemorph was undeniable. Resting right before you was a giantess sized Vulpix, roughly the size of a building commonly seen in a city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith wide eyes and mouth nearly agape, you wonder just how a massive vulpix managed to enter such an area, let alone through the cave that you entered. As your mind quickly begins to race with questions over the sudden discovery, another loud moan quickly snags your mind back to reality. Another groan soon follows as the vulpix shrugs her shoulders and moves her head ever so slightly. In no time at all, her great amber eyes slowly begin to flutter open as if something was waking her up. Immediately, you gaze down at your beaming flashlight with wide eyes as you try to shut off the power switch. \"nghhh...wha?\" A feminine voice mutters as your entire form freezes up by the sound of her voice. Nervously. you raise your eyes upwards before noticing the massive giantess gazing confusingly down at you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"huh?\" The great vulpine pokemon says as her huge head cocks ever so slightly to the right. As her amber orbs are glued straight down upon you, you stand perfectly, uncertain of her intentions or just whether or not she saw humans as lowly creatures. Running was a completely futile option considering just how huge she was, and even if you did manage to evade her and make it outside there was still a chance that she could easily bring down the tunnels in rage. For seconds, the both of you stare at one another in a rather awkward fashion. It was almost as if meeting up with someone for a blind date...a date that was ginormous and could kill you at the spot that is. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"e-errr...\" you stammer trying to find the right words to say to the huge vulpix. \"u-ummm....Hello?\" You ask in a stammering voice. While the question did seem utterly ridiculous and stupid overall, just maybe...MAYBE you could manage to make conversation with her. If that was possible, then maybe trying to dissuade her from harming you would be a piece of cake?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
