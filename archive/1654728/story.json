Natsuru walks over to Sakura. \"Hey Sakura. So you got out of the mental hospital?\" Natsuru asks. \"Yeah I got out yesterday! \" Sakura says happily. Sakura puts her hand in her bag to grab something. \"AAHH DON'T HURT ME!\" Natsuru suddenly screams. \"Hmm? What's wrong Natsuru? Im not gonna hurt you.\"sakura says. She takes out a small packaged bundle. \"Here Natsuru! these are rice balls! I made them as a token of forgivness to you and your friends. Look im really sorry. For everything. You know, attacking you, sending my white kampfer to attack you, controling you, and almost killing your friends. Sending me to that mental hospital was the best thing you could do for me. You didn't send me to jail or anything. Well anyways bieng at that mental hospital made me think of two important things.\" Sakura said. \"Oh? Well what are they?\" Natsuru asked suspiciously. \"Number one, how much im sorry and how much your friendship means to me and two... well... umm... well you.\" Sakura answered. \"Me? Well ok. I accept your appology but this is your last chance.\" Natsuru responded. \"Oh thank you Natsuru! I promise i won't attack you or your friends again!
