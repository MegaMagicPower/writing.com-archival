            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Here you come across the crowds of all types of furrs.  There are a few of the arena champions and competitors showing off their muscles, cocks, and bodies while at the same time trying to secure sponsorship as they sign autographs and display themselves.  They stand upon elevated platforms so that everyone gathered around can view them as they show off, make comments onto the overhead loud speakers, and generally go about their business. Even a couple take volunteers for their cock and are actually voring people after a waiver in front of the crowd outside.<br>\r\nThese various competitors are behind a velvet line of cum stained black ropes and have several security guards ensuring few if any people can actually get past them without good reason.<br>\r\nNot only for the competitors safety but for that of the crowd, as if the competitor got a hold of one of them, there is no promise they would not be the next layer of cum on the platforms and ropes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVarious lines are formed and roped off to show where people should go.  New competitors are arranged by blue for males, purple for herms, and pink for females.  Though the females usually only unbirth or consume someone orally and generally have a hard time getting in.  Next there is a black roped off area that is labelled, sponsors only.  Apparently you require a VIP card to get over here.  Lastly there is a white roped off section lined around the block for spectators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich one are you coming up here?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You are one of the various sponsors that help fund and make things such as this stadium possible. Though crowd funding covers some of the cost to run this stadium, it is through YOUR wallet and those like you that this stadium and what happens in it is possible. So when you or one of the other sponsors enters the stadium in your sectioned off area the security and management make sure you are well taken care of. You've lived a rather rich and powerful life style, getting almost anything you want. Whether it be through bribes, display of power through hired goons or even showing people just how talented you are in person and making them disappear for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, you got your wealth or how you use it, no one dares to stand in your way for fear of ending up turned into cum, or some other fate. For as a sponsor you get lots of special treatment, if you wish to see two fighters go at it you can have them do it. If you want to participate in a match, you can do it. If you want to have someone brought to you so you can enjoy them in your own personal way, you can do it. There isn't much that you can't do in your sponsor sectioned area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course this will all mean nothing to you if you lose your special badge or ID that tells you are a sponsor. For the moment you lose it, you are as vulnerable as anyone else to the whims of those around you. So you keep that in mind and keep your card close at all times. After all, you're not the only sponsor here. And many of the other sponsors would love to do the same to you, as what happens in the arena.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sponsor section is designed to be more regal and elegant. Having servers and waitresses taking orders for things like food and drink, or even becoming snacks themselves. Thus why the floor is made of smooth stone, so that the mess made by the sponsors enjoying their company is easily washed away. After all as a matter of pride and presentation the arena makes sure to keep its sponsor area clean. No matter how much its sponsors dirty it up. Each sponsor is allotted their own booth which gives some of the best views of the arena and the fights inside. But it's only the lucky few that get the best seats within the sponsor area. And it has been known to happen where sponsors have taken their quarrels on to the arena floor itself to settle disputes over who sits where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk to the sponsor arena a single male Ork guard blocks your entrance. It is clear by his stature and demeanor he has had many threats against him before and by his sack hanging between his legs which squirms with the features of some hapless full that he is also not afraid of dealing with people posing as sponsors. \"Identification please.\" Comes his gruff voice as he stares at you waiting for you to show your identification as to who you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly look at the Ork in his armor and his struggling sack and you...</span></div></div>",

Seeing as you have only got a ticket to the stands, it seems best for you to follow the white ropes leading in rather than those spurting out but all the same, you came here to watch the vore so why not enjoy the pre-show a bit...</span></div></div>",

Here, life and death are tested by a method of consuming your opponent with a cock and then turning them into nothing but cum for characters to spray over the audience or into others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will allow pretty much any form of vore, sex, and other things.  I would ask to keep humans to a minimum and no underage things.  Beyond that, have fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinimum post is 3 paragraphs, and yes I will delete anything short of that, or I may ask you to correct your grammar if I find it is in need of it.  This is to be considered constructive critism by you in order to improve your grammar rather than something that you should take negatively, afterall, we all want to write amazing good stories for people to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond this, have fun, enjoy the story, and if you do enjoy, add to it.</td>",
