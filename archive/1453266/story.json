Suddenly, your soul is sucked out of your body and enter's Blake's body. You slowly open your eyes and notice that you are now lying in bed. You smirk slightly and quickly remove the covers and see that you're only wearing a pair of boxers, just like Blake wore before he went to bed. You then ran your hand across your stomach, feeling your new, developing abs. You were now your roommate. You look down at your boxers and see a decently sized mountain rising from them. You lift up your boxers to get a look at your new cock. \"Bigger than I thought..that's a plus..\" You think to yourself before placing your new hand around it and giving it one quick stroke, causing a little bit of pre-cum to squirt from it. You then remove your hand from your boxes and climb out of bed. You look at your previous body, which is now asleep in your old bed. You slowly remove the talisman from your old neck so you don't wake up Blake. You then examine it. \"This thing is awesome,\" You said with a small smile. You then think about what to do next. Should you explore your new body a bit more, live as Blake for a few hours, or try swapping with someone else?</span></div></div>",

You wrap your new hand around it and begin sliding it up and down your cock. It feels so amazing. You keep doing it over and over until cum shoots out and onto the floor.

You do know that you don't have class today, right?\" He asked you. \"I know Mr. Peterson, I was just coming here to ask you something,\" You tell him. It's strange being called Blake, and hearing his voice come from your mouth. \"Ask away,\" Mr. Peterson tells you with a small smile. \"Would you be willing to switch bodies with me?\" You ask him. He then looks at you, a bit confused. \"What do you mean?\" He asks.\"I mean that you become me and I become you. I kind of want to see how it is being the teacher,\" You reply, hoping he says yes. Mr. Peterson sits in silence, thinking, before finally answering. \"Sure. It sounds fun,\" He tells you. You then grab the talisman and switch bodies with him. Mr. Peterson's body was much different from Blake's, mostly due to the fact that Mr. Peterson was twenty-seven. You look down at your new body. You are now wearing a suit and a silver watch on your left wrist. You look over at Mr. Peterson, in Blake's body.

You don't sleep in only boxers! Blake does that!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Why am I naked!\" You exclaim to deaf ears but your own. You notice the talisman dangling from your neck, hitting your chest lightly.

It's only a matter of time till everything comes together in your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god... I'm in Blake's body...\" You almost whisper to yourself, finally realizing the change in your voice. You swing your legs over the side of the bed, sitting properly, clad in only those pure white cotton boxers your friend is so adamant about sleeping in. You kind of understand why he does it once you get a feel for them, but the fact of being in his body makes the situation awkward in your opinion. You stand up and scratch the back of your head, only to feel hair a bit longer than your own, just enough to be gripped and called shaggy, but nothing too long. You trail your hands to your chest and down your stomach, resting at the waist band -- fiddling with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god this is awkward on so many levels\" You think to yourself. You take a peek beneath the boxers, if it's now yours you might as well check it, right? It seems a little bigger than your own, but not by much. The fabric slaps back against your waist and you kneel down by your bed. Your REAL bed. It's almost noon today, thank god you don't have classes. Blake would have gotten in trouble otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou move your head close to your old body, and shake it, slowly pulling Blake out of his sleep.</span></div></div>",

It looked oddly... cute for some reason. You always took your looks and body for granted, but being someone else, you can truly appreciate just how much effort you took to get definition here or there. His hips thrust into the comforter of your bed, and a thought occurred to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning wood\" You spoke with a smirk gracing Blake's features. It's too soon to call them your own, or so that's how you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned over and whispered into his ear, \"It's time to wake up dude, I got a surprise for you\", to which you only got a simple \"Huh?\" In return. You shook his side, trying to get him to wake up, only to have him roll over and mumble, just barely coherently \"Wha'dya want man? Tryin' ta sleep\". Was it weird to find the simple talk adorable? It was like hearing a baby talk with a grown voice. He went back to shaking the all too familiar curves of muscle on his old body, finally, granted the time of day to show his roomie the discovery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd through sleepy eyes blake's mouth dropped, stunned seeing himself in front of.. well. Himself.</span></div></div>",

You want to feel what it's like to swim with Blake's athletic body and talk with some of the guys, but as you walk by you pass by a mirror, remembering that you haven't really gotten the chance to fully explore your new body. If you stay behind you'll be late and probably get yelled at by the coach but if you go to practice it won't be a while before you're free again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You don't want to get yelled at so you don Blake's goggles and swim cap and make your way to the pool area. The water is freezing at first but as you start swimming laps you feel a lot better. In fact, you feel great. While your technique isn't perfect with Blake's physique you are able to fare pretty well for most of practice. After an hour's worth of a good workout the coach decides to give everyone a break and start a game of water polo. At first you're not sure what to do but you hear someone call Blake's name and you turn to see that it's Dan who wants you to play on his team. You agree and take an offensive position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game begins and you see how rough the guys are. Underwater wrestling matches for the ball take more than 10 seconds. One of the opponents throws but Dan manages to intercept it. \"Blake!\" he yells and tosses the ball to you. Using Blake's powerful legs you jump out of the water as high as you can and barely catch the ball, then hurl it with surprising force into the goal. Your team cheers and there are high fives all around as you make your way back to your side of the pool. When the ball came back in play the same thing happened: Dan received the ball, passed to you, and you scored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on until practice was finally at its end with your team as the victor. In the showers, a totally nude Dan walks up to you and pats you on the back. \"I never knew you were such a stud at water polo, Blake\" he said with a grin. A couple of the other guys voice words of agreement. You try hard not to look at the lower half of his body. \"What can I say?\" you reply with a smirk. Once done your showering you go the lockers to dry off. As you're about to pull on some underwear, one of the guys walks up behind you and snaps a towel against your buttocks. You reflexively clutch your, or rather Blake's butt in response to the stinging sensation. That's when you realized Blake kind of had a hairy butt. It felt weird since you were used to yours which was perfectly smooth, but so as to not attract attention you stopped probing and chased the man who slapped you for revenge. After you had a few hits in with your towel you finally get dressed. Dan walks up to you. \"Yo, me and a bunch of other guys are going to be playing ultimate frisbee at the park at 3. You in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. \"Sure,\" you say. Then you remembered the real Blake. \"Oh, and my roommate Eric might want to play too. Would that be okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" Dan replies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake decided not to go with you to play ultimate so you don white tshirt and comfortable silver basketball shorts and leave for the park alone. It's not like his mad at you. After all, you explained once you got back that you didn't want him to be late to practice and he seemed to understand. You're not sure what Blake is or has been doing your body, but for some reason you don't feel that bothered at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game begins and once again Dan chooses you to be on his team. It's a tough match, with both teams being about even in skill, but you manage to make a lot of great plays. Halfway through the game Dan takes his shirt off, treating you with the sight of his amazing, tanned, well-toned upper body glistening with sweat. You decide to take off your own shirt as well, and the wind blowing against Blake's exposed torso feels great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone on your team hurls the frisbee through the air and you blindly follow its path. You hear an \"I got it!\" not too far away when suddenly you feel bare skin against bare skin and head against head. You had collided into Dan and both of you were on the ground. He starts laughing and so do you. Then he gets up and offers you a hand. \"You must be pretty tough,\" he says. \"I have a really hard noggin so I'm surprised you're not knocked out or something.\" The two of you try to stagger back to an open spot but you accidentally step on Dan's foot. \"Whoa, you and your big feet,\" you exclaim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know what they say, the bigger the feet the bigger the shoe size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it was 'the bigger the hand the bigger the glove.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, same thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, whatever you say, Dan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game was at a tie and the guys decided that the next point would win. Someone on your team manages to intercept the frisbee and passes it to you. People from the other team dash into your direction and in a haste you chuck it towards the end line. It's a bit low but Dan manages to jump ahead and catches it. You then waste no time in sprinting to the end line and Dan casually passes it to you, scoring a goal and winning the game. The two of you chest bump, though it was a bit weird doing it with no shirt and pressing your sweaty bodies against eachother. \"Man, how come we don't hang out all the time,\" Dan says as the two of you pull on your shirts. You smile and say, \"I don't know, but we definitely gotta do it more often.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, well I'll see you around,\" Dan says and he's off. You watch him leave and sigh. Then you see Chaz walking up to you. He has a sneer on his face and it's making you uneasy. \"Yo, I'd watch out for Dan if I were you. Sure, he gets a lot of biddies but he's ultra clingy to his guy friends so I wouldn't be surprised if he was gay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay...\" you're not quite sure what to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I'm saying is, watch your ass when you're around him,\" he says snidely. \"See ya.\" And he's off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you make your way back to your room you weigh your options. You might stay in Blake's body a little bit longer. You suppose it all depends on whether or not the talisman starts working again. You're certain that it will though, so you start weighing your options. Dan was a total stud with a body to die for, and it is quite true that getting girls is ridiculously easy for him. You've had a crush on him, and though Chaz's words may just be him being a jerk, it does give you a glimmer of hope that he may not in fact be straight. Trying to get with him may result in a dead end, but it wouldn't hurt to at least find out and put your mind at ease. You begin to formulate a plan. Ultimately, you decide that your goal is...</span></div></div>",

You'd better get ready as I don't want you to be late.' Says Blake who is now in your body, finishing getting changed into your clothes. He's somehow managed to find all your clothes apart from a top. He's rummaging around in your draws obviously trying to find one. You decide to help him out a little and point him to the wardrobe. But enough helping you get dressed, you need to put something on as you're still only wearing his boxers. and swim kit. You walk over to his drawers and open them. They are a mess. There are boxers mixed in with shirts, shorts and socks. After a few minutes of piling through, you had managed to find socks, clean boxers, top and shorts. You take the pile through to the bathroom, where you could get changed in privacy. You're not sure why you want privacy as it's not your body but for some reason you do. Besides you could have a quick peep and compare his body to yours. You lock the door and drop the clothes onto the floor. Feeling highly curious you fiddle with your Calvin Klein waistband, and slowly slide his boxers down your now smooth, thin legs. You take a quick peep in the mirror at his member and quickly reach for Blakes clean boxers. Despite feeling uncomfortable on many levels, you hesitate and look again in the mirror. It's suprisingly big for his body, a little bigger than your member. But he's let down by the lack of much of a forest. He's clearly not very far through puberty. Disgusted with yourself for looking, you pull your new boxers up your legs. Followed by shorts and a t shirt.\u00a0You then unlock and leave the bathroom now you're changed. You grab Blakes swim shorts off the radiator - they're still wet. There would be now way you would ever wear them, but you have to. But worse still, they're skin tight. You would never wear them in your old body, but with blakes smaller, skinnier frame, hopefully they wouldn't look as outrageous as they would on you. You shove them in one of blakes sports bags along with a towl, goggles and a swim cap. Before you leave for the first time as Blake, you double check your new reflection, flick your long blond hair into place and head out, leaving Blake stuck as you for the rest of the morning. </span></div></div>",

You take off Blakes nice converse trainers and leave them on the rather empty shoe racks. Without waiting you head through to the boys changing rooms and surprisingly, it's empty. It won't stay empty for long though as the sessions start in not too long. The place isn't deserted however as there are four or five bags on the rails. Must be the keen swimmers at the top end of the school. You decide to make use of the lack of people and get changed before anyone arrives. You unbuckle your belt and the jeans fall straight to your ancles, they are pretty big for him despite being a small. That's how thin Blake is. You don't mind being thin as Blake does have some meat - he's not a twig. You then unzip Blakes bag and rhumage around for his shorts. They're  pretty easy to find as they are still wet from Blakes last training. You pull them out of your bag. They're rank. And they stink. And they're skintight. But you've no choice. You speedily slip down your boxers, and Put on blakes swim shorts - and you didn't have to look down there either! That would have totally creeped you out. You grab his swimcap and goggles and head off to the pool. On the way you pass a mirror, and as the changing rooms are still empty you decide to take a quick look at your new body. It's thin, tanned, lean. What your old body wasn't. But what really strikes you is Blakes six pack, you've always had a bit of a belly so this is a big change. Another change is how hairless his body is, his legs are smooth and his underarms have very little. Despite secretly enjoying looking at Blakes body you decide to stop. Your straight and checking out your roomies body is pretty gay. You promise yourself that that is the end. You pass the showers and through into the poolside. You take a seat on the bench by the pool and lean back against the cold wall. There are about four people swimming, all older than Blake. You've only got five minutes to kill before training starts so you might as well wait on the bench. You slouch back. Not much is really happening. The lifeguard isn't paying any attention, and the few people in the pool are doing lengths apart from one who is getting out. You guess he's just going to the diving board which is right in front of you. You'd be right as he's walking your way. You can't help but notice that he's and extremely fit guy. His six pack is bulging and his thighs are huge. You scan up and down his body as discreetly as possible. You wouldn't mind swapping bodies with him. You start feeling some raise in your shorts. SHIT. You immidietly panic, your hands go diving into your pants and tuck Blakes dick into the waistband followed by lifting your legs up to your chest, creating a ball shape and hiding the hard one. You think you got away with it. The guy is meters away now, you now recognise who he is now, you've seen him around school. <br>\r\n'Reet Blake, bit keen aren't you?'<br>\r\n'Err... Explain?' You reply nervously<br>\r\n'Training ain't on for the under sixteens, duh' He said grinning<br>\r\n'Oh yeah, err, I didn't know, thanks' You reply keeping your legs tucked in as much as possible trying desperately to hide your raging erection. Thankfully the guy turns and walks towards the diving board. Your situation is made even more awkward however as you cannot keep your eyes off his arse, this just makes you stiffen down below even more. The pleasure is short-lived however is he dives in - leaving you on the bench alone. Very confused you wonder if Blake is gay? Surely you can't have adopted his sexual orientation? His body is one thing, but that too? You guess you have Blakes brain too.. You stop. Your just getting confused. It's thankfully calmed down in your pants so you decide to go back to the room and get some answers from Blake - if he's still there.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You would normally regard a blue blazer as an annoying, immature boy, yet to hit puberty - and now you are one! You give blake a nudge of the elbows, immitating how chaz acts, and point at your morning glory. You let out chaz's trademark laugh, Blake laughs too. As chaz lies there in your body, confused, you decide to crack a size joke, along the lines of mines bigger, something immature, something chaz would come up with, something that puts Chaz on the spot. He just lies there, and manages to splurt out a short, 'what's happened?'. You ignore it, and decide to leave him to it, besides you need to find out about his swimming gala, it must be soon, otherwise he wouldn't be up and dressed so early on this fine weekend morning.

You pass Robbie on the stairs, your best friend. You were about to stop and say hi, but you just remembered you're not his best friend anymore, you've probably never even talked to him! This is wierd. Finally, you reach chaz's corridor, it's further than you thought! Or maby it's just because you're a lot smaller, you're old body was a rugby player, a forward, and now you're younger, thinner, shorter, and less muscly. You're not totally sure what Chaz's body is like underneath his clothes, you've never thought about it, as far as you know, Chaz is pretty much a twig. You arrive at Chaz's room, keys... You dive deep into his blazer pockets, phone, money, some homework, and a used tissue. Eww. You dive into the other pocket, equally full of crap, but you find a key, with C32 engraved into it, that's the one. Just before you place the key in the door, it opens, it's Jonny, Charlies room mate. He's quite a cool guy, he played for your rugby team, which was quite impressive, as he is in the year below. He's of average height, and is pretty unfit. He's also crippled, he did his leg in in a match not too long ago, he's got to walk around in crutches now. The conversation was fairly short, he's off to watch the rugby team play. Its good news, you will have the whole room to yourself. Give you time to figure out what has just happened. You stroll into the room after you saw off Jonny. It seemed so strange, he actually thought you were Charlie, his roommate. Being called Charlie is something that you will not get used to, and hopefully not have to, hopefully you will be able to work out how to work that tailsman rubbish that made you swap bodies, lives even.</span></div></div>",
