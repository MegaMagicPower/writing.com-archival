She was small no more then eleven inches tall and the clothes she was wearing before were in a pile along the floor and she was on top of the pile wearing the dress. \"OH MY GOD\" Said Lilly.

Sally who had been stroking her sisters hair with her pinky finger stopped suddenly. \"Awwww your scared\" said Sally. \"Yes I'm scared you could squish me if you wanted too\" said Lilly. <br>\r\nQuite suddenly Sally grabbed her sister and held her like she would a doll. \"Don't worry little one I'll take good care of you\" said Sally with a grin of mischief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SALLY PUT ME DOWN RIGHT NOW\" said Lilly banging on her sisters fists. Sally ignored her sister and skipped happily to her room when she opened her door she threw her sister in the air. Lilly landed on her sisters pillow at the head of Sally's bed. Sally Jumped in the air and landed in front of her sister. Lilly looked around her sisters room dolls and doll clothes were lying everywhere in the corner was a large doll house next to a toy box and in another corner a small, round, white table with four empty chairs around it and a plastic tea set on top of it. She continued to look around for several minutes until she looked up at her sister who was looking at her sister eagerly as though she was supposed to entertain her. \"Take a picture it'll last longer\" said Lilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally giggled happily not taking her eyes off her sister. \"were going too have so much fun little Lilly I'll play with you, and I'll feed you, and I'll dress you\" said Sally.</span></div></div>",

In the middle of the corner there was a pink runway like the ones models use but it was just her size and around the runway were translucent boxes upon boxes all filled with doll clothes.<br>\r\n\"We're going to play dress up\" said Sally with glee. As Sally began to slowly pull the dress off her body that Lilly desperately hoped that the second the dress was removed from her body she would grow back to her normal size and then she could start planing her revenge against Sally for treating her like a toy.<br>\r\nHowever as she was lying in her younger sisters hand naked Lilly was forced to accept that the dress had done its magic and just taking off the dress would not free her from the spell.<br>\r\nSally placed her sister on the floor and said \"now you be good and wait while I find you some new clothes\" in a soft but commanding tone as though she were talking to a five year old.<br>\r\nLilly seeing a chance for escape started to run as fast as she could. It was five minutes before Sally turned around and and saw the empty spot an the floor she looked up clearly worried. However as she her tiny sister running across her room that she giggled and got to her feet. \"Here I come Lilly you better run fast\" said Sally in a playfully voice as she walked over and picked up her sister. Lilly looked into the face of her sister it wore a look as if Lilly were a fun wined up toy that Sally had to chase and capture. And then she spoke as though Lilly was trying to entertain her \"Well well looks like someone's just full of energy but we have to get you dressed first you cant play naked you'll catch a cold\" said Sally as she carried her sister back to the corner. Sally then forced her squirming sister into a red dress covered in rose's.</span></div></div>",

Finally Sally said in a sweet yet commanding voice \"ok Lilly you wait right there while I go get us a snack\" the second grader giggled as she left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow alone in the room Lilly began to walk around the bed and climbed up a pillow and sat on the edge. She glanced around sadly looking at the doll house she could now live in and at the thought she giggled. Lilly knew that all things considered she was safe that her sister playful as she might be would never harm her. Sally was very gentle even with her normal dolls. Also Lilly thought as though reassuring herself of her safety Sally had already made it clear she as going too keep her feed and even if she wasn't Lilly knew that at her current size she could survive for a year on a single slice of cheese.<br>\r\nThe door opened reveling a smiling Sally with two fruit snack bags in her hands as she jumped into bed right in front of her sister. \"One for you and one for me\" said Sally. The next few minutes passed wit out much activity Sally eating her fruit snacks in great numbers and Lilly nibbling at hers it wasn't until Lilly slipped on the wrapper of her fruit snacks that anything happened. Lilly got up from the wrappers trying to heave the fruit snacks off her Sally giggled. The eight year olds hand pealed a cherry of her sister and dropped it into Sally's mouth. \"Awwww Lily you're so sweet oh but look you got your pretty dress all messy\" Sally said giggling at her own joke. \"Very funny now help me out\" responded Lilly. \"Ok Lilly don't worry Lilly we'll get all cleaned up in a nice bubbley bath then it'll be time to go to bedy bye\" said Sally addressing her as though Lilly were a young child who had gotten dirty playing.</span></div></div>",

Meanwhile Lilly was standing on the sink trying to remove the sticky dress. Sally with the bathtub filled with water and bubbles spilling out from the sides glanced over at her shrunken sibling and giggled. Lilly was still on the sinks edge the dress only half off. Sally walked over to Lilly helped her  and looked down at her with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally held out her palm and allowed her sister to climb on and then entered the bathtub. Lilly swam through the foam on her back looking up at the bubbles in awe. She saw the the thousands of translucent balls and with the light reflecting through them it gave her the impression that she was surrounded by thousands of different sized suns. <br>\r\nThe bubbles gave off a pleasant scent of lavender the water was just right not to hot or cold but pleasantly warm. As she lay there in the light of the bubbles that for one precious moment Lilly forgot everything it was as though she could just lie there and float in the bubbles forever. However this moment of peace was shattered by the sound of a giant splash for a moment Lilly wondered what it was but realized in an instant that her sister had submerged below the water looking for her so she swam out of the foam into her sisters view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh there you are Lilly I thought you might have drowned\" said Sally in a relived voice while she squeezed soap in her hair. \"I was just swimming around\" Lilly responded climbing on the edge of the bathtub. Sally then gave the soap bottle another squeeze and let a generous amount of soap cover her sisters head. \"Gee thanks you think you could put a little more on next time\" Lilly complained. At this Sally lost her temper and picked the bottle of body soap and this time poured it onto her sister until Lilly was a massive blob of liquid soap. \"Is that enough or should I squeeze you through the top\" said Sally. \"Oh very funny\" said Lilly sarcastically as she heaved massive amounts of soap off her self. As bathtime came to a close Sally picked Lilly up off the edge and skipped merrily off to her room.</span></div></div>",

Sally looking down at her sister had tears rolling down her cheeks \"I'm s-sorry Lilly I n-never thought a-about it like that if you want we can call mom and dad in Hong-Kong\" she said with a voice of concern.

Unable to stifle a sudden curiosity, she surreptitiously grabs the jeans and gets into the room to try them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow with more time to spare looking at them, Lilly noted that they look like the jeans'd fit her just fine- only intensifying the curious whim that led her to grab them in the first place. She quickly removed her own pair of pants before starting to don the male ones. She easily pulled them up all the way to her waist, although it was somewhat tight around her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWearing the jeans, now, Lilly started to feel somewhat strange. Her lower body tingled, and she suddenly realized the jeans were actually quite comfortable. After a few minutes of sitting there feeling comfy in the pants she'd found, she started to realize (with a certain tinge of apprehension) that something was very much different from how she was used to. She realized that since she'd put on the pants, there was this sense of something where, previously, there was nothing.</span></div></div>",

It was very unfamiliar to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked in the mirror, her eyes tracing the reflection from her pretty face to her nice figure. When her eyes reached the jeans, her hands ran over her legs, from the hips down to as far as she could reach without bending her body. She wrinkled her nose as a serious itch worked its way onto the skin she had just touched. She scratched her legs, thinking that the jeans weren't as great after all. But they felt so comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill lightly scratching her legs, Lilly turned her body so she was looking at her reflection from the side. She frowned again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGee\u2026 I know these are boy jeans, but I didn't think they could downright make anything look flat.\u201d The girl thought, her eyes on her usually plump rear end that now slightly resembled a board. One of her hands unconsciously moved to her backside, as the itch had spread there too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe right hand scratched her buttock and the left one moved closer to her thighs. \u201cCheap material\u2026\u201d Lilly thought after checking her flat looking butt in the mirror, all the while furiously scratching her skin. Her left hand moved from her inner thigh to her crotch, intending to relieve the uncomfortable itch from there as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilly\u2019s moth formed a slight \u2019O\u2019 when her hand touched her crotch area. There was something there. It felt soft and itched more than any part of her body.  Her small hand cupped the foreign growth, trying to figure out what it was. Squishing it gently gave her a pleasant sensation and it seemed to grow a bit when she did that. It hurt if she gripped it. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She loved to adorn herself in anything pink, expensive, and cute looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is one of the reasons she initially scoffed at the idea of a football sofa. Of all the idiotic things, why would somebody want a sofa with such an uninspired and ugly design? She went to walk away, but unfortunately for her, one of the few employees of the place came by. The guy looked to be about a year or two older than her, with extremely pale skin and somewhat red eyes. His dirty blond hair was a mess, and his red shirt was wrinkled beyond belief. He was rather tall, and a bit gangly looking. He also carried the voice of a stoned highschool drop out, as she was about to get a very good listen to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey dude, find something you like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well it figures any store trying to pawn this thing off would hire such shoddy employees.' she thought to herself as she prepared to address this loser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not particularly, no. I was just skimming by this section of furniture and saw... this.\" She made a motion with her hands to the old sofa. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah cool, yeah that's been around here for a while. Nobody must like football and sitting on their butts anymore. Weird, since that's what I thought the American dream was.\" The supposed stoner laughed at his own joke while Lily gave him an overly exaggerated eye roll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll be leaving then.\" She went to leave, but as she spun around, the heel on one of her stilettos mysteriously snapped. She fell face first on the couch, and the stoner placed his pocket knife back in his pocket as he watched the transformation happen.</span></div></div>",

She got up, her scuffed up tennis shoes being much easier to balance on than any type of high heel, and her ripped jeans and t-shirt being vastly different in shape, condition, and color than her previous clothing choices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck did I even trip on?\" she asked herself as she looked around. On the ground, she saw a pink object of some sort. Picking it up, it looked much like the heel to some gawdy stilettos. She looked around and immediately noticed a lanky looking pale guy walking by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you know where the trash can is?\" she called out to him. He walked closer by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, it's over by the counter. You change your mind about the couch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" She looked over to the couch, and suddenly felt compelled to buy it. It would look perfect where the empty spot in the game room was, and just the right position for watching football with her dad on Sundays. The perfect fit for the father daughter duo. She didn't need to worry about her mom. Football wasn't her sort of thing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mom had always tried getting her to be more of a girly girl, and try to obsess over fashion or keeping up a cute appearance. Lily had always sort of laughed off the notion. She pulled out her wallet. \"How much was it again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seve-... Well it's usually twenty, but if you can tell me which NFL team is the best, I'll knock off five bucks. Special Sunday deal, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLily gave a confused stare for a bit, but then shrugged. \"Easy, Packers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenage employee nodded his head. \"$15 bucks it is, dude. You got a car big enough for this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we can just load it in to the back of my pickup.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool.\" The two got the couch moved easily, and soon Lily was on her way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the employee went back to the store, a young teenage girl was standing by the counter. She was a somewhat heavier African American girl, with long black hair done in braids. She wore the same outfit as the boy, red t-shirt and blue jeans. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know which was better, the transformation, or the mooching off extra money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy laughed. \"It isn't mooching if she feels like she saved money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl shook her head at her coworker's antics. \"I just never took you for a football fan, John. Let alone a Packer's fan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn sat down behind the counter and reclined slightly on the wall. \"Never even seen a game, my man. You're probably more a fan than I am, Sandy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy chuckled and checked a device around her wrist. \"Looks like we got another customer coming in shortly. You want in on this one, or you calling in your break?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll break on this one dude.\" He lifted the broken pink heel. \"I need to figure out what kinda stuff we can do with this thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would try to scam people with a broken part of a single shoe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn straight.\" He smiled before going through the door behind the counter. Said door immediately vanished as a vehicle parked outside. Sandy made sure to hurry and conjure up a new, differently designed couch before the person got out of their car. She then started wandering about, fixing clothes and reorganizing books and DVDs as the next customer entered.</span></div></div>",

He had just got done taking his little brother to martial arts class, where they both trained. Bill was slightly pouty as he'd failed the belt test that day, staying at a green stripe while Eddy advanced to full red belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's alright man. It doesn't matter what color of belt you get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill continued to sulk, looking at the buildings they were passing instead of his sibling. \"Easy for you to say, you got a red belt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but I did get a head start on ya by a few years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBill glanced at Eddy. \"So if I were older than you, I'd be better than you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEddy chuckled. \"I don't know about that, bro. Besides, I wouldn't go wishing years away. Soon you have to plan for college, adulthood, bills, jobs...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cars, staying up late, and getting to do fun stuff.\" Bill finished with a smirk. Eddy laughed. They continued their walk until Bill stopped. Eddy stopped shortly after to see what had halted their normal walk home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this place new?\" Bill asked. He referred to the new thrift shop-esqu place that had recently opened up. It looked a little small on the inside, but his friend Lily had said the inside had a huge variety of stuff. He thought she said something about going there to get some cheap furniture today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just got here a while ago I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n______________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy was reading a letter from management. Apparently their store was being looked at as 'too predictable' due to the customers never facing any mental dilemmas. In short, the customers always had their minds altered along with reality, and the powers that be that ran the shop found that dull. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't wait to tell this to John.\" She muttered. It was then that she saw another letter under the first. She opened it and felt an immediate rush of air zoom past her. 'Huh, another magic force?' she thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt read: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Dear employees of the new shop in town,<br>\r\nIt's a pleasure hearing I won't be the only one working this neck of the woods. This place is teeming with subjects ripe for the transformation. Definitely one of my favorite stops. As a sign of goodwill from one company to another, I've settled the trouble of your supervisors' worries about the mindset of your customers. My gifts are just outside the door, being viewed by your next interests. They'll give your customers a... fighting chance? Anyway, have fun.<br>\r\nSincerely, the proprietor of Spells R Us</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well... alright then. No idea what this is about. Let's just see what happens. If this thing screws anything up, I'll just blame John again. Gods know superiors never harp at him too badly.'

The preteen trio ran the gambit of eggings, grafiti, and all around general nonsense. Ike and Riley were both brothers from a very non-caring aunt looking after them, and Scotty was the only child of a worried couple wondering if their precious baby boy was hanging out with ruffians. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIke was the leader of the three. Despite not being the oldest, he had the most courage, and the stubborness and lack of impulse control that made most of their pranks hilarious and successful. He also was very emotionally driven, and was sometimes plagued by mood swings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiley, despite being the youngest of the three, was probably the sneakiest. He was nearly silent whenever he walked, and he rarely spoke. He also sported large blue eyes that he used to great affect when it came to getting what he wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScotty, the oldest of the group, relied on his wit and social skills when aiding the pranks. He'd usually be the distraction, chatting someone up or talking their way out of trouble if they ever got caught. Being an only child, he really wanted to connect with other kids his age, and he enjoyed hanging around people who he thought needed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was after a particularly brutal tp'ing of an elderly man's house that the three relaxed at their hideout, an abandoned old two story house a little out of town. There, they formulated new targets for pranks and hid some supplies. That day, though, Ike paced back and forht instead of chilling like the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" asked Scotty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is gettin... boring.\" Ike stated. Riley nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what should we do?\" Scotty asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIke sneered at him. \"How should I know? You're the smart one!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScotty smiled at the compliment, and tried to think of something. His mind went back to running by that cute older girl carrying the couch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could try doing something with that new store that opened up.\" Scotty suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"New store?\" Riley asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIke looked deep in thought, which was odd for him. Finally, he spoke. \"Let's steal something from there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScotty rubbed the back of his neck. \"Like, what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIke looked over at him with condescension. \"Whatever we want, dingus! Let's go!\" Riley followed him without hesitation, while Scotty brought up the rear with worry plastered all over his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n______________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy smiled as a former couple of quarreling kids left as two dating young adults. Before them had come an overly serious business man who she'd turned into a clown, and a smug heiress to a millionaire family into a trailer park occupant. She looked at her watch, seeing that the store would probably close soon. She wondered what she'd do after the shift was over today. Maybe go time traveling? Country hopping? ... Take a nap on her favorite couch? Oh the possibilities. Then she felt another presence getting closer to the store. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want me to handle these guys?\" John emerged from the back door, which disappeared as it usually did whenever someone wasn't using it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me check what their thought process i- oh.\" Sandy realized they were coming in to try and steal some things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know right.\" John gave his little chuckle. \"No matter where we go, man, we always got idiots.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll handle this. They're just kids, so it's not like it's gonna be a robbery or anything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn shrugged. \"Alright dude. So, gonna give em normal stock? Or something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy normal stock, John of course meant reality altering and mind altering magical items. That was what a majority of the content of the store was. However, there were a few exceptions. Some items only altered reality, some items only altered the mental state or physical state of the customer, etc. They rarely tried getting people to use the special stuff because it was much harder for that person to adjust to their new life. In fact, the only reason it was there was for people who tried stealing, using counterfeits, or using violence. Or whenever they were bored and felt like screwing with a rather rude person... only for a bit of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh, it's been a while since we've used that 'something else'\". Sandy said with a grin. John chuckled again. He knew how much Sandy liked getting involved in that stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright man, you do you. See ya tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You doing anything after work?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, might go, like, fight a war in a different universe or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandy smiled. \"Yeah, you look like you could use the exercise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn flexed his puny muscles. \"I already got these guns, what are you talking about?\" The friends shared a laugh and John left as soon as the three entered. Sandy knew ahead of time what they were going to steal, and thought about whether to give them the regular transformation, or a special one.</span></div></div>",
