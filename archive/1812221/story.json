Looking over to Tea, instead of his oldest friend, he saw a boy wearing the blue Domino City High School uniform for the boys. His hair was also brown, and a bit short. His face also looked a bit familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the boy looked over to him, he had a confused expression on his face. \"Yugi? Is that you?\" he asked, a worried tone in his voice. He also then placed a hand on his thought as his expression of confusion grew. \"Whats wrong with my voice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm Yugi...\" he replied, then noticed that his voice sounded odd. It sounded a few octaves higher. It was then that he also noticed why the boy looked familiar to him. He looked just like... \"Tea? Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tea, you... You're a boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they both looked down at themselves, Yugi saw that he was now dressed in the girl's uniform for their school with the pink blazer and the blue skirt and bow. He also now had a perky pair of b cup breasts, that while small, looked well sized for his, or rather her, body frame. His hair was a bit longer, with the black parts with red highlights now going down past his shoulders to her mid back, and the yellow locks had grew in length as well and framed her though it still had the bizare star shape on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did this happen to us?\" Tea questioned. \"I mean, I know we've seen some weird stuff before, but this takes the cake!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure...\" Yugi replied. As they were wondering what had happened, Yugi spotted the familliar figures of his friends Joey, Tristan, Duke, and Bakura.</span></div></div>",

When Yugi and Tea were able to see again, they look at each other with confusion.<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Tea asked.<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I...urgh\" Yugi says before feeling a strange feeling all over his body.<br>\r\n\"Yugi, are you all right?\" Tea asks loudly with concern. She runs up to him before seeing something unusual. She saw Yugi's spiky hair grow and droop down on his scalp.<br>\r\nYugi starts gasping loudly for air, each gasp sounding higher than the last. Seeing nobody within the area to help, Tea places her hands on the small boy's chest, preparing to give him CPR, before stopping. She feels something on Yugi's chest. Tea gasps in shock upon finding out what was wrong; Yugi was developing breasts. Tea proceeds with the CPR to help Yugi breath as the breasts grow in his body. The stress of the changes forces Yugi's body to turn red and sweat to cool down.<br>\r\nAfter a few more seconds, Yugi finally stopped panting, now breathing heavily to recover. Tea takes her off of Yugi, happy he is alright. Tea blushes, wondering how to break to Yugi when he asks about his new features. In truth, the bumps are only a modest A to B cup, but they are in proportion with Yugi's small stature and are big enough to be seen through his jacket.<br>\r\n\"Tea?...\" Yugi says, noticing his friend. Yugi's faint voice sounds so high, sounding like a innocent girl rather than a short boy. \"What happened?\" Yugi asks Tea again. Tea, not knowing what to says points down to ground. Yugi looks down, finally noticing his new parts. Yugi screams with a voice rather strong and high for a boy who was just ill. \"What... what...,\" Yugi asks himself as he sees he has changed in quite a few ways. Adding two and two together, both friends anticipate what is coming next. Tea looks away as Yugi checks underneath his pants. Yugi screams even more, seeing that his manhood, as well as any tingling sensation that proves it exists, is gone. At this point, Yugi can not move or speak from the shock. Tea approaches him, now her, hugging her friend.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His nasal perceiver turned into a delectably resplendent button nasal discerner and his square jaw-line became more curved and soft. His thin lips swelled up, turning into pouty feminine lips within an instant. His lashes grew and his hair perpetuated to grow down his back, losing its spiky hair, becoming straight solid hair.

Then a thin slit appeared composing a vagina fitting his panties it wasn\u2019t painful but he groaned at the plethoras of pressure inflicted on his face.     He prehended his bottom with his two hands, feeling the fat that had appeared as his butt commenced to stick out. while looking down he optically discerns that his height has dramatically incremented. <br>\r\nYugi then feels algid on his arms and legs, the final stages of the transformation were taking place. His modicums of body hair vanished and his skin intenerated.  His skin bubbled all over as it became softer, hairless and delicate. His hands shrunk, his nails sharpening like a feline.He visually examined the hair on his arms suck itself back into his body as his skin smoothened all over.  Yugi then feels his face is on fire. His heart was in his throat as he raised his shaky hands to his hair, splitting it down the middle to reveal the most pulchritudinous, feminine face he had ever visually discerned Tea's face.Tea then feels her chest seemed to be loosening, then looks down to optically discern that her breasts are shrinking to compose a flat chest.<br>\r\nTea is experiencing equipollent to Yugi, expect everything gets more immensely colossal for her, and falls down for the same reason, but her chest doesn't bounce and jiggle. Then Tea gets up by pushing her hand against the floor, while looking down she optically discerns that she has   shrunk,<br>\r\nTea's hair then commences to grow situating itself on top of her head and losing its straight solid hair, becoming spiky hair. Tea's incipient spiky hair then it changes from a light brown to yellow, remote red, and ebony, her hair perpetuates to grow until it has edges equal on each side. Tea then feels a pain in her lower area. A little later the pain Tea experiences is gone. Tea then feels an outlandish sensation in her lower area, where her vagina expeditiously transmuted into a penis, Tea then feels warm on her arms and legs, then her hands feel different. Tea then looks down to visually perceive that her  arms and legs, are no longer hairless and her hands are now longer feminine. Tea then feels her face is on fire. Tea then expeditiously walks to the restroom mirror wall, to optically discern that her face is becoming Yugi's. Tea feels her butt is shrinking until it becomes a boy's. the rest of Tea's body is loosing the rest of her feminine  features everywhere.<br>\r\n Yugi and Tea then feel a headache when in fact they are gaining each other's recollections.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She didn't realize how short Dark Magician girl's skirt was, only going down to her upper thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, but I think that card did this\" Yugi said. As he looked around he saw that his environment had changed. He and Tea were now in some sort of Forest, but unlike any other forest the trees seem to be taller than normal. In addition, the aura of the environment seemed surreal, like a dream. <br>\r\nFor a while the two looked over themselves and their new clothes. Tea's new outfit consisted of a blue, strapless magician dress, leaving her shoulders exposed and a jewel encrusted choker now placed around her neck. Her face seemed brighter as she now had makeup on it with her cheeks now red and rosy. On her head was a blue magician hat, revealing  a bit of her hair through a hole in between the hem of the hat and the top part. The rest of her short brown hair hung normally from her sides while the rest lowered down in a bunch down her neck similar to the real Dark Magician girls long hair. Her arms were now half bare with her forearms wearing two sleeves, a jewel on the edge of each one. On her chest was a red gem centered below where her cleavage was located, a quarter of it exposed. Her blue dress was clung tight around her waist and a pink miniskirt hung below it, barely covering her lower thighs. Finally on her feet were two cartoony looking blue boots. By the feel of her soles she guessed that her socks dissapeared. Yugi was dressed in the attire of his favorite card the Dark Magician. His body clad in a skintight purple magician robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Tea, I don't think we're in Domino city anymore\" Yugi said with concern, trying to say it easier with a jokelike tone. \"Huh\" Tea said. looking around when she realized he was right. \"Y-yugi, where are we\" Tea asked with panic in her voice, putting her hands up to her face and curling her fingers with fear. She got closer to Yugi. \"I don't know but it looks like some sort of dream world. <br>\r\n\"Well lets get out of these clothes first\" Tea said. As they attempted to take off the clothes Yugi noticed something that was a cause for alarm. The clothes wouldn't come off. \"Yugi, its stuck\" Tea said trying to pull of her sleeve. \"I... urgh, know\" he said pulling off his hat, or at least trying to. The clothing however, refused to come off theeir bodies, as though it was attatched to their skin. After numerous attempts they stopped, realizing it was useless to keep trying.<br>\r\n\"Pant, pant, We, we can't take... these off\" Tea said, kneeling down to catch her breath, her hands on her bare knees. \"Oh man, what what are we gonna do\" Yugi asked desperately hoping to find a solution to the situation. \"I have to admit though Tea, you do look pretty\" Yugi said, trying to look on the positive side. At that moment, Tea began to blush. Of course it was hard to tell with her rosy cheeks.\"Um, well, really\" she said shyly, her hands behind her back.<br>\r\nAt that moment though they saw something that looked like a duel spirit. It was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She wore the same blue and pink dress that Tea wore. It was then that the two discovered that this girl was no ordinary girl, it was the dark magician girl. Her curled hair went upward with every step she made, bouncing up and down while still staying in place. Her cheeks were red and rosy with her makeup, and her dress was strapless leaving her shoulders exposed. On her neck was the same golden choker embedded with the same red jewel, clamping between her throat and shoulders comfortably. On her feet she wore the same cartoony looking blue boots and by close observation you could tell she wasn\u2019t wearing any socks. Coming closer she said with a smile \u201cHello Tea, Yugi. It\u2019s so nice to see you here\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi and Tea were a bit confused. \u201cHow do you know our names\u201d Tea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come now, I know who you are. I\u2019ve been in enough duels to see you Tea, and you Yugi. I also know Joey, Tristan, Mai and Serenity\u201d the bubbly magician said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, so every time I summoned you in a duel you weren\u2019t just a hologram, you were actually there\u201d Yugi asked, a bit surprised to know a duel monster to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course, I am a duel spirit and a duel spirit is connected to their card no matter who\u2019s using it\u201d she said with her rosy cheeks rounding from her smile. Yugi then felt flustered a bit from looking at Dark magician girl\u2019s flawless skin and bright smiling face. He couldn\u2019t help but blush a bit, although it felt weird to him a bit that he was infatuating with his own duel monsters card. The magician girl noticed yugi\u2019s slightly reddened cheeks and giggled a little, her hand on her mouth. The Dark Magician Girl was known for her charm in both the human world and the duel monsters spirit world. Yugi was no exception, for he definitely felt charmed from her beauty, to which Tea felt a ping of jealousy toward. Even if she was jealous, it still felt weird to her being envious and also talking to someone who is technically a monster. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell anyway\u201d Dark magician girl said her arms spread sideways in an introductory fashion. \u201cWelcome to the duel monsters spirit world\u201d. Tea and Yugi both looked at each other for a moment, to which Dark Magician Girl looked at them, knowing how they would react being in a different world. At that moment, realizing their situation they replid to her with a shocked \u201cwhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly wanting to ask questions, Tea pulled on her dress\u2019s strapless shoulder edge like it was a collar and said. \u201cHow are we going to get back, and why are we in these clothes?\u201d she asked this with panic in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magical girl attempted to calm the teen. \u201cTea, calm down\u201d she said. All of sudden she held out her hand in front of her in a holding position. Tea and Yugi both watched as sparkles began forming in her long fingernailed hands. Soon the sparkles began to take a rod like shape. In an instant the rod shaped sparkles transformed into the DMG\u2019s magic wand. She grasped it in her fingers as she began to explain more. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to learn the reason why I\u2019ve brought you here\u201d. Tea and Yugi were confused by the sudden change of tone in her voice. In an instant she waved her magic wand and\u2026 </span></div></div>",

With a snap of her manicured fingers she poofed up a comb in her hands. As she looked at Tea, still struggling from the newfound weight her larger and rounder breasts added onto her she said \"ready for the next step\"? Tea looked in confusion, what was she going to do with a comb? \"Wh-what are you going to do with that\" Tea asked stuttering. \"You'll see what I'll do soon enough\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking behind Tea while looking a Yugi, who was still dumbfounded by Tea's huge chest, she kneeled down to Tea who was sitting due to the struggle in weight and placed the comb on her hair. She began stroking. Tea expected it to feel painful like her breast growth did, but instead, it felt very soothing. She relaxed as Dark magician girl gently stroked her hair, her hand moving the comb across it. Strangely Tea felt as though her hair was itching and tingling a bit with each stroke, but simply ignored it and drowned herself in the relaxing enchantment of the comb. \"Aaaahh, oh yeah, that comb is so good feeling\" Tea said happily. \"giggle, yes it sure is\" the Dark Magician girl said, a sinister smile on her face. Little did Tea know what the comb was really doing. Suddenly she felt something tickling her hand. \"Huh\" Tea said as she looked down. With her manicured hand she held a flock of long brown hair that travelled all the way down to her knees. Picking up the flock of hair, she instantly recognized it as her hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaah, wha-what did you do to my hair\" Tea said as she grabbed it between her fingers, pulling it. \"Hehe, you don't know, well I'll tell you. My comb magically makes whoevers hair it touches grow. It accelerates the growth rate of your hair making it longer and longer. Basically, it elongates it with every stroke\u201d. <br>\r\nYugi watched as Dark Magician girl poofed her comb away with her magic. \u201cThere, you look absolutely beautiful\u201d. Tea blushed a bit. \u201cR-really\u201d she said stuttering. \u201cOf course, with those huge breasts and that gorgeous hair you\u2019ll be irresistible\u201d. Tea looked down for a moment, seeing her jiggling breasts bulging out in front of her by practically a whole foot, showing a long line of cleavage running up between them. She cupped them, feeling their softness and how they tightened her dress against her stomach.  \u201cWell, why would you do this in the first place\u201d Tea asked. \u201cTo play with you using my magic, giggle\u201d DMG said, her hand over her mouth as she laughed at Tea\u2019s state.   \u201cJust think about it. It wasn\u2019t an accident that you got that blank card, I sent it to you and infused it with magic that teleported you to my world\u201d. Tea replied angrily by saying \u201cSo you did this just so you could teleport me to your world, dress me up like you and transform my body to your will\u201d. \u201cOf course, you humans are so fun to morph and transform to my will\u201d. Tea then said. \u201cand what\u2019s so fun about that\u201d? \u201cWell, seeing reactions like that for example\u201d Dark magician girl then pointed to Yugi, a long nailed finger pointing straight in his direction. \u201cHuh, Yugi, hello\u201d Tea said. Yugi however was lost in his feelings. His face was blushing a deep red, his mouth hung open and his eyes stared wide open at Tea. With her new looks she was practically a goddess that Yugi was head over heels with. Her long, beautiful hair that went down to her knees, her eyelashes that sparkled in his eyes and her flawless smooth looking skin that was revealed more thanks to Dark magician girl\u2019s outfit being so skimpy. Finally her huge breasts that bulged out with cleavage were making his heart beat like a drum. He loved how she looked with her new enlarged features making themselves announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHahahaha, human boys are so funny. and with how beautiful you look I doubt you won\u2019t be getting much attention, little Tea\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cChange me back\u201d Tea screamed angrily at the DMG. \u201cOh, come now, you look so much better\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t care about looking better I want my body turned back to normal\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m sorry but you\u2019re gonna have to stay in this form for a while. It\u2019s just funny how I can manipulate your form at will\u201d the pink and blue magician said with her evil grin. \u201cThe question now is, what can I do to play with you  next\u201d? Tea just stood in helplessness. She was at the DMG whim. She looked down, only for her enlarged breasts to get in the way. \u201cUrgh, I hate these stupid things\u201d Tea said as she put her hands on her breasts and proceeded to push them inside, only for them to bounce back out in their original position. <br>\r\nAt that moment, DMG snapped her fingers with an idea in her mind. \u201cAh, I know\u201d she said. With a swing of her wand she flung it at the ground and pink smoke erupted out of nowhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had she done?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can understand that she goes barefoot in her boots but come on, a little decency would be appreciated\" she said, putting her arms around herself. Yugi intervened by saying \"Uh,Tea, maybe we should just try and go along with this for now\". \"Oh, your right, I guess I really shouldn't complain, but how are we gonna get these clothes off\" Tea said, touching her dress' shoulder edge. \"I guess we'll just have to wear them until we find a way to get them off\"  \"Oh fine\" Tea said, her hands on her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they began to walk they didn't know what to do. They simply wandered around the forest looking for what to do. Being magicians now they weren't really sure what to do with their time in a parallel world. Practicing magic came up as a subject that yugi suggested, but Tea said to probably do it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof, I can't walk anymore\" Tea said. She sat on a rock to rest her feet, wanting to take them off knowing she wasn't wearing socks so she could rub her poor bare feet, but knowing she can't because the boot is stuck to her. She slouched on the rock while Yugi looked around for something to eat while they try and find a way to a town. Tea however was quite upset that the dark Magician Girl left them in her clothes and took their places in the real world, leaving them in the spirit world to do nothing but sit around in magician clothes that they\u2019re unable to take off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly something caught Tea\u2019s eye. \u201cHuh\u201d she said, looking to her left. In a bush patch sat a bunch of plump looking blue berries. Tea thought they looked delicious, not thinking about the risk of eating something in the spirit world. Fortunately Yugi was more cautious enough to think about the risks. \u201cHey check it out Yugi, berries\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t know Tea. I don\u2019t think we should try them without knowing what they are first\u201d Yugi said. Then upon further inspection he saw a note on the bottom of the berry bushes. \u201cHey, a note\u201d he said curiously. Picking it up he read it aloud, Tea lowering down to his height to read the note with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDear Yugi and Tea:<br>\r\nI decided to bring you some food that we monsters eat in the spirit world. Since you are technically monsters I think you\u2019ll really love these berries. <br>\r\nEnjoy: Dark Magician Girl(MANA)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess we know now they\u2019re safe to eat\u201d Tea said. She picked up a berry with her soft hand and brought it up to her mouth. It was sweet and juicy. \u201cMmmm, this is really good\u201d Tea said. \u201cReally\u201d Yugi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As soon as Tea swallowed the berry\u2026\t<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yugi looked in surprise as Tea's ears started to grow sharper and pointed. She had grown elf ears. Licking her fingers of the berry juice she sighed in enjoyment, loving the berries. \"Mm Mm. Yugi you should try these\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi however, coninued to look shocked, much to Tea's confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yugi, what's wrong\" she asked. \"Y-your ears\" he said stammering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh\" Tea went as she put her hands to her ears. \"Uhh\" she went as she felt the sharp pointed tips of her ears. They also felt a bit longer. \"Yugi, my ears\" she said panicking. She grabbed her pointed ears, gripping them with her fingers as she scram scared. \"WAAAHHH\" she went as the forest echoed her scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was in disbelief as she continued to shake her ears. \"I can't believe it, I'm an elf\" she said in woe and drama. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Tea, you look great. Besides, we'll find a way to get you back to normal\" Yugi said, hoping it would cheer her up.  \"GREAT? I have POINTED EARS!!\" she said, gesturing to her pointy ears. Yugi tried to calm her down. \"Don't worry, you'll get back to normal\" he said. \"We're in the duel monsters spirit world so I'm sure having pointy ears won't make you stick out or anything. Lots of monsters are elves so you'll blend right in\" Yugi added, trying to reason with his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalming down a bit, Tea said \"Ok Yugi\". I guess it isn't so bad having pointed ears\" she said, poking the tip of her right ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden a note poofed up in a flae of pink smoke. It flew into Tea's hands as she opened it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey a note\" Tea said. \"Who's it from\" asked Yugi. \"Dark magician girl\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe read the note aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Tea and Yugi:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now I'm sure you've eaten the berries I sent you. I just want you to know that if you have eaten them you have been transformed into elves. Keep in mind that elves reflect upon the different creatures in my world and that you will start to transform into one of them. It could be Mystical elf, fairy's gift etc for Tea and Celtic guardian, Obnoxious celtic guardian etc for Yugi. You will transform into a version of yourself with traits from the elf you turn into. If your looking for a way to reverse this process, I'm sorry to say you cannot. The effect is permanent and you will stay elves for the rest of your lives. Fret not though, because as elves, you can live for a long time, more than 10,000 years to be exact. Your practically immortal, so enjoy the time you have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, I almost forgot. You can master magic much easier as elves. Study to be great wizards someday and who knows, you may discover a way to become human again,...in 2000 years if your lucky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToodles<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark magician Girl\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWIth that note read, Tea crumpled the paper in her hands in anger. \"UNBELIEVABLE, I'm gonna be stuck as an elf for more than 10,000 years. I don't even know how long that's going to be\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi looked at Tea sadly. He then looked down at the berries. Realizing the situation he thought about what he had to do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tea\" Yugi said. The sheer tone of his voice, serious sounding, snapped Tea out of her fit and her attention shifted to Yugi. He looked worried, but also sure of himself. \"Yeah Yugi\", Tea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If what Dark magician girl said is true then if I'm going to survive long enough to stay with you the next 10,000 years, I need to eat these berries\" he said, knowing the consequences. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, Yugi\" Tea didn't want him to do this. She didn't want him giving up his humanity to become immortal and an elf. But deep down she knew that that was the only option he had right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to Tea, its the only way I'll make it\" he said. Tea knew there was no changing his mind when it came to helping his friends. \"Ok Yugi\" Tea said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a berry, Yugi bit out of it. Eating the entire berry he began to change almost immediately. His ears became longer and sharpened at the tips to become pointed. After that, while he didn't notice it, his hair grew longer under his Dark magician helmet. he did feel his hair tingling a bit though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow Yugi, you look great\" Tea said, returning to support he gave her earlier. \"Thanks Tea\" Yugi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now\" Tea asked. </span></div></div>",

And unfortunately for him, it didn't look like he was the one dressed like the Dark Magician...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe now wore the familiar light blue blouse with pink trimming that would give anyone a view of his cleavage, if he had any, that is. It also came with a short pink cape, and a pink skirt. On his forearms were light blue sleeves that went from his wrists to his elbows, and on his feet were boots. And on his head was the hat, and he even held her wand in his hand. To say he felt ridiculous dressed up like the magical girl would be a serious understatement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTea meanwhile, was now dressed in the familliar purple robes of his very own favorite card, from the hat now on her head to the shoes on her feet.

Kuri. So, to get around this, they created the card that would give their powers to two people worthy of possessing them, and I guess that you two were chosen by the card as the two worthy people.\" the Kuriboh explained. \"And you two would be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my name is Tea.\" she introduced herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Yugi. But what I want to know is why am I the Dark Magician Girl?\" Yugi whined. \"I mean, being a boy kinda makes me unqualified for the position.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that. Kuri.\" it apologized. \"While the card was made to choose a male and a female to give them the powers of the Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl, it was intended to give them the powers of the spellcaster of the same gender as them, not for a boy like you to become the Dark Magician Girl. But magic isn't always perfect, I guess. Kuri.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not that I'm against helping, but what if someone sees us like this? I'd die of embarrassment if Joey or someone saw me like this...\" Yugi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry about that. As long as you two are using your powers, normal people will see you two as the one you're dressed as, so people will think that you are the real Dark Magician Girl, Yugi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know whether I should think thats a good or bad thing...\" he muttered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we can change back, right?\" Tea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, of course. You both just touch the tip of the  staff and wand together and say \"We .\" while focusing on returning to normal, and your new powers will deactivate and your clothes will change back. But just remember, this means you two need to be together to return to your normal forms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to waste no time in returning to normal, they touched the tips of their wand and staff together and said \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi's clothes glowed brightly, and turned into pink light, and then he was once again wearing his own school uniform, much to his relief. Tea's robes glowed similarly in the color purple, and then she too was once again in her school uniform. They also noticed that in the hands that they had been holding their tools were now something else. Yugi was now holding a pink, and feminine wand while Tea held a what seemed to be a smaller, more handheld version of the Dark Magician's staff, only purple instead of green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are your transformation wands. When you want to call upon your powers, simply hold them up and say your activation phrase, which is \"Dark Magic Power.\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, ok.\" they said, and noticed the wands vanish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can summon them whenever you want to transform.\"  the Kuriboh said as it became transparent, and said that when it was like this that only they can see them.</span></div></div>",

He also noticed Tea lying nearby, still dressed as the Dark Magician as well. He then got up, and looked around, and instantly noticed his location had changed. He was no longer on the streets of Domino City! In fact, they definitely weren't in a city. They now appeared to be in some sort of a forest, with trees taller than any he had ever seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\" he wondered out loud.  He then walked over to Tea, and gently shook her to waker her up.<br>\r\n\"Yugi? What happened? Where are we?\" she asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Lets have a look around.\" he said, and the two followed a path that, lucky enough, led them outside the forest. Once they exited it, they saw what they could only describe as a magical countryside. There were many fantastic, and familiar creatures. Yugi recognized many of them as ones from various cards he had seen. They saw a village in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tea, I think we may be in some kind of Duel Monster's world.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? But how?\" she asked with worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Yugi replied. \"But for now, maybe we should head for that village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they made their way there, they noticed several of the creatures observing them. As they continued, a small group of fairies suddenly flew right by Yugi, and waved at him, and they heard a few of them say \"Hello Dark Magician Gil!\" and the fairies flew on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...did they just call you \"Dark Magician Girl?\"\" Tea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... think so?\" Yugi asked, unsure of what else to say. He was just as surprised. He may have been wearing her clothes, but he looked nothing like the spellcaster. What he and Tea didn't know was that along with bringing them to this world, the card made it so that the two were now viewed as what they were dressed as, effectively taking the place of the Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, the two arrived in the village.</span></div></div>",

Turning around to look at the souce, they saw a large, armored fiend-type monster carrying an axe. Next to the monster was another, a woman elf like ears and long white hair. She wore a red, black, and white dress and had black, shoulder-length gloves holding a spear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi recognized the two cards as those of the ritual monsters Demise, King of Armageddon, and Ruin, Queen of Oblivion.<br>\r\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20071218045254/yugioh/images/b/b2/Demise%2CKingofArmageddonDR04-EN-SR.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20...</a>)<br>\r\n(<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100619222649/yugioh/images/a/ad/Ruin%2CQueenofOblivionDR04-EN-SR-UE.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20...</a>)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, please don't tell me that I'm the one hes talking to...\" Tea muttered low enough that only Yugi heard her, and she glanced around the area, desparately hoping that there was a real Dark Magician nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for her, no such luck. The two Duel Monsters walked right over to the two of them. As the two approached them, other monsters started to lear the area fearfully, not wanting to be involved in this situation. \"Its been a long time since we all ran into each other, Dark Magician.\" Demise said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long time no see, Dark Magician Girl.\" Ruin taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After our last encounter, I've been looking for you in hope of getting revenge for defeating me then.\" Demise said as he raised his axe. \"Now, this time I'll kill you!\" he said as he was suddenly surrounded by an aura of blue flames and that flew up from it and fired a powerful blast at the Tea and Yugi, who leaped out of the way in fear. At this, the other Duel Monsters that had still been in the area all started to run until it was only Yugi, Tea, Demise, and Ruin left in the area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Oh man, what are we going to do!?</i>' Yugi thought, the two had gone in separate directions, and Demise was focusing his attention on Tea. Looking around, for something to help her, he watched as Demise charged at herwith his axe. \"Hey, leave us alone!\" he shouted as he waved his hand that held the wand that hae had got ten with the Dark Magician Girl's clothes. As he did this, he watched as a box floated up, and fly at Demise and hit him in the head, causing him to stumble. '<i>Did I do that?</i>' Yugi wondered as he ran over to Tea while Demise recovered from the surprise. The two backed off, and Yugi swung his wand again, but this time, nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, fight back, Dark Magician!\" Demise taunted. \"Or I you too afraid to face me? If that is the case, just surrender now and let me kil you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRacking his brain for a solution to avoiding this fight that they were sure to lose, Yugi came up with a plan to at least delay it. \"Listen! Te-The Dark Magician isn't going to fight you here, not when it would put others in danger!\" he said as he steeled all of his courage. \"If you want to fight him, then you'll just have to do it somewhere else!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yugi!\" she hissed low enough for only Yugi to hear. She was terrified, and wanted to avoid the fight altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Tea, just trust me. Just play along and say that you'll do this tomorrow, outside town.\" Yugi whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that she would trust him, she put on her bravest face and turned to face Demise. \"Yu-uo heard her.\" she said, cuttinger herself off as she almost said 'Yugi is right.' \"I'm not going to fight you here and now. If you want to fight me so badly, then we'll do it tomorrow, outside of town where it won't put anyone in danger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then, we'll finish this tomorrow.\" Demise reluctantly agreed. \"Nut know this! If you're not there tomorrow, then me and Ruin will be back, and we'll make sure to destroy this town, and then you'll have no excuse to avoid us then!\" As demise said this, Ruin leaned over and whispered to him who nodded to whatever she said, before turning back to the two humans and walked over to Yugi, who tensed up as she held her spear close to his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Instead of just letting the men fight alone, us ladies will join in as well.\" Ruin said to him. \"I'll enjoy killing someone as pretty as you.\" she said before lowering her spear and turning and leaving with Demise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh of relief, Yugi turned to Tea. \"Yugi, what are we going to do?\" she asked worriedly. \"If we go to that fight, we'll be killed! Maybe we should just get out of here while we can...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't do that, Tea. You heard him, he'll destroy this town if we don't face him. We can't just let him do that and kill the inhabitants of this town because we were too afraid to do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right.\" Tea said. The inhabitants of this village may have been duel monsters, but here, they were just as real s her and Yugi. She couldn't just let them die. \"But what can we do? We may have their clothes, and everyone else may think that we're really the Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl, but that doesn't mean we actually are them. We're just regular, powerless humans in a world full of monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, but maybe not.\" Yugi said as he held up the wand in his hand. \"When that monster charged at you earlier and I told it to stop, I happened to wave my wand, and a box floated up and hit Demise. Apparently, along with these clothes bringing us here and making everything thinking we really are the Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl, it also gave us their magical powers as well. I tried to use them again after that, but it didn't work that time. So all we have to do is figure out how to use them properly, and we might be able to beat Demise and Ruin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure hope so.\" Tea said as she looked at the staff she held.</span></div></div>",

She furrowed her brow in concentration, and lifted the staff. When nothing happened, she frowned and move the staff around some more.

They jumped in surprise, and then stared at the slightly burning branch on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" Yugi said after a moment of silence, \"That's something, at least.\"</span></div></div>",

And thats when I waved the wand.\" Yugi said, demonstrating with a swing, but nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats all well and good, but how do we make doing something we've never done before 'feel natural?'\" Tea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Yugi said. \"But we've gotta figure out.\" Yugi said, swing ing his wand again for no reason, and nothing happened, and tried again, but still nothing. He groaned. If they couldn't figure thinks out, they were gonna die... '<i>No! I can't think negatively or I'll just give up. I've gotta be brave!</i>' he thought as he pointed the wand forward, and a magical blast launched out from the tip, much to both of their surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you do that?\" Tea asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi thought for a moment when an idea popped into his head. \"I think I've got it!\" Yugi exclaimed. \"Okay, we can't force it, and its gotta be natural, so we can't think too hard about what we're doing, but maybe the magic also respondes to our emotion along with everything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Emotion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, for example, I just wanted to protect you with something in town, and when you fired that blast, you were a bit frustrated! And just then, I strongly thought 'I've gotta be brave!' as I pointed my wand forward, and that magical blast shot forward!\" he explained. \"So then, I think we can do this!\" he said, another swing, and magical energy gathered at the tip, but this time, it seemed to backfire, and explode in Yugi's face. \"Ow... This is gonna take a lot of work.\" he groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess thats why Dark Magician Girl is just the apprentice...\" Tea remarked.</span></div></div>",

What I mean is, how do we know which of these books can help us?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we'll just have to look. Now, lets see...\" Yugi said as he walked down a few rows of books for a while with Tea following begind him, checking for any writing on them that would identify them as a spellbook. After a while of, he caught sight of one book in particular. It seemed vaguely familiar looking to him for some reason, so reaching over, he pulled it off the shelf and looked at the cover. While there was no writing on it, he realized why he recognized it right away. \"Tea, I've got one! This one will be perfect for us to use!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Positive.\" he said as he handed it to her to look at the cover. \"I recognize it, from a card. Its the same one on the \"Magic Formula\" Spell card. Its an equip spell that can raise the ATK of Dark Magician or Dark Magician Girl specifically, so this one would be our best bet to check out first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then opened the book and read through a bit, and sure enough, just like Yugi said, it was definitely a spelbook. It had a variety of spells inside, some of which Yugi recognized as the effects of cards he had seen like the 'Magical Hats' and 'Thousand Knives' cards, and others. And not just spells, it also detailed how to use their new magical abilities properly, and properly show them how to activate and control them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were right Yugi, this definitely looks like it will be a big help.\" Tea said. And with that, the two of them headed over to the Time Wizard they had saw earlier reading a book. It looked up from its book as they approached it, and Tea held up the book. \"We're going to be taking this book for now.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, it is your book afterall.\" the Time Wizard replied. \"I'm just holding onto it for you while the two of you have been staying in town. Good luck with your fight tomorrow.\" it said, before returning to reading its book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" And with that, the two left.</span></div></div>",

But if you're too afraid, it makes it hard to also use offensive spells, as the magic will be more focused on protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And more neutral spells require clarity of mind, combined with a focused purpose for the magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds a little complicated,\" Tea said, \"But I guess it's a start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Yugi said, picking up his staff and flipping to another page, \"We should probably start with the defensive spells first...\"</span></div></div>",

Eventually the two got the hang of things, and by the end of the day, they had managed to gain a pretty good control over their new powers. As the Dark Magician, Tea's magic also seemed to be more powerful than Yugi's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had also learned a variety of things, such as how to use their basic but powerful magical blasts, levitation, and several spells, such as the usage of ones such as the 'Magical Hats' and various others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Yugi awoke with a yawn and got out of a comfortable bed. As it turned out, the Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl that they had seemingly replaced here had been renting a small one room house in the village while they stayed there. They had found this out by chance, after Yugi had quite literally accidentally bumped into what turned out to be their landlord while they had wandered around town while searching for a place to stay for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out the window, it appeared to be morning, and glancing at a clock, he saw that it was ten o'clock. Looking over to Tea, she was still asleep. With a quik growl from his stomach, he decided to look for something to eat. Looking around, he saw a few supplies like eggs and such, and with them, he began to make an omlet for Tea and his breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he began to finish, he noticed Tea began to get up. \"Something smells good...\" she mumbled as she rubbed her eyes before walking over to where Yugi was finishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good, you're awake.\" Yugi said. \"I made breakfast. Theres plenty of omlet for the both of us, so have some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good.\" she said as they sat down and Yugi placed a plate in front of each of them. As they ate, Tea lookedover to Yugi. \"So, after we settle this thing with those two monsters, what are we going to do next?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we should probably start looking into how to fix things and get back to normal.\" Yugi replied. \"I feel ridiculous in this outfit, and I don't really like the idea of being seen as a female.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I agree. And you do look ridiculous in that.\" Tea said. \"So then how should we start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, first we should worry about the fight.\" Yugi said. \"How to get back to normal won't matter much if we don't live.\"</span></div></div>",

No, this flock of hair was resting on the back of his neck and was long enough to pull across his head. In addition, the color was a bit off. Instead of his usual black, he saw a dim shade of blonde. In addition, the blonde hair looked a bit curled towards the tips of it. \"Gasp, n-no way, my hair is longer\" he said in a panic as quietly as he could, trying not to attract attention from the villagers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was with a shock that yugi realized what this hair looked like and what could be happening. \"Tea, I think I know who's hair this looks like\" he said with worry in his voice. \"You don't think\" she said. \"I really hope not\" They said discussing ther secret worry.\"We gotta get out of here before more weird stuff happens\" Tea said. And so they ran.</span></div></div>",

Hesitantly, Tea started following, face blushing bright red at the fact that she was walking down the street on all fours, completely naked, with her best friend pulling her along on a leash. The blush deepened as they passed other people on the street, but the one upside of the situation was that no one paid the two any attention; apparently, whatever had happened also made the rest of the world see her as a dog, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What did that card do?' she thought miserably, 'And why did this have to happen to <i>me</i>?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, the two reached the Kame Game shop and entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Grandpa, I'm back!\" Yugi called. When no answer came he shrugged, \"Huh. He must be running an errand or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, Yugi led Tea behind the counter, before unhooking the leash from her collar. Tea barely noticed, as she was distracted by the rather disturbing sight of two bowls in the corner of the room - one full of water, the other of wet dog food - both with her name written on them. Her attention was pulled back to Yugi as she heard him opening a drawer; looking up, her eyes widened in shock as she saw him pull the weird card that had caused this mess out of his pocket and place it in an open drawer behind the counter, which he soon closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to remember to tell Grandpa about that card, maybe call Ishizu if he doesn't know anything,\" Yugi muttered to himself, before brightening up and smiling down at Tea, \"You sure are lucky you don't have to deal with stuff like this, Tea. I'll see you later, okay girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe patted her on the head affectionately, before turning and walking out the door. Tea waited a few minutes until she was sure he was gone, then jumped up and grabbed the drawer, trying to open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Come on, open damn it!</i>\" she yelled, \"<i>If that stupid card could do this to me, it can change me back, so open so I can grab it!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Tea couldn't get the drawer open - her hands were refusing to work right, and she couldn't seem to balance properly on just her feet. After a few minutes of trying, she gave up and sat back down on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh, now what am I supposed to do?</i>\" she said, not noticing the dog-like whine that accompanied it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, there was a bell chime as the front door opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho walked in?</span></div></div>",

As soon as the two of them felt it was safe to open their eyes, they noticed the obvious changes. It seemed that the two of them had somehow switched clothing. Joey was now sporting Mai's short-sleeved purple coat which her white corset-like tube top,which showed off his stomach, along with purple high-heeled boots. It also seemed that he had obtained Mai's oversized hair and light touch of makeup.\"Hey what's goin on here?\" Joey said as he panicked, trying to figure out exactly how he got in Mai's outfit. <br>\r\nMai was freaking out as well, though admittedly she was taking it much better once she got a good look at Joey. \"Oh god I don't know what's going on, but dear lord is it funny!\" She nearly fell over laughing. She was now sporting Joey's usual long blue open jacket with a raised collar, a white T-shirt underneath and blue jeans.<br>\r\n\"No it ain't!\" Joey let out a low growl. \"If anything I'd say that it was incredibly unfunny!\" He blushed as he looked down at his new outfit. \"How exactly am I supposed to walk in these boot thingies anyway?<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, a familiar face made his way into the room where they were having their duel. \"Oh hey guys playing a game?\" He seemed rather unfazed by the fact that his super macho friend Joey was dressed up like a girl.<br>\r\nJoey blinked in confusion \"uh.. Yugi do you happen to notice anything different here?\" He said as he pointed to his hair. \"Anything at all?!\" <br>\r\nYugi looked at him nervously. \"Uhh.. Sorry Mai I didn't notice you got a haircut. Later guys\" He gulped as he quickly ran out of the room. <br>\r\nMai mused the situation over for a second. \"Hmm.. As far as I can figure out, we've somehow switched lives with each other. She gave a giggle. \"And now everyone things that we're each other.\"<br>\r\n\"Glad you find this so funny.\" Joey pouted. \"What are we supposed to do now?<br>\r\n\"Hmm..\" Mai tapped her foot as she thought. It seemed that she had a little idea forming in her head.</span></div></div>",

Fears of sabotage and thievery sent him bolting from his chair, but a tight constriction around his legs almost sent him stumbling over before he reached the door. Peering down to see what it was, he was soon thankful that he hadn't made it outside his office in what looked to be a purple skirt. More than that, he realized in shock, as his eyes darted from the matching gogo boots and mini-jacket, to the white corset and soft lavender arm sleeves. He didn't even need to lift the skirt to realize his underwear had been changed as well. The sheer disbelief of it all stalled his memory for a long, silent moment before he could recall that he had seen this ensemble before, on one Mai Valentine. Stomping over to the mirror in his walk-in closet, the final indignity was suffered as he saw his hair had even been styled into a shorter but matching style to the Harpy Queen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What. The. Hell?!\" he growled, restraining the urge to howl out in rage, which ironically caused his new locks to bounce about and tickle his face playfully. Somebody had gone through a lot of effort to humiliate him today in his own building, it seemed, and he was eager to return the favor once he found out who. The initial suspect was Mai herself, but while they had never found one another endearing, he questioned what her motives would be for something of this scale. She had never been the type to shy away from a duel. As another point, he realized as he slowly began to calm down, he gave the woman enough credit intellectually to not form a plan the hinged on Kaiba forgetting he had another closet right here inside his own office. Just as he began calculating how long fixing his hair would take, however, the phone rang. Probably nothing of import, but given the circumstances he wanted to know if any more packages had his name on them. \"Yes, this is Kaiba,\" he barked into the receiver, swatting the hair out of his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looking good today, cutey,\" a distorted voice responded slowly, causing Kaiba to stiffen to alertness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is thi-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, just as I thought. Dressed to the nines and he still wants to play the big man on campus. Well, in that case...\"</span></div></div>",

Reaching up, he felt a pair of hoop earrings, designed to resemble coiled snakes. That called attention to his outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis usual trench coat was gone; instead, the only thing covering his upper body was a red top that didn't really cover his upper body. It was split down the middle right to the body, revealing his muscular chest to anyone who was interested. Why, if he didn't know any better, he'd say it was designed to show off cleavage...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot helping that notion was the equally revealing skirt that currently clad his legs. Red with a Medusa-like pattern, the skirt was split on either side, causing it to cover his legs very little. Closer inspection revealed that his legs were now completely devoid of hair; as a matter of fact, he also noticed that his otherwise unchanged hands now ended in perfectly manicured nails, and there was a definate smell of perfume coming from his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf that wasn't proof he was currently dressed as a woman, the bright red high heels that currently adorned his feet were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Kaiba could react to his new appearance in anyway, a green-haired woman with a large head approached him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there something wrong, sister?\" she asked, a long, thin tongue extending out of her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaiba briefly considered how to answer...</span></div></div>",

She wanted to take deep breaths and calm down, but was to nervous to breathe underwater even if she could. Then again, if you were an air breather and suddenly had to breathe water you'd be pretty hesitant too, seeing as you now needed new respiratory requirements. Serenity took in a swish of fresh seawater and inhaled it. She could feel the water filling her lungs as she breathed it in, still a bit nervous about taking it in, but she then exhaled it. She watched as the water flowed out of her calmly.The breathing felt normal. It felt just like fresh air to her. Relieved a bit she said \"well at least I know I'm safe here\" she said reassuringly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she knew she could breathe underwater now she needed to find a way back home on dry land, though getting there wasn't going to be easy. Seeing as she was underwater and had a fish tail she knew she had to get used to swimming to get around places. She attempted to swim, putting her arms out and moving her arms while swishing her tail up and down, but to no avail. there was no way to get in sync as her legs were no longer there. For a normal swimmer who was human i would be easy to move in sync with your arms and legs moving at the same time, but for a newbie human/fish hybrid with a fish tail its not exactly easy to get in sync with one fish tail. She simply flailed about as she tried to swim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThats when she heard a voice. \"Hey, you over there\" said the voice. turning around Serenity saw 3 other mermaids swimming toward her, quite professionally as well. She saw the mermaids calling out to her. One mermaid had blue hair and a blue tail with a pearl necklace, one had green hair with green tail and pearl bracelets and one had blonde hair with pigtails and a yellow tail with a bracelet attached to the fin. \"Hi there\", said the girl with blue hair.Serenity just looked shyly upon the 3 mermaids as they introduced themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Serena\" said the blue haired mermaid.<br>\r\n\"I'm Melody\" said the green haired mermaid.<br>\r\n\"Im Felicia\" said the yellow haired mermaid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerenity said her name as she introduced herself. \"I-I'm Serenity\" she said shyly as she wasn't used to talking to mythical creatures, even if she was one herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing out in the middle of the ocean like this Serenity?\" Asked Serena. \"I, um, uh\" Serenity stammered as she talked, not sure how to say that she was a human turned into a mermaid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you must be a newcomer\" said Melody cheerfully. \"Well not exactly said Serenity. I'm not really from around here or the ocean for that matter\" she said. The mermaids looked confused at her last statement. \"That's silly, of course your from the ocean, your a mermaid silly\" Felicia said as she tried to tell Serenity the obvious truth. \"But I'm not, I'm a human and I was turned into a mermaid\" \"A Human\" the trio said. \"Yes\" Serenity said. She proceeded to explain what happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A human who turned into a mermaid from a card? weird\" said Felicia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't worry we'll help you out\" said Serena as she swam forward and reassured Serenity with a pat on her bare shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" Serenity said gratefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, if your gonna be a mermaid you have to learn how to swim like a mermaid\" said Melody. \"I saw that you had some trouble swimming so I'll teach you\" Serenity looked happy to find friends who would help her. \"You'll swim like a pro in no time\" Melody said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She averted her eyes and looked down at her other arm \"Where did all this jewelry come from\" she said. She put one of her hands on a bracelet and tried pulling it off but it wouldn't budge. It was as though it was glued to her arm. \"Oh man, come off already\". She pulled and pulled but to no avail. It wouldn't come off. She finally gave up, panting heavily from how much she tried to pry her clothes off. She was stuck wearing these bracelets and her new egyptian dress that went up to her knees in the middle of Egypt but she didn't know why. \"I've gotta find that card\" she said, hoping that it would take her back to Domino city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   She decided to bend down and search in the sand, she dug sand everywhere with her delicate fingers, her bracelets shining light into her eyes a bit as she dug, the hood of her dress coming over her head and her circlet and necklace jingling as she searched. She was able to search long seeing as her dress protected her from sunlight, of course that didn't mean that she wasn't going to get a tan from how hard the sun was beating on her. \"Bingo, found something\" she said with confidence and hope. Hoping to have found the card she pulled it out but to her misfortune it wasn't the card. \"Huh, what's this\" she said, holding the object up she saw that it was...</span></div></div>",

One moment she was walking by leisurely in domino city one when she found the card and the next moment she found herself in a medieval themed forest dressed in primitive rags near a village. Her most breathtaking surprise was the fact that she wasn't even human anymore. She rubbed her ears, feeling their length as she rubbed her finger to the tip of her pointed right ear. \"Oh, what happened to me\" she said in a sad voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting her newfound ears aside she knew she had to find a way back home and back to being human. She could see the villagers walking by in the close-by village she eyed. \"Maybe someone in there could help\"  she said with hope. Running along, her feet splashed in the puddle she gazed in to see her reflection. While she ran she noticed something, she seemed to be more agile, running faster without having to catch her breath for one second. She took brief notice of her newfound athleticism and agility. \"Woah, since when could I run so fast\" Serenity asked herself in confusion. She remembered how hard it was for her to run in school without catching her breath, now she could do it easier as though it was natural to her. She stopped for a moment, looking down at her feet, which were within a pair of pointed animal skin shoes. She could feel empowered and eager. Looking at a tree branch curiously, she squatted down and then jumped up to grab the tree branch and hop off it to go faster. To her surprise she lunged off the ground more than 3 feet and used her dainty fingers to grab hold of the branch and swing herself onto it, supporting herself as she perched on top of it without making it break. Serenity looked at her right hand in awe while her left held the branch. She was never this athletic and fast before. She felt overwhelmed by her new abilities. All of this was a bit much to take in. she felt a bit scared looking down from the tree, mentally criticizing herself for even performing such a stunt. She didn\u2019t know how all of this was possible, her turning from a human into an elf, running and jumping flexibly. She wished that her brother Joey was with her, helping her out and giving her support. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down, still uneasy with her new athletic form. Gulping as she looked below she sucked in her fear and jumped to the ground. Landing perfectly on her feet without losing her balance at all she was amazed and shocked at her power. \u201cLooking down she confirmed that there was no doubt about it, she had become very athletic. Becoming an elf must\u2019ve changed her body in more ways than one. She confirmed this in her head as she finally took it in, but also remembered what she needed to be doing. So putting her abilities aside she went with it and ran with incredibly fast speed to the village. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as she got to the village she slowed her pace to normal walking. Looking from  the entrance she saw something she couldn\u2019t believe. The entire village was full of elves just like her. The village was very reminiscent of a primitive medieval village with cobblestones on the roads and buildings that looked like small cottages made out of stone with wooden door windows. \u201cNo way\u201d she said as she felt her ears again, still not believing she\u2019s an elf, or that she\u2019s seeing an entire community of elves for that matter. She took small steps into the village, the stones beneath her echoing out her steps. As she pressed looked forward she noticed that the townspeople didn\u2019t act strangely to her in any way. She of course knew this was because she was an elf like them, but it still seemed strange to not have any surprised looks gaze upon her for having pointy ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked right and left at the different people and buildings, a voice said to her from behind \u201care you lost dear\u201d. Serenity turned around in surprise as she saw\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For a top she was now wearing only a closed pink vest; in addition to that she wore a green cloth belt around her waist just above her new tail, gold rings around her wrists, large gold earrings, and a small pink veil over the lower half of her face. Also, her hair was now pulled up in a long ponytail. All in all, she barely recognized herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... a genie,\" she said in shock, \"How did this happen?

Somehow managing to blush even harder, Serenity's head whipped up - and her eyes widened in further shock. There were some people walking towards her, except they were also naked and walking on all fours. More to the point, they were being led on leashes by dogs - dogs that were walking upright and wearing clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Serenity continued to stare in shock, the dog wearing jeans and a shirt said, in perfect English, \"Looks like a stray human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" the dog wearing a dress asked, \"Better check to see if she has a collar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSerenity was frozen in shock, unable to move as the male dog handed his leash to the female, then walked over to her, pulling her hair back to check her neck.</span></div></div>",

He was weaing a blue coat that was the standard uniform for male members of the Obelisk Blue dorm. His face looked oddly familiar, kida resembling Atticus and... \"Alexis? Is that you?\" Jaden asked, also noticing that 'his' voice sounded much different, and had a softer tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy nodded. \"Ja-Jaden?\" the boy that was actually Alexis asked, noticing that 'her' voice sounded deeper, which alerted her to the changes, and how she was now a he. As Alexis took in his changes, Jaden started to notice the changes that had happened to 'him.' \"He' was a girl! Her brown hair had grown a bit, and now went down a few inches past her shoulders, though it still resembled how her hair had been when she had been a boy, only really having gotten longer. Her clothes had changed. Still wearing the Slifer Red blazer, it now lacked sleeves. It was also worn open like when she was male, showing her she still wore a black shirt, which evidently also was sleeveless. She also had on a white skirt. On his feet were a pair of of heeled boots that looked just like those that the Obelisk Blue girls wore, only red, while on her hand were red versions of the fingerless gloves that Alexis used to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what happened to us?\" Jaden asked worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>You both changed genders.</i>' Yubel stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, obviously...\" Jaden said under her breath. As she took in her new body, as her hands went up and hesitantly touched her new breasts. \"Yep, they're real.\" she said. They weren't as big as Alexis's former ones, being only a b cup, but they were still strange for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets just stay calm, Jaden.\" Alexis said, more for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.

No!\" Alexis denied. \"We were just, uh... talking. Thats alll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what were you two talking about?\" Cazz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, nothing much.\" Jaden said. He figured that considering how they now thought that she had always been a girl, no one would believe what had happened to them. So, she quickly thought of an excuse, and said the first thing that came to mind. \"Just about dueling and stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, despite being a perfectly reasonale excuse considering who it was coming from, no one seemed to believe them due to how evasive they seemed to be acting. \"What? Jadey, why would you try to hide something like this from us!\" Jasmine said as she and Mindy got cose on both his sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!

Usually a diligent student, Alexis found a great difficulty paying attention today. She just couldn't seem to focus at all, and seemed to be so bored.

He had to admit, for some reason, he liked it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few mintes, Alexis came out wearing his black t-shirt, red blazer, jeans and his shoes. \"Oh, Jaden I thought if we were wearing each other clothes you may want this.\" she said presenting her underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis are you wearing underwear?\" he asked, realizing if they were hers what was she wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm actually wearing yours.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden's face went pale as he took the underwear and went in to change again to put them on.

But before Jaden and Alexis could leave with their friends, the teacher called out to them. \"Excuse me, Jaden Yuki, and Alexis Rhodes, would you please stay behind, I'd like to speak with you about something. Everyone else is dismissed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing as he said, the two walked over to the front of the room where he was. \"What do you need?\" Jaden asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is about your dorms.\" the teacher replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our dorms? What about them?\" Alexis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you know, Ms. Rhodes, you are not the most attentive student, always sleeping in class, while in contrast Mr. Yuki, you are quite the model student, and your grades are at the top of your class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first the two were a bit confused. Jaden knew that this had been the very first time he had ever payed any attention in class, while Alexis had never slept in class before. However, as they thought about this, they were unaware that their memories started to alter a bit, and thus their thoughts changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Wait what am I thinking?</i>' Jaden thought as he brushed aside his previous confusion. '<i>I always pay attention in class and work my hardest in them to get the best grades I can. I never sleep during class.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Oh yeah, I do sleep in class all the time.</i>' Alexis thought. '<i>Class can be pretty boring and its hard paying attention to.</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough they were now convinced that things had always been that way, there were still some lingering doubts in the back of their minds that something was off, they put it aside for now and let the teacher continue. \"Since you two both have grades and such that contrast those normally associated with students of your color and fit better with those of each others, its been decided that you two will switch dorms.\" the teacher told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Switch dorms?\" the two questioned in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. From now on, Ms. Rhodes, you will take Mr. Yuki's place in Slifer Red while Mr. Yuki will take your place in Obelisk Blue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey thought about protesting. Normally, Jaden had turned down every promotion to a higher dorm that he had been offered in the past, having opted to stay in Slifer Red. But for some reason, he was fine with it today, and looking forward to it. As for Alexis, most students would normally be upset over being demoted to the lowest dorm, but for some reason, she didn't seem to mind. She thought she might enjoy the laid back atmosphere of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, at some point today, you two need to move your stuff into the other's room, which will be your new ones.\" the teacher told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, move our stuff into the other's room? But isn't Alexis's room in the girls dorm? And I'm a boy.\" Jaden said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, you two will be taking each other's place in one another's dorms. This means that you will be part of the Obelisk Blue girls dorm. A special exception is being made for you.\" the teacher told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to take care of the move right away, but it has to be done today. Now that you two have been informed, you're both dismissed.\" the teacher said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two headed out of the classroom, they decided to speak with one another about things. \"Hey Alexis, does something feel off to you?\" Jaden asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. But I can't put my finger on what it is. Everything seems normal.\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>What about you, Yubel?</i>' Jaden mentally asked his duel spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Something does feel strange, but I can't tell what it is either.</i>\" she replied as her spirit appeared next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess we'l just have to pay attention for anything out of the ordinary.\" Jaden said out loud to both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Alexis agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them and the duel spirit were completely oblivious to Jaden and Alexis's slowly changing personalities, reality altering with them, and just how odd it was for a boy like Jaden to be placed in the Obelisk Blue girls dorm. They could feel that something strange was going on, but they just couldn't tell what it was.</span></div></div>",

As they entered in, they saw Fonda Fontaine, the school nurse and gym teacher, and head of the girls dorm, and she was holding a pair of boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, its a good thing I ran into you two. Now I don't have to go looking for you both.\" Ms. Fontaine said. \"Here you go.\" she said as she handed them both one of the boxes she was carrying. \"Here are your new uniforms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her box, Alexis saw the standard Slifer Red blazer. Inside Jaden's box was more than just a blazer, though. It was a white sleeveless one with blue trimmings, a blue miniskirt, and blue heeled boots, the standard Obelisk Blue girls uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure that this is for me?\" Jaden asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But this is the girls uniform.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, of course it is. You're part of the girls dorm now, after all.\" Ms. Fontaine pointed out. \"You don't have to wear it if you don't want to. After all, Chazz never wears anything but that black coat of his.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden considered sticking with his usual attire but decided against it. He was a model student, and he would wear the appropriate uniform. And it wasn't that bad, after all. The two then resumed their trip to Alexis's former room, and entered in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Jaden marvelled at the sight. The room was much nicer, and bigger than any room at the Slifer dorm. It even had its own private bathroom! He had heard that the Obelisk rooms were the best in the school, and now he could see and experience just how much nicer they were. \"Well, why don't you gather up your stuff.\" Jaden said. \"While you do, I'm going to get changed.\" he said taking his box into his bathroom. He then began to strip out of his clothes one by one. Once done he put on the white top, followed by the miniskirt, and finally the boots. He then looked himself over, seeing that he looked the part of his new dorm now. He then noticed that he could see the legs of his boxers sticking out from under the miniskirt. Thinking he'd have to do something about that, he then noticed there was something else in the box his new uniform had been in. Looking at them, they were a pair of blue panties. He then took off his boxers and put on the new underwear. \"There, that fixes that.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he exited the bathroom, he saw Alexis had her stuff all packed into a box. She was also now wearing the red blazer of the Slifer dorm and a pair of jeans and sneakers. \"Thought I'd get changed too.\" she explained. \"Plus, I really like red.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. Lets get your stuff to your new room and pick up my stuff.\" Jaden said and the two made their way to the Slifer dorm. As they did, no one they passed by seemed to find anything odd about the sight of a boy like Jaden in the girls uniform.</span></div></div>",

He couldn't understand why he'd turned down every chance to move up to a different dorm. He'd always paid attention and thought that he should've been in a higher ranked dorm. He then looked ahead and saw Mindy and Jasmine walking toward the girls dorm as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, guys!\" Jaden called out as he quickly caught up with his fellow Obelisk Blue students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy and Jasmine turned to Jaden as he ran up to them and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jaden.\" said Mindy \"We heard about you and Alexis switching dorms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. And we were looking for you to see if you wanted to do something with us.\" Jasmine said with a little eagerness in heer voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Jaden pondered. \"It has been a long day and I'm getting a little tired of moving back and forth between my new dorm and my old one. Let's take a bath and then decide what we should do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's do it!\" exclaimed both girls and the three of them headed off to the Obelisk Blue girls dorm.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Walking through halls of the girl's dorm, Jadnen made his way back to his new room with Jasmine and Mindy. As he got there and walked in, he recalled something. \"Oh yeah, you two were Alexis's room mates.\" Jaden said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, which means we're your room mates now.\" Mindy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it nice that you get to be room mates with your best friends?\" Jasmine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, th.\" Jaden said, his memories once again altering themselves. In his new memories, he remembered always being best friends with the two for as long as he could remember, ever since elementary school. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking forward to relaxing in the bath, the three began to undress from their uniforms. Neither Jasmine nor Mindy seemed to care that Jaden was in the room as they did. Looking over to Jaden as they did, they did notice something that they found strange though. \"You weren't wearing a bra, Jaden?\" Jasmine asked him with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Jaden said, then looked down and letout a light gasp as he saw his chest. \"Wow, I can't believe I forgot to put one on. I'm lucky no one noticed.\" The fact that Jaden was a boy, and thus had no breasts that would require the use of a bra, seemed to be lost on all three of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were finished, Jaden looked over to his currently naked friends, not reacting much to the sight, if at all, of the two naked girls before him. Likewise, they didn't seem to react to the sight of the naked boy before them. Mindy handed Jaden and Jasmine towells to cover themselves on the way to the bath outdoors. Like Jasmine and Mindy, Jaden wrapped his around his chest, and the three walked outside to the outdoor bath of the girl's dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, they weren't the only ones deciding to take a bath, . And despite clearly being a boy, none of the girls their found anything odd about his presence there. It was almost as if he was just another one of the girls as far as he or any of the real girls were concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three relaxed in the bath, the talked about a variety of subjects, such as classes and assignments, Duel Monsters, things that had happened to them, and such. And as usual for them, Jasmine and Mindy's coversation came to one of their favorite subjects: Boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All you two ever talk about is boys.\" Jaden said, rolling his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you could always join in.\" Mindy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one I'm interested in.\" Jaden replied. The fact that he was a heterosexual boy might be the reason he was disinterested in boys didn't seem to occur to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Alexis?\" Jasmine asked slyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what about Alexis?\" Jaden asked, a slight blush appearing on his face. He was glad that he was currently looking away from the other two, so that they wouldn't notice it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think you two would make the perfect couple.\" Mindy said. \"After all, you two seem like you were both made for each other. You two both obbsess over dueling. Alexis has dueling on the brain like 24/7, and you're always more interested in dueling than boys.\" And seemingly unknown to them, they were both now students who had personalities that were of the opposite gender of their bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you two are pretty close.\" Jasmine said. \"I think you you really like her. And I think she likes you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Alexis is a really good friend. Of course we like each other.\" Jaden reasoned. \"But 'like' in this situation is different from the way you two usually use the word when talking about boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Oh, don't be so shy, Jaden. I know you've got a thing for her.</i>\" Yubel teased as the Duel Spirit appeared above him, and lowered herself into the water next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I don't know what you're talking about.' Jaden thought to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I'm not ax crazy anymore, thanks to you.</i>\" Yubel said with a smirk. \"<i>If you're worried about how I might feel, you don't need to. I love you enough that I wouldn't mind having to share you a bit with someone like Alexis.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh be quiet, you.\" he said out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Mindy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing.\" Jaden said.</span></div></div>",

In fact, she seemed to feel a close connection with her and duel monsters than before.

Scurrying though it with her fingers she felt like she could hear her monsters. She felt like she could talk to her monsters all day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Alexis looked out the window she had a smile on her face. \"Aaaaaahhhh, now this is so much better than that obelisk blue girls dorm\" she said.

He was in a white top with blue trimmings with a blue miniskirt, and a pair of blue boots with a low heel. He also had on the blue fingerless gloves that went up to his elbow that Alexis always wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis meanwhile, was now wearing the red blazer of the Slifer dorm. The blazer was open, showing a black shirt under it, and also in a pair of jeans instead of the usual pair that most Slifer Reds wore. It was the same way Jaden wore his uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" Jaden let out as he took in the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did I get in this? And why are you dressed like that?\" Alexis let out in confusion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You look ridculous like that.</i>\" Yubel commented with a giggle. \"<i>But then again, it looks kinda cute on you.</i>\" she joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not helping.' he thought to himself, though he did agree with her. At least on the ridiculous. He did look and feel ridiculous. \"How did this happen? Was it the card?\"</span></div></div>",

It was mostly white, with some red lines on the front and a blue circle on the center of his chest. On hhis shoulders and arms were a bit of armor, and a strange antenna-like object sticking out at his elbow, and black gloves on her hands. On his head was a blue and white antenna-like hat going up from his forehead. \"Woah, this is pretty weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I'll say.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis meanwhile was now wearing a red and black mask that almost seemed heart shaped, and from the mask were several blue feather-like attatchments on both sides.

On the front of the body suit at the base of her neck there was a strange brooch with a red circle and a pair of blue wings, and on her feet were a pair of blue boots. \"Why are we dressed like our ace cards...?\" she wodered aloud.</span></div></div>",

He also noticed Alexis lying nearby, still dressed as her Cyber Prima as well. He then got up, and looked around, and instantly noticed his location had changed. He was no longer near the Acadmey! In fact, they definitely on the island. They now appeared to be in some sort of a forest, with trees taller than any he had ever seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, you're awake.\" he heard a voice nearby, and saw Yubel. And to his surprise, her form seemed completely solid, and wasn't the ghostly form the she was usually in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yubel, you've got a body again.\" he said with surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. That flash of light knocked me out as well, and when I woke up just a bit before you, we were all lying here, and I had a body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we, anyway?\" he wondered out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but we should probably wake up Alexis.\" Yubel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Jaden agreed. He then walked over to Alexis, and gently shook her to waker her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaden? What happened? Where are we?\" she asked him. Shethen noticed Yubel, and was surprised to see her, having not seen the duel spirit since the events of the other world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Lets have a look around.\" he said, and the three followed a path that, lucky enough, led them outside the forest. Once they exited it, they saw what they could only describe as a magical countryside. There were many fantastic, and familiar creatures. They all recognized them as ones from various cards they had seen. They saw a village in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis, I think we may be in some kind of Duel Monster's world.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again? But how?\" she asked with worry. Their last two times in a duel monsters world hadn't gone too well for any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. But this would explain my sudden body.\" Yubel replied. \"But for now, maybe we should head for that village. We might be able to learn something about what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" they both agreed. \"At least this place seems brighter and livelier than the last two.\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they made their way there, they noticed several of the creatures observing them. As they continued, they eventually reached the village, the monster guarding it, looked them over. \"Elemental HERO Neos, Yubel, and Cyber Prima? Welcome to the village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three walked into the village, Alexis and Jaden exchanged glances. \"Did he just call us by the monsters we're dressed as?\" Alexis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... think so?\" Jaden asked, unsure of what else to say. He was just as surprised. He may have been dressed a bit like him, but he didn't relly resemble his ace monster. What he and Alexis didn't know, as well as Yubel was that along with bringing them to this world, the card made it so that the two were now viewed as what they were dressed as, effectively taking the place of the Elemental HERO Neos and Cyber Prima.</span></div></div>",

As Jaden look down to see what the duel spirit meant, he saw that he was also now wearing a skintight gray bodysuit, along with a blue skirt, and several large rings, with a pair on both arms near his shoulder and an pair on both wrsits, ans a strange pair at his waist that seemed to not be connected to him and orbitted his new skirt. On the front of the body suit at the base of his neck there was a strange brooch with a red circle and a pair of blue wings, and on his feet were a pair of blue boots. He recognized his strange new attire as resembling one of Alexis's favorite cards, her Cyber Prima. He was shocked by being dressed like this, and a bit embarrassed being in a skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis reminded him that Alexis was with him, and turning to look at her, he saw that she was preocupied with her own strange change of attire, and saw she was also wearing a body suit, though different from her own. It was mostly white, with some red lines on the front and a blue circle on the center of her chest. On her shoulders and arms were a bit of armor, and a strange antenna-like object sticking out at her elbow, and black gloves on her hands. On her head was a blue and white antenna-like hat going up from her forehead. He couldn't possibly mistake her new attire, as they resembled his own ace card, his Elemental HERO Neos!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Alexis turned to look over to Jaden, and saw him dressed like her Cyber Prima. \"Jaden? Whats going on here?\" Why are we dressed like this?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got no idea.\" Jaden replied honestly. \"But I think it was that flash of light from the card.</span></div></div>",

And just like with Jaden's, hers wouldn't come off either. \"Mine won't come off either!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well, this sure went from being entertaining to a problem.</i>\" Yubel commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd though try as they both might, the clothes they now wore just wouldn't come off. They also seemed practically indestructible, as they wouldn't tear off as they even tried to rip them to get them off, and clung to their skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That card must have done this.\" Jaden said. \"But what could have happened to it? Where did it go?\" he said as he realized he didn't have it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think it just disappeared and is gone for good now, do you Jaden?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure hope not. I don't want to be stuck in this...\"</span></div></div>",

I think you can move those wings.\" Jaden said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" she questioned, not sure whether he was serious, but as she put a bit of effort into it, she watched as the wings spread wide. \"Woah...\" she let out in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are they real?\" Jaden asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not completely sure.\" Alexis responded as she moved one to feel it with her hands. \"It feels like a costume, and I can't actually feel it. But I can move them somehow as if they were my own limbs.\" She then had one thought, and just had to see how much these wings actually worked. With a few quick flaps, she found herself rising into the air, and began to float there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, Alexis! Your're flying!\" Jaden marveled in surprise, his annoyance at his attire temporarily forgotten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know!\" she replied, just as amazed. She didn't actually need her wings to move to be able to fly it appeared, as she wasn't flapping them, but wasn't losing any of her height. She flapped them a bit, when suddenly, feathers shot out from them, and shot downward at Jaden. They also appeared to be razor sharp at the ends. \"Jaden, look out!\" she warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" he yelled out in surprised as he raised his hands to protect himself. As he did, fire suddenly blazed up in his hands, and a fireball shot aout and burned the the feathers away before they could hit them. The fireball kept shooting up,  and would have hit Alexis if she didn't quickly descend to avoid it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaden, I'm really sorry about that!\" she appoliged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too, about almost hitting you with that fireball.\" he replied. The two then looked over themselves. \"I'm not sure how, but it looks like somehow, along with these costumes, we somehow got Avian and Burstinatrix's powers.\" he said, making a small flame appear in his hands for a moment. \"If I wasn't Burstinatrix, I might think that this was kinda cool.\"</span></div></div>",

With a sigh, she intended to get there attention, and with a flap of here wings, an strong gust of wind knoced almost everyone off of their feet. \"Now, everyone calm down.\" she said sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis, how did you do that?\" Jasmine asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when our clothes changed, it turned out we also gained the powers of the Hero we were dressed as.\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a demonstration, Jaden formed a fireball in his hand. \"See?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, thats pretty cool!\" Jesse said. And with that, a few of them tried their own powers out, such as Jasime forming her own fireball, Syrus shooting a quick blast of water from his hose and controling its path, and Jesse shooting a quick electrical bolt from his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, mayve this isn't so bad.\" Chazz said. \"At least I'm not dressed like a girl one like Jaden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for rubbing it in, Chazz.\" Jaden grumbled.</span></div></div>",

This time, the two also lost consciousness this time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jaden awoke, he stood up, and noticed with a frown that he was still dressed like his Burstinatrix. He also noticed Alexis lying nearby, still dressed as his Avian as well. He then got up, and looked around, and instantly noticed his location had changed. He was no longer near the Acadmey! In fact, they definitely on the island. They now appeared to be in some sort of a forest, with trees taller than any he had ever seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Good, you're awake.</i>\" he heard a voice nearby, and saw Yubel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Where are we, anyway?\" he wondered out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I don't know, but we should probably wake up Alexis.</i>\" Yubel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"Jaden agreed. He then walked over to Alexis, and gently shook her to waker her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaden? What happened? Where are we?\" she asked him. She then noticed Yubel, and was surprised to see her, having not seen the duel spirit since the events of the other world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden then noticed her staring at Yubel, despite being in her usual intangible form. \"Alexis, can you see Yubel?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\" she replied. \"Its kinda hazy, but yeah. But forget that for now. Where are we?\" she repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Lets have a look around.\" he said, and the three followed a path that was before them, with Yubel floating behind the two humans dressed as Duel Monsters, and  lucky enough, led them outside the forest. Once they exited it, they saw what they could only describe as a strange sight. There were many fantastic, and familiar creatures. They all recognized them as ones from various cards they had seen. They saw a huge city in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis, I think we may be in some kind of Duel Monster's world.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again? But how?\" she asked with worry. There last two times in a duel monsters world hadn't gone too well for any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I don't know.</i>\" Yubel replied. \"<i>But for now, maybe we should head for that city.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" they both agreed. \"At least this place seems brighter and livelier than the last two.\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, is it just me, or does that city look like my Skyscraper and Skyscraper 2 cards?\" he said, recognizing the similarities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it might.\" Alexis agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they made their way there, they noticed several of the creatures observing them. As they continued, they eventually reached the city gates, and the monster guarding it, looked them over. \"Oh, Avian, Burstinatrix! Welcome back!\" it greeted them excitedly. It also didn't seem like it could see Yubel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three walked into the city, Alexis and Jaden exchanged glances. \"Did he just call us by the monsters we're dressed as?\" Alexis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... think so?\" Jaden asked, unsure of what else to say. He was just as surprised. He may have been wearing her clothes, but he looked nothing like the Elemental Hero monster hewas dressed as. What he and Alexis didn't know, as well as Yubel was that along with bringing them to this world, the card made it so that the two were now viewed as what they were dressed as, effectively taking the place of Avian and Burstinatrix. And unsurprisingly, both of the monsters were also big time superheroes in the city, meaning that now, Jaden and Alexis were.</span></div></div>",

Everything seemed to be blue, and it took him a moment to realize he was now wearing a visor. \"Huh?\" he wondered aloud as he lefted it off, and then took at look down at it, and that was when he was met with surprise. His clothes had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>You look ridiculous.</i>\" Yubel told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, Jaden did. He was now wearing a skintight red and white bodysuit, along with a blue tutu. on his feet were a pair of ballet slippers, and each of his hands had a decorative rose on it. On He recognized his strange new attire as resembling one of Alexis's cards, her Cyber Tutu. He was shocked by being dressed like this, and a bit embarrassed being in a such a girly outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis reminded him that Alexis was with him, and turning to look at her, he saw that she was preocupied with her own strange change of attire, and saw she was also wearing a body suit, though different from his own. It was all red, and on its waist was a white skirt. On her face was a red cloth that covered her right eye, and there was a ribbon wrapped around each of her arms. She was also wearing the clothes of one of her Cyber Girl cards, her Etoile Cyber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Alexis turned to look over to Jaden, and saw him dressed like her Cyber Prima. \"Jaden? Whats going on here?\" Why are we dressed like this?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got no idea.\" Jaden replied honestly. \"But I think it was that flash of light from the card.</span></div></div>",

This time, the two also lost consciousness this time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jaden awoke, he stood up, and noticed with a frown that he was still dressed like Alexis's Cyber Tutu, mush to his displeasure. He also noticed Alexis lying nearby, still dressed as her Etole Cyber as well. He then got up, and looked around, and instantly noticed his location had changed. He was no longer near the Acadmey! In fact, they definitely on the island. They now appeared to be in some sort of a forest, with trees taller than any he had ever seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Good, you're awake.</i>\" he heard a voice nearby, and saw Yubel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Where are we, anyway?\" he wondered out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I don't know, but we should probably wake up Alexis.</i>\" Yubel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"Jaden agreed. He then walked over to Alexis, and gently shook her to waker her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaden? What happened? Where are we?\" she asked him. She then noticed Yubel, and was surprised to see her, having not seen the duel spirit since the events of the other world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden then noticed her staring at Yubel, despite being in her usual intangible form. \"Alexis, can you see Yubel?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\" she replied. \"Its kinda hazy, but yeah. But forget that for now. Where are we?\" she repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Lets have a look around.\" he said, and the three followed a path that was before them, with Yubel floating behind the two humans dressed as Duel Monsters, and  lucky enough, led them outside the forest. Once they exited it, they saw what they could only describe as a strange sight. There were many fantastic, and familiar creatures. They all recognized them as ones from various cards they had seen. They saw a huge city in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis, I think we may be in some kind of Duel Monster's world.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again? But how?\" she asked with worry. There last two times in a duel monsters world hadn't gone too well for any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I don't know.</i>\" Yubel replied. \"<i>But for now, maybe we should head for that city.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" they both agreed. \"At least this place seems brighter and livelier than the last two.\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, is it just me, or does that city look like my Skyscraper and Skyscraper 2 cards?\" he said, recognizing the similarities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it might.\" Alexis agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they made their way there, they noticed several of the creatures observing them. As they continued, they eventually reached the city gates, and the monster guarding it, looked them over. \"Welocome to this city, Etoile Cyber and Cyber Tutu.\" it greeted them. It also didn't seem like it could see Yubel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three walked into the city, Alexis and Jaden exchanged glances. \"Did he just call us by the monsters we're dressed as?\" Alexis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... think so?\" Jaden asked, unsure of what else to say. He was just as surprised. He may have been wearing her clothes, but he looked nothing like the Cyber Girl monster he was dressed as. What he and Alexis didn't know, as well as Yubel was that along with bringing them to this world, the card made it so that the two were now viewed as what they were dressed as, effectively taking the place of Cyber Tutu and Etoile Cyber.</span></div></div>",

But unfortunately for him, it didn't look like he was the one dressed like the Dark Magician...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe now wore the light blue blouse with pink trimming that would give anyone a view of his cleavage, if he had any, that is. It also came with a short pink cape, and a pink skirt. On his forearms were light blue sleeves that went from his wrists to his elbows, and on his feet were boots. And on his head was the hat, and he even held her wand in his hand. To say he felt ridiculous dressed up like the magical girl would be a serious understatement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis meanwhile, was now dressed in the purple robes of Yugi's favorite card, from the hat now on her head to the shoes on her feet. She even had his green staff in her hand. She felt pretty ridiculous dressed like this, though it paled in comparison to Jaden's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happened? Why am I dressed like this?!\"  Jaden yelled in embarassment. Alexis let out a giggle as she looked at Yugi. \"This isn't funny, Alexis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" she apologized. \"But you just look so cute like that\" she joked, and Jaden frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Shes right, you do look cute like that.</i>\" Yubel jokingly agreed. \"<i>Would you like me to call you the Dark Magician Girl now, as well?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>Not helping...</i>' Jaden thought towards the duel spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the two of them stood there, wondering what they were going to do about their current situation, there was suddenly another bright flash of light. This time, the two also lost consciousness this time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jaden awoke, he stood up, and noticed with a frown that he was still dressed like the Dark Magician Girl. He also noticed Alexis lying nearby, still dressed as the Dark Magician as well. He then got up, and looked around, and instantly noticed his location had changed. He was no longer on the Academy's island! They now appeared to be in some sort of a forest, with trees taller than any he had ever seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Good, you're awake.</i>\" he heard a voice nearby, and saw Yubel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Where are we, anyway?\" he wondered out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I don't know, but we should probably wake up Alexis.</i>\" Yubel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"Jaden agreed. He then walked over to Alexis, and gently shook her to waker her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaden? What happened? Where are we?\" she asked him. She then noticed Yubel, and was surprised to see her, having not seen the duel spirit since the events of the other world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden then noticed her staring at Yubel, despite being in her usual intangible form. \"Alexis, can you see Yubel?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\" she replied. \"Its kinda hazy, but yeah. But forget that for now. Where are we?\" she repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. Lets have a look around.\" he said, and the three followed a path that was before them, with Yubel floating behind the two humans dressed as Duel Monsters, and lucky enough, led them outside the forest. Once they exited it, they saw what they could only describe as a strange sight. There were many fantastic, and familiar creatures. They all recognized them as ones from various cards they had seen. They saw a village in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis, I think we may be in some kind of Duel Monster's world.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again? But how?\" she asked with worry. There last two times in a duel monsters world hadn't gone too well for any of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I don't know.</i>\" Yubel replied. \"<i>But for now, maybe we should head for that village.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" they both agreed. \"At least this place seems brighter and livelier than the last two.\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they made their way there, they noticed several of the creatures observing them. As they continued, a small group of fairies suddenly flew right by Jaden, and waved at him, and they heard a few of them say \"Hello Dark Magician Girl!\" and the fairies flew on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...did they just call you \"Dark Magician Girl?\"\" Alexis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... think so?\" Jaden asked, unsure of what else to say. He was just as surprised. He may have been wearing her clothes, but he looked nothing like the spellcaster. What he and Alexis and Yubel didn't know was that along with bringing them to this world, the card made it so that the two were now viewed as what they were dressed as, effectively taking the place of the Dark Magician and Dark Magician Girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, the two arrived in the village.</span></div></div>",

He then looked around, and nearby, he spotted Alexis, though a bit different that she had been a few moments ago. She was now dressed in and orange and black jacket with matching orange pants,and around her forehead was a black headband with a metal plate with a leaf-like design engraved on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis? What are you wearing?\" he asked, getting her attention, and she turned to look at him. When she did, a look of confusion was on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I should ask you the same thing.\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Just take a look at yourself. You'll see.</i>\" Yubel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then look downward at his own appearance as instructed, and was once again surprised. Like his friend was dressed in strange clothes, he was as well. He was dressed in a red sleeveless top, black shorts with a pinkish skirt-like cloth over them, and black sandals with heels. If he could have seen his head, he would have seen his hair had a red headband similar to the one Alexis had tying it up.</span></div></div>",

He was still outdoors, but not anywhere he recognized as part of the Academy's island. The surrounding area looked nothing like it. It was seemingly in the middle of nowhere. Looking around, he spooted Alexis nearby, though he also instantly noticed that her attire had completely changed. No longer in her normal ubiform, she was dressed in a bluish-purple sleeveless shirt with matching pants, and a pair of boots on her feet. She also wore a pair of gloves, and a steel pauldron on her left shoulder. However, the most striking thing about her appearance was the huge sword strapped to her back. And strangely, she didn't seemed burden by its weight, when it was sure to be extremely heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis.\" he said to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaden?\" she said as she turned to look at him, and he saw confusion in her eyes.

You look quite ridiculous.</i>\" Yubel said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to find out what they meant, he then looked down at what he was wearing, and discovered that he was dressed in a white tank top that exposed his midriff and black miniskirt. He also had on gloves that went up to his elbows, with a metal eblow guard on his left one, and a pair of boots. And though he could see his face, his crimal mark was absent from it, and he had a pair of teardrop shaped earings hanging in his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just whats going on here?\" Alexis asked him. \"Why are we dressed like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not too sure.\" he replied. \"But lets stay calm.\"</span></div></div>",

He was currently still outdoors, but from the looks of it, he definitely was not on the Academy island. Actually, he was apparently on what appeared to be a large moving ship if the view from the balcony he was standing by was any indication. He then looked around, and nearby, he spotted Alexis, though a bit different that she had been a few moments ago. She was now dressed in a black leather bomber jacket with fur trim on the collar and a low-cut white shirt underneath, and a pair of black pants. And strangely enough, a scar had appeared on herface, going down her forehead and between her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis? What are you wearing?\" he asked, getting her attention, and she turned to look at him. When she did, a look of confusion was on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I should ask you the same thing.\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Just take a look at yourself. You'll see.</i>\" Yubel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then look downward at his own appearance as instructed, and was once again surprised. Like his friend was dressed in strange clothes, he was as well. He was dressed in a , and it was even stranger than hers. He now wore a long, sleeveless, blue rib-knit duster sweater that has a pair of white wing designs on the back, and along with it, he had matching rib-knit arm warmers. He also wore a black halter top, a denim button up skirt, a black ribbon on his left arm, and black bike shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, how'd I get in these?\" he wondered outloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we'd both like to know what happened to us.\" Alexis said</span></div></div>",

Jaden's hair grew much longer all the way down to just above his butt. Alexis said, \"Jaden you...your hair it looks just like Blair! Is the card turning you into her?\" Jaden said, \"I....don't know, but maybe. Please help me up Alexis.\" Alexis nodded and helped Jaden stand up and he was surprisingly lighter than expected. As soon as he was standing she could see why he had lost a large amount of muscle leaving him with a skinner body all around. He had also shrunk in height quite a bit. He felt a pain in his stomach and waist as his from began to shift more. His waist caved in  leaving him with a developing hourglass figure as well child bearing hips. He felt his privates reverse themselves into the female equivalent. All the body hair he had disappeared leaving him with smooth skin all around. He felt his face being molded as his nose shrank down to a petite size and brown eyes darkened.He felt the burning focus on his chest as two small bumps appeared. He was now fully a girl and identical to Blair minus his clothes. The two were blinded by a bright flash of light when it died down Jaden was now dressed exactly like Blair with an orange shirt, black shorts a belt around her hip, black stockings and a pair of red boots. On top of her orange shirt an open red jacket over the orange top. Jaden could feel a bra and panties on his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden asked softly. \"Is it over now Alexis?\" He sounded exactly like Blair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis nodded, \"Yeah it seems so. I've never heard a card transform someone before. We should take you to Ms.Fontaine and make sure you are health.\" Jaden nodded not really feeling like arguing right now. The two began making their way to the nurse.</span></div></div>",

Jayden looked at his hands instead of seeing his usual hands, he saw a demonic feminine left hand and a demonic masculine righthand. Instead of freaking out he said, \u201c I always wanted to know how you saw the world\u2026 even my voice sounds like yours\u201d . \u201caren\u2019t you shocked by this?\u201d, said Yubel in Jayden\u2019s body a bit annoyed. \u201cthere is no point in freaking out, it won\u2019t do anything , we might have to accept that we might not switch back.\u201d , Jayden responded and he began checking himself out. He noticed that he still had his regular clothes on but it was adjusted and altered to fit his new body. \u201c you need to find away to fix this !\u2019 , Yubel said still freaked out. \u201c can\u2019t it wait a bit , I always wanted to try flying . \u201c , Jayden said having a bit of difficulty trying to spread his new wings. He managed to figure out how to control his new appendages and then leaped forward taking flight. It was short lasted and he crash landed on the floor. \u201c I must still get used to flapping these wings.\u201d , he said in Yubel\u2019s sweet voice a bit embarrassed.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the blinding light began to die down, something would obviously be different to any onlookers if they had been around. Where two people had been standing a moment ago, there now stood only one person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new person had quite the unusual appearance. The facial features was rather androgynous, and one would be unable to tell if this person was a boy or girl. However, it was other aspects of this person's appearance that was strange. The hair was rather odd, being made of two different colors ans styles split evenly down the middle. The right side was long and blond and looked just like Alexis's, while the left side was shorter and brown and resembled Jaden's. The person's eyes were also different colors, with the right eye being a yellowish shade and the left eye was brown. The person was wearing the white top that the girl's of the Obelisk Blue dorm wore, but over it was an open Slifer Red blazer and the blue sailor collar going over it. On the legs was a blue miniskirt, and a pair of sneakers on the feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person standing there was both Jaden and Alexis, their bodies having somehow fused together by the card. \"Wh-what just happened?\" the new boy spoke, and the sound that came out was both Jaden's and Alexis's voices at once, speaking in perfect unison. \"Our body...\" This new person that had been created from them knew it had been them, both of their minds and thoughts appearing in its head. Suddenly, the body froze up and its expression glazed over, and a red and blue light came out of the body, and the lights took form and became ghost-like spirits of Jaden and Alexis floating just outside the body. The two spirit bodies looked from one another and then at their new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Jaden? Wh-what is going on?</i>\" Alexis asked, how worried she was being evident in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I don't know.</i>\" Jaden honestly replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What should we do? I mean, this is too weird.</i>\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Perhaps first, you should find out a few things about your new body since you don't know how long it will be like this.</i>\" Yubel suggested as she appeared. Alexis was a bit surprised to see the duel spirit, but then again, she was also a spirit right now. \"<i>For example, maybe you should find out if both of you need to be in this body at once for it to work, or if either of you can be alone in it.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>That does sound like something we should try.</i>\" Jaden said, and Alexis nodded. Touching the body, his spirit turned into a red light and entered the body. Unlike before, his it was his mind his mind alone in the body right now. Moving the body, everything moved normally. He then turned to where Alexis and Yubel's spirits floaed nearby. \"Well, everything is fine for me. Well, other than the bosy.\" he told them, his voice alone speaking. The body then froze and its expression glazed over as Jaden's spirit exited body. \"<i>Your turn.</i>\" he said to Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, she touched the body and her spirit body became blue light as it entered the fused body. Like with Jaden, it was currently her alone in the body, and everything moved for her normally. \"It works fine for me.\" she said to the two spirits, the body speaking with just her voice. And once again, the body then froze and its expression glazed over as Alexis's spirit left. \"<i>Now what?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>There is something else to try.</i>\" Yubel said. \"<i>Since I'm a part of Jaden's soul, thi new body is technically mine as well. You can even see it seems to take some influences from me, such as with the hair and eyes. I want to see if I can use it as well. If you'll allow me that is.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well, I don't have a problem.</i>\" Jaden said. \"<i>What about you, Alexis?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well, if you're okay with it, I'll let her.</i>\" Alexis agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, the duel spirit touched the empty shell of a body, and became a white light as she did and enterd it. The body moved and then turned to the two human spirits. \"It looks like I can also use it as well.\" Yubel said, the body speaking in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>So then, now what?</i>\" Alexis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enter the body, both of you.\" Yubel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Huh?</i>\" the two let out in unison, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm curious what would happen, what it would be like if all three of us were in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well, I guess we should find out. C'mon, Alexis.</i>\" Jaden said, and Alexis nodded. The two human spirits touched the body, and Jaden became a red light and Alexis a blue one, as they both entered into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, it felt as if all three of their minds were one, and it was slightly hard to tell which thoughts were whose, though it was possible. But at the same time, it all felt natural. Thoughts of Jaden also felt as if they were their own to Alexis and Yubel, and the same was true of theirs to the other two. Currently, the three were of one mind, and was almost as if they were a single person. \"This is kinda strange, but it feels normal.\" they said, all three of their voices speaking in unison. \"It feels like we're only one person, but at the same time, we still feel like a 'we' rather than and 'I.' We identify ourselves as Jaden, Alexis, and Yubel while we're like this.\" They then thought about what to next. \"Should we start looking for a way to fix our body problem, or should we tell our friends and have them help us.\" they said, sthinking out loud.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the light died down and their vision cleared, Jaden and Alexis immediately realized a two things were wrong. For starters, rather than standing on their feet, they were both hunched over on all fours. And secondly, and the most important of the differences, their clothes had disappeared, leaving them both completely naked. The only things on them were collars, a red one on Jaden and a blue one on Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing brightly, Alexis attempted to cover herself, but found that her arms weren't working right. Trying to get up, they also found that they couldn't stand up properly; they could balance on their feet for a few moments, but it was shaky, and they both ended up falling back onto their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Jaden, what's going on!</i>\" Alexis screamed with fear, \"<i>Why am I naked?! Why can't I stand up?! Wha-</i>\" She cut herself off as she realized something else. Despite her screaming, she wasn't hearing her words - she was hearing barking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden meanwhile noticed something else. While he clearly heard Alexis barking, he found that he somehow undersood exactly what she was trying to stay. \"<i>What is going on?</i>\" Jaden gasped, and was greeted by a \"Woof!\" of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Jaden, why are we barking like a dogs?! And why can we understand it!?</i>\" she screamed in another series of barks.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"<i>I don't know.</i>\" Jaden said as calmly as he could. \"<i>But lets try to stay calm here. We can't panic.</i>\" His words were still coming as a series of barks and woofs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well, this is pretty strange.</i>\" Yubel said as she appeared next to Jaden. Like with Jaden and Alexis, her spirit body was also currently forced on all fours, and was in a sitting possition crouched over with her hands planted in front, and was basically sitting like a dog. \"<i>Whatever is affecting you two is also affecting me as well.</i>\" the duel spirit barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were confused by these strange turn of events, they suddenly heard a voice speak, and one using words and not barks. \"Ah, there they are!\" Somehow managing to blush even harder, Alexis's head whipped up - and her eyes widened in further shock. There were some dogs walking towards them - dogs that were walking upright and wearing clothes! There was a dog in a Slifer Red blazer, one in a Ra Yellow blazer, one in an Obelisk Blue boys uniform and one in an Obelisk Blue girls uniform.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs the two continued to stare in shock, the dog wearing the Ra Yellow uniform said, in perfect English, \"I'm glad they didn't go too far. Looks like they just wanted some fresh air.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were worried about you, Alexis.\" the dog in the girl's uniform said as she pet Alexis on the head, much to her shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and we were worried about you too, Jaden.\" the dog in the Slifer Red uniform said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now that we found your humans, Spike, now can we head back in?\" the dog in the blue boys uniform said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm just happy my two humans are safe.\" the dog in the Slifer uniform, Spike, said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs this all went on, Jaden and Alexis, as well as Yubel, were just confused.</span></div></div>",

Alexis couldn't help but feel completely mortifed by her current situation. Here she was, currently naked and she couldn't do anything to cover up. And on top of that, she was being treated as if she was a dog, and by real dogs no less! At least she had Jaden here to help her through this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as for Jaden, he thought about the current situation. It was definitely weird, and he knew he had to find some way for him and Alexis to return to normal, though he currently had no idea, other than maybe finding that card again. He also payed a bit of attention to Spike and Precious, who were chatting a bit with each other about various things such as dueling, their friends, things going on, and each other. He also got the feeling that the two might like each other as more than friends. As he looked around boredly, he suddenly noticed something nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>SQUIRELL!</i>\" Jaden barked out loudly as he realized what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>WHERE!?</i>\" Alexis yelled out excitedly as she instantly turned her head in the direction Jaden was looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Jaden and Alexis were excited now, there worries completely forgotten for the moment. It was a squirrel, and they knew they absolutely had to chase it. The two of them tried to run after it, but were held back by their leashes, though that didn't seem to disuade them as they struggled to try to go after it, though the dogs didn't give in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Squirrel! Squirrel! I wanna chase it! I wanna catch it!</i>\" The two of them barked, and continued to yell/bark at the animal, who had heard them, and had started to take off in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, realx boy.\" Spike said to Jaden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, girl.\" Precious said to Alexis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Let go, its getting away!</i>\" Alexis complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I wanna chase it!</i>\" Jaden barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut unfortunately for the two humans, their desire just wouldn't come true, as the teo dogs held the leashes firmly, and prevented their pursuit. Eventually, the squirrell had ran out of their sight. \"<i>Awwwww.</i>\" the two whined with disappointment. After they had calmed down, only then did they realize what had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a look of what was practically horror, Alexis turned to Jaden. \"<i>J-jaden, why t-the hell did we just do that?</i>\" she asked him fearfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I don't know. For some reason, I just really wanted to cath that squirrell, and was overwhelmed by that desire...</i>\" Jaden told her. \"<i>Alexis, I think the longer we're like this, the more we're gonna act like dogs!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Things just keep getting worse for us...</i>\" Alexis groaned as the two dogs resumed walking the humans.</span></div></div>",

Is that suppose to happen?\" Jaden asks.<br>\r\n\"Well yes it is. When a girl grows breast it starts to hurt. That's why girls wear bra's to lessen the pain.\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n\"Can i borrow one?\" Jaden said.<br>\r\n\"Sure Jay. Let me go get one.\" Alexis said as she puts the tray down and goes inside her closet. When she comes back she was holding a blue bra and giving it to Jaden.<br>\r\n\"Um how do you wear this?\" Jaden asks.<br>\r\n\"Here let me help.\" Alexis said as she took the bra and took of Jaden's Blazer and shirt releasing her breasts that were now stuck on Jaden. Alexis then put the bra on Jaden who in turned felt the pain subside. <br>\r\n\"There Jay.\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n\"Thanks Lex!\" Jaden said happily.

Jaden now wore the uniform of the Obelisk Blue girls, with the white sleeveless blazer with blue sailor collar, blue miniskirt, blue high heel boots, and even wore Alexis's fingerless gloves. As for Alexis, she now wore a Slifer Red blazer that was open to reveal a black shirt under it, a pair of jeans, and sneakers. They were now dressed in each other's clothes However, even though they were now dressed in each other's uniform, they didn't seem bothered by that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sure was weird.\" Jaden commented, putting his hands on his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say.\" Alexis agreed. \"Good thing it didn't seem to do anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Jaden agreed. \"Anyway, I think we should get going to class. You don't want to be late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right.\" she agreed. \"Don't want Crowler getting on my case again.\" And with that, the two headed to class. Jaden was walking much more femininely, with his hips swaying, while Alexis had a more maculine stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them were completely unaware of what had happened to them, and that was that they had swapped lives with one another. Jaden Rhodes as he was now known. had taken Alexis's place, and despite not having physically changed in the slightest, now had everything about her life. He was now the top student in the girls dorm, had the best grades in school, and was nicknamed by the other students as the Queen of Obelisk Blue. And of course, he was also the most attractive one in the girl's doem, and had many male admirers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the occupant of his own life, now known as Alexis Yuki, who also hadn't changed physically, now had everything about his life. A bit of a slacker when it came to schoolwork, and not the brightest sometimes, but despite her grades, she was a great duelist, and one of the best in the whole school. Though she was in Slifer Red, the dorm regarded as the worst, she was better than most in Obelisk Blue. And like Jaden had been just moments ago, it was now her soul that Yubel was fused to, and the duel spirit was also completely unaware of the change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo these two, and anyone else, the two of them had always had their current lives, and nothing was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what about the card that did this?</span></div></div>",

Her body was phsysical once more, and she was not restricted to her spirit form. She was also now wearing some clothes. She wore a white sleeveless blazer with red trimming and a red miniskirt. It looked like a Slifer version of the Obelisk Girls uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yubel? How are you like that all of a sudden?\" Jaden asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure.\" she replied. \"I'm just as confused by this as you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure whats going on either, but it was probably the card.\" Alexis said. It was very strange for her to see Yubel again after the whole mess in the other dimension, but she and the others had been told before that she was no longer a threat and had changed. But she still felt slightly tense seeing her again after everything that happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden looked at the card that had seemingly done this, and it was still blank. He then turned back to look at Yubel. \"I wonder why you're wearing clothes and dressed like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys!\" They heard someone call out to them, and saw their friends, Syrus, Hassleberry, Chazz, Jesse, Blair, Jasmine, and Mindy walking over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jaden.\" Jesse greeted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Alexis. Hey Yubel.\" Mindy greeted the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three exchanged looks of surprise. Apparently, they were the only ones who noticed how strange the current situation was. It was because reality had altered. Now, in this new one, Yubel had been a student as long as Jaden, Alexis, and some of the others, and the events in the other dimension hadn't happened. She was also friends with the rest of the group, and no one else found her non-human apearance strange. Only Jaden, Alexis, and Yubel were aware if the previous reality.</span></div></div>",

The sun was shining and Syrus was walking on the Acedemy grounds, hoping that nobody strong wants to challenge him to a duel. His short stature, large eyes and shy personality gave many the impression that he was a little kid. He certainly looked like one to the point where if you put him around everyone else who looks older but in the same age group as he was you would think that he was a small boy, which lead many to underestimate his dueling skills. But he was very fortunate to have friends like Jaden, his best friend, Alexis who he acts as a sisterly figure to him, and even Hassleberry who actually does look like a general in comparison to him. Being so small and little boy like wasn't all bad however.He had to admit that many of the obelisk blue girl students thought of him as the cutest little boy in the academy. Seeing as he had the stature of one and didn't really look like anyone else his age the girls called him a little boy. \t<br>\r\n             <br>\r\n            \u201cOh man\u201d Syrus said, walking around being cautious as ever. He was heading to the Slifer red dorm to meet Jaden when something caught his eye while he was on the path to the dorm. \u201cHuh, hey what\u2019s this\u201d Syrus said to himself, looking down to his right he saw a peculiar blank card.  It was green so he knew it was a spell card but he didn\u2019t know why it was blank. \u201cThat\u2019s weird\u201d he said, picking up the card with his little boy looking fingers. \u201cHmm\u201d he exclaimed.  He stared at the card for a few seconds, but at that moment, \u201cHey half pint\u201d said a voice from behind Syrus. \u201cAaah\u201d Syrus screamed wide eyed in shock when Hassleberry came from behind him and put his buff arm around Syrus\u2019s neck in a playful friendly hold. \u201cWhatca got there\u201d. \u201cHaven\u2019t you ever heard of saying excuse me before you scare someone like that?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve gotta make sure you stay alert \u2018cause you never know if danger could be coming in any direction\u201d Hassleberry said in his Sergeant lingo. \u201cYou\u2019re the only danger around here\u201d Syrus said while still holding the card. Hassleberry then released his grip. \u201cSo what\u2019s that blank card you got\u201d he asked. \u201cBeats me, I just found this.\u201d Suddenly the card began glowing. \u201cHuh\u201d Syrus said as he stared at the light. Suddenly a bright flash of light blasted and enveloped both of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Throug squinting from the sheer brightness of the light he noticed that the light only hit syrus. \"Truesdale, whats happening\" the buff Ra yellow duelist asked the small boy like teen. \"Aaaaah\" Syrus was screaming as the light was affecting his body. There was a bluish glow outlining him along with what could be identified as a male symbol being projected. Although he himself couldn't see it, he was changing. Hassleberry stood in disbelief at what was happening. The glow surrounding Syrus was also changing colors. The blue around him grew lighter as it changed into a reddish pink. His voice had changed as well, from his screams of pain it could be heard that his voice was becoming higher pitched than usual. The next change was his hair. Usually an upside down W it grew and went down. He now had girl like bangs and his hair flowed down to his back. The blue on it was also a bit lighter. His eyes while closed had their eyelashes combed and grown a few centimenters. His fingers became more slender and toned along with his arms and his fingernails sharpened and grew a bit as well. Now came the lower body. His waist constricted and his hips flared out as his backside grew a bit further and stretched his currently male pants, giving him an hourglass shape similar to Alexis, Jasmine and Mindy. His chest swelled into 2 fair sized breasts that were approrpriate for a person his...or her age, pressing against his blazer but not to large to reveal cleavage through it. His legs had their thighs grow and like his arms become slender and toned. As the change finished the symbol was now changed from male to female and Syrus' new aura was a bright pink. Syrus had now officially become a girl with the only physical resemblance to his male form being his glasses. The glow and female symbol had disappeared and the card fell to the ground. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n       Newly feminized, Syrus was exhausted from his transformation and passed out on the ground, the card laying next to him/her. \"Truesdale\" Hassleberry said while managing to get out from the trance Syrus' transformation instilled on him with its unimaginable sight. \"Uh Sy\" Hassleberry asked, nudging on his shoulder, only recieving quiet grunts from syrus' new and strangely soothing girl voice. Not sure what to do he didn't want to wake Syrus up and have him see he's a girl, so he did the only thing a chivalrous man would do for a lovely lady, so to speak. He picked him/her up in his arms and decided to run over to Mrs Fontane, the school nurse and ask her for help, leaving the card behind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Hassleberry ran he looked down at Syrus, his new female face's eyelashes long and glistening in the sunlight. Hassleberry had to admit, even though it sounded weird, Syrus was quite a pretty girl, his/her long hair drooping down, glowing a bright blue, his glasses on his new small nose and his skin smooth and unblemished. \"Man, i've gotta get this shrimp turned back to normal or I'm gonna go thinking the weirdest things\", he said, still carrying Syrus' female body to Ms fontanes office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n              \"Ughh where, where am I\" Syrus said in a soothing light female voice, still too groggy to notice. He woke up and saw something unusual, he was wearing a pink nightgown and his hair was obscuring his vision a bit. When his vision cleared he saw that he was in a bed in Ms Fontane\u2019s office lying quite comfortably. \u201cHmm,\u201d Syrus said as he turned around, long hair swishing from left to right. Next to him were Jasmine and Mindy, two girls from the Obelisk blue dorm. Mindy thought Syrus was cute and now that he was a girl he was 10x as cute. They were sitting by his side, big happy smiles on their faces. \u201cHi Syrus, giggle\u201d the two of them said, giggling and putting their hands over their mouths in amusement of something. \u201cUh, hey Jasmine, Mindy, how are you? What\u2019s so funny?\u201d Syrus asked, not knowing that \u201che\u201d was the joke.\u201cWe\u2019re good Syrus\u201d Mindy said \u201cbut your definitely different now\u201d Jasmine said giggling. \u201cHuh\u201d Syrus replied, not sure what she meant by that, until he felt something brush on his hands. As he turned around he saw what he had felt and saw it was hair. \u201cWha-what the\u201d Syrus said, feeling the flock of hair in his hand as he realized it was his hair. His hair was now long and smooth, going down to his back. It spread on the bed in all directions as he sat up in it. Also his arms were toned, with feminine hands and long fingernails. He now had breasts that pushed against his new girly nightgown that he was wearing, his waist was thin and his hips wide just like Jasmine and Mindy as he felt his gown being pushed from the sides by his larger hips.  \u201cWha, what happened to me\u201d Syrus said with his even higher pitched girl voice. He felt his face with his new feminine hand, his cheek now smooth. \u201cI\u2019m, I\u2019m, a girl\u201d. \u201cYou sure are cutie\u201d. Mindy commented. \u201cYou\u2019re so beautiful\u201d Jasmine said, stroking Syrus\u2019 smooth hair.  Both her and Mindy had smiles on their happy go lucky faces. \u201cStop that, I\u2019m a guy. I am not a girl\u201d Syrus protested, to which Jasmine and Mindy replied with two smiles. \u201cHate to break it to you Sy but, you are a girl\u201d Jasmine said. \u201cYou see, Hassleberry said that you turned into a girl and passed out when you found some card\u201d Mindy said to the newly feminized and overwhelmed Syrus. \u201cWe didn\u2019t believe it at first, but after seeing how you looked we believed it\u201d Jasmine added. \u201cSo then we just had to get you out of those boy clothes and into a cute little gown to sleep in, it really fits you, giggle\u201d Mindy said. Syrus couldn\u2019t believe it. He had to accept that he was now a she. Syrus grabbed a flock of her hair and held it in her hands, rubbing it on his long nailed fingers. \u201cSo then, I really am a girl\u201d Syrus said sadly. Mindy and Jasmine however decided to cheer him up. \u201cAww don\u2019t be upset Syrus, you look pretty\u201d Mindy said endearingly, her hand on Syrus\u2019 shoulder. \u201cYeah, your one of us girls now. We\u2019re gonna help you out, Ok Sy?\u201d Syrus blushed and cheered up. \u201cReally\u201d she said hopefully. \u201cTotally, you\u2019re so cute with those adorable eyes and that lovable smile we can\u2019t say no\u201d Mindy said, pinching Syrus\u2019 cheek, admiring its smoothness. \u201cOk Syrus, first things first\u201d Jasmine said. \u201cLet\u2019s get you-they suddenly started talking together and holding hands \u201cIn uniform\u201d they said giggling. Syrus however, had a very uneasy feeling about this. With her new long hair, breasts and girly nightgown, she wasn\u2019t sure how she was going to handle all this change with being a girl, let alone dressing like one. Jasmine suddenly pulled out an Obelisk blue girls uniform from the closet in the nurses office, a sleeveless button top with a blue miniskirt and blue high heel boots. Syrus looked at the shirt with disbelief, not believing he was going to have to wear that with his new girl body. He couldn\u2019t help but feel ridiculous with his female body. As Mindy held the shirt in front of Syrus with her manicured fingers she said \u201cYou\u2019ll look totally fetch with this on, and don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ve got plenty of other outfits too, cutie\u201d she kissed him on his now smooth cheek with her clear lips. Despite being a girl, his mentality hadn\u2019t changed(yet), so he couldn\u2019t help but blush at the feeling of being kissed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n           Afterwards, Syrus had gotten out of bed. Taking a moment to take in his new form he looked down, his breasts pushing  a little bit against his gown, which went all the way down to his legs, slim and toned like Jasmine and Mindy. The weight of his breasts heavy a bit, not as heavy as Jasmine and Mindy\u2019s probably were but still weighing him down a bit. He was still a boy at heart so he didn\u2019t mess with his new features. Suddenly the clacking of high heels was heard. Mindy and Jasmine had come back and looked at Syrus with adorement. \u201cAww, shes so cute standing up\u201dMindy said, her hands together adoring Syrus\u2019 cute little eyes and small size. He would have to get used to being called a she. \u201cOk, your gonna have to go change in there, Sy\u201d Jasmine pointed, her hand on her thin hip, pointing to the room that was next to one of the beds. It was a girls changing room. Syrus couldn't help but freak out knowing he'd have to go in there. \"B-but thats the girls changing room\" he sputtered with his high pitched girl voice. Jasmine then added \"Um, hello, what do you think you are\" she said, her hands on her hips. \"Oh yeah...\" Syrus said, still not used to being a girl. \u201cWell, alright\u201d Syrus said, her female voice a bit nervous. As she took the first step she suddenly felt two arms wrap around her waist and pull her into a warm embrace. \u201cOh Syrus, you\u2019re so cute, you\u2019ll look great in this uniform. SMOOCH\u201d. Mindy said one last time as she kissed her with a big love filled kiss on her cheek, still admiring her now cuter girl form. Syrus however stood blushing from the kiss. She liked Mindy and Jasmine as friends and she had a feeling she was going to like them more as friends now. So she went into the changing room. \"I'll do this but i have to get back to normal soon\" she said and began to get dressed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He, Jaden and the rest were ready to start their third year at Duel Academy while Hasselberry and Blair were about to start their second one. There was also something about a promotion for him going into Obelisk Blue after his performances and high grades he scored last year. He knew he would feel a bit lonely with him moving to a new dorm, since while he was still in Ra Yellow he had more opportunities to visit Jaden and the gang at Slifer Red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut currently, he was looking at a blank card he found near the gates of the academy. His issues with moving out were obscured by a curiosity about the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this the real deal? I never thought I'd found this here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what exactly did ya find Truesdale?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyrus yelped at the sudden question as he turned around to see Hasselberry with a grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't scare me like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Sorry 'bout that. But what's with that blank card in your hand? Did you find a misprint at the shop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I found it near the gates.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. Odd place for this to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well actually....\", began Syrus with his explanation. \"Remember that magic show we had not that long ago?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean the one with the magician brought by Crowler? Yeah, I do. It was pretty neat. One of the few good things he did as a principal...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that moment when he called a few students to hold these blank cards on the stage and said they can make wishes come true? Like make money appear and getting to find your old stuff.... I have been thinking. What if we tell it we want to become Obelisk Blue students? I mean we could finally be at the top with the big guys. And we won't have to hear from Crowler that we are lazy in that situation. It works only three times if I remember. So we could have two more wishes left...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the possibility to move with his friends into the Obelisk dorms would be perfect as they wouldn't be fragmented and they would benefit from the comfort of the place as well. But Hasselberry gave a sigh at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Sy. You know things like that don't happen. The guys who went on stage either were in cahoots with the magician or simply had good luck. First there is Jaden with the spirits and now you with this magic stuff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... what if it's real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it... I mean...\" He then took the card from Syrus's hand to look at it. \"It's just a blank card. I can't see something like this granting wishes. It's like with the magic well thing... But I do wish the two of us could be in Obelisk... as improbable as it is.\" He then gave the card back, with neither noticing a faint glow from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right... It does seem a bit outstretched.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course it is... But I was wondering one thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the guys in the blue dorms get in there due to their grades... But I wonder how did the girls that hang with Alexis got in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean Jasmine and Mindy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not surprised Alexis is in there, but those two make me wonder how easy is the entry there. I mean, the don't Duel unless it's either a test or a demonstration and seem more interested in the basics than in actual Dueling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I know they have high grades... but when it comes to Dueling, they are a bit unexcited. And I've heard they remade their Decks recently as well, but I haven't seen them Duel anybody.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. And not to mention their obsession with boys. They always talk about getting boyfriends instead of Del and such. Even Alexis is tired of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... That's true...They might think this is just a regular academy where we could find romance and such... I admit it makes me curious. I wish I would know exactly what they are thinking.\" Just then, the card glowed again, but a bit stronger this time. Hasselberry thought he saw a light come out of the card, but merely thought it was just an optical illusion or something. \"Anyway, let's head to class. The supplementary classes are about t begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me again why are we going? I know Jaden needs to go since he is still in Slifer, but why do we go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We may need some new strategies. Cards are being made non-stop. Who knows what types of decks we mind find in the future. A bit of preparation doesn't matter much... And I kind of feel bad for Jaden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I will go for the latter more than anything else.\", joked Hasselberry as Syrus put the Card in his pocket as the two went to class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith two wishes already made, the Card was now ready to make them real. But since both were vague, it decided to accomplish them in a special way...</span></div></div>",

But there is no wind. But it wasn't so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's just me since I have no sleeves... By the way, does Chazz and Blair go to the session as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, they don't. Since they were the last two standing in the tournament they have the day off from the session. Chazz said he needed more time anyway to get all his stuff back from when the Society of Light was still a thing. And Blair wants to get accustomed to the place since this is technically her first year here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two were talking, they were now ignoring the slightly colder sensation of their skin as they lost any bits of hair that they had. Also, their shoes began to change color with faint traces of blue starting to appear on them as they began to get a tad smoother, with Hasselberry's boots more so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I am amazed she picked Slifer. I would've guessed she wanted in Obelisk since it was the only dorm that had girls sleep separate from the guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am guessing because she may have a crush on Jaden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You thought so too? She did seem a bit clingy before... Wait, but you said she came here before dressed as a guy. Was she also like that then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, last year she had a crush on Zane. She dressed herself as a boy and then began following my brother around. But Jaden caught her when she sneaked into Zane's room and found out her true gender. Then they Dueled for having Jaden keep his mouth shut about the whole thing, as we found out she also was younger than normal to attend the academy. In the end, Jaden won and she had to go back home. But at the end, the confessed that she began to have a crush on Jaden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing that made him freeze in place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No joke. He hadn't said a word about it for a week before he was again comfortable with the subject.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two were laughing a little, their footwear continued to change as the black, and in Syrus's case the yellow, were now replaced with a dark blue color. They then began to change physically. Their feet began to get daintier as their nails got trimmed and gained a thin layer of gloss. Syrus also climbed in height a little bit while Hasselberry's muscles lost a tiny bit of their definition. These changes were currently unseeable, thus the two remained unfazed by the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you gotta admit, that the whole thing is a bit cute. I mean, Blair did come back for Jaden, didn't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... But it's also a bit sad. She is a few years younger than him, so I don't think it will work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you never know. Atticus always said romance comes in many shapes and forms, that age isn't important... or whatever. She may get a chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe subject of romance wasn't something the two would ever talk about. Especially Syrus, after the whole academy found out about his crush on Dark Magician Girl... But at the moment, the two seemed a bit interested in it. They felt something was off by the conversation, but they shook off their heads as they approached the front gates.</span></div></div>",

Once they got closer, they found out it was Jaden with a somewhat miserable expression on his face. Once they got closer, Syrus saluted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey guys! Are you coming for the course too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. We didn't want ya to be alone in this mess as Chazz and Blair are not coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. But it's not like it will be that much of a hassle. I'll just snooze my way through the lessons. I'll just have to pretend to be awake once we get to Crowler's lesson.\", said Jaden with a carefree smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, the guys would gave an awkward laugh at this, would sigh or would try to convince Jaden to at least be awake during classes. But new thoughts went into their heads as new opinions were forming regarding their friend's behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile processing the new thoughts, their pants got tighter on them, which made their legs a bit more visible, especially in Hasselberry's case. His hairless skin also began to lighten a little bit from its deep tan while Syrus did the reverse and became slightly more tanned. Jaden thought something was off, but before he could ask what was wrong, Syrus told him:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez Jaden, you could try to pay attention. As boring as it could be, if you can get onto the teacher's good side, it would benefit you a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? As long as I pass the practical exam with flying colors, for the written exam, I will just score enough points for a D.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do realize we won't help you with the test right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? I am sure there is a way to peek-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Jay. But Hasselberry is right. We don't want to get in trouble. No offense, but... I think the reason why the teachers give you such a hard time besides sleeping in class is because you are a Slifer. You could try and study so that you could get in another dorm. You know that the teachers put less pressure on the guys from the yellow and blue dorms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I mean, if Chazz managed to do great before he got in Slifer, I am sure you can do better as well. Ya aren't dumb, but you are kind of lazy. I think it's high time for you to begin studying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden was literally shocked. He knew his friends wouldn't always help him on a whim if that would put them in trouble. But never before he thought they would try and lecture him to be more studious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case, let's just head to class for the moment.\", said Syrus as the three went inside, with Jaden still thinking about what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked, the shoes continued changing, without Jaden or the two noticing. Syrus's shoes got a bit longer as they began to cover his ankles while both his and Hasselberry's lost their usual method to close them, as both gained a side zipper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, what is with them today? Don't they know how boring some of these lessons could be? I even saw them sleep in class before. I wonder if something happened... And was it just me or did Syrus seem a little taller? And I swear Hasselberry doesn't wear pants like those... Anyway, if they are upset or something I'll just ask them later. Right now, they seem a bit out of it.\"</span></div></div>",

To their slight surprise, besides the Slifer students, there also were some Ra and Obelisk students as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why are some Obelisk and Ra guys here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\", started off Jaden. \"When Saritorius took over Obelisk, his students didn't participate at all the classes and even had their own schedule, separate from the rest of us. That's why the brainwashed people, after the whole thing was over had to take a few extra lessons to recover the lost ones. But the guys who did well at the tournament got excused for today, including Alexis. The same goes for the guys from Ra who got unlucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that explains why some people were waking up early this morning... But it seems like students from different dorms sit differently. Slifer at the bottom, Ra in the middle and Obelisk at the top. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?! Oh, man... So I'll be on my own...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheer up Jay. It's not like it's a test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. It's not like we aren't here. We're just up a few seats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks guys...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden wanted to go on with the discussion a bit more, but the teacher just so happened to arrive in the class. Syrus and Hasselberry waved at Jaden as they went to their seats, with Jaden going lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class then began, with teacher beginning explaining different strategies to counter Burn Decks. Syrus and Hasselberry weren't enthusiastic about the lesson, but listened anyways as it could prove useful to some future Duels. As they were listening, more changes happened to them. While writing down a few things here and there, their hands began to slim down. Their fingers became longer and daintier. Despite taking a few glances at his now smaller hands, Hasselberry didn't seem to notice the changes, nor the fact that his armbands vanished. Meanwhile, Syrus's blazer and top began to slowly recede as his wrists were now visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the lesson went on, the two began wondering where the earlier comments about Jaden's laziness came from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did I go that far? I mean, I know how lazy Jaden can be. But he is right about some classes being boring. And I know he already knows a lot about Dueling...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why in Sam Hill did I get so upset? It's not like Jaden finds lesson boring to annoy people. Some actually are, the teachers continue nagging at him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, their legs finished their transformation into slim, athletic feet that seemed a bit smaller than they should got a boy. Their pants, also began to shift color. The original colors were slowly turning a pale blue as the material got a tiny bit softer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...But he should at least try to please the teachers. He must know by now how hard is to make yourself liked. If you say lessons, are not your thing, that's fine, but sleeping in class is just stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... And he still doesn't care. If he wants to go and sleep, he should study hard and gain a promotion. I don't know if the teachers will accept him snoozing, but at least he will have less pressure on him... And all he does is grinning at all this... Honestly...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir perception of Jaden were slowly getting warped as the lesson passed. They still considered him a great friend, but were beginning to get a bit annoyed at his laziness.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Down at his desk, Jaden was yawning. While he knew that what the teacher said was somewhat important, he would rather learn about the things he said by Dueling. While he didn't caught any attention at the moment, he was getting increasingly bored with the lesson, thus his napping time might come soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man... This sucks.\", he humbled to himself. Next to him, Winged Kuriboh appeared in spirit form, looking at him with curiosity. \"Oh hey pal. How are things going?\", he murmured to not draw any attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinged Kuriboh made a few noises which made Jaden understand that everything was all right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Good for you. I kind of want to chat with you and the others, but I am stuck here... By the way, did you feel that something was wrong with the guys? And I mean not just what they said, but also how they looked. It's not just me, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe winged creature looked a bit surprised as well, but with the noises it made, it also didn't know what to make out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you don't know either. Maybe they are trying to change their attitude a bit, but it is a bit much. Oh well, I guess I should ask them once this lesson is over.\", he said as Kuriboh nodded before disappearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with the others, the two were silently listening to the lesson as they scribbled whenever they found something interesting. But as time passed, Syrus began getting taller. For every 20 minutes that passes, he would go up another inch. The opposite happened to Hasselberry as he got a bit shorter, though nowhere near as much as Syrus grew. But in his case, his muscles were slowly fading away. It was barely noticeable at the start, but his biceps were gradually getting smaller as his legs also got the same treatment, his thighs getting a bit smaller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn their minds, their thoughts seemed to shift from taking Jaden's side to finding faults in his logic and trying to make him understand why he should study harder. Their reasons for going to the lesson also seemed to oscillate between going for Jaden's sake to actually trying to score some points for the teachers, as they seemed to hold in regard those that came for supplementary lessons. But there was something else that happening to Syrus's mind. Some of the memories of his past with Zane seemed to fade here and there as a few new ones, after he went to the academy, where he was admiring him appeared. This made him pinch the bridge of his nose as he tried to regain focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright Syris?\", asked Hasselberry as he looked at him a bit worried, not noticing the way he called him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I am fine Hasilberry. Just a little headache.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing grave, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, nothing too important. I may be getting a bit tired, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see. Sorry for interrupting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine. Don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two gave a small smile to each other as they went back to their thoughts. As class continued, their hair began changing. Syris's became a bit fuller as it started to become less frizzy while the roots of his hair began to turn brown. Hasilberry on the other hand, seemed to have his hair get bigger under his bandanna, as it seemed a bit poofier while his dreads were slowly starting unravel as the ends seemed to get wilder.</span></div></div>",

I also need to go. Should we wait for Jaden?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I am sure he's sleeping. Let's go just the two of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. And it's not like it is necessary for him to come either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyris nodded as the two began walking towards the restrooms. Their speech patterns seemed to change a bit as Syris seemed a bit more laid back while Hasilberry got a bit more sophisticated with his words. But that didn't seem to be noticed by them. As for the other students, with the exception of Jaden, the two didn't seem in terms of appearance any different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were compelled to head for the women's restroom for a second, but they quickly shook that thought off as they headed for the men's. Once inside the stalls, they had a feeling they should sit down, but just as before, they took their mind off this quite quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they did their business, more changes happened to their hands. Their nails grew longer and became polished as the rest of the hand became quite small in comparison to the rest of their arms. But that was quick to change. Syris's seemed to get a bit thinner, but also became a bit toned, while Hasilberry's did the opposite, as it started to lose more mass, the muscles compressing down. After finishing up, they pulled up their pants as they began to grow smaller, currently showing their ankles as the blue hue from before began to deepen for both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the two then got outside and began washing their hands. As they did, Hasilberry looked at himself in the mirror with a slight confusion on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say... Do you think we look a bit different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? How so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it might be just me, but I feel like our hair is... a bit off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon looking, the Syris also found out that something seemed different. His side points were now pointing lower as the back spikes, expect for the lower ones seemed to straighten. As for Hasilberry, his bandanna was having a bit of difficulty covering his hair as it seemed to poof out a bit more as his dreads were starting to break as the the ends continued getting spikier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right. It does look a bit weird... Do we have time to go back to our rooms and style it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think we can. The recess isn't long enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rats... I guess we have to go out like this then. It doesn't look too bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Besides, wetting our hair is a big no. We would have a nightmare of a mess by tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if it will be that bad. But you're right, it's not worth the risk. Let's just roll out for now. If it gets bad later we will see what we can do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHasilberry accepted the suggestion as the two left the bathroom. Normally, the two would never pay this much attention to their hair or looks, but they seemed more and more interested in their aspect as time seemed to pass.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On the way back, Syris took a glance at an Obelisk student who was talking with his friends. Nudging Hasilberry, he gestured towards the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't he look nice? If only we had half his charm, we would be able to get a girlfriend much faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you getting the whole girlfriend thing? And why now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't it bother you? How some nice-looking guys get fan clubs like Atticus while we don't get fans. Jaden might not be bothered by it, but I want to be in the center of attention for once. And besides, this really should boost your popularity enough to get a girlfriend as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right. Having a girlfriend sounds really good. I don't know why I haven't thought of it before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing in a relationship never crossed their minds thus far, and such it should feel weird for them. On top of that, given how much effort they put into Dueling, they really didn't had much time to even consider this. But now, the two seemed quite eager to try having girlfriends. Even Syris seemed to grow out out of his feelings for Dark Magician Girl as he began embracing the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, their footwear began to grow a heel in the back as they raised up by a couple of inches. Also, the tops folded themselves as the dark-blue began to be more dominant. Also, the white side of their collars began turning blue as well. Even though quite a few students passed by, no one seemed to see the clothes changing, thinking everything was normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyris then remembered the card from before as Hasilberry looked at him a bit confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I said it sounds impossible, but what if this card is real? We could ask for girlfriends...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHasilberry sighed as he shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you. Don't believe things like those so easily. That magician may have been really good at his job, but it's impossible he used real magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... You're right... A card that grants wishes does sound pretty crazy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are you going to do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know... I may take it to the shop at leave it there. As far as I know, this could be just a misprint or something like that, not necessary one of the magician's cards... But I don't know if we have any time left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can go next recess. It is a bit longer, and we could stop there for lunch as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so. I just wonder how did this card get next to the gates though...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe someone opened a pack and found it blank and threw it out in frustration. Or maybe it was from that batch of wrongly printed cards that were sent back a little while ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. I mean, the management was pretty shaky last year with all that happened. Maybe Crowler supplied cards from a different source... But man I really wanted to have a girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two once again let their minds wander over having a partner, their calves began reshaping themselves. Syris's became more slender and sleeker as they grew a bit while Hasilberry's seemed to do the reverse, losing a bit more muscle on them, as they became smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut while they were thinking, the image of the guy from before seemed to change slightly as they went from jealous to slightly admiring his looks. The two were getting a bit confused over this, and they tried to recover their thoughts as a small tingling feeling was developing in their necks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two returned to the amphitheater, with Syris still holding onto the card, and upon looking down, they saw that somehow Jaden was still asleep.</span></div></div>",

There's no wonder why Crowler even calls him \"Slifer slacker\". You would think that after two years, he would at the very least not fall asleep so often... I wonder why Alexis wants to hang out with him so much. I mean, other than his Dueling skills, there's rally no reason to.\", replied Hasilberry in a higher pitched voice as well. \"I can't say he isn't talented, but he seems so irresponsible and childish at times...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Sometimes even I ask myself how we have this much patience with him... I wish he would be like Alexis. That way he would be a lot more responsible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the wish was made, the card glowed a little, with Syris thinking he saw a light come from the card, but decided to brush it off. He and Hasilberry then went to their seats, but surprisingly enough, the seats they took were a bit higher than before, right at the border between the place the Ra and Obelisk students would stay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they sat down, Hasilberry's skull pendant vanished while Syris's sleeves continued shrinking away, currently resting just below his elbows. Also, the yellow on their jackets began to fade a little as their collars continued getting blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you going to put that card away?\", asked Hasilberry as he saw Syris put the card on the desk..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. I don't want to forget later to take it to the shop. I know I am not bad at remembering things, but I want to have an insurance any way... It sucks this thing isn't magic though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, okay? It's not like we need any magic anyways. Especially after all the trouble we went last year, with the whole Obelisk White magic brainwash thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right. We had enough of that...\", smiled Syris as the two waited for the teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes ago, Jaden was still dozing off, dreaming about another fantastic Duel, with him using Neos to win the battle. But just as Neos landed the finishing blow, a small shiver down his spine woke him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, and it was getting to the good part too... Did someone let a window open or something? I'm sure it wasn't supposed to be cold today...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon looking around and seeing the other students returning, he could only frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, did I sleep so much? I know I stood up late to watch that Pro Dueling Tournament with Chazz last night, but I never thought I was that sleepy. Guess I should stop watching international tournaments late in the night... But it's fine. The teacher didn't say a thing as he didn't try to wake me up, I'm sure of it. It just sucks that I didn't had a chance to talk with Syrus and Hasselberry about that weird talk from before... Oh well, there's time next recess anyway. And man, I sure need some before Crowler's boring class...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo distracted with his thoughts, Jaden ignored a slight tingling feeling centered on his feet, as they seemed to get a bit smaller and gained a pedicure as well. Meanwhile, his shoes began to turn completely blue, the red and black being gradually replaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he looked up to see his friends, Jaden was surprised to see someone else in the seats they once stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Did they ask to change seats? Are they even allowed to do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could scan the room however, the teacher entered the classroom. Jaden didn't mind snoozing in class, but he didn't want to draw attention to himself to not get in trouble, thus deciding to settle for meeting them later.</span></div></div>",

Jaden groaned a bit realizing that it was a teacher that talked quite slowly, thus making the lesson even more boring. He was willing to stay awake until the roll call, but not any more than that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the other students were whispering between then until their name was called. Neither Syris or Hasilberry questioned themselves why they sat in different seats than the ones from before, or why they now went to the higher ones. Despite Syris's promotion into Obelisk Blue happening shortly, he should still be staying in the Ra section of the class. But now, both of them believed that they deserved to stay higher, given that now, their grades were actually higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReality began to slowly warp as their big accomplishments were beginning to vanish from their profiles, but they seemed a lot more consistent in terms of grades as the results of some of their past tests went up by a few points. They weren't exactly getting smarter, but they seemed a lot more competent when it came down to lectures and examinations, more so in Hasilberry's case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile waiting to be called out, the two noticed a few Obelisk students who were talking a bit louder. They appeared to be talking about asking Crowler and Miss Fontaine to hold out a small tournament for the new Obelisk students that were to become first years. This made the two giggle a bit in their slightly higher voices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so nice to have such thoughtful students in the blue dorm, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it is. I personally don't mind pairing up with one of those guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither. It definitely would show the new guys how skilled we are... and we would hang out with a group of cool guys too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two were giggling, their faces began taking a much rounder shape, as their chins, especially Hasilberry's became a lot less pronounced. Also their calves started to shift as well as the muscles were starting to get redistributed better as the excess fat began to slowly move up to their thighs. Hassilberry also lot a bit more muscle, so that he wouldn't have issues keeping his center of gravity. Lastly, their pants gradually went up again, now being right below their knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, after his responding to his name being called, Jaden was already starting to get sleepy again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So boring... Maybe a quick nap before the lesson starts might not be a bad idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began assuming the \"thinker\" pose as he started to doze off again. But as he tried to, he began to feel a small itch on his scalp as his hair began getting longer. Initially it wasn't so bad, but having to constantly brush off the few bangs that were getting in his face, made him open his eyes in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, why does this happen? Is my hair that long? I know I didn't cut it recently, but come on....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Syrin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Present!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haelbery!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Present!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jaden was trying to understand the situation, his shoes continued changing as they became fully blue as the straps were replaced with a side zipper as the tips got pointier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did the teacher screw up their names? Why would he call Syris and Hasilberry like that... Huh? Wait... Am I getting their names wrong as well? I could swear it was something different... Man, I must be more tired than I thought... Maybe a fifteen minute nap might be in order for me.\", thought Jaden as he put his head in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially, Jaden wasn't affected by what was changing Syrin and Haelbery, but with the new wish made, reality was now warping around him and his mind as well.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the roll call, the teacher began the lesson. He started to explain various methods of using Winged-Beast monsters in various conjunctions with other Types. He explained the necessity of using a deck based on covering the weaknesses and to boost their attack power, as unlike single type decks, unless it was an archetype, it would much more difficult to maintain a good approach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyrin and Haelbery were listening to the lesson, and while not taking as many notes as before, they seemed to remain mostly focused on paying attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This stuff is pretty useful, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure is. The whole archetype thing would screw people over big time. If you want to use a Winged-Beast Deck, then just use a Harpy build. Mai Valentine used that kind of Deck and it was many times successful in winning. It's graceful, it combines strength and strategy and is quite easy to use too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. But I never thought you would be so into a Harpy Deck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyris was indeed a bit confused too. He never was that much into anything beside Machine Type monsters, but that would soon change, as the two were a bit dazed by a few more mental changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn this time, Syrin's blazer and top were now reaching the middle of his biceps as the blazer's color was starting to change from red to black. As for Haelbery's tank top it also began darkening as the material was starting to get thicker. As for the footwear, after a few more minor changes, became two perfect replicas of the one the Obelisk girls had, with their 3-inch heels giving them a bit of ascension.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the daze was gone, the two shook their heads a little as new thoughts went through their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course I am. It is a favorite build for me. I am in fact surprised that you said that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I mean... You also use different types of Decks as well. I thought it was just a favorite of many.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way. Harpies is a type I always liked. And if Mai got so good with it, I am sure I will too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am glad to see your enthusiasm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the two giggled a little, they returned to paying attention to the lesson. As time passed, their hair became silky smooth and a bit wavier as the color of Haelbery's bandanna was starting to fade to a dark-red, beginning to lose most details as the \"teeth\" vanished as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jaden was starting to have a little trouble sleeping. It wasn't as much the teacher's voice that disturbed him, but actually his calves, which started to vibrate. Muscles were being remade, getting more shapely in the process as his feet finished becoming petite and dainty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, my legs feel a bit numb... I know I didn't exercise too much lately, but it shouldn't be that bad. And the fact that the teach keeps talking so loudly isn't helping either... This lesson is boring as heck and it doesn't help me in the slightest. Other than Hummingbird, there isn't any other Winged-Beast monster in my Deck so why should I even bother? And besides, I need to fake myself being awake next class, as I don't want Crowler to make a speech about being a slacker again... I have to try and get some rest for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was genuinely not enjoying the situation he was in. He could pass for the weird feeling in his legs if he would try and ignore the teacher completely. He didn't had his earmuffs, but he still considered it plausible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, his shoes got a lot tighter, becoming of a material more similar to leather, and thus conforming better on his feet, as they began to lose all of its accents as a tiny heel was forming beneath them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden was about to go with his plan when...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still... Who knows, this might be useful.... I didn't meet someone who runs only Winged-Beasts in their Decks, but it could prove useful for a future Duel... Although it would just as better to learn from an actual battle rather than like this... But it's not like I can nap like this either...\"</span></div></div>",

They remained strong however, as it wouldn't pose much trouble if any. Especially if he were to run again, given the many times he had to get to class on time... But slowly his memories were changing as well as in some of the times he got late to class, he now remembered actually being on time... And besides his physical changes, his pants also got a lot tighter on him, hugging his legs better as the light shade began to darken a bit, a slight bluish hue beginning to appear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith how his legs, and now his pants, were distracting him, Jaden let out a small groan as he straightened his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it... Might as well pay attention to the lesson now. I don't know why my legs feel numb, but I can't get any rest like this. Maybe listening will put me back to sleep again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lazily repositioned himself on his chair as he began listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher continued talking about the various combos that could be utilized. After talking about Alector, Simorgh and Raiza, as well as mentioning a few more new Monster Cards that were in the making, and were to appear in future Card Packs, he then moved on to talk about Harpies. After a brief history, he began talking about their utility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe mentioned that while their attack power was fairly low individually, they become quite powerful once multiple Monsters appear on the field as they all have the ability to have the same name, Harpy Lady while they were on the field. He then began talking about various way to summon them quicker or to use different ways to increase their attack. He also briefed them on a few details regarding new Cards that Industrial Illusions were going to make specific to the archetype.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are going to release support for the Harpies?!\", exclaimed Syrin slightly. \"I know Pegasus has some random times to release supports for different Decks, but if this is true, I am so going to wipe the floor with the guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... never thought I'd see you this excited...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? Is Jaden allowed to be the only one that can get excited over Dueling others? I can get into the groove as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two were talking, their tops continued getting whiter, as the white line what was on them, began to also fade towards dark-blue, like the collars. Also, their thighs thickened, being one step closer towards completion. But for Haelbery, his hard-earned muscles were now really starting to fade out on his legs. They still had a somewhat muscular and toned look, but they will not do that for much longer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You just say that because you want to impress boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how is that a bad thing? Getting attention is our goal after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right. Besides, what I learned from last lesson will also help me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two laughed a little before continuing listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jaden found himself quite interested in the subject. He still found it quite boring, but he admitted that some of the things were actually not too bad to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... I never knew that Alector could that that much of a pain. I don't know when I will fight a Simorgh, but it is nice to know a way or two about how to counter it I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he listened further, his hands began tingling. He initially thought they will get numb like the legs, but this time, it wasn't nowhere near as bad. They began to slim down, as his fingers became longer as the overall aspect became something more dainty and feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the lesson got to the Harpies Deck, and upon learning a bit about them, he left out a small chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Who knew Harpies could be strong like that... Wasn't Jasmine also saying she would use a Harpy Deck? Well, I am sure she- Wait... How do I know that? She said she would keep it a secret and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted when the teacher drew attention by asking someone a question.</span></div></div>",

Jades, can you please answer the question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJades was quite confused by how the teacher addressed him, thinking he was talking to someone else until he saw his gaze directed at him. But he didn't have the luxury to think about that at the moment... Usually, whenever he was asked something that he didn't know, which happened most of the times, he would laugh nervously and apologize, as it would make the teacher go to someone else. But this time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap! What do I do? Umm... I can't just laugh it off can I...? Think Jades!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't notice that the way he addressed himself in his head was also different, as currently he was thinking of an answer. As he did, he didn't notice his hair changing further. It once again grew, now covering his neck as the spiky and wild appearance began to tone down a bit as it became softer. Also, he light brown color from the upper part of his hair also began to envelop parts from his lower part. After a few more seconds of panicking and preparing to call it quits, new information popped up in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... First you use Inferno Reckless Summon to call another two Harpy Lady 1 for a total of 900 attack points. The Monster that benefits the most is Hunter Owl... because beside the boost from the 3 Harpy Lady 1, he also gains 500 attack points for every other Winged-Beast, so that would leave him... at 3900 ATK. And the best way to inflict damage is with...Double Attack since Hunter Owl is a level 4, it is easy to find a level 5 or higher Monster to discard for him to attack twice...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite impressive Jades. I am happy you studied for this one. Then again, given your most performances, it shouldn't be that surprising.\", said the teacher with a smile before resuming his lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough he got himself out of hot water, Jades was a bit confused not just by what the teacher said, but also by how he got that answer right. While processing everything, the sleeves of his top and jacket began to recede, beginning so show a bit of his forearms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just... How did I manage to get that right? I mean... I saw some guys play in a similar way with Hunter Owl, but how did I get that so fast? And what did he meant by my \"performances\"? Did he meant the tournament? But... Chazz is technically the one who won the whole thing. And Chancellor Shepard congratulated me more for beating Sartorius more than the whole thing with the tournament... And was it just me, or did he say my name wrong...? Something weird is going on here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp in the classroom, Syrin and Haelbery were also a bit impressed with their friend's performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... Guess he can learn a few things. I still would've gotten that right too though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Symrin. Can't you praise him a little more? He did study after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right Haelery. But I am just saying, if he is good at Dueling, he should be good at studying too. I don't know why sometimes he just slacks off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. It is quite a paradox, isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir opinion of Jades was slowly improving. While he thought at the start he was their best friend, than a friend that was too lazy, now he was a friend they began to respect. And this would continue as reality changed further...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, their boxers began to follow in the steps of the pants, as they got a lot tighter on them. Also, alongside their superb legs, their hips also started to push out a little, putting a little strain for their pants and underwear.</span></div></div>",

And this time, there no longer was an angry glare directed at Jades for sleeping or not paying attention. Since the recess was bigger, most students were starting to leave the classroom to either eat or chat outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally, I can go and talk to the guys.\", said Jades so himself as he began walking upwards. He passed the place where Symrin and Haelery were sitting before, not necessary because he saw two different students, but because he was beginning to think they never sat there today. \"Hey...\", was all he could say when he ran up to his friends, really confused about their looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi Jades.\", said Haelery smiling a little. \"Sorry for leaving you last recess alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's nothing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, great job on answering that question right. If I was asked, I may have known another method for the third part, but congrats to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thanks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJades was holding himself from not asking out-loud what he saw. Aside from their more polite and really different way of talking, with Symrin sounding more confident and a bit laid-back, and Haelery seeming less louder but almost and expressive but still a bit talkative, their appearances really seemed different than how he remembered the two. Symrin was a lot taller, giving him a lanky appearance if it wasn't for his thighs and hips which were still growing slowly, while Haelery looked like he lost quite a lot of muscle. Yet to both of them, it seemed normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile gathering his thoughts, he missed seeing Symrin's skin tone tanned a little more, but it wasn't nowhere as significant as the way Haelery's skin got lighter by a few shades, still giving him a tanned look, but not the way it was before. Also, Jades' skin lost any body hair it originally had, becoming smooth and a bit shiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay Jades? You seem to be in deep thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh? Oh... No, ... It's nothing important. Don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so... By the way, we are going to the Card Shop right now. Do you want to join us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure... I don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect. We may as well have lunch too. Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus, the three left the classroom, heading towards the shop. Jades was a bit curious about the blank card Symrin was holding onto, but got a bit concerned by how his friends walked, shaking their hips a little with every step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something is wrong. It has to be. I mean, how can they not see how weird they look? Even their clothes seem off... And why is Symrin so casual all of a sudden? I mean, it's not bad that he is a bit more confident in himself but still... Wait... Wasn't his name Syrin? Or is it Symrin? Why am I getting confused over this all of a sudden...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile gathering his thoughts, Symrin and Haelery's collars became fully dark-blue while Jades' began darkening towards the same color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I was tired but still... It's not like there is any more room to sleep anyways. Hey Kuriboh, do you think something is off?\" He waited a few moments for his spirit friend to emerge but he was confused as to why he didn't. \"Huh? Kuriboh? Neos? Aquos? Anybody?\" Still nothing. \"Why isn't anyone answering? Did something happen?\", asked Jades to himself, getting a bit worried.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The three soon got to the card shop, seeing other students already there, looking at different card packs or at the food on display. But Jades was quite worried about his sudden inability to talk to the spirits, so just before they went to the counter, he excused himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, can I look around a bit? I... kind of want to look around a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. We'll just talk a bit at the counter. It won't take long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJades nodded to them and then hid behind other students, at some distance from them, trying to wrap his head around the current situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Symrin and Haelery went towards the front counter, seeing Sadie talking with a customer. The two politely waited for their turn, as they engaged in a little chat. As they did, they didn't notice that their hair changed once more, with Symrin's brown roots spread further, a quarter now being brown as Haelery's seemed to lighten a little, gradually going from back to s dark-gray color. But what was more important for him was that his dreads finally snapped, making his back hair tickle his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon noticing, Haelery left out a small groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... My hair is getting a bit on my nerves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't leave it free like that. I mean, it is a bit hard to control it if you don't use enough conditioner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't to use a full can of hair-spray for hair hair though... Wait, I have an idea....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then took off the bandanna, which was now almost a complete dark-red except for a few design lines, revealing his fluffier hair, as he used it to tie his hair into a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Much better. I don't know why I left it the way it was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you just wanted to try out a new style... Or maybe you just forgot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I don't know why I even decided to wear a bandanna. It's so not my style.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple more minutes, the client walked off. The two then walked up to Sadie, as she welcomed the two with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Sadie!\", saluted back Symrin as Haelery also greeted him. \"Are you alone right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Ms Dorothy said she needed some time to restock a bit in the back. A new semester is coming, and she wants to make sure the new packs are ready... How can I help you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's this.\", said Symrin as he gave Sadie the blank card. \"I found this at the front gates this morning. I was wondering if someone lost it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Let me check in the data base.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was looking at her computer, the boys felt a little tingling in their necks, similar to the one from before. The two noticed that it wasn't as bad as before, gently rubbing their necks a little as they waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, their memories and personalities were changing further. Haelery was now really starting to forget about his training regime as as well as his preference for Dinosaur Type Monsters. Instead, he grew a fondness for more girly things like shopping and gossiping, as working hard for muscles no longer seemed an attractive idea for him. Which wasn't something he didn't welcome, as his new personality was slowly erasing his more \"army behavior\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething similar was happening to Symrin. While he wasn't getting as girly-like in terms of personality, as he seemed a bit more laid-back, he still started to enjoy the same things Haelery did. But what was more important in his case was the fact that his memories with Zane were starting to fade out quite a bit, the only ones that remained mostly clear being the ones after he joined the academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\", started Sadie. \"I've checked the database, and so far, no one reported any missing blank cards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it belongs to that magician.\", said Symrin in a higher voice than before, his tone starting to get similar to someone else's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He thinks it may belong to the magician that came here a while ago. Blank cards were used for his magic tricks.\", continued Haelery in a higher voice too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's possible... But we never got told anything about that. We will check into it... But it is more likely it is one of the faulty cards we found in our stock. Ms Dorothy says we should send them back as they don't have much value... But thanks for bringing it to me anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem... Say, is the Golden Egg Sandwich still not taken for today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup. Who knows, maybe you guys might have your lucky day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giggled as the said \"Maybe.\" in unison before leaving to pick up Jades.</span></div></div>",

However, he getting increasingly confused and worried when no one replied back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why isn't anyone answering?... Did what happen when I lost to Aster is happening again? But... it shouldn't. I mean, the Light of Destruction is gone, and there wasn't any indication that something like that happened again... Is there some other phenomenon that is at works here...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile thinking really hard about the cause, his hands became dainty and delicate as his fingernails grew in length a little as well. The changes then progresses further up his arms as they began to slim down, with some muscles distributing their mass between each other. As for his clothes, now almost all of his forearms were now uncovered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, he would freak out at this, but currently, he was preoccupied with something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Was it just me or did I use some spiffy words back there?... Am I getting smarter? Nah, that's impossible. I mean, it's absurd to think that I somehow learned big words all of a sudden... But back on topic. Why isn't anyone responding? Even Kuriboh, who I could hear and see ever since the start of the first year doesn't answer... What is the cause here?... There was no warning from Neos or anyone else. Sartorius said there shouldn't be any traces of that power from before. And I don't recall any weird Duels either.... Is this somehow related to how Symrin and Haelery are acting? They started talking like some of those guys from Obelisk did back in the first year. They weren't exactly snobby as they were, but still... Back when I was exploring their dorm, some were quite boastful and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJades suddenly stopped, confused at his own thoughts. He was so distracted by them, that he didn't notice that his tighter pants were slowly rising upwards, showing his ankles now as his footwear gained a pointed tip and the heel grew out a bit more as they finished becoming a pair of heeled blue boots that were identical to the ones his friends were wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't so important right now, as his memories were also changing. The names he called his friends aside, he was starting to remember times when he spent more time at the Obelisk dorm. But it didn't seem like he was there to ask a Duel or anything, but simply walking around, talking with the other students. He didn't meet many students from Obelisk outside the tournament or the official Duels he had, thus he didn't had much time to interact with them. But his newly developing memories were starting to contradict that. But what was weirder was that in some of those memories, he was actually talking with girls. Usually, the females from the blue dorm wouldn't think much of him, still considering him a slacker like Crowler does. But in the few memories he had of them, they seemed to actually respect him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJades was ready to start a debate in his mind over his thoughts, but when he noticed that quite a number of students have began gathering, he paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn... Lots of people are now here. It would be weird if I just sit here, in my own world, while blankly looking at the shelves. And Symrin and Haelery are going to get back soon. As much as I would want to wrap my head over what in the world is going on with my head, I have to wait. Maybe I could excuse myself and go somewhere to think. Or I could just ask them what is going on here. They surely had to notice something was off... Although I don't think they did, given how they were acting earlier... But it's not like I can just leave either...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then noticed his friends getting back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess asking them wouldn't hurt...\"</span></div></div>",

We left Sadie a weird blank card I found this morning. She says it might be from a batch of misprinted cards that they were planning to return. None of us knew where it came from since I found it near the gates, but I guess now it's their job to figure that out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blank card?\", asked Jades to himself. \"... Could it be...\", but before he could ponder anymore, Haelery interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we are thinking we should have lunch now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lunch?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\", said Symrin. \"We could eat after Crowler's class ends, but I think eating now is a better idea. And we can try the Golden Egg Challenge as well, as it wasn't won today yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... guess we could try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what are we waiting for? Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three then headed towards the sandwich box. As they waited for some students to make some way for them to advance, as they too tried winning the challenge, more changes happened. Symrin's sleeves completely vanished, as he now had a sleeveless version of his uniform. It resembled the one Haelery had, except it looked like it was tailored to be sleeveless. Haelery's soon modified itself a bit as well as it became just the Symrin's. Also, his once dark-green undershirt which already started to blacken, conformed better on him as it began covering more of his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Jades, his pants continued getting smaller as it reached the middle of his slender calves while it got once again tighter and the bluish hue was starting to get more visible. He found it mildly uncomfortable, but being distracted by his thoughts and the crowd in front of him, he let it pass for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple more minutes of waiting for the crowd to not monopolize the sandwiches, a few students began to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was about time. I know most of the sandwiches here are good, but they shouldn't be this frantic about them, huh Hanery?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Even the Obelisk guys sometimes seem to forget about manners Samrin. What do you think Jadeis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh...? Uh... yeah, sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJadeis was getting quite confused by all that was happening. He brushed off the weird voices his friends seem to have as he thought he was hearing them wrong... or he maybe got too distracted with his worries that he forgot how they sounded for a second... But the whole name change was too weird for him. He was confused by the way they addressed each other, as they didn't sounded like they once did anymore... without finding odd how he himself was called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...\", started Jadeis, trying to get his mind out of his problems, without looking nervous in front of his friends. \"What kind of sandwiches are you guys hoping for? Except the Golden Egg of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I don't mind the one with chicken or the steak ones. They are quite hardy and have nutrients... But I guess I could also roll for a vegetarian one as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, me too.\", said Hanery. \"As long as it is healthy, I am fine with it. The hamburger one, as tasty as it sounds, I may pass it on to someone else. I am on a diet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas again Jadeis was confused. He never thought he would hear either of his friends talk about healthy food, as was shocked when he heard that Hanery, who loved eating meat was going to skip on one... But the more he thought about it, the more natural it seemed to him why they would choose something healthy. His own preferences were starting to change. While he would love almost all things that could be inside, a desire of something more nutritious or even something more sweet began to fill his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, Jadeis' hair almost  became one color, the darker brown covered most of the lighter one, as it's original, slightly messy appearance was disappearing, becoming a lot more neater. He also began to feel his throat a little sore, but he ignored the feeling as it wasn't necessary too uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen their turn came, Jadeis prayed he would get the Golden Egg sandwich. He really needed something to distract him from this weird day.</span></div></div>",

While he doesn't usually mind them, he really wasn't in the mood for them right now... But his tastes were also gradually changing. He was now silently craving for something sweet as well, but the Golden Egg was the best option anyways, so he tried taking hat one. After a little bit of choosing, he picked one that was in the middle of the center pile, while Hanery and Samrin picked the ones next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe unwrapped it and once he looked inside...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! You actually got it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe... Thanks. But it was luck honestly.\", replied Jadeis sheepishly in a slightly higher voice, his vocal chords starting to tighten. \"What did you guys get?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking at their sandwiches, both of them smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! I got jam!\", exclaimed Samrin. \"I heard Ms Dorothy picked a sugar-free one this week for the filling, so I am excited to try it out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got mixed vegetables.\", said Hanery. \" I was really up for something like this. I know I will like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJadeis was once again confused by Hanery's tastes. He could understand Samrin liking something sweeter, but regardless, the fact that they didn't any any meat and do not seem bothered at all really stood odd to him. Right now however, he just wanted to dig in, trying to forget all these weird happenings that were going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he took a bite, and was immediately charmed by the taste. The flavor, texture and creaminess of the yoke were really doing a great job to distract him from his troubles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That chicken really hit the mark this time as well. It's as good as always... I just hope I won't put on much weight from eating all these egg sandwiches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as that thought occurred, his thighs expanded a little, as along with the mass that came from his calves, they also filled up a little on their own, getting a little bit of fat over his changing muscles. Also, his pants grew higher once again on his legs, as they were now just below his knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why would I think about getting fat? I am fit and I do exercise. And why would I even care about that? It's not like people look at me expecting to look nice or anything... Whatever, just focus on eating Jadeis. The weird thoughts come later.\", he murmured to himself as he continued indulging himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis friends were also enjoying their meals. Despite the fact that they were quite into their picks, when usually they would just be okay with them. But now, they were liking the fillings quite a lot, a sign, that like Jadeis, their preferences were changing. And just like him, they began getting thoughts of maintaining themselves fit and athletic, but this time, they weren't brushing them, and were actually embracing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they ate, their figures continued changing. Other than their waists compressing a little, their build was also altering. Samrin was once again getting taller, this time stopping with just half a head below Jadeis, giving him a slim physique for the moment, while Hanery didn't get any smaller, but his skin tone lightened up once more. His tanned appearance was now starting to look like a distant memory as his skin was not just a two or three shades darker than his friends. Also, his muscles were really fading out as well, more so his pectoral area, which became quite small, his build beginning to look like Samrin's. The only regions which still had some developed muscles were his abdomen, legs and arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing up their meals, Jadeis was about to start talking when he noticed the changed look his friends had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that was good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I am full now. What about you Jadeis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Yeah. Me too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's head back now. We could chat some more on our way back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three were leaving, Jadeis was really weirded out right now. But there was something else that was bothering him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They... look different. I know it. But... why exactly can't I say what's wrong?... They look wrong... right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were starting to get muddled, as his original memories were starting to contradict with his current ones. But he kept quiet for the moment. He really wanted to just figure it all out right now. But he knew that if he started asking all the questions on his mind, he would be the one that would seem crazy.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There were many things that didn't make sense to Jadeis at the moment. Not only that his friends were looking different and even their voices were sounding higher than he could remember, but their mannerisms were different, the usually meek Samrin getting bolder, while Hanery becoming more polite as the two seemed to be taken by an aura which made them unaware what was really going on. As for himself, Jadeis was no longer able to communicate with the spirits anymore... And yet, he somehow managed to remain calm and not question aloud all the weird things that were going on. But it was more than just him not freaking out, becoming more composed as the changes progressed, but certain things were starting to make sense to him and thus, he didn't freak out as much as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so distracted by his thoughts that he didn't notice his friends shaking their hips as they walked, or that he was slowly starting to walk the same like them. With the need to use the restroom, he found an opportunity to also figure things out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we stop and go to the bathroom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. There is some time left. We will wait for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they reached the bathrooms, Samrin and Hanery were seemingly going to the women's, before they shook their heads and followed Jadeis to the men's bathroom, something which he noticed. Once inside, he went for a stall as the others waited for him at the sink. Once inside, he found a strange urge to sit down, but he simply complied to it, not feeling in the mood for any other distractions. While doing his business, he recalled all the weird things that happened so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so what in the world is going on? First they tell me to be more attentive during class, then they leave without me last break, and now they want to eat vegetables? I know people say that time changes you, but this is ridiculous... And what about their look? I know they don't look normal... but why can't I discern what exactly is off about them?... Is this supposed to be a prank or something? Oh, I hope not. Atticus alone is enough to make me lose my patience, I don't need someone else messing with me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring his thought process, his thighs thickened further, as they began to create some discomfort for his manhood. He repositioned himself on the seat, ignoring a cushy sensation that was now being felt. Unknown to him, his butt also began to fill out, but there was still a way to go until its final size. But all these things didn't matter too much as Jadeis realized something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? How did Atticus pop up in there? First I can't call Kuriboh and now this? And what about Atticus? His jokes are pretty funny, and he's an awesome guy. Sure, he can get a little carried away with some of his ideas at times, but not all of them are so bad... I don't know why sometimes Alexis doesn't cut him some slack and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small headache prompted him to stop his train of thought as he rubbed his temples with his smaller fingers. As he did, his sleeves receded further, now being halfway to his upper arms as the red on the blazer began fading out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although... It doesn't respect people's privacy and choices when he thinks about stuff like becoming a singer and all that... As fun as it is to be around him, it sure can be irritating at times too...\", grumbled Jadeis under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he finished, he was upset that he didn't figure anything out, but decided to observe things further for a while longer before he could inquire about what's been going on. He pulled up his boxers and pants, which were now tighter on him, before leaving to meet up with his friends.</span></div></div>",

I know he loves Dueling, but it is getting a bit out of hand. He knows that today was a day he had to come, so then why...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that's a question to ask him once the day is over. Next we have Crawler's lesson, and despite his position, he is a bit with his heads in the clouds lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's because he went back from being the principal to being a teacher. Or maybe he needs some time to get in the stride again after the tournament.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably... But still, his lessons are usually not that exciting. I know he promised this one would be good, but I am a bit on the fence with this one... Still I am sure Jadeis will handle it nicely. He did answer that question perfectly earlier after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I am sure he'll manage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir perception of Jadeis was gradually changing, as although they weren't getting as close as they originally were, they still were seemingly getting a higher level of respect towards him than when the first class started. This was partially because in their minds, Jadeis was quite smarter now. While there were some inconsistencies with how he still sleeps and even runs late at times, in their mind, he was becoming a smart and studious student of the academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Samrin took a quick glance at the mirror, Hanery did the same as both had a slightly curious look on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, before you said that we looked weird right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I feel like we look better than before, but still something seems off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir facial appearances were something that worried the two before, even if their hair was a bigger priority for them at the beginning. While they didn't seem to mind the hair as much as before, their faces seemed off to them. Without even noticing, their eyes got a bit bigger, giving them a slightly more innocent look as their eyelashes grew a bit longer, though they weren't done changing. As for their hair, Samrin's was now almost fifty percent brown as his hair grew a bit longer, all of the spikes he had before now facing downwards. As for Hanery, his mane didn't get longer except for his ponytail, which grew a bit, adding a bit more volume to its wildly look, while his puffy hairdo didn't change much, except for a few bangs in the front which got a bit spiky. Also, Samrin's glasses suddenly vanished, blinking a few times as his eyesight was restored, while Hanery's former bandanna became a regular red hair-tie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do look a bit different. But maybe it's just us...\", said Samrin. \"We thought something was off before, but now that I look again, I don't see anything wrong with my hair. I mean, it is a bit short, but still...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. I guess it was because I forgot to tie my hair...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two still had a few unanswered questions, but when they heard Jadeis getting out, they welcomed him back. He looked dazed for them for a second, as he slowly went to wash his hands. They exchanged a quick look of worry, before Jadeis dried his hand with a paper towel and then leaving together with him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jadeis wanted to ask a hundred things. Not only did the weird thoughts about Atticus persisted, as besides the image of friendship, an idea that he was acting goofy and silly was slowly forming in his head, but the look of their friends really threw him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?!\", he asked himself. \"What happened to Samrin's glasses? And their hair... I know for sure Hanery wouldn't style his hair like that... But... why does a part of me think it is normal...? Is it tied somehow to my thoughts about Atticus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile thinking, his hair became a full dark-brown, the original light-brown being completely overtaken. On top of that, the color began to lighten slightly, a few strands turning a really dark blond color. as a bang in the front of his head started to get a bit longer than the rest of his hair. Also, Samrin's and Hanery's hips continued growing wider as well, straining their pants even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it. I have to ask them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before Jadeis could have the chance to ask, his friends turned towards him with a slightly concerned expression, as Samrin asked him:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Adeis... Me and Hinedy were wondering if you are feeling okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... We saw you pretty out of it during the first class. Samin said you maybe were just tired, but... is there anything else that happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdeis was not as confused about the new name he was addressed, but by rather the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are ones acting weird, and they call me for that?\", mumbled Adeis under his breath before replying back. \"What makes you think something like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we saw you sleeping during first class. I know you are usually someone who doesn't do that except when the lesson is indeed boring, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might be just us, but it's not inspired to sit in a place where the teacher sees you sleeping. But, why exactly were you snoozing off? The lesson itself wasn't so bad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was getting ridiculous for Adeis. He swallowed the way how the two chewed him on this morning, but getting told that sleeping during class wasn't his thing was plain stupid. And he knew he couldn't sit in a place where he couldn't be seen as he had to sit in the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up with them? They are not making any sense. Why are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were obscured by a quick wave of vertigo that came as fast as the headache in the bathroom. His thoughts were getting a bit muddled in this time, as certain aspects were now changing in his head. Firstly, he began to stop considering himself a Slifer, as thoughts of being in another dorm were forming in his head. His memories of himself always dozing off in class were gradually replaced of ones where he paid attention, answered the teacher's questions and taking notes. He didn't knew where these memories were coming, but was having a hard time telling himself these were not true. Lastly, a few more memories about Atticus, spending time with him before attending the academy were now being created in his mind as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, aside from his lightening blazer, the white line at the chest level, as well as the collar began turning blue, as the pants his friends were shrank once again, this time until they were at the level of their thighs, getting ever tighter on them as their color almost became fully blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong...?\", asked Samin a bit worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm fine. I... stood late last night to watch a tournament, that's all. I may be just a bit tired, but that's all, I can assure you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, if you say so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should be a lesson for you. Stop staying late in the night. Even if it is a great Duel on TV, you need to relax. Especially if there is going to be classes the next day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... Noted...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, now don't be mad at us. We were just worried.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not mad. Thanks guys...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two smiled at him as Adeis also gave a weak smile. His mind was in chaos right now, but he didn't gave up on figuring out what was going on. As soon as the vertigo stopped, he thought that the fact that he was recalling events with Atticus before entering the academy, might be a good starting point as to what may be going on. Fortunately, he had plenty of time to think. As long as he will not fall asleep and Crowler won't yell at him, he had enough time to sort his thoughts out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The three soon got back to the classroom, the other students also returning back. Adeis waved to Samin and Hinedy as he went for his seat, not noticing that the two once again went to a different row, this time right in the middle of the Obelisk students. While going down, Adeis felt like his seat wasn't that down, and instead he was supposed to be higher. He shook his head, before going to the place his mind told him to: among the Ra students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon afterward, Crowler entered the class, his voice being loudly heard through the microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem! Soon we will enter a new year. And for some of you, this will be your last year at the academy. Nonetheless, we will continue to give all the knowledge that we have been invested with to pass on to you, so that you will become great Duelists one day. For those that are here right now, allow me to unofficially welcome to the new semester!\", said Crowler, the class slightly impressed by his small hint of consideration. \"Anyway, this class is held for those whose studies were interrupted by the incident with the Society of Light, as well as those who either didn't had good grades or performances this year. For the former, I am happy to tell you that a shortened version of the curriculum will be handed down to you about the studies you missed, but you will not be asked to take a test about the subjects. As for the remaining ones... well I suggest you start studying and not always sit on your bums, looking at others Duel, otherwise you will all end as a bunch of slackers.\"... And soon all the students sweat-dropped at the comment. \"Now let's begin today lesson, shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdeis wasn't too impressed by the whole speech, but has the feeling that Crowler is a bit more mellow than last year, although this could be just his imagination. He then decided to try and think things through once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... So why do they believe I am the weird one? Can't they see how weird they are? I mean... Sure I might be a bit sleepy after last night, but I needed to rest a bit... Although I guess it was kind of rude... I hope I didn't make the teacher too mad with that... Whatever, I still need to figure out what's the deal with Atticus and him appearing in my memories. I swear I haven't met him before the academy... Did I? Why is it so hard to remember? This can't be just from my tiredness... Hold on. Am I forgetting something? I fell like there was something else that was off... Ugh, I can't concentrate with Crowler talking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdeis began having trouble focusing, as Crowler's booming voice was heard. While trying to focus, his hips began expanding, gradually stretching outwards along with his pelvis as a soft layer of fat was forming over them. Also, his thighs finished growing as they even became a bit bigger than the ones his friends had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrowler began talking about different strategies to quickly Fusion Summon, and using other cards than Polymerization. He started mentioning various ways to summon Fusion Monsters as the students became a bit more interested in the lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Samin and Hinedy, while they paid a relative amount of attention towards to the lesson, they also listened to the small talk the Obelisk students had. As the subject of the Obelisk tournament for the newcomers was brought back, the two couldn't help but sigh dreamily at some of the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We sure are fortunate to have such gentlemanly guys around huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. And they are good looking as well. I wonder if they would want us as partners for the Duels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure hope so. How else are we supposed to impress them if we don't Duel?\", giggled Samin as Hinedy joined in with the laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile giggling, their butts began to enlarge, as they slowly rose on their seat and their thighs also grew nice and shapely, just a bit smaller than Adeis. Their boxers also grew even tighter on them, as the material began softening, and a bit of their legs shrinking down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Adeis was having trouble concentrating, as Crowler's voice was disrupting them. He also couldn't help as he also had a small desire to actually listen for some reason. In that time, his pants grew higher on him once again, stopping at around knee level. With a sigh, he told himself:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Screw it. I can't focus. I guess I just need to wait until the class is over... And who knows, maybe this will help me in future Duels as well.\", he thought with a faint smile on his face.</span></div></div>",

He knew he would always use a strategy to bring out Fusion Monsters regardless, so listening would prove beneficial anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe settled to just pay attention to what Crowler said, as he currently left his troubling thoughts behind a little to see if he could enjoy the class. As he listened, his top he wore under his blazer became tighter on him, becoming a little more formfitting, while the red on the blazer faded a out more, now being a really pale tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for his friends, who were also partially listening, and also thinking about their plan to the welcoming party, their clothes also changed as their blazers became fully white as their rears slowly expanded further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what Deck will you use for the party?\", asked Hinedy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well of course I will use the brand new one I made and managed to keep it a secret from everyone. What about you? You switched a few up in the past, but you seem to have stayed recently with that Burn Damage one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I do. But it felt really good to use that Deck with a bunch of good-looking guys too. I may use it for the ceremony too. I mean, I must show that I can handle something more diverse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so. I will just stick with my Harpies. It's about time the guys to get blown off by some wind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giggled a little as their voices also grew another octave, becoming somewhat similar to the voices of another two students they knew, but they never noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for their conversation, their Decks were also gradually changing, Samin's Roid Cards being gradually replaced with Harpy ones, while Hinedy's Dinosaur Deck was being changed into a Burn Damage one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lesson continued, as Crowler went through various methods to use to Fusion Summon, and then listing several cards and archetypes that would benefit from the mentioned techniques.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, we will talk about a special type of Fusion. It is called Contact Fusion. It is made by returning the Fusion Material Monsters from your Field to your Deck without the use of any other cards. The times you can use this type of Fusion it isn't restricted by a number of times, thus if you have the possibility, use the method to bring out your stronger Monsters. A type that is being used is... Neo Spacians...\", said Crowler with a grumble, reminding himself of a certain \"Slifer slacker\" before resuming: \"And the Gladiators, a new archetype currently being produced by Industrial Illusions that will have this mechanic. The Cards will be released soon for the public, but when they are, I suggest you learn about them, as the aforementioned method of Fusion if surely going to become really useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdeis couldn't help but laugh a little upon seeing Crowler's grumble, as he watched him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, he is sure isn't happy talking about this. Well it was to be expected. There is no way he could talk about Contact Fusion without mentioning the Neo Spacians. I am just surprised he didn't turn to look at me when he said that though. I would have expected at least an irritated glare or something.\", thought Adeis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality, Adeis wasn't for Crowler someone he should glare at. In fact, he hold a degree of respect for him as he was becoming someone who in his opinion deserved respect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, but still... Gladiators, eh? I wonder what they will be like. Well, I am sure I am going to find out, since I am going to Duel whoever is going to pick them up...\", told Adeis to himself as he felt a slight tingle in his abdomen as his waist pinched in a little. \"And I guess I could use a Ritual Monster or two to mix things up as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't notice where that comment came from, as he didn't use Ritual Monsters, but for him it was natural to think that. Inside his Deck, Elemental Hero Neos turned to Cyber Angel Benten.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Now then, I have a question for you all.\", began Crowler with a grin on his face. \"The Wicked Dreadroot is on the opponent's field, who has 2500 LP. Having only 100 LP, please state 3 methods to win in one turn by using only Neo-Spacian or Hero related cards and Contact Fusion. And all those times, the win must be brought by a different Fusion Monster. Those who think they can answer raise your hands!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question wasn't particularly easy, but a handful of students did raise their hands. Adeis never actually encountered someone using The Wicked Dreadroot, so he didn't actually knew three methods. Also, his familiarity with the archetype was slowly slipping away as well, making it even harder to think of the possibilities. Just when he was about to give up, and somehow manage to avoid getting a scolding from Crowler for not knowing his own Deck properly, new knowledge flooded his mind. Just like with the question from before, Adeis seemed to gain more information about the various cards and effects, thus giving him a better insight. He initially had zero prior knowledge of something like this, usually learning from Duels rather than textbooks, but currently his mind was slowly developing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring a small discomfort in his throat, and a feeling of tightness as his boxers became tighter on him, just like his pants, Adeis raised his hand too. Scanning the room for the people who raised their hands, Crowler spotted Adeis, and with a small smile, told him to stand up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Adeis, if you know the answer please tell us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Certainly.\", said Adeis compliantly, as he stood up, answering in a slightly higher pitched than before, the tone being almost different from his original one. \"The first option is simple. First use Grand Mole and Neos to summon Grand Neos to return Dreadroot to the hand and then attack the opponent directly with Grand Neos. Then you can call forth Air Neos and with its effect, increase it ATK to 3600 and then with Neo Space to 4100 ATK. After destroying Dreadroot, use Contact Out to call back Neos and Hummingbird and then land the finishing blow with Neos. Lastly use Dark Panther and Neos to summon Dark Neos to cancel out the effect of Dreadroot. The by using Skyscraper and H-Heated Heart, you attack, and force a tie. But then by using Reverse of Neos, you can call back Elemental Hero Neos to land the finishing blow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrowler and the rest of the class couldn't help but clap upon hearing the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marvelous. You truly are a prodigy in this Adeis. That is absolutely correct. There are different methods as well, but all the ones you mentioned are true. Truly, a superb display.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdeis couldn't help but blush a little at Crowler's praise, as he sat down. He certainly wasn't expected to hear him out of all people congratulate him on a job well done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this sure is great. I don't know where all that came from, but I am sure happy that I answered right.\", thought Adeis smiling, without noticing that his face took on a much rounder shape, his features starting to soften.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Hinedy and Samin ,the two also clapped loudly for their friend. As they did, they felt some discomfort in their shoulders, thus they moved their arms a little to try and alleviate the pain. The ache soon disappeared as they stopped clapping, as their shoulders rounded out, and their arms became long and thin, with Hinedy still having a little muscle on them visible. Also, their underwear lost a little more of their legs as the material continued getting softer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, he nailed it once again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that again. I am really not surprised by how great he did. He is smart, and really professional when answering as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! He just needs to find a better passtime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Totally. Just hanging out at the Slifer dorm all the time is really boring. I mean, there are so many other places to check out. I really wonder why he goes there sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir thoughts and opinion about the red dorm were now changing a lot, from being a second home to actually being a place they don't want to frequent too much. And for Samin his former memories of spending a year there were now disappearing as well. New thoughts of spending time at the blue dorm were instead appearing, with even the memories of being in Ra were now beginning to fade away.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Adeis was slowly starting to let himself relax bit by bit as the lesson progressed. While he still had his doubts over a few thinks and had plenty of unanswered questions, they didn't seem as important right now. Other than his thoughts regarding Atticus, most of his problems didn't seem as urgent as they were before. And even his memories about Atticus, despite a few being kind of odd or out of place, with some even somehow managing to trace all the way back to his childhood, weren't as troubling as they were before, as new flashbacks of time spent together before attending the academy were slowly filling his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I don't know why I was so panicked before. Sure, I kind of what to know what the deal with Samin and Hinedy is, but I guess it can wait. It isn't as if there is a time limit or anything. I guess they also thought I was being odd also by seeing my reactions. I guess I just need to take a breather and try to enjoy the lesson, even if it is Crowler the one who's talking.. But was that thought from before, about me forgetting something important...? Eh, maybe it was just my imagination. Or maybe it was another memory with Atticus, or something like that. Anyway, I guess it can wait until I talk with the guys.\", thought Adeis, in a more composed state of mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was he forgetting was in fact, the other big issue he discovered: not being able to talk with Duel Monster spirits. However, with his memories gradually changing, the thought of himself being able to communicate with the spirits was vanishing step by step, with currently not being able to recall if he actually did this before. As proof of that, more cards in his Deck changed to new ones, with Elemental Hero Avian becoming Etoile Cyber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lesson continued as Crowler then moved to different archetypes that use Fusion Monsters to Fusion Summoning by banishing Monsters, a strategy Chazz was known using. In the meantime, the changes progressed further for all three boys. The pants Adeis wore finished becoming dark-blue as they climbed even further up his legs, now resting at about his lower-thigh. Also, his hips were also almost done growing, as were about the same size his friends had. Lastly, his complexion changed a bit as well, his skin becoming a bit paler, but more peachy in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for his friends, their butts finished inflating, becoming big bubble-shapes as their waists were gradually reworked, slowly becoming less and less broad, almost finishing their hourglass-figures. Also, at the exit of their now sleeveless blazers, two round blue circles appeared, as the region became a bit thicker to be more visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnlike Adeis, who was now actually entranced by the lesson, the other two would talk to each other, without drawing too much attention to themselves as more thoughts appeared in their heads and more cards got replaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, what are your plans for today after class?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I don't know Samin. I was thinking hanging out with the guys a little to hear about that party they were planning, but I guess until Crowler gives his approval, I should wait a little bit. I doubt he would let us the entire dorm for any festivities outside the formal ones. The party they give is nice and classy, but I feel it can get a bit monotone. it isn't too exciting, but it is the one he always does.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You never know. He seems a lot more open this time around. I don't know if it is after going back to being a teacher or he simply had a revelation, but it could be possible. And who knows? Maybe he will like the ideas we bring out.... But I will see tomorrow what they are talking about. I need my beauty sleep after waking earlier than usual. Not only did we had to help for laundry day, but now we had to come here just because we weren't that great in the tournament.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not so bad, as it isn't as stressful as the regular schedule and some of the things they talked about was actually useful... But I agree with you. We didn't join the Society of Light or whatever was that group called, so we shouldn't actually be here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir memories changed further, as instead of providing support for Adeis, they actually came to class because they didn't make it too far in the tournament instead. Their pasts changed more as well, as more memories changed into new ones, with Samin's perception of Zane also changing, starting to find him a bit handsome and Hinedy enjoying chatting more than exercising.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the lesson, ended Crowler went to the microphone to give his parting words for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for coming here today. Even if it isn't something that originally planned, I am happy to see there are people who take studying seriously. The whole Society of Light incident is now over, thus I suggest we try to move on into the new year without anything to hold us back. Once again, thank you for attending. But as a reminder to everyone, no one will be spared from future examinations, especially the ones who performed poorly in the tournament.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole class sweat-dropped as Crowler gave his ending speech, not knowing what to think of the combination of gratitude with the stern remark at the end. It surely looked like he wanted to get closer to the students, but it was clearly visible that some tendencies are hard to give up on. Before he took his leave, he took a quick glance at Adeis and gave a small unnoticeable grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see he still in top form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Crowler left, students also began leaving, happy they didn't got chewed on too harshly today from what happened at the tournament. Samin and Hinedy stood up and were waiting for Adeis, ready to leave to their dorm. However, as they waited three Obelisk students approached them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Sasmine, Hindy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi. Did something happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, actually we were looking for you. We decided to hold a small tournament to welcome the new students at Obelisk this year. We will make a petition and we are trying to find as many people as we can to convince Crowler and the principal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't have to be at the opening ceremony.\", said another student. \"We can ask them for the next night or in a day there aren't classes. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile it seemed odd to ask someone who isn't part of the Obelisk dorm for their support, reality changed a lot since the changes started, and currently the two were actually part of the blue dorm now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they talked, a small cape appeared from the back of their blazers, as their hair grew a bit longer, with Sasmine's hair now almost touching his shoulders as the color became 75 percent brown as Hindy's hair grew a bit longer, the hair in the ponytail now reaching his mid-back almost as the color was closing on being an ashen shade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. We would be happy to help.\", said Hindy with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you must let us be part of the exhibition matches.\", continued Sasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, aren't we demanding, are we?\", replied a student jokingly. \"But sure. If you wish to be part of the tournament, we will be happy to let you. And I'm curious what new Deck you've made up Sasmine that you are hiding it up until now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well just wait and see.\", replied the boy with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdeis on the other hand, also left his seat, but was feeling like his back was a bit stiff and sore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? I didn't know just sitting a few hours could make by back hurt a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pushed his back forwards as he massaged it, trying to get rid of the ache. As he was rubbing his back, the sleeves of his top and blazer retracted completely, with the blazer having a blue lining where his arms came out. When he finished, the stiffness was gone, but now his back was arched forward, his spine now being a lot more flexible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, much better. There have been a lot of weird things going on today, but I am glad that the tiredness from this morning is gone. I feel kind of refreshed right now for some reason. It really was from that nap?... I guess it doesn't matter. I don't want to make them wait for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then walked towards the exit, but noticed that his friends were chatting with some boys from the blue dorm. When Sasmine noticed him, he gestured to him:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Adleis! Come on over!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy...\", mumbled Adleis under his breath as he didn't notice once again how was he called. \"I sure hope they aren't roping me in in another one of their schemes.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Adleis nervously joined Sasmine and Hindy as the students next to them were looking at him expectantly. He hoped the two didn't accept to just spend the time with these guys and said he will join them in whatever idea they had for today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... what's up guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they have a great idea for you during the next welcoming party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't let it be singing...\", murmured Adleis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you wish to be a trainer for the tournament?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We want to organize some matches for the new students of Obelisk, and we want to ask the teachers and the principal if they can let us have the main hall for the tournament. And we were thinking you could be a sort of teacher for the new guys. I mean, you are smart, are a great Duelist and you seem like a great person they could learn from. Sasmine and Hindy recommended you for the task. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite wishing his friends would stop making decisions for him, the idea itself wasn't sounding too bad. He was really up to test the newcomers, and he would surely enjoy Dueling just for fun. And somehow, the notion of himself teaching others and giving tips wasn't sounding too bad either. But there was something that bugged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why exactly do they need me for this? I mean, Chazz could be a better option. He won the tournament after all, and he is very popular right now. But is it okay for them to ask this for people outside the blue dorm? I mean, I am...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdleis's mind seized up for a second as his confusion about what dorm was he in was slowly starting to get clearer. In that time, his waist pinched in further as his hips finished growing, as together with his rear, they formed a figure that would be envied by a lot of girls. Also, his blazer became fully white, if it wasn't for the line on his chest and the collar which were continuing turning dark-blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other boys believed Adleis was pondering on the idea, but Sasmine and Hindy looked at him a bit concerned, remembering his pauses from before. Their changes also went on as whatever soreness they had in their throat vanished as their vices went higher one last time. As for their underwear, as they continued shrinking, their design was starting to change. Sasmine's simple white design was beginning to grow some thin baby-blue lines while Hindy's camouflage design vanished, becoming a dull dark-green before the color began to lighten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to Adleis, his mind was starting to recover, the fog in his head starting to clear. The time he spent at the red dorm was now mostly reduced to just visits, as he now recalls being part of Obelisk Blue. On top of all that, more memories of himself and Atticus appeared in his head, with more and more seemingly being from his childhood years. But at this point, he had an urge to just consider everything normal, as he had trouble finding anything wrong with how his memories played out in his head. Inside his Deck, Elemental Hero Burstinatrix became Blade Skater as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sure came out of nowhere... I hope it was just a small vertigo and nothing else... But should I really accept the offer? I mean, it would be a great experience, but I don't want to come out as bossy or in need of attention for the others. The fact that I have a fan club is already worrying... Still, it could be a good practice to know how to teach...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Initially Aldeis wanted to think over the whole situation, as well as trying to get a grip on the mess with his head, but the idea of being a teacher to other students began to sound more and more enticing to him. Sure, it would be a nice thing to do and it would make him gain some popularity, but at the moment, all he was thinking was all the good experience he could gain by doing this. He never actually considered teaching as a career for his future, but he was slowly starting to think it would be amazing to be a teacher. Ignoring a slight tingle in his vocal chords, he answered back:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I guess I will.\" He didn't notice his once again changed voice, which right now started to resemble someone else's. Someone he knew. \"I don't know how good I'll be. But I will give it a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Then it's settled. Now all we need is to have the hall for us for half a day or so.\", said one of the students. \"Once again, thanks. Once we see if we can convince the teachers, we will tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three noted as the small group left. Sasmine and Hindy giggled a little after they left. As they did, their waists finished slimming down, as Hindy's muscles faded a bit more in that region. Their shoulders also rounded out, as their new forms were one step closer to completion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might I ask what is so funny?\", asked Aldeis, not amused at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were just laughing a little at how predictable your answer was. We were sure you would accept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you could warn me before you make decisions in my name. You seem to be doing this a lot lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it's not like it's a bad thing. You always said you wanted some practice training others. And we thought how great this opportunity would be for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We admit the offer came a bit sudden, but we knew you were up for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks... I guess.\", answered Aldeis a bit flattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it's not like it's something fishy like the stunts Atticus likes to pull off... And we thought you could benefit a little. After all, talking with boys should be a priority for you as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAldeis simply rolled his eyes at the remark. While it was true that some of the ideas Atticus came up with were being more childish, stupid or crazy, including one where he remembered Atticus wanting to turn him into a singer, the part with the boys came out naturally to him. While spending time with boys might have been and still is something he does, he now quickly registers the message his friends are sending him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Again? I thought I told you I am not interested in things like these.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon. It's like there is any harm in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course there is. What if people start thinking I want to draw attention from the boys? It's already bad enough there are rumors about that. I don't need someone to think that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one will think that. You've been here for over two years. It's pretty hard to change one's reputation without proof.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I will try to maintain appearances, so please don't think of plans of me being surrounded by boys, with them asking me for a match or anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\"Fine...\", replied the two in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the conversation, Aldeis' hair grew once again longer, now resting at about his mid-back as its color changed to a sandy brown, on the verge transitioning towards blond in the process. As for his friends, their pant-legs finally gave out as they completely fused together, forming two small skirts, held in place by a small blue belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are your plans for today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were thinking we should just head back to the dorm and relax a little.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Already? But it's barely in the afternoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are just a bit tired. With the earlier wake-up call and the classes, we wan to take a small break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAldeis was not sure about the idea, as for some reason, he was feeling a lot more invigorated than in the morning. He didn't knew if it was because of his earlier nap or because of another reason, but for the moment, he just headed towards the dorm with Sasmine and Hindy, as he thought not just of another option to spend his afternoon, but also about his confusion from before.</span></div></div>",

As Sasmine and Hindy were chatting with each other, Aldeis stood a bit behind, to once again gather his thoughts. He then tried to review the whole situation one more time, but this time he was finding a lot more difficulty in doing so. Not only did his communication ability with the spirits was foreign to him now, he actually believed it was silly. And as for the praise he got from the teachers, he was now really believing that he was a hard-working student. The times of him sleeping or coming late to class were replaced with memories of him actually paying attention, taking notes and scoring high grades on tests, as his knowledge of the Duel Monster Game was even now expanding, as more information was developed into his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of memories, even the weird memories with Atticus were slowly starting to feel normal, as his perception of him was also changing. While he was a cool and smart person with a slightly goofy side, he was now becoming childish, exasperating and silly as well. But most importantly, he was starting a different kind of bond with forming. He couldn't place what that bond was, but at the moment, that was mainly the thing that was on his mind as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... That's odd. I thought there were more things that seemed odd before. Maybe my mind was just muddled a bit... Or maybe I was a bit too tired. Still, I made those two worry about me for nothing. I was really out of my stride today for some reason. I should apologize for sleeping as well. It's not that I usually do something like that... Wait... Then why do I have the feeling that there was someone who sleeps in class. If it isn't me, then who...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was thinking, his pants went further up his legs, as they now reached the middle of his thighs, losing their pockets in the process. They once again darkened, as they were almost dark-blue as well. His face changed further as well as his ears and nose grew smaller while his eyes became bigger as well. Lastly, his figure was also nearly done, as together with a little more mass being transferred from his narrow waist to his hips and butt, there was little to be done before it would be finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasmine and Hindy on the other hand were meanwhile discussing their plans and ideas for the tournament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you think we should dress differently for the event?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. I mean, a bit of diversity wouldn't be bad at all. It's just that it comes down to whether the teachers accept it or not. And since Crowler's vote is the most important, I highly doubt it will happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, good point... But it's okay. It's not like dressing up nicely it's the only way to draw attention. We just need to show them our awesome Dueling skills!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! And with Mr Instructor on our side, we would surely have a chance to make a great first impression on the newcomers too.\", joked Hindy as both exchanged a small laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were almost ready to integrate into their new roles, their previous memories already being gone. Whatever previous even he had with Zane before the academy was now gone for Sasmine, but strangely enough, both of them now remembered that they actually knew each other by the time they attended the school, as well as meeting Aldeis too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir faces finished changing, with their lips plumping, their cheekbones growing higher and their eyes changing color to gray for Sasmine and an olive color for Hindy. Their underwear also changed more, as their legs were almost gone as Sasmine's blue lines became more visible and bigger, while Hindy's were starting to gain a pinkish hue.</span></div></div>",

Do you still feel out of it like this morning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAldeis wanted to comment on that statement, but instead he was starting to think on the meaning of his words. As he did, Sparkman became Cyber Angel Idaten, insdie his Deck. At this point, most of the cards he had became completely different than they were before, and if he would open his case and take a look at the cards, he would see how his Deck was starting to resemble the Deck of someone he knew. There still were some cards which didn't change such as Polymerization, but right now, only a part of his cards were making sense with the current build.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I guess I am. Sorry of I scared you this morning... You seemed to act a slightly different to me as well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Huh... We never noticed... But I guess we did what we did because we were a bit concerned with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most likely. I mean, I suppose we aren't that persistent at talking with you like that... Even if we forgot to go with you to the bathroom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right... Sorry about that. We thought you would follow us so I didn't pay that much attention... Maybe we should have woken you up at the start of the recess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. I don't mind that. I just hope the teacher didn't get too mad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he kind of frowned a bit upon noticing you asleep, but I am sure he didn't get mad or anything. I think he just assumed you were tired. I mean, you never actually do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, besides you aren't like those Slifers who sleep all the time. Even a few of the Ra students began doing it at some classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were talking, their hair changed again. Aldeis got a few bangs covering most of his forhead as it grew once again longer, stopping at about his mid-back, as the color once again lightened, to a dark blond color. As for his friends, their haircuts were now done. Hindy not had a poofy hairdo with a few bangs being a bit frizzy and spiky in the front, right above his forehead and the hair I the ponytail was a bit spiky and wild as the color became an ashen gray. As for Sasmine, his mane was now fully brown with multiple spikes pointing downwards and two strands standing upwards a little on top of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for their clothes, the collar and chest line that were on Aldeis' top fully became blue while the underwear his friends were completely lost their legs and softened further until they became two pairs of panties: white with blue stripes for Sasmine and pink for Hindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis once again happened beneath everyone's radar, as none noticed anything. As for Aldeis, the thoughts he was having before his friends were now attributed to how they reacted to his tiredness rather than acting differently than their usual personalities. But there was something else that was now on his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon. Don't be like that Sasmine. You know that not all lessons are that exciting as the ones we had today. In some the teacher only talk too. It's really not that surprising.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe. But still, it is really dumb to do it. I mean, an angry teacher is the last thing anyone should want. Syrus and Hasselberry too, need to stop doing that. They just act like they shouldn't care... even if Ra is the dorm where they put knowledge above everything.\", huffed Sasmine with Hindy nodding in affirmation, and Aldeis simply sighing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs things were right now, the two boys no longer considered themselves to be the ones they were at the start of the transformation, as their minds were now completely integrated in their new characters.</span></div></div>",

Also, he continued feeling more and more different about Atticus, as he somehow felt a fraternal respect develop for him even if he wasn't related to him as his memories with him now reached to almost the times he was an infant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of memories, what happened at Duel Academy was still present in his head, the only major difference being the shift in perspective, as some of the more important Duels that were organized were now seen from the gallery instead of the arena. There were still a big number of Duels he did however, as his passion for the game didn't falter. But there was something that was starting to confuse him. By now, he believed Syrus and Hasselberry to be completely different people than the friends he was currently walking to the dorm with. That didn't matter as much, as he was still good friends with them... However, there seemed to be someone else who was in his memories, but for some reason his image seemed quite blurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis individual was someone who piqued his interest early on, from the start of the first year, and he was quite fond of this person. He respected, acknowledged and even admired whoever he was thinking of. He initially thought it was Chazz, but he quickly dismissed the thought, as great Dueling skills aside, he found a lot of flaws with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was thinking, he felt something in his throat. While it wasn't as uncomfortable as last time he had this feeling, he still felt some discomfort. As gently rubbed his neck, pushing a small bulge there back into his neck as his vocal chords tightened upon doing so. After a hard swallow, the discomfort was gone. He smiled to himself and giggled a little at the relief, not noticing his higher pitched voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSasmine and Hindy on the other hand were talking with each other once again, letting Aldeis with his thoughts. They knew he was a sociable person, but also that he would also ponder on certain things at times. They didn't want to break his concentration, as they began to think they did that quite a lot today. Instead, the two were once again discussing their plans for the tournament as well as impressing the others, especially the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe changes for the two were nearing their end, as Sasmine grew one last time in height, bringing him to the same level as Hindy and Aldeis while the last faint vestiges of muscles disappeared on Hindy as his skin tone lightened to the point he became a bit more pale than his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, are you two ready for a small bath?\", asked Sasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHindy nodded, but Aldeis wasn't actually in the mood for that at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A bath now? It's not even that late... And I am feeling better now, so I will just take a shower later... Hmm. Didn't Blair invite me for a little meeting with the guys? This could be my chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAldeis stopped walking as he told the two:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, Blair invited me for a Dueling session at the red dorm. I will join her if you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two looked at each other, gave a sigh, while still having a small smile on their faces as Hindy replied back:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. If you want to Duel of course you can go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just make sure you get back before it gets too dark. I know how intense you can get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, I will....\", said Aldeis sighing a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And close your top. There is a chance it could get windy tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAldeis noticed his opened top, so he zipped it, a bit confused as to why it was opened. Hindy seemed a bit bewildered as he saw his top opened as well, which prompted him to close it. Afterward, Aldeis headed for the Slifer dorm while the other two went for the Obelisk dorm, as they waved to each other. One last thing that changed before they separated was that Aldeis' boxers began to shrink and lose their legs, as the material got a lot more silky, while Sasmine and Hindy felt something constricting their chests for a second, but upon noticing, they simply brushed it off, as bras identical in design to their panties formed over their pectorals.</span></div></div>",

It sounds probable as she is new and wants to get on the same page as the rest of us... Or this could just be one of his plans to meet a certain someone.\", said Sasmine with a small smirk on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...! I see. Well, it kind of makes sense in a way. If we told him to go on his own or if we joined him, he would obviously refuse... I still don't get why he doesn't just admit his feelings though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows. Maybe he is afraid that nothing will happen. Or he is too modest to be aware of his feelings. Atticus may be his brother but I wouldn't be surprised if he is indeed as innocent as I think he is.... But anyway, this should sound alarm bells for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To have a boyfriend of course! I mean, Aldeis already has someone he likes, and we don't even know someone who could suit our tastes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... Most of the guys from Obelisk aren't that nice as some seem to have taken from Chazz or aren't as good as the MVPs from the other dorms. It sucks that all the good ones were taken by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it does... But maybe we could get lucky. Maybe we will find someone we like among the freshmen. After all, there isn't that much of an issue if we are older right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. In fact, I could actually see it working.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two continued talking, they both felt a little itchy around their pectoral region. They absentmindedly scratched the area as they discussed more about potential boyfriends, as the preferences were starting to change. Their nipples grew wider and more sensitive as faint pockets of fat were slowly developing under them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But maybe we could do something that would give us a lot more attention....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have something in mind Sasmine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a matter of fact... I do. Maybe we could ask Aster to hold a Duel as an opening night event or something like that. I mean, he has a lot of fans and he is very skilled He surely will be a hit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... Do you think he will come though? He is kind of busy with his schedule and he didn't come to the academy ever since the end of the last semester... Maybe we could ask Zane to come. He was a former student of the academy and he is very popular right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... don't think that's a good idea... Believe me, I would love for him to come back, but... I don't know, ever since he lost to Aster and then rose back to fame, he seems a lot more creepy in my opinion. Even Syrus can say that about him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Sasmine no longer considered himself Syrus anymore, not only did he not see Zane as a brother anymore, but his feelings were kind of mixed right now between respect and a bit of fear for Zane, as he seemed really different than the way he remembered him from the academy, a feeling shared by Hindy as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... Than what do we do? Inviting someone for an opening night Duel demonstration sounds great, but who are we going to invite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just think more about this in the bath. Right now, I just want is to relax a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too... Maybe we could even think which guy among the ones from came up with the idea is ideal for us. I doubt all of them have girlfriends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh. Good point.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their thoughts went back to boys, the two began to feel a bit aroused this time, but were too busy with their thoughts to feel their manhoods starting to shrink away, becoming slightly smaller at the moment.</span></div></div>",

But there was something they should have noticed once they arrived. This was the Obelisk Blue dorm that belonged to the girls. There were a few guts around, but it would be obvious for anyone to make the difference between the girls and boys dormitories. But the two not only were unfazed by this, they knew this was the right place for them to go, as it was also in their profiles noted that they stayed here. While it would be strange for two guys to live there, soon that would not be a problem...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey slowly walked towards their room, engaging in a little more conversation and sometimes saluting the girls from the dorm on the way. Once they reached their room, the two wasted no time in turning on their Jacuzzi that they had in their bathroom. If only the Slifers would knew the luxury the Obelisk students had... They then began undressing, as they waited for the tub to fill up. While they were in their underwear, Hindy admired Sasmine's design.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's such a nice design! I am amazed there were sporty looking ones still at the shop. Most of the ones I found online were usually frilly or lacy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I thought it looked normal to me, but I guess it does seem a lot less girly than some other options I have... I haven't actually checked the clothing store in a while now. But there were a few options for myself last time I checked it out, and there were a few sporty options out there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then maybe they got sold. There are a lot of girls who wish for a bit more variety in their options.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yours look great too if you ask me. It is actually sort of cute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks... Although it's just a regular pair, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they took off their underwear, they took a glance at each other's body for a second, before they both blushed a little and closed their eyes, hopeful the other didn't see their reaction. While naked, their breasts finally began developing, growing towards an A-cup and continued growing as their manhoods shrunk a little bit more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up with me? Why did I get flustered all of a sudden? It's not like I haven't seen him naked before... Is it because of that talk with how great we look from before? Crap... I need to get my mind out of the gutter before Hindy notices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I blushing? This never happened before when it was just me and Sasmine... I can figure this out later, right now I must act normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA flicker of their initial modesty around girls resurfaced as the two tried to act as casually as they can get, relieved that it seemed like they haven't seen each other's reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Well now, let's head for the Jacuzzi, shall we?\", asked Sasmine a bit nervous still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"y-Yeah, let's.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the bathroom, the Jacuzzi was now filled to the brim. After dipping their feet to check the temperature, the two slowly submerged themselves in the tub. They gave out a pleased sigh as they let the water do its magic. The warm water also caused their breasts to grow a bit more, now bordering the B-cup range.</span></div></div>",

We don't use the Jacuzzi too often, but right now it sure feels like it hits all the right spots...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree to that... I've been feeling a bit winded today for some reason. I've been thinking about Zane a bit too much and I somehow managed to doubt my skills for a second... All sorts of weird thoughts like those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too. I've been thinking about training to build some more muscle, but I don't particularly care about that. I mean, I agree we should keep ourselves fit and all that, but putting on muscle isn't for me at all... And I also thought I used a different Deck for some reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too huh? I kind of forgot what Deck I thought I used before... I only know myself of using my usual one, until the new addition of Harpy archetype...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... Maybe we need some sleep as well, not just Aldexis... Anyway let's just put this whole thing behind. No one noticed, and these thoughts weren't especially interesting. I don't see why it should bother us.\", said Sasmine as Hindy nodded,, not noticing how they called Aldexis by yet another name. However, Hindy found an opportunity to a topic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of Aldexis, what do you think about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know. Having feelings for Jaden and all that stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven thought the changes for Aldexis weren't quite done, the two, as well as Aldexis himself now believed Jaden was a different person altogether now, as their memories were almost done finishing changing. Actually, apart from a few things, Sasmine and Hindy were actually nearly done. As the conversation began, their breasts grew to large B-cups as their testes were starting to feel tighter for them as their groins continued shifting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that... Well, to be honest I am still a bit shocked by that. I mean, talent of not, he is still a Slifer, he irks Crowler to this day still and he doesn't seem interested in studying at all... But I guess I have to give him the credit for being a prodigy I guess. He had a Draw with Zane, and beat Aster, so he has what it takes to be a pro... And has somewhat enough smarts to make up strategies during a Duel. If it wasn't for his laziness and stubbornness for not paying attention during class, a lot of girls would have the hots for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe... But this isn't actually what I wanted to ask... His skills and hobbies aside, I was actually wondering if the two could actually make a couple. I think we can agree he is quite dense when it comes down to romance. Remember that time with the tennis captain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right... It's good his pride took a step down after that Duel, but... Jaden can be so clueless at some of the things everyone knows, I sometimes wonder what goes through his head... But for him to be with Aldexis... Hmm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two became quite interested in the topic of love. While they were still on the hunt for partners themselves, the idea of their friend being in a relationship with Jaden, made them think quite a bit about it. Sasmine actually never got too deep into thinking about the notion, while Hindy, while still not too engrossed into the idea, found it quite vexing in a way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, their breasts were now just entering C-cups as a new cavity was now forming inside their abdomen. There were a few more things to change, but right now, the two would surely think of themselves as girls.</span></div></div>",

But if they somehow manage to get together, I am pretty sure they might make a good couple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But weren't you saying he is unfit to be a couple because he is a Slifer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, but let's be real here for a second. Outside the teachers, I don't think anyone really thinks low of him after these past two years. Sure, he is lazy an uninterested in studying, and he is clueless about things not related to Dueling, but otherwise he is a pretty cool guy... I don't see how Aldexis fell in love with him, but I'm not saying it's impossible to imagine why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir respect for Jaden was not as high as the one his other friends had for him, but they still gave him the credit for being a talented prodigy despite all of his flaws. They had trouble understanding him sometimes as well, but that didn't make them criticize him other than with some advices for playful jabs here and there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both shivered a little as their breasts grew to large C-cups that jiggled a little as they reached their final size. But what really caused the shiver was that their manhoods grew even smaller, as along with their testes were ready to be pulled inside them. But that didn't stop them from continuing the conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right. He has a pretty cool personality isn't obnoxious when he loses like Chazz and he is friendly towards most people. I may see it happening actually too., he \", said Hindy. \"As for Aldexis, even if he is praised by everyone, he is really modest, and he is still innocent towards love, so there might be some issues in terms of confidence, but if he can mange them he can actually confess. They would be a perfect couple.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well both love Dueling and think about it 24/7, they are passionate and determined once they have a goal, and they get along amazingly well. If they would take part in the tournament, they would make a perfect team. Even Atticus is on board with the idea of them being together, and I even bet he would be thrilled if that would happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... All in all Jaden seems like a great boyfriend material. If you can look pass a few things, he could actually be charming... That kind of makes me wonder if Blair sees that in him as well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But anyways, you gave me a great idea for the tournament. And I am sure we will get the attention of tons of boys as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs their thoughts went back to their own desire for boyfriends, the two moaned a little as the changes finished up, the two now having a new gender in between their legs, as their personas were complete as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you feel that Jasmine? What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Mindy. It sure felt weird for a second there. But whatever it was it's gone now, so I guess we're okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so. So what were you thinking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what about we invite Jaden for the tournament?\", asked Jasmine with a sly smirk on her face as Mindy looked at him surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Jaden is kind of like a celebrity around here after beating the Society of Light, so inviting him would make perfect sense. We would have him clean house and then we would offer our services for the new students to help them train. And in the process, we will get boyfriends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... what if they would wish to have him train them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I doubt it. Any new kid in Obelisk wouldn't want a Slifer to lecture him. We got used to him, but until they do. they will seek someone like us for help. And will not Duel us, to not embarrass ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That... might actually work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why wouldn't some cute guys want to train with us? I mean, we have the smarts and the charms.\", said Jasmine as he puffed out his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe. Guess so.\", giggled Mindy in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then went to discuss about their plan and how to woo the boys to their side, as they would occasionally steal a glance at each other, happy they are friends with someone who really are on the same wavelength with them, who also look amazing in their opinion... If only a certain someone would be more like them. </span></div></div>",

He was glad he managed to avoid another talk about how to impress boys with Sasmine and Hindy. As much as he liked their company, just talking about boys instead or literally anything else and taking a bath when the Sun didn't even set, were the two factors that made Aldeis leave. After all, he just started to feel energized again, so having a hot bath right now would only make him feel sleepy again. But there was another reason he wanted to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... so who is this mysterious person who all of a sudden is now inside my head...? I swear, today my head was filled with a bunch of weird thoughts... Is it really just because I was a bit sleepy? It's hard to believe my head with be so foggy for no real reason. Maybe I'll take a good sleeping pill or another remedy for tonight... I just hope this is because of a lack of sleep and nothing else...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was walking, his thoughts keep him distracted from his changes. His hair color settled for a dirty blond color as the tips that reached the middle of his back were now swept a bit backwards as most of his mane straightened out, expect from his tips in the back and the hair that framed his face. His clothes finished morphing as his Obelisk Blue female uniform was now complete, complete with a small blue cape on his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, I guess figuring out who this person is might help me a bit. Plus it will make time pass easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe once then began thinking of possible candidates for the mystery person. He already ruled Chazz out, so he began thinking of other people. Syrus and Hasselberry were already clearly seen within his mind, and despite their friendship, he didn't see a real reason to admire them as much he did. Blair seemed at one point possible, given her tenacity and greatly improved Dueling skills to be something anyone would be impressed of, but he also dismissed her as the figure seemed taller than her and given the circumstances, he couldn't observe her for two years as she just attended the academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was something that him frown a bit. During his second year, there was a big gap in his memories, as after a certain Duel with Chazz, he seemingly blanked out. There were a few fragments of events play out in his head, such as the time he went to Domino City and participating in the tournament, but then everything really went white. The then recalled Dueling the person he couldn't remember tell him he won a Duel against him. Afterword, everything played out normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird... Why is there such a big gap? I know I lost to Chazz when he was all about that \"enlightenment\" thing... I mean, I guess I was sort of brainwashed like the rest of the Obelisk students, but was it really that bad? Hold on... Is what I am going through right now a secondary effect or something like that? No, it couldn't be. Why would it happen now and not earlier? And Chazz seemed normal and he didn't look like he was too affected by the whole thing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile thinking, any last ounce of fat that was anywhere on his body was trimmed down and settled for his butt and hips. His proportions were without a doubt bigger than the ones his friends had. His current figure was now a bit envied by the girls at Obelisk, including Sasmine and Hindy, but Aldeis remained modest, not taking too much pride in his figure, only caring about keeping himself fit.</span></div></div>",

The figure seemed to get slightly less blurry as he began to acknowledge the person as a boy. Gradually, he was now recalling that he was a Slifer student, but despite that, he was without a doubt one of the most talented students at the academy. He was quite confused as to how he was recalling so many things about the boy, but he couldn't remember his name at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, this sure would be embarrassing without a doubt. Imagine talking to the guy and not knowing his name. I would crawl under a rock if that would happen... I need to focus my thoughts. Just take a deep breath and concentrate...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was trying to remember, he had to brush off a weird itch on his face. He didn't know why this was happening, but he dismissed it quickly. His eyelashes grew longer as his lips plumped up a bit, while his cheekbones grew higher. Along with his eyes changing into a lovely brown color and a few other minor adjustments, his now feminine face was finished, and if he would look into a mirror, he would see how much it looked like a certain girl he knew. The thing was, with Miracle Fusion turning into Machine Angel Ritual inside his Deck, his changes went to the point where he would actually believe he was said girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, his faster pace was now slowly getting more restricted, as his pants had their legs fused together, becoming a skirt which now fit perfectly with his top, his uniform now being complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could actually think more about the mysterious boy, he noticed he already reached the Slifer dormitory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got here already...? Did I quicken my pace without noticing?... I kind of do that whenever I am in deep thought...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around, and much to his surprise, he found the dorm to be fairly empty. Usually, there would be a good number of students already out either Dueling, or simply chatting with each other. But given school didn't officially began and since a few had to take part in the morning lessons, he assumed they were all out at the moment. There were a few students talking with each other on the second floor, but the rest of the dorm almost seemed deserted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I guess I should have expected that. The semester didn't start yet, so some must be enjoying the \"freedom\" that they still have...\", thought Aldeis with a slightly awkward smile. \"I guess Slifers enjoy their free time a bit more... Actually, I don't blame them. If Crowler is still going on with that \"slacker\" business, even I wouldn't feel too excited to be in class I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then made his way to the bottom floor, saluting the students that were chatting. He was going to Chazz's \"lair\", knowing Blair would be there. She decided to drop there for the moment, as there were no other rooms with enough space for her, and since Chazz's room had the space for two rooms, he reluctantly allowed her to share the place with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he was about to open the door, he felt as if something was constricting his chest. He brushed it off quickly once he realized it was just his blue bra. Meanwhile, his boxers, who were changing ever since he split up with the others, completely lost their legs and became a same shade of blue as the bra. A small bow in the front, along with a little more softening of the material finished changing them into a pair of panties.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Just like he anticipated, Chazz and Blair were inside the room, both watching what appeared to be the news. They heard the door opening, and then they greeted Aldeis as he came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Aldexis!\", said Chazz a bit more politely than usual. \"Nice to see you here. Are those classes already over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. They weren't so bad. They had some pretty valuable information. A bit more than usual actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I would've come but after helping the guys at the blue dorm repaint the exterior and watching that tournament last night, I was pretty beat this morning. Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a problem. I too was a little tired after last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky you won the tournament so that you didn't had to attend classes.\", said Blair with a small smirk on her face. \"Otherwise, you would get an earful from Crowler in no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, might I remind you I was once an Obelisk!\", replied Chazz a bit angry. \"The teachers know my skill, including Crowler. It's just that after I left the academy I had to start from the ground up. That's the reason I am a Slifer right now. I guess I deserve to be here nonetheless and I need to pull my weight to show my progress... But let me remind you that's not my job to be yelled at for being lazy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I guess you're right... So? Anything worth telling us about the lessons Aldexis?\", asked Blair, without paying as much attention to Chazz at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAldexis sat on a small couch next to them and began telling them about the lessons. There were at times, moments when he would try to recall who the boy in her head was, but had to keep an image of composure in front of his friends. He also knew his friends would obviously know who the boy was, but asking them something like who the person was out of the blue would be out of the question. He was distracted by his thoughts and his explanations that he missed how detailed his description was, usual a much wider array of words than he would use in the beginning of the transformation . Also, his hair finished styling itself as while some bangs now covered his ears and another one as now falling almost to eye-level as it lowered over his forehead, a good portion of his top hair was brushed to his right. The rest of the hair straightened out mostly as his hair over his back split a bit forming several small ends to his mane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a new Contact Fusion archetype coming?\", asked Blair completely taken aback by the news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Along with some other support for various archetypes and so on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, Industrial Illusions must sure be busy with all these ideas coming out...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I can only imagine the look on his face when he heard about it... If he was awake during the presentation of course.\", said Chazz with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother trigger appeared in Aldexis' mind as he remembered the boy was also using Contact Fusion. He was sure there wasn't anyone else who did, given how many surprised students there were about the new cards that were coming... But still, he couldn't recall his name...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, I should bring out some snacks for when the guys are coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't empty the cabinets!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe... No promises...\", giggled Blair as she went for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes I wonder why my patience didn't go away just yet with her....\", mumbled Chazz out loud. \"I just hope the arrangements for a new place for her to stay are going to be over soon...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\", said Aldexis awkwardly. \"...By the way... have been having blanks recently?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, after the whole brainwash thing, I was wondering if you still had some side effects, like forgetting someone or other events?\", asked Aldexis in a tone which Blair didn't hear, as Chazz began pondering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Well, I don't remember many things when I was brainwashed, other than some fragments here and there... Mostly I needed other to tell me the things I did back then... But I didn't forget faces or anything like that. It would be pretty hard anyway. I remember most of the people from the first year and the ones I met at the beginning of the second year...Why are you asking? Are you drawing a blank at remembering someone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... A bit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, it's just a brain fart then. It happens to anyone from time to time. But speaking of forgetting, where in the world Jaden wondering around? Is he still asleep at his desk or what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that time, everything clicked to him. As his nipples grew a larger and more sensitive as they pushed out slightly and Elemental Hero Flame Wingman became Cyber Blader, the current card now being one of which people would recognize him, he remembered the boy's name: Jaden Yuki.</span></div></div>",

See? I told you it was nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was nothing?\", asked Blair as she returned with a large bowl of chips of different brands in her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little... Did you just use my entire stock of chips?\", said Chazz slightly ticked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax. I just opened a bag of each. You still have a lot more left.\", said the girl dismissively while putting the bowl on the table. \"So what were you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... Lex forgot someone and now he remembered them after we talked a bit. That's all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all? Hey, it happens to everyone, don't sweat it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thanks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Chazz and Blair tried to assure him there was nothing wrong in drawing a blank sometimes, he couldn't tell them it was Jaden the one he forgot. After everything that happened the past two years, saying he forgot Jaden was out of the question, especially to him. Other than Syrus, there wasn't anyone who would support and encourage their friend more than he did. Especially after all he did for him as well. From saving Atticus and being a constant source of support to saving him from the brainwashing. He didn't remember much of the second year at the academy and in some of the fragments he did remember, he recalled how cold and rude he was with him, something he sincerely regretted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't any doubt that he was a source of inspiration for him, his drive and determination rivaling the ones Zane and Aster had. And after his defeat to Aster, he could only be impressed by his ability to rebound and to control the new Neos Deck he had quickly enough, despite some of his bumblings in the beginning. But there was something else beside the gratitude, care and respect he had for him that was slowly budding inside his heart. Something that not even him was too aware off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was thinking about Jaden, the changes moved to their final stretch. his chest began to get slightly bigger as small lumps were starting to develop, his nipples getting larger and a lot more sensitive. Also, his manhood got a little smaller as well, however both changes went beneath anyone's notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'll go get the soda.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no you won't! Knowing you, half of my bottles will be empty by the end of the day. You stay here while I look through the selection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlair pouted as she sat on the couch, while Chazz went to check out his beverage supply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can be such a jerk at times...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he is prideful, but he is a lot nicer than he was in the first year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't he have a crush on you or anything?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you would consider him a lot less tolerant given the way he usually is. Besides, he is a bit unnerving when he tries to be nice to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I admit he could ... try a bit too hard at times, but I am pretty sure he understands I am not into him... I hope.\", the last part coming out a lot quieter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then who are you into?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't start. It's already bad enough Jasmine and Mindy bother me with trying to find me a boyfriend. I don't need you too on this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon... I will not argue with you having a fan club that can get a little out of hand, but you have to at least have someone you like. Even if it's not from said fan club.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're wasting your time. I was never actually interested in being in relationship with someone. The fact that I turned down Chazz and many others is proof of that. And you can ask Jasmine and Mindy too. They are the ones in fact who are boy crazy not me. Just ask how many times they tried to hoop me up with someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlair already asked them about Aldexis's love life. He knows they tried to get him in a relationship with someone, but after several unsuccessful tries, he outright told them to stop doing that. They still made a few more subtle suggestions at times, but there wasn't much success with that either. But there was one thing that the two noticed and thought of that upset Blair a little when she found out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You like Jaden don't you?\", asked Blair dryly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAldexis opened his eyes in surprise as a faint blush appeared on his face. On his chest, his growths became small, AA-cup breasts.</span></div></div>",

But I think it is kind of obvious at the moment that he stole your heart. Your friends already told me their input on your relationship. And trust me, as a maiden who has also been charmed by him, I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing on keeping his cool at the moment, Aldexis's blush was kept to a minimum, his cheeks not flushing too much. However, the idea of him having feelings for Jaden certainly made him quite nervous, the fidgeting of his fingers on his lap, a clear indicator of that. Also, his thoughts went for a second towards Jaden, particularly towards an image of him smiling and saying his trademark catchphrase. A pulling sensation at his groin however took him out of his brief daydreaming, trying to find a counterargument to Blair, as his testes were now slowly receding inside him as they grew a bit smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Like I said, they are the ones who are into pairing me up with someone. They just think that because I hang out with Jaden more often lately. I don't know if they told you this, but they were with this assumption ever since the first year as well. Just because I like spending time with him, that doesn't mean I like him as a boyfriend or anything. They most likely read the situation wrong, that's all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAldexis hoped that this was enough to settle the matter once and for all, as Blair should know by now that Jasmine and Mindy like to gossip quite a lot, thus she must know that they just told her something without any actual proof. But she was slightly unnerved when, despite frowning and giving out a small sigh, her expression didn't change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that. It is possible that they misunderstood the situation... That's why I went to talk with Atticus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAldexis couldn't help but widen his eyes, his nervousness level now going up, as his breasts became small B-cups, now being a bit visible through the uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While he said there is nothing concrete...\", continued Blair as she saw Aldexis's small blush a bit better, \"He said that without a doubt you want to be a couple with Jaden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAldexis's face became suddenly beet red, all attempts to cover how flustered he felt at the moment completely thrown out the window. He was ready to yell at Blair to stop with the teasing already, but with the risk of Chazz hearing them and them stepping into the conversation, he had to try very hard not to raise his voice too much. He was very grateful that Chazz apparently went into his pantry to look out for drinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you listening to the same guy who thought it would be a good idea for me to become a singer, and who has no issues having a far clingier fan club than I do, and who goofs out two thirds of the time we see?... I will tell you only once: I do not like Jaden!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the tension that was building up, Blair only gave out another sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said you would react like this. And before you explode or anything, let me say what he told me first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAldexis was ready to cut her out, but for the benefit of the doubt and to know why Atticus thinks he would want to be in a relationship, he decided to let her talk. But there was also another reason as to why he would let her speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while, he got these weird thoughts regarding Jaden... Even if he was said person in the beginning, his memories and reality changed so much to the point where everyone had to know Aldexis and Jaden were now different people... That's why his current thoughts were mostly of seeing Jaden in a different way than how he saw him before... Ways which at times made him faintly blush and become a bit flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was preparing for the possible explanation Atticus would give, his breasts grew to large B-cups as his manhood became smaller, anticipation now filling him.</span></div></div>",

After spending time with his fan club, and having about a dozen girls at the very least who wish to be his girlfriend, he began forming a few patterns I accordance to how girls act when it comes down to liking someone. It isn't anything concrete, but according to him, you fill the bill in having feelings for Jaden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just stupid! He only says he knows that by acting like some sort of womanizer. And the girls from the fan club tell him straight to his face that they like him! How am I in the same category as them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I admit, I had my doubts as well at first... But he has experience when it comes down to this sort of things. He was in a few relationships before, and he said that after spending time with his club, he found a few signs that proves you like Jaden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlair's expression became a bit angry, as she was now basically making Aldexis his love rival... But he respected him and acknowledged his aptitudes, and since making him aware was a direct request from Atticus, he decided to just tell him what he knows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, it's that feeling that you admire someone that becomes into full-blown affection eventually, especially if it is something deep. It isn't uncommon for respect to turn into love, and if the person is someone you wish to be like, that adds more fuel to the \"romance fire\" as he says. Secondly, it is desire to protect that certain someone. I know neither you or Jaden are weak, but Atticus is sure you at the very least want to repay Jaden for all the times he saved you. He said you wouldn't mind taking the blow, if it means putting him in a less risky position. There is also the thing of wanting to spend more time with him. I know I asked you to come here for a few practice Duels, but somehow I know deep down you also wanted to meet Jaden... There are a few other things that Atticus noticed about you.... But I am sure now you might have an idea of how things stand in your case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was quite a lot of information to process for Aldexis, but everything that Atticus pointed out turned out to be more or less true. This revelation made him stand with his mouth opened a little, his eyes wide opened, and the blush still dominant on his face. Inside his Deck, the last card that tied him to his previous persona, Winged Kuriboh became Cyber Angel Benten, one of the trademark cards from his Deck, as he suddenly became conscious of his emotions. To add to that, his breasts grew into C-cup range, but weren't done growing, as his testes were now completely pulled inside of him, changing function and producing more estrogen, which further amplified his beliefs of being a girl, as well as diminishing the size of his manhood once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I-Is it really true?\", asked Aldexis to himself. \"I-I mean... I know Atticus can be such a tease sometimes with me and Jaden being together as much as Jasmine and Mindy... But then why does he seem to know so much? Being my brother aside, how can he be so aware of my thoughts on Jaden? Is he really a relationship guru after all?... No, that's not what's important right now... Is it true...? I do respect him deeply, I want to make sure he doesn't get himself in trouble, be it school or something supernatural, and I do like spending time with him a lot... It's still a stretch, but what if it's true...? Also, Jaden didn't seem to have any interest in a girl or never saying he would like to be in a relationship... But that doesn't mean he isn't into girls or that he wouldn't like to date someone... Am I overthinking and I'm letting Atticus and Blair get in my head? Or do really like him...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could finish that line of thinking, he winced a little as a new flower bloomed between his legs, as his breasts grew one last time to D-cups. With everything done, the new girl tried to recompose herself, as the new, or rather familiar identity was complete. She was now Alexis Rhodes.</span></div></div>",

What I told you was more a favor to Atticus, rather than my own decision, but I suppose you had to know as well, given how close the two of you are. Whether Atticus was right or not, it depends on how much you actually you want to be a couple with him. I can only wish you luck if you want to try, but I can tell you I will not back down without a fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis was honestly surprised. Now that the blushing was mostly gone, she was now somewhat grateful to Blair and Atticus, even if she knew she will have a serious talk with her brother later on. This revelation really was like a back-up call, but she wasn't entirely sure if it really the same type of love Blair was having for him. Before he could think further though, Chazz finally returned with a few bottles in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry it took so long. I had to look through my selection a bit to choose the best one for this occasion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you really took your time? Did you drink a few bottles to know which one you should pick? I didn't know you are a soda tester this much.\", giggled Blair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it! The only reason it took so long is because I was looking for something that would fit your tastes! It's not my fault you are too young for the mature tastes my drinks have.\", said Chazz, smirking a bit at Blair's pout. \"Anyway, what were you talking about while I was away?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just some girl stuff. Things that wouldn't interest you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Yeah, it was quite an interesting one... Sorry Chazz, we can't tell you what we discussed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. But what I want to know is where is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the door opened, revealing Jaden, Syrus and Hasselberry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of the wolf. Where were you? The lessons passed a while ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys... Well, I had to take a nap after last night. I slept a little during class...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually most of the time...\", deadpanned Syrus .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And since not even Crowler bothered to wake me up, I kept sleeping. I felt awesome now after a good nap and we Dueled a little on our way here from the academy. Sorry if I kept you guys waiting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChazz sighed while the girls gave a little nervous laugh at the remark, while Jaden was blissfully unaware of what they were thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's good to have you here now... And since we are starting a new year in a few days, I thought it would be nice to have that little celebration we planned right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! You sure seem to already be ready like a soldier at morning call\", said Hasselberry as he looked at the bowl of snacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Anyway, let's just begin the party already. And don't eat everything allright? I need something for later as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlair giggled as Chazz wouldn't tell anyone that she was the one who filled the bowl as the boys sat next to them. The group then began their usual talk, adding the theme of wanting to know what will happen once the new students as well as the transfer students will arrive. Then it moves on to today's lesson, and to no one's surprise, Jaden wasn't even aware of the new Contact Fusion Deck, while the guys congratulated Alexis for the answers. A bit later, they began talking about Dueling, with Chazz and Blair having a Duel after a small argument, with Syrus and Hasselberry watching them, while Jaden and Alexis just relaxed on the sofa. Before Jaden could go to watch the Duel, Alexis took his attention by grabbing his jacket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong Lex?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I didn't mention before, but at the party for the Obelisk students I mentioned before, I was asked to offer some advice for some of the guys that will attend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Advice? Oh, you mean like a trainer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More or less. Actually, it is more like a teacher. When I Duel them on when they Duel someone else, I could give them a helping hand... Does it sounds too forced?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all. It sounds great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You mean it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. I mean, you're smart, you're great at talking with others, and if I remember, you did say you wanted to be a teacher. You're going to be awesome. I just know it. I makes me a bit jealous I am not a first year to be trained actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though he said it with his usual goofy smile, Alexis's cheeks gained a bit pink upon hearing his praise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jaden! Are you coming to see how I wipe the floor with Chazz?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm coming Blair! Let's go Alexis!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jaden went ahead, Alexis stopped a bit to contemplate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if it's truly love... But I guess I have a year to decide upon my feelings. Jaden really is a cool guy, no wonder Blair likes him... I wonder. Should I invite Jaden as a guest for the party? Even if he's a Slifer, lots of people would like to see someone as talented as him in action. I should talk with the girls about this later... I wonder how good we would do in a Tag Duel though...\", she wondered as she smiled a little, while she began looking at the Duel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Sadie told Dorothy about the white card that was brought today, and indeed it seemed to belong to the magician that came at the academy to perform. When he left, he told Dorothy to call him urgently if she would find the card he lost. After telling him the news, he told her he could come in a few days to pick it up, while she would put it somewhere safe. She didn't knew why he would want the card back so badly, but she guessed it was a personal belonging. She watched the magic show too, but didn't think much of the wishing cards, but there was something that she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If someone would find this, would they actually wish for something? The girls didn't say anything about a wish... Oh well, I guess they just might ask for something. Kids these days are truly hoping for miracles sometimes. I wonder what they wished for though...\"</span></div></div>",

Falling, falling, but not knowing where. \"Wh-where am i goiiiing WHAAA-...\" he said before he eventually blacked out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon waking, Syrus slowly opened his eyes while hearing a soothing voice saying \"..-up Syrus, wake up my dear\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-huh, where am i\" The blue haired boy said confused at where he was. He slowly opened his eyes to take in his surroundings. It was a grassy plain with a clear blue sky, but not much else. Then he noticed something. He was lying down face up and laying against something but he didn't know what. Looking down he saw  a pair of arms wrapped around his head, holding him caringly. What stood out the most though was that the arms had a pair of blue gauntlets attached to them with the hands sticking out, showing smooth white skin and long nailed hands coming out of them that hugged . Coming into realization he was being held by someone he turned around and looked up. He saw the girl of his dreams, the Dark magician girl.<br>\r\n\"Hi sleepyhead, good morning~\" Dark magician girl said.<br>\r\nAt this, Syrus was caught in a number of emotion, ranging from shock, surprise and infautation. \"WAAAAAGH, D-D-Dark magician girl. I-i'm sorry for touching you, i didn't mean it I...what am i doing here with you\" He said in a panic.<br>\r\nDark Magician girl simply stroked his hair with her hand. \"Its ok Syrus, calm down\". The gentle stroking of his hair by his adored duel monster girlfriend calmed the paniced boy down.<br>\r\n\"I brought you here. I was hoping you got my invitation and thankfully you did\" she said.<br>\r\n\"Invitation?...Oh, that card that shone that light\" Syrus said recollecting what happened.<br>\r\n\"Yes, i have brought you here with me to the duel monsters spirit world, where monsters from the game of duel monsters live in peace\" she explained. \"I've wanted to see you again\" she said happily. Syrus blushed at that, the red on his face clearly visible to the magician girl.<br>\r\n\"O-oh thanks but, why me\" he asked shyly. <br>\r\nShe carressed his head with her hands and brought her bright pink lips to his cheek and gave him a great big  smooch. \"Because i love, cherish, and ADORE you silly\" she said with great joy. Syrus was colored tomato red now as he was feeling very hot as he took in that he was kissed by the girl he most loved. After Syrus calmed down from his love daze she explained more why she loved him. <br>\r\n\"I know how you feel for me Syrus and the truth is i ADORE you as well\" she said.<br>\r\n\"W-well thanks but why\" he asked being humble of himself.<br>\r\nShe gave him her answer while caressing his cheek. \"Because out of all humans you are the most adorable, caring and kind. And frankly your small stature is what i love as well. \"She said while rubbing his cheek with her thumb. Syrus blushed feeling her soft thumb rub against his cheek, feeling her skin. She then moved her hand to brush his hair. Man did she LOVE his hair. To her it was as if she was touching a soft pillow. Syrus however, had a question pop into his mind. How was he able to feel her? He could touch her skin and feel her lips kiss his cheek but wondered why, assuming she was a hologram still. <br>\r\n\"Um Dark magician girl, i was wondering. How am i able to feel you kissing me. Aren't you a hologram\" Syrus asked. <br>\r\nShe anticipated he would ask that and said \"very simple my dear Syrus. I'm flesh and blood in my world. As real as you heehee~. No holograms here~\" she said cheerfully. It did make sense to Syrus seeing as he was clearly no longer in his own world.  <br>\r\n\"If you truely wish to confirm it, touch my hand\" she said. She held out her hand welcomingly, her fingers and palm awaiting Syrus' hand. Syrus put out his right hand and touched hers. It felt so warm and soft and heavenly to the boy. She wasn't kidding, her hand felt like real human skin like her lips felt like real human lips. She then put her left hand above his right hand, caressing it lovingly with both her hands. She grabbed his left hand and intertwined her fingers with his, he felt her soft skin embrace his own hand. \"These palms touching and fingers intertwining represent our love. Let us never be torn apart and be bonded forever in love Syrus\" DMG said as she let go of his hands and embraced him in a loving hug and passionate kiss. Syrus was definitely feeling her now. Her soft skin on her face nuzzling his cheek, her blonde luscious hair brushing on his face, her big round jiggling breasts pressing against his chest with the leather like fabric of her blue magician dress, and her lips, her juicy sweet lips that he was kissing. It was like tasting cherries. He loved the feel of his lips on hers as he returned her passionate kiss with one just as passionate. She felt like a real human girl. Syrus returned her embrace with one of his own as he put his arms around her, feeling her very long hair against his hand as she wrapped her legs and booted feet around his body in a pretzel, putting him in an embrace where her entire body surrounded the boy in a desire to love, protect and cherish him. They put their entire souls and hearts into their embrace and declaration of love.<br>\r\n\"I love you Syrus\"<br>\r\n\"I love you as well Dark Magician girl\" Syrus said as he drifted into his dreamy feelings of being with his crush.<br>\r\n\"Please, call me Mana\" she said in response while still hugging.<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\nAfter sharing their loving embrace they let go and Dark magician girl began explaining more on why she brought Syrus here. <br>\r\n\"There's another reason i brought you here Syrus\" she said. \"I've wanted to give you a gift\"<br>\r\n\"You see as a magician i have many powers. One i have learned to master is the power of shapeshifting\" she explained.<br>\r\n\"Shapeshifting\" he asked wondering what she meant.<br>\r\n\"Yes. You see i can change anyone into anything or anyone else. There's no limit to how much i can change\". She held out her hand and her wand poofed into existance. \"I can change mine or someone elses age, size, weight, even species and gender. I can even go as far as to make someone into a morphed amalgamation of things *giggle* she said giggling at her mischieviousness. <br>\r\n\"Well ok so, are you gonna change me\" Syrus asked Mana. \"You got it\" she said sticking out her tongue and winking in a silly way while pointing at the boy. \"I'm going to give you great power Syrus. But don't worry, if you don't like it i can exchange it for another shapeshift. I'll also be doing some surprise shapeshifts teehee\" she said again mischeviously. <br>\r\nSyrus nodded, ready to be morphed, though not sure about being surprised. <br>\r\n\"Ok get ready, here it comes\" Mana said happily as she lowered her head to Syrus and kissed him, her lips glowing pink as they pecked Syrus's.<br>\r\nIn an instant Syrus began to morph.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dark magician girl kissed Syrus's lips with her own as she enchanted them with a pink magical glow. (Syrus noted how sweet her lips tasted and how soft they felt, still in slight disbelief he could feel her).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmwwuah\" she said smooching Syrus hard on the lips, as the pink glow went from her lips to Syrus's and vanished within him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So uh, what happens now\" Syrus asked. Dark magician girl just looked at him with a grin with her arms crossed beneath her chest.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, Syrus felt a tingling sensation within himself. His entire body began to vibrate and shake as he suddenly got scared. \"Wha-whaaat's happeniiing\" he asked in a panic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDMG simply said. \"Syrus, you are very adorable and i love you, but i also love the thought of bending your form to my will like puddy. It's just a mischievous magician thing, nothing personal. So prepare to experience the life of a magical female\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-you are gonna turn me into a girl?\" He asked. She winked \"that's right\". Syrus could feel the changes coursing through him. A magical pink puff of smoke burst out of him as he first noticed a sudden large growth spurt, as he grew in height a whole 2 feet, becoming just as tall as many of the girl students at duel academy. Syrus began coughing up more and more pink smoke his body was self-producing as his voice became light and feminine.<br>\r\nHis growth spurt stretched his Ra yellow blazer and pants, pushing his shirt and blazer above his midriff which exposed his belly button. His arms lengthened and lost any and all hair on them and became smooth and soft as his hands became dainty and smooth with his fingernails growing to look like press on nails.<br>\r\nHIs legs grew very long as his pants stretched upwards in surrender to his new elongated limbs, making things a bit painful for his manhood. His thighs magically puffed up and became thicker, looking almost like two round chicken legs attached to a human torso as they threatened to tear his pants apart.<br>\r\nHe suddenly felt his manhood disappear as it was sucked into him and replaced with a clean new womanhood, making him more comfortable in his lower body and leaving his thighs with more room to move. His face began smoothening out its features as the smoke made his nose smaller, his lips bigger and pinker and his eyes have outstandingly long eyelashes. <br>\r\nSyrus felt a sense of pleasure as he leaned back as his hair was now growing and overflowing, cascading down his back as he grew new long light blue beautiful hair that didn't stop until it reached his feet. At the same time the most important and noticable change occured. His chest began pushing outwards, swelling into two large mounds that grew and swelled bigger and bigger into large jiggling breasts, the cleavage showing half of his new gigantic ample breasts from his stretched shirt and blazer. As they finished growing, they let out an audible *Boing* as they bounced around in his already stretched blazer to settle in their resting place, becoming just as big as the Dark magician Girl's own breasts.  For the finishing touch, his butt and hips grew and swelled greatly, slightly tearing his stretched pants. His butt expanded into a round jiggling bubble butt, pushing her now torn pants more upwards and his hips .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyrus had fully become a girl,  a well grown, well endowed teenage girl who was just as tall as the likes of Alexis, Jasmine and Mindy. \u201cHe\u201d was now a \u201cShe\u201d.<br>\r\nSyrus looked down at herself, she had blossomed into a beautiful teenage girl. It was as if her male form was just a cocoon and her female form was the butterfly that emerged from it. She looked down at her dainty smooth skinned arms and hands, her long fingernails sticking out as if she had a manicure while she wiggled her fingers. <br>\r\n\u201cWh-whaaaaa-why am i a girl and..my voice\u201d Syrus said hearing his new girl voice for the first time and putting a hand to her throat. It sounded even lighter and very soft and gentle. \u201cAnd i have...breasts\u201d Syrus said blushing a cute pink on her new girl face. She cupped her jiggling breasts in her smooth long nailed hands, the orbs showing off half their expanse with the cleavage showing. They felt big and slightly heavy. Did she really grow breasts this big? She remembered Alexis having huge knockers but never saw any this big.  She blushed even harder. She then felt something on her head, a lot of something. She grabbed handfuls of her now long flowing hair. \u201cM-my hair\u201d Syrus said as she pulled at a seemingly endless supply of hair, bringing the long strands in front her. She noticed her hair reached down her back all the way to the floor as she was sitting.<br>\r\nDark magicial girl looked in adoration at her work. Syrus was beautiful...no, gorgeous even. <br>\r\n\u201cEEEEEEEK\u201d the magician girl shrieked in joy. \u201cAAH-\u201d Syrus blurted out as she shrieked. Dmg observed her at the same time as she fawned over her. Syrus looked very timid, scared and nervous at becoming a girl, even more timid than she was before. Apparently turning into a girl had amplified her shyness tenfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH SYRUS YOU ARE SO GORGEOUS AND CUTE\u201d Dark magicial girl said as she rushed over and hugged the newly turned girl as she kissed her now softer cheeks repeatedly. \u201cUh Th-thank y-you\u201d Syrus said as he blushed after feeling her kiss and soft lips on her cheeks. She felt her breasts squish with Dark magician girl\u2019s. The sensation was making Syrus blush harder. <br>\r\nDmg felt the sensation as well and let go to observe Syrus\u2019 new breasts. \u201cOh my, it seems i added too much female growth energy to the spell\u201d she said giggling while covering her mouth. She observed Syrus. Her timid expression was so cute. The only thing of the old male Syrus left were his glasses, which she didn\u2019t mind as they made her look even cuter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyrus still sat, looking over herself and her new body with her huge breasts being the thing she noticed most, still not quite out of blushing when she sees them. She pokes and squeezes her breasts out of curiosity. She could feel her own skin being touched each time. Syrus couldn\u2019t get around it, she now owned an impressive pair of breasts. She was a girl inside and out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDark magician girl giggled at her curiosity towards herself. Then she noticed something else. Her clothes were no longer fitting on her. \u201cOh my, Syrus\u201d she says suddenly. Syrus perked up in attention to her sudden concerned look. \u201cYou\u2019re clothes don\u2019t fit anymore\u201d. Syrus looked down again and noticed this. \u201cU-uh y-yeah i guess they don\u2019t\u201d she said rubbing the back of her head.<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, i\u2019m about to give you a wonderful pair of clothes suited for a girl like yourself\u201d.She says and then she waves her wand and shoots a bright pink laser at Syrus. It zaps her and a pink puff of smoke bursts out of nowhere....</span></div></div>",

Next, his muscle tone increases greatly and he grows and extra foot, putting him at 6'7. We then see that his boots start to meld with his feet and turn into his new skin color and he now has dragon-like talons but not entirely while he has claws just like his talons. afterwards, his chest develops a 14 pack and his biceps start to grow and become shiny yet translucent with blue coloring. We then move to his back where it re-forms itself to look like he has folded wings although he dosnt, like a baby dragon and he started to grow a 3 foot long tail with a few spikes at the end, just like Stadust Dragon. And finally for his face, his nose gets a spike at the end, and a line runs up from it to a helmet like protrusion that resembled the top of Stardust Dragon's head came out from his hair, and on the side of his head, similar things form and pointed back, and his teeth become much bigger and sharper with fangs along with a lizard like tounge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Akiza, her outfit morphs into a rose dress that has small roots poking and weaving through her skin, it also had large vines flowing through the bottom and from the back. Areas of her skin then turned black, such as the majority of her legs, which resembled stockings, and from her hress up to her neck, which made it appear she were a leotard under the dress. Her height then went from 5'3 to 6'3 and her muscle tone only slightly increased although she did aquire a 6 pack and her breasts went up a cup size, but the dress concealed them. Her shoes then turned into talons with crimson nails, and from her arms, large rose petals bean to grow out and form wings while on her hands a crimson claw grew out from each finger, yet kept their human aspects. Her new wings could also retract and make it appear as if she had no wings, though would still be cover with rose petals. She also grew a long tail with thorns coming out of it from under the dress. Her teeth then spread further apart along with being sharper, and in her hair sprouted a flower on top and replaced her metal hair piece, and her two from bangs started to become covered in rose petals, and two more of them grew out from the flower and went down her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this, the light faded, the card disapeared, and the two fell to the floor being unconcious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhen they awoke, they were still their new selves. \"Ugh... My head. What the heck just happened?\" Yusei grunted with an echo. Akiza sat up with alot of difficulty due to her dress but she managed and spoke with an elfish voice, \"I dont know... Ahhh! you look like your monster!\" and she fell back. Yusei had a similar reaction when he saw Akiza, though didn't say anything, since he knew how sensitive she was to the word.

He also now wore black gloves were elbow length and thigh high socks of the same color and red high heeled pumps. Just as Akiza was now dressed, but her clothes were more dirty.<br>\r\n-Whoa, you look great in those- she said amazed.<br>\r\n-I thought so too- he said blushing a bit.<br>\r\n-You can keep it, it really fit you better than me.

She undressed and put on the shirt, but it was hard to put on with her giant breast in the middle.<br>\r\n-These clothes look so good and I can't wear then... maybe if I take off my bra it would fix.<br>\r\nAnd with that the she put the shirt without problem.<br>\r\nThen she saw Yusei shorts \"with his skirt he couldn't wear that.. maybe I should try them\".

How'd I get here?\" he questioned out loud, though since he appeared to be alone, he received no answer. \"And just where is here, anyway?\" he said. As he turned his head, he saw that behind him was a larger window. And looking out of it, he discovered that he was definitely no longer in New Domino anymore, as he saw what was unmistakably the Eifel Tower! \"How did I end up in Paris?\" he questioned wth surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked ut the window, he noticed something odd about his reflection in the glass. His marker wasn't there, and it looked like he had make up on his face, as well as a teardrop shaped piece of jewlery on his forehead. He also saw that what he could see of his refection below the neck seemed off, so he backed up a bit and took a look downward, and was met with a second surprise. He was dressed completely different, and now wore a red spaghetti strap shirt and a long white skirt that was wraped so that it showed of part of his legs in the front. On his feet were a pair of silver 4 inch stiletto heels, and on his arms were a pair of white elbow length gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just whats going on here?\"</span></div></div>",

Before Yusei could say anything about the situation, he man had already began soeaking to him. \"Ah, here you are, Misty.\" he greeted him as he approached himBe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Did he just call me Misty?' Yusei thought in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're looking beautiful, as always. But thats to be expected of Misty Tredwell.\" he said to Yusei. \"I just wanted to let you know that its almost time for the photo shoot today, so we need to get going soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He thinks I'm Misty?' Yusei thought to himself. He knew Misty Tredwell, of course. She was currently one of the world's top fashion models and also a friend and aquaintance of his. Luna was also a fan of hers. She kept in contact with Akiza and Carly regularly through postcards and such, so he knew that she had been in Paris for a while. But this was still so strange. Somehow, he had seemingly switched places with her; and he was now somehow living her life, though he was still himself physically. 'It must have been that card...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready, Misty?\" the man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I guess I should go along with things for now.' he thought to himself. Misty was a friend, and he didn't want to mess up her life. \"Yes.\" Yusei told the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. The limo is waiting for you by the hotel's entrance.\" he said as he headed out o the room with Yusei following. And though Yusei didn't seem to notice it at the moment, he now appeared to be walking with a new, and more feminine gait. He was now unconciously walking the same way that Misty did.</span></div></div>",

As he approached it, a man standing near the lim opened one of the doors near the back for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Yusei said to the driver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its no trouble at all Ms. Tredwell.\" the driver replied. Yusei couldn't help but feel weird being addressed as such.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei entered into the Limo and the driver closed the door behind him as he took a seat, while the manager and driver sat up front, leaving him to himself for now. Not that Yusei minded. He wanted to be alone for a bit so that he could think about his situation. This whole situation was just so strange. Even stranger than any of the other weird events that had happened to him in the past. Here he was, now somehow living the life of another, and a female at that. And even though he was clearly male, as a quick inspection confirmed, people still seemed to believe that he was a woman. His physical features hadn't beem changed in the slightest, and yet here he was, with people still believing he was Misty. And if he was here living Misty's life, then where was Misty? Was she back in New Domino City, similarly living his life in his place? And if so, was she as confused as he was?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe also couldn't help but notice the bilboards and other such advertisements as the limo drove through the streets of Paris. Advertisements featuring Misty were very common, and he had seen more than a few of them in New Domino City. But just like he seemed to have replace Misty in her life, he had also replaced her in the pictures on the bilboards. He recognized several as ones he had seen before, only with him in Misty's place, and in the same poses. Even his facial expression in the pictures mirrored the ones Misty had when he had seen them. He really had somehow replaced Misty as her. This also reminded him that he was now a fashion model for as long as he was Misty. He didn't know how he was going to get through all of this. And it was strange, as though he still looked like himself, he was still somehow considered a very beautiful woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything about all of this was just so sureal and strange.</span></div></div>",

He still found this all so strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked at himself in the mirror, his keen eye for details instantly picked up on something strange: His posture was different. Instead of how he would usually stand, it seemed more... elegant, graceful, and feminine. Deciding to test something, he walked away from the mirror, then turned around and walked towards it one more. He watched as the steps he took were graceful, with one foot in front of the other, and his hips swung with each step. He wasn't putting any thought into the actions, just walking forward. His actions were completely unconcious, like he was used to walking this way and it was a force of habit. Yusei sighed. \"I guess I somehow acquired some of her mannerisms as well, and they've replaced my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, there was a knock at the door, and Misty's manager announced it was him, and Yusei gave him permission to enter.</span></div></div>",

We're almost ready for you.\" the manager annouced his presence. \"We've brought everything you need to wear for todays shoot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come in.\" Yusei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the door opened, and the manager entered once more, and was followed by a woman who wheeled in a rack with several outfits hanging on it, and a few boxes on its bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be waiting right outside once you're ready and I'll show you the room where everyone is waiting.\" he told Yusei before exitting with the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndressing out out of his current attire, he stripped down and saw he was wearing a pair of lacy panties and a matching bra that seemed to fit him perfectly despite his flat, male chest and having nothing to support, as if it had been made specifiaclly for him. He then slipped off the high heels and neatly folded the clothes he had taken off. He then headed over to the clothing rack. Everything had a number on it, so it was easy to figure out what they wanted him to wear first. The first was a simple black spaghetti strap dress that would give people a good look at cleavage if he had any breasts to begin with. To go with it, there was a pair of matching black heels and white stockings. With a sigh, he reluctantly put everything on. Everything fit him perfectly, though he wasn't surprised at this point. Once done, he exittid the room. \"I'm all set.\" Yusei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, follow me.\" And the two of them walked a few doors down. Entering, he saw a few people, lights, and a white backdrop all set up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty! Its lovely to see you again. Its always a pleasure working with you.\" a man greeted Yusei as he entered the room. \"Anyway, lets get this show started! You know what to do from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei walked over to the backdrop, thinking about what he was going to do now. As he was worried about what to do next, he suddenly realized that he knew exactly what he was doing, and everything he was supposed to do. As if he had been doing this his entire life, he put one foot directly forrward in front of the other, and put one hand on his hip and smiled for the camera. The photographer then took a picture of it, and Yusei switched to another pose as he bent over slightly and brought his hand up to his hair to brush a lock out of his face. After the photographer took a picture of that pose, he switched to a pose where he stood to the side, but turned his head to face the camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPose after pose, he seemed to find every action natual, and he beyond the poses, he also knew many other aspects of the modelling world, such as various fashions. Afraid of what this meant, he thought about how Duel Runners worked, and various other mechanical and technoloical things. While he had once been very gifted in those fields, none of it was making any sense to him at the moment. 'So on top of her mannerisms, I've also got her talents, skills and knowledge pertaing to them. And as for my own...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, he was done. \"Thats all we need for this outfit, Misty. You did great as always!' the photographer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\" Yusei replied, still uncomfortable about this situation.</span></div></div>",

He hung the black dress up, and looked for what they wanted him to wear next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he found it, he began putting it on. It was a yellow, floral print sundress, and a white sun hat to go with it. He then slipped on a pair of shoes with a low heel to complete the ensemble. Once he had several photos taken in that, he returned to to the dressing room, and this time put on a red cocktail dress and a pair of white gloves, and a matching pair of red heels. After that, a lght blue evening gown was used in the next photos. After that, he was on his final outfit, which was a white halterneck dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring each photos, he continued to pose perfectly, all the while thinking about how strange this was. He had seen himself in the mirrors in the dressing room, and he thought he had looked ridiculous in each outfit. And yet, other people seemed to think he looked beautiful, as he had overheard a few males whisper to each other how attractive they thought he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he had finished the last set, he returned to the dressing room, and undressed once more before putting on the clothes he had came here in.

All he could recall of his cards were his most commonly used ones, such as Stardust Dragon, Junk Warrior, and the ones that anyone could tell you were the ones he was known for.

Brushing the thought off for now, he stepped into a pair slippers near the bed, and headed out to kitchen. Looking around, he spotted a fancy kettle, and decided that he would make some tea. Once done, he enjoyed a cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then went back into the room and took off the nightgown he had slept in. He then put on a matching lace bra and panty set. Then he looked through his clothing for something to wear... Wait, no, this was all Misty's clothing, not his. He wondered why he had briefly thought of them as his own. Resuming looking for something to wear, he settled on a light green dress. And after that, slipped on a white cardigan, and then slipped his feet into a pair of green heels. Once dressed, he took a look at himself in the mirror, but felt something was missing, and took a seat at the vanity. Noticing the makeup, without giving it much thought, he began to expertly apply a foundation, followed by some blush, eye liner and mascara, and some lipgloss. Once done, he admired his handiwork for a moment before he realized what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the other skills that he had gained from Misty, he wasn't surprised how he had known how to apply the makeup. What did surprise him though was why he had done it. He had thought he would look better with it, and from there, he just started aplying it all. Even now after he had regained himself a bit, he still thought that he did indeed look better with the makeup. He also did like what he was wearing, which at the time, he hadn't given much thought to putting on, but realized that did like the way he looked. He even had to stop himself from doing a spin so he could see the back. \"Am I starting to get a bit of Misty's personality as well?\" he wondered aloud. This was even more of a reason that he had to find a way to return to normal.</span></div></div>",

Since the card was not in his room or back at the garage, he didn't really know where else he should search. And there was no call from Misty or Akiza, which meant they didn't find it either. But given he swapped places with Misty specifically, that gave him an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I should look at the places Misty usually goes. It's not much, but it is more plausible it would be somewhere she would be familiar with. I doubt it would have ended in a random place in this massive city.\" It wasn't much, but it definitely would beat searching every nook and cranny of Paris. Not to mention that it wouldn't really make sense for it to be in an unrelated location to either of the people affected. But there was another problem. \"Misty is a renowned celebrity though, and I doubt I will have time to look around if I am going to have to deal with her fans. But I don't want to take the limo, it would be too strange to ask the driver to take me everywhere I should go. Maybe I could take her own car and be on my own for a bit to clear my head... I guess this is one of the drawbacks of being famous. I wonder if other models go through this as well.\" Yusei spoke those words almost like it came from his experience, although he knew that it was once again because his and his friend's personalities were overlapping once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, Yusei got out of his room and began going downstairs for breakfast. On the way, his phone vibrated from inside the green designer pursed he took with him. Pulling it out, he saw that his manager told him that he would be free today, but the designers would leave some swimsuits to try out for tomorrow's summer shoot. This made him sigh a little in relief remembering the many dresses he had to wear the previous day. \"At least now I have more time to look around. It sure is brutal being a model...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was having a light breakfast, Yusei couldn't shake off the weird feeling that persisted ever since he woke up. His body simply felt a little odd, and he couldn't tell why. He looked at himself several times already, but there were no visible changes that would indicate something was different. While there were no physical changes, Yusei noticed his mannerisms were becoming more womanly, from his smaller bites and slower chewing speed to his eating preferences, the usual full breakfasts he usually being replaced with a only a fruit salad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing eating, he went down to the main lobby to talk with the receptionist. Upon seeing him, they greeted him with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning Ms Tredwell, you must be here for your car, aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I decided I should take a drive around the city... But how did you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your manager already told us you would be free today, and normally you would go to you favorite relaxation spots on your own to cool down a little after long days of work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks you... Say, can you give me the addresses of some of these places... The GPS didn't work too well recently, and I don't really know the streets too well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course. Even I get lost times. It takes to time to memorize all the roads, and without the GPS it could get a bit tricky at times. Please wait a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thanking the receptionist, he finally went outside to see a vintage and elegant white car being brought by the valet. It certainly suited Misty quite well as even the interior was really nice without looking tacky. As he walked, he once again noticed the swaying of his hips, which made him groan a little inwardly. \"I can't seem to stop doing that... I can't stop acting like Misty and everything feels more natural by the minute I need to find the card fast.\" Once Yusei thanked the valet, he got inside the car and began going on the main road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, the card continued working its magic on Yusei and Misty, continuing to shift their minds to fit the other's place. And with the changes progressing smoothly, it could now begin its next phase. After all, they couldn't fit their new positions by only switching their lives and habits.</span></div></div>",

There sure are a lot of places Misty frequented, although these might just be the whole list of the places she went to rather than her usual hang-out spots. I am still surprised the guy at the hotel just told me all of these places like I didn't know them even if supposedly I should. He even gave me a description of the places... Maybe whatever that card did made a slip somewhere down the line, or maybe it made whoever thinks I am Misty to give me info on what I don't know...\", mused Yusei as he continued to drive. It felt a little odd to be behind the wheel of a regular car instead of a D-Wheel, but he couldn't really complain right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he thought of where exactly he should go, his body began changing to accommodate Misty's role. His muscles tingled as they were slowly losing their definition. Before, he had quite a toned figure and he was considered to be in the same group as Jack and Crow, if he were to believe Leo's words. But now, his frame was diminishing rapidly and his muscle mass was gradually withering away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I should go and check out a few of the shops first... It's not much, but I doubt it would be at an art gallery or a restaurant when they are so many people around. If it happened in public, it should have affected more people, and perhaps Akiza may have had some immunity since she was a Signer and only I got hit because I was the one holding the card... I may be looking too deep into this, but if this would have happened in a changing room, it would sound more plausible... Maybe I should head to the one she frequents the most.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put on the address on the GPS, without noticing his hand slimming down as he did that, and then followed the direction to reach the destination. As he continued to drive, he tapped his fingers on the steering wheel, his fingers growing longer and daintier while he gained a manicure. Yusei looked at the window, admiring the architecture of the city, and the various shops that were right next to the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a shame that I can't really have the luxury to go and look around town for a bit. I could check out some of the stores Sherry went to buy parts for her D-Wheel... and maybe look at where she bought some of her dresses...\" The last part he thought once again made Yusei sigh, as the feminine parts of his mind were once again working against him. However he didn't bothered him as much as before, getting used a little to these impulses. He didn't know that this was a sign he was getting used to another lifestyle entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body continued to vibrate without his notice until his frame became thin and lithe, with his arms and legs looking a lot slimmer than before. The yellow streaks from his hair also disappeared, leaving it pure black. As for his mind, the elements of Misty's life were overshadowing his own, but in the process, some of the earlier memories of his past such as his childhood living in Satellite were slowly being erased.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a peaceful ten minute drive and passing through the Champs Elysees Boulevard, where Yusei couldn't help but be slightly mesmerized of the various shops on the street for a few seconds, before groaning inwardly at letting Misty's tendencies take over again, he reached his first destination. It was a small, discrete shop that was at the edge of the boulevard, in a more secluded area, but judging from the elegant exterior of the building, he assumed it was one of the more expensive shops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This has to be it, right? \"L'allure de diamants\"... It looks fancy, but nothing too gaudy by the looks of it.\", noted Yusei as he stepped out of the car. He once again noticed his feminine walk, which at this point felt almost natural, and thus decided to simply ignore it for now. What he didn't know was that his feet became as petite as his hands, fitting better into his footwear while his calves slimmed down and became a lot curvier too. While they maintained a level of athleticism, they now looked a lot more feminine than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon entering the shop, Yusei was immediately taken aback. Not only did the place looked bigger on the inside, but there was a lot of variety in what was on display. Dresses, cardigans, blouses, jackets, skirts and even underwear and swimsuits. This place was a lot more packed than he thought it would be, the clothing options definitely outclassing the stores in Satellite. As for the customers, there weren't that many women around, but he noted that all of them were dressed rather stylishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Miss Tredwell, I wasn't expected you so early in the morning.\" Yusei turned to see a young woman in her twenties with brown eyes and short black hair styled in a bob cut coming up to him. Her friendly smile and casual approach made her look like she was one of Misty's acquaintances than only a mere clerk. To prove that, he already knew her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Annette. Sorry if I dropped unannounced, but I wanted to ask you a favour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please go ahead Ms Tredwell, tell me what are you here for. Is it a new sundress? We still haven't brought the model you asked for, but we did receive some new ones which might interest you. And I can assure you, all of them highlight your skin perfectly, just as you would want from a summer dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei's skin tone lightened as it also became hairless and softer. He took note that it belt a bit colder now that his body was hair-free but paid really no mind to it as he replied back to Annette. \"Thanks, but it's not that. I was wondering if you found a card here since the last time I came over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A card? As in a Dueling card? Did you by any chance dropped it here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not sure. That's why I wanted to ask if you or someone else found it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... I have to ask if someone saw a card or not. Please wait a few minutes until I return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Annette. I appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it. In the meantime, look around if something catches your eye. We have plenty of new clothes brought in and perhaps you might see something you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei nodded and let the young woman leave to ask her colleagues. He wanted to tell her a bit more about the card itself, but for some reason the details of it were getting a bit cloudy in his head. He brushed it off with him thinking that it's just him being tired from acting like Misty, unaware that his mind was being reworked.</span></div></div>",

Akiza might like a few of the clothes that are here maybe I can ask Misty to help me buy something for her when all of this is over.\", thought Yusei as he began looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shop certainly had diversity as a key quality. Yusei didn't often frequent clothing stores in the past, as he never thought of changing his wardrobe too often and if he really needed, he could ask Jack for some tips, given his former expensive way of living, which unfortunately transitioned into the current one. As for women's clothes, he had almost no experience in that department. Sally didn't bother going to anywhere else but at second-hand stores, which while the prices were smaller than usual, he couldn't really call hat they had on display as \"high-quality\". This time however, he could tell that the dresses, shirts and so on were made with the utmost care and used rare or expensive materials to be made. He would normally feel very lost in such circumstances, but for once, he had to thank for having Misty's experience, as he could better tell the value of the designer clothes than ever before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of searching, his gaze fell onto a red off-the-shoulder silk dress that covered the chest, but revealed a bit of the back. Yusei had to admit, even if he wasn't a fashionista, it still looked really good. \"This really looks something Akiza might like. It is a bit fancier than what she usually has, but I can see putting this on for special occasions. It even has the same color as her hair and is not too revealing. I am sure it's expensive, but I think I can ask Misty to split the bill if possible. I have some money at home saved for more spare parts, but I think there's enough for my share...\" He began to move towards towards the rack to examine it further, but the second he did, his vision became a little blurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed a few moments to regain his bearings because as quickly as it came, his sight came back to normal just as fast. \"What was that? Did something get in my eyes? I don't... Huh?\" Yusei was a little confused when he saw that the dress he picked up wasn't red, but rather green, unaware that the shade of his irises changed into a lighter shade of blue. \"There was a green one too? I haven't noticed it before... Well, maybe I should put it back, this color doesn't suit Akiza that well. Although... It still looks pretty...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something that made Yusei not want to put down the dress, as he continued to look at it and touch the soft texture in his smaller hand, almost like he was in a trance. A small voice in his head told him: \"You should try it on and see if it suits you.\", but he was reluctant to do so. But even if he was a man, everyone around him still thought of him as being a woman, so would it really be that wrong for him to wear it, especially after the photoshoots? He had to admit that the voice was right in a way, but he didn't want to change into other clothes again, remembering the embarrassment from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, his earlier memories of his life in Satellite shifted with him no longer living on the streets, but in a spacious suite without any major hardships happening in his childhood and he grew a vague sense of brotherhood with a figure which didn't resemble  Jack or Crow, but the bond between him and said boy seemed to be more familial... His now fully back hair, which no longer had any of his yellow highlights began to flatten out, the previously unique hairstyle changing to a more normal one as it also began to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was snapped out of his trance when he heard a ringing sound from his purse. Putting the dress back on the rack, he picked up the phone to see who it was.</span></div></div>",

There was also another emotion that began to bud in his heart when her name was brought up, but thinking nothing of it and brushing it off as another impulse, he answered the call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello. Yusei, are you free right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I am Akiza. Did you find the card by any chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunately, no. We've looked everywhere, including race track and Leo and Luna's place, but it wasn't anywhere. We've pretty much exhausted the location you could have gone recently before you disappeared, and it wasn't anywhere. It means the card must be there with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it is, I didn't find it yet. Today however I managed to get some free time to check the places Misty usually goes to. By the way, is she there to help?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at the moment. Jack and Crow picked her up and took her to practice a few laps. With how everyone is thinking she is you, she didn't really have much time for herself, but I've kept her company and she seems to adjust better by the looks of it. When she first came she was almost overwhelmed, but after I told her about you, she began to get into stride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like she's lucky she has you there for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we didn't talk much after she left, but I am happy we caught up. She's surprisingly a pleasant company.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei smiled a little hearing that the two were on much better terms than before. After all that happened with the Dark Signers and clearing up the mess Sayer made in regards to Misty's brother, it was nice to see the two young women finally be friendly with each other, even if the circumstances that they managed to talk with each other again weren't really ideal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring their talk, Yusei ignored a faint tingle on his face, as it began to morph. His masculine features softened with his eyelashes extending, his nose becoming smaller and his lips plumping up into a natural cupid's kiss. Without noticing, a new question came up in his brain, that he felt an urge to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's your opinion of her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of Misty? She is in my opinion a great person that I believe is very strong for being able to move on past her inner demons and I am happy I got to know her a bit better. I am really grateful that she forgave me for my mistakes which put her brother in peril and I really wish we could get along...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis smile grew a bit wider as his cheekbones rose higher on his now feminine face as a small fluttering sensation developed in his chest, as his visage now resembled resembled a certain model's. He didn't know why, but he seemed to value Akiza's opinion a lot more than before for some reason...\"I am sure you two are going to get along just fine. You may even become best of friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope so. I'll call you back if I find something. Hope you have a great day Yusey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You -ahem- too Akiza. Bye.\" After ending the call, he paused a little. It wasn't how high pitched his voice sounded at the end which threw him off, his Adam's apple receding quite a bit in the process, but the way Akiza addressed him. \"Did she pronounce my name a bit differently? No, it could be just my imagination... Although, maybe I should have asked her if Misty was also behaving like me or not... Well she said she was \"adjusting\", but perhaps it could be that she's used to act out like someone else. Maybe I should call her later and ask her to let Misti on the phone.\", thought Yusey to himself as he too pronounced the model's name a bit differently.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Checking the footage on the security camera, we didn't see you drop any card, nor did we find someone turn it up to us ever since you last came here. I apologize for not being able to help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Annette, I understand. Truth be told, even I am not sure where I dropped it. I just thought this place as one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry for getting into business that mind not involve me, but what kind of card are you looking for exactly? Is it one from your deck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... can say that. It is a pretty new addition though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. But do you have any matches scheduled? I didn't think you had time since you seemed to be very busy lately. I find it a little hard to believe you could have the opportunity to duel so soon after the day you had your shoot. Did your agent finally let the leash loose a little?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, not quite, it's just I need to find it as soon as possible...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring their conversation, Yusey's body changed further, as his slim frame became even smaller as his shoulders rounded out and his waist started to pull in. He also lost a few inches, making him as tall as Annette, if not slightly taller, although some of the height difference could be attributed to his heels. As for his mind, it got a bit cloudier when it came down to remembering about the card that he described. It was obvious that telling the whole story behind it was a sure hit to have the woman in front of him either laugh or look at him suspiciously, but he had quite the bit of trouble giving her even the basic details about it. And yet, he didn't seem nowhere as concerned about finding it as he was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly dear, you should try and convince them to have a break every now and then. I know very well how busy the life of a model is, but it wouldn't be too difficult for them to squeeze in more free days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but these last few days have been so hectic and I have scheduled another shoot tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another reason to ask for a small vacation later on. You said that after that gala the next month things would quiet down a little. Why not take that chance to go and visit that boy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, the one you said you met a while ago, when you were abroad. I don't remember his name, but you said you wanted to see him again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusey looked at her oddly, as he didn't know what he was talking about. So far, there wasn't anything in Misty's memories about her having a boyfriend, although it could be just Annette jumping to conclusions. And yet, there was an air of excitement that wouldn't go away the more he thought about it. It felt similar to the strange sensation he felt when talking to Akiza, but slightly stronger. He didn't seem bothered by it though. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis waist compressed down to a waspish size as well, making him appear even slimmer than before while at the same time, his pelvis suddenly widened, as his hipbones popped outwards. The clothes which before were tailored to his masculine frame shrunk down together with him, as they began to look more and more normal on his changed body. They also started to feel better on him, the idea of them being something that he would normally wear entering his brain at the same time.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not to mention that it wasn't really something on top of the priority list right now. Even if he somehow gained some of Misti's feelings about her boyfriend, he thought it would be easy to suppress them, given that so far there wasn't any issue in controlling his emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will talk about this later. For now I need to leave and keep searching. I hope you don't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all Ms Tredwell. I hope by the next time you'll visit us, we would have received your dress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick goodbye, Yusey left the shop and went to the car, finding his new womanly way of walking more bearable. It still was upsetting he was getting used to shaking his hips so much, but he decided he should ignore it, as it would be too problematic to keep worrying over his mannerisms at this point. He didn't know that the reason he couldn't revert back to the old way he walked was because his pelvis stretched out, making his regular walk a bit uncomfortable before switching to the more feminine stride without him even thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the car, Yusey went to check on the list of places he wrote down. \"Hmm... So it's not here... Now that I think about it, Annette said she didn't see me... I mean Misti drop the card on the camera so I doubt it would be in places where the security would have notified my if they found it. I guess that takes the art gallery and the other stores from the equation...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he went through the list, Yusey had an increasingly hard time making the difference between himself and Misti, with him thinking he was in her shoes for more than just the small amount of time he did after being transported to Paris. Once again however, he chalked it up to her memories overshadowing his, and didn't thought much about it, unaware that his own memories weren't suppressed, but actually erased. More of his childhood in the slums was replaced with a more comfortable way of living, his younger years now being mostly peaceful and uneventful. There was also the slight nag of him having a sibling, so far it was a pretty subdued feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, his hair grew quite a bit, with his now silky black locks reaching below his shoulders. It also became straighter with two longer bangs starting to frame his face and another two lengthening in the front, slowly covering some of his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Could it be at one of the caf\u00e9s or restaurants? I doubt I could have left it behind there without a waiter noticing... I could try looking at a few of them though, although I don't want to go each and every one of them...Hm?\" As he looked down at the paper, he saw that there was an hour marked next to one of the locations as well as a few notes mentioning that he had an appointment there today. \"Huh? I don't remember writing this down? Did the receptionist say something about it and I didn't notice?\", wondered Yusey to himself as he looked again at the place he had to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He doubted Misti would just tell someone something like this so causally, but given how friendly he was it wasn't outside the realm of possibility that she might have dropped that information during one of their conversations prior to the switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd... But it is one of the places the card could have gone to. And cine it's the only one underlined from the list as well, maybe her muscle memory took over again. Maybe it was there from the start and this would be Misti's way to tell me that?... Well, I don't have anything to lose at this point, so I might as well head there to see if I have any luck...\", said Yusey to himself as he put on his belt and began driving. It didn't click to him however that he didn't input any address in GPS as the location of the spa embedded itself into his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe road also seemed more familiar to Yusey as he continued driving, getting more comfortable with being behind the wheel of Misti's car while his experience with driving a D-Wheel gradually vanishing from his head. Meanwhile, his hair continued to grow, getting to his upper back and kept lengthening. Yusey however didn't think there was anything off about it when he briefly gazed at his mane in the mirror. Actually, it seemed to be shorter to him than it should be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ignored the view from outside, including many landmarks such as Eiffel Tower which could have been seen in the distance for a few seconds, however as he kept thinking about what Annette said at the end. He didn't seem to mind what potential boyfriend he... no, Misti had, but it seemed like it bothered him quite a bit now. It made him feel something akin to what he felt when he was on the phone with Akiza, but slightly stronger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up with me? Why did that stick with me?... There wasn't any talk about Misti liking someone when I was modeling. Her manager didn't know or he didn't approve of it?... Still, there wasn't any gossip in any of the tabloid magazines I've read about a potential lover, just some talk of how her perfect partner would be like... But I have a feeling I know who he would resemble...\" More of Yusey's mind changed as the feeling of butterflies in his stomach made him blush a little, unaware that his already washboard flat torso started to cave in. His sides pressed inwards, which caused him a bit of discomfort, which he ignored without much thought, as his waist continued to compress down to a waspish size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still... Why do I feel something like that for Akiza too? Am I homesick already and I wish to see her again? Or is it because of something else...?\" Yusey was so absorbed by his thoughts that he almost didn't look at the road properly, before widening his eyes and stopping right that second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He breathed in relief as he shook his head at the blunder he was about to commit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was way too close... What is with me today? I've been absent-minded almost the entire morning and I've had these weird thoughts too... Am I getting too on edge about this? Nothing bad happened ever since I got here and other than the loaded schedule there wasn't really any problem. Maybe the spa appointment is what I needed after all. Maybe that will calm my head a little.\", mused Yusey as he closed his eyes to clear his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know that by doing this, his worries and confusion over not just today, but the entire time he spent in Paris over his situation to vanish, his anxiety over living someone else's life being replaced with the sensation that there was nothing out of the ordinary with what he has been doing, the idea of him being a model not sounding so ridiculous to him anymore. In addition, the amount of time spent in France seemed to have extended for him, from just a few weeks to almost an entire year, enjoying the fact he got back into modeling after so long. Yisey's memories got a bit murky when he tried to remember what happened before getting to Paris, but figured that whatever the reason was, it had to do most likely with his hiatus. In this time, Yisey's hair finished growing, the black mane reaching his lower back while it styled itself in the front, longer bangs framing his face and covering his ears while the small bangs that grew in the front arranged themselves to come down diagonally before stopping right above his brows, perfectly showing the small blue jewel on his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter calming down a little, Yisey decided he should just ignore the weirdness for today and to relax a little. It was perhaps one of the few free days he had lately after such a busy schedule in which he could have some time for himself. And if it wasn't tied to the card he had to find, there was no reason to get agitated since he was in no rush to find it, given he was slowly adjusting to his work. Too bad he didn't really remember what the card he had to find was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he waited at the light, he looked better around his surroundings for the first time since he jumped in the car, a small smile coming to his features as he say the people enjoying the sunny day. His sight lingered for a few seconds on a family, specifically at the two younger siblings the parents had and how happy they were. It reminded him of the days past, when he was spending time with his brother figure in his vision and also thinking about his desire to start a family one day too. But before he could ask himself where these thoughts were coming from, he spotted something in the corner of his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...\" He saw a billboard which featured him as Misty Tredwell once again, but rather than normally seeing his face, he saw Misty's instead, albeit with his own criminal mark on her face. \"Does this mean... the spell is being undone? Then maybe things would be solved on their own. I must call Akiza and tell her...\" His gaze became unfocused as he clutched his head. Both on his face and on the billboard the jagged criminal mark that marred his features slowly disappeared leaving behind only smooth and healthy skin behind as his gaze refocused. \"Strange... That sure came out of nowhere... Perhaps this is a sign I need to unwind.I never thought I was so tired... What did I want to call Akiza? I think it can wait until after the appointment. I feel like it is something important, but if it is urgent she will call me...\", said Yisey to herself as she started up the car once she saw the light turn green. \"But honestly, they need to change the photo on those billboards. They are starting to get a little old. I could swear I saw myself with a mark on my face... I sure hope it was just my imagination... Even if it was graffiti, it would give the paparazzi all the reason to create make-up stories again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he sighed, he didn't know that his image was as flawless, as it perfectly matched his own look. It seemed however that he didn't realize that he shouldn't have any issue even if he had a mark, given that only he would see something was wrong...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After another 20 minutes of driving and looking at the Parisian life around him Yisey finally reached the spa, located towards the outskirts of the city center, on a small hill that overlooked the town. The place looked very modern, with a small sign which read \"Small Paradise\" in French in front of the establishment. Despite being the first time he came here, Yisey felt the place was familiar to him. But rather than chalking it up as another influence from Misty's memory, he actually now believed he visited the place before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I may have arrived a bit earlier than I was scheduled, but this should be fine. I got time to ask about the card I was looking for... Although for some reason I can't really remember what was it called... I know I parted with it some time ago and that this last week was quite hectic, but it is a little strange that I can't recall its name... Still, it's not like I am in a hurry...\", said Yisey as he went out of his car, the sense of urgency he had before disappearing completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he strode towards the building, he casually swayed his hips as he walked, no longer questioning the feminine gait at this point as it felt natural for him to walk this way. His wider hips also started to look less bony as they got some mass on them, his underwear feeling better against his privates. Speaking of his panties they continued to morph throughout the day to better fit the physical changes that Yisey went through, but now they started to get a bit tighter around his manhood, starting to show the faint outline of a bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, he noticed the d\u00e9cor immediately. It looked both fancy and elegant at the same time white and green being the dominant collars, the occasional placement of some plants in the room giving it a \"greener\" vibe while the light green couches in the waiting room next to some of them perfectly complimented the atmosphere. Walking up to the front desk, he saw two older women who looked to be in their late twenties. One had long black hair that went down to her back while the other had light brown-hair which was neatly styled in a bun. Recognizing the pair, Yisey called out to them as they noticed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good afternoon Maria, Ingrid. I hope I didn't arrive too early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh miss Tredwell! Welcome! And of course not, we are happy to welcome you any time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. This place is always open to one of our most loyal customers such as yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYisey giggled a little at their reply. They were as friendly as Annette but they still were a bit too formal even now. Sometimes she wished they would address her more causally given that she knew both of them for quite some time, but she assumed it was mostly due to how strict their boss was with them that made them act more professional. He had to remind herself to talk with them and give them an easier time, given they were very good at their jobs... Maybe he could even \"borrow\" them for a few hours and go out into town with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, it is quite rare for you to arrive so early. Did something happen on the way here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, nothing like that. I actually wanted to ask if you found a card here by some chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question was a bit unexpected for the two and looked at each other in slight confusion before Ingrid asked: \"As in a credit card?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's actually a Duel Monster card. I... must've dropped it from my deck somewhere and I was wondering if it was here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, sorry. I don't think I saw anything like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me neither... Wait. No, I think I found one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did? Where is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I left it in the back room I'll come right back with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maria went away, Yisey began getting a little excited on the inside. He was really lucky to have found it already. He should call Akiza and-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYisey stifled a light moan as he felt his panties tightened around his manhood. The space which was initially left for his manhood was now gone, the underwear pressing against his groin as it started to be pulled inside. The gentle and soft touch of the fabric however distracted him enough, making his thoughts blurry and unfocused. But Ingrid didn't seem to notice any of this, and remained unfazed by his soft groans as they both waited for Maria to come back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yisey's head was washed with new information and memories which initially were foreign to him, but at the expense of his original ones, the new thoughts started to make more sense to him. He no longer considered himself someone who was poor or lived in the slums as his new history showed him having a regular upscale lifestyle where both his parents were quite wealthy and thus he never had any major hardships in his early years. He received a good education, made many friends at school and despite not playing Duel Monsters too often he quickly grew to enjoy the game at its fullest especially in high school. He expressed mild interest in Speed Duels when he was younger, but found the regular duels to be more comfortable to him and while he still watched those matches on TV, he only enjoyed the ones where the duelists actually put effort in them. He kind of wished he had more time playing, but after being scouted by a modeling agency once he got out of high school, those times became more seldom. He loved his job, but sometimes he wishes he would have a bit more freedom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this time, his privates continued to shrink, with his testes slowly burrowing inside of him. Misey knew something was wrong with the way he was feeling but as the new thoughts became less vague, he was having a hard time discerning what exactly was wrong, with only a lack of sleep being the only possible option he could think of at the moment. He didn't have time to ponder however as Maria rushed back to the front desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry if I took too long. I forgot where I put it initially, but luckily I managed to find it. Is this the card you've been looking for Miss Tredwell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tingly feeling wasn't gone entirely but was enough for Misey to pay attention and grab the card Maria showed to him. Looking at it for a few seconds, he was surprised to see that it was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reptilianne Lamia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found it on the floor near the locker room. Initially I thought it belonged to a member of the staff but none of us play any Reptile Deck before I remembered you leaving in a rush a few hours earlier and I thought it belonged to you. I tried contacting your agency but I didn't manage to get in a direct line with you. Is this yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few second Misey wanted to say \"no\", but with the appearance of the card he was looking for being blurry in his head he wasn't sure. Then a new set of memories appeared in his head which made him reach a conclusion just as the buzzing of his mind and body stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes it is. Thank you for keeping it safe for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the card, she smiled at it before picking up her purse and taking her deck case out. He gently placed it in the box as she made a note to scold her crew for not telling her about someone finding his card, especially now when he had a duel exhibition the following week. Although she was partially to blame as well since she only noticed the card gone just this morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I remember now. You showed the card to me a few days ago\", said Ingrid. \"You said someone lost it but I don't know why I didn't think it was Miss Tredwell. Good job for making the correlation Maria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but it wasn't much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was quite a lot Maria. I have reworking my deck recently so I really appreciate you keeping it for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha... It was my pleasure Miss Tredwell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLamia wasn't on its own a strong card, but Misey always needed to play strategically when it came down to using the Reptilianne deck. Some burn damage would suffice if it meant dropping more monsters on the field, and Tuners were always good to have out. She  was thankful more Reptilianne cards were released recently so strengthen her playstyle. It was a tricky deck, it was hers, and she always liked to challenge herself when dueling others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

But I guess we should begin.\", nodded Misey as he placed the card in the deck before putting the case back in his purse. He wanted to talk a bit more with Maria and Ingrid, but she supposed this was fine as well. He would be able to talk with them during the treatment anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Then we will head and make the final preparations until you get ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the young women went ahead while Misey headed to the changing room. He was already familiar with the place as his mind felt actually at home, the spa becoming one of the better places to unwind whenever he felt stressed out or simply wanted some time for himself. The price wasn't exactly cheap, but given the service it gave, it was worth every euro. Upon entering the changing room, he gave a small sigh as he observed the empty room. He already knew that the place wouldn't be full today and that he booked himself at an hour clients wouldn't normally come, but being able to lay back a little and not be always preoccupied with the image he had to uphold around the paparazzi made him a little relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly began to take off his clothes, noting how better they felt against his skin than they did in the morning. They also felt like they were a bit ill-fitting as well, but Misey attributed to his tiredness after the long photoshoot the previous day. Once he took the dress off his body, he looked at himself and raised an eyebrow as he noticed a few things. The bra seemed to be oddly loose on his chest, the cups of his undergarment leaving quite the space between itself and his chest, which also felt like it was smaller. As for his panties, while his hips seemed to accommodate him quite well, the butt still was smaller than the size of his underwear. And he also felt something pushing against the fabric in the front leaving a noticeable bulge in them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...My body still feels a little strange. It did so all day, but things have started to felt normal after a while... Although I can't help but think that something is still off. Was my chest always so small?... Maybe I'm imagining things... The massage may really be what I need right now after all...\", mused Misey as he decided not to think about his appearance anymore as he also stripped of his undergarments. He took a towel from a stack that was on a table right next to the lockers and quickly wrapped it around his body to not grow cold. As he used it to cover up his chest as well, the bulge in the front of the towel seemed to grow even smaller. While Misey didn't consider himself a woman yet, right now he completely ignored the tiny manhood that rested between his legs as if it didn't even existed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting his clothes and purse in the locker, he slowly went out of the room and walked along the corridor. After a few minutes, he finally reached Maria and Ingrid once again, just as they finished setting up the massage table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you are done Miss Tredwell. Shall we begin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I am ready to get myself fall pray to your \"magic\".\", said the almost woman with a chuckle to which the girls became a bit flustered at his response, Ingrid managing an answer somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-We appreciate your praise. Now let us begin then...\"</span></div></div>",

I think I would like to start with my legs. They have been feeling off all day and I think we should leave the chest for last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We understand, now please take a seat while get ready.\", said Ingrid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod, Misey went and sat on the table. He then positioned himself on his stomach as he removed the towel, leaving his back bare. He saw Maria rubbing some oil onto her hands before she began massaging the model's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm....\" Misey couldn't deny that Maria and Ingrid were two of the best masseuses he ever seen. Compared to most of the professionals he met so far, the two young women were incredibly dexterous with their hands. He simply melted at how nice it felt whenever they massaged him, but with them denying having any special skill, it was still a mystery sometimes why he felt so relaxed when it came down to those two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Maria rubbed his legs, Misey let out a few quiet coos, enjoying both the pleasant rub and the nice aroma of the oil. Neither were aware that Maria's rubs sculpted his legs further, the muscles in his calves being further defined while his smaller feet lost any callousness they had prior. But when she moved to his thighs, they started to bloat with each rub, the muscles losing quite a bit of their strength while a good amount of fat was added in return. This felt a bit stimulating to Misey who couldn't deny he felt a little turned on, and when his legs expanded one last time, he couldn't help but release a small moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry if I was too forceful! I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, you did nothing wrong. Maybe I was just a bit sensitive over there, nothing more... But once again, I have to say I am impressed with your technique. You sure are exceptional at this Maria.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No problem Miss Tredwell. I am only doing my job.\", replied Maria meekly back. She didn't notice Misey frowning a little upon hearing her reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt about the same time, Ingrid finished warming up the medicinal stones and gently picked them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They might feel hot at the beginning Miss Tredwell, but please bear with them.\", said the young women, to which he nodded and let her place the stones on his back. The warmth permeated the skin as he enjoyed the pleasant heat, while Ingrid rubbed some oil on her palms as well before moving to rub his arms while Maria moved to his hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like before, it was nigh impossible not to be able not to enjoy the heavenly sensation, Misey cooing every so often whenever either of the ladies put a bit of force in their movements. Just like his legs, his arms were sculpted as well, enhancing their delicate, and yet still athletic appeal while his hips finally began putting some mass on them, gradually becoming large and childbearing. The stones also helped finish up his spine, as it completed the new arching position, while his torso shrunk further. Misey was now starting to develop the curves she was meant to have, his body finally starting to match the mental image of his figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've really taken good care of your skin. It is always so soft.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you. Although it wasn't an easy process. It took me a long time of daily skin care and many organic products to get to how it is right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I see. You really are someone who cares a lot about their body Miss Tredwell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisey once again frowned as he heard the way the addressed him. Raising his head a little he asked them: \"Can you do me a favor if you would?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, we would love to Miss Tredwell. What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Even if the name obviously belonged to a girl while he was still biologically male, he found nothing wrong with it. There was a small voice in his head that said it belonged someone else's but he quickly brushed it away, thinking it belonged to some of his acquaintances that he didn't remember right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the two masseuses, they looked surprised at the request as they exchanged a glance, before Ingrid attempted to ask back sounding as professional as usual, although a she couldn't get rid of a small stutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-With all do respect, can I ask why? We are mere employees here, there is no need to call our customers in such an informal way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the problem. You're more than that to me.\", replied Misty, which made the two pause. Even if the massage temporarily stopped, the changes did not, as his hips added some more meat to them, making as inviting as they could possibly be, many models he worked with the past being unable not to feel the tiniest bit jealous of them and his small and fit waist. But there were two more elements he usually that made him the picture of perfection and one of them was slowly beginning to appear as his rear started to expand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the duo stood there unsure of what to say, Misty continued: \"I've been a customer of this place for almost three years and every time I came here I felt comfortable knowing there are people here that I can talk to like we are friends. You two are ones of the few that never commented on me being famous, asked for autographs or acted like my fans. You two treated me like a normal person and I greatly appreciate that. But whenever I tried to invite you to drink a cop of coffee or to go shopping together, you always refused m, saying you can't. Even now you're talking to me like I am just a customer here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-But Miss, we aren't allowed to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already talked to your boss about this. He didn't say anything like you two being unable to make friends with the customers. Sure, his rules and kind of strict and I think he should give you two a raise for how much you work, but he is a good man and he has nothing against us keeping in touch. So I want to know the real reason why you always seem to reluctant to take up my invites.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria and Ingrid looked at each other, both being more than a little nervous while Misty waited their response. As he did that, he had to slightly move, a small discomfort being felt around his privates. His manhood was a little squashed between his plump thighs and the bed and it was quite uncomfortable even with its smaller size. And once again it shrunk, its size being reduced by half as his head fogged up for a few seconds, thoughts about what gender was he plaguing his mind before he decided to cast them aside for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute of silence, Maria finally spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We... are sorry for our behaviour. We knew you were trying to be nice with us, and yet we refused your attempts to approach us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay. It's not as much what you did, but rather why you did it that interests me. You always were so open-minded, so I find it odd you would not want to talk about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... the truth is that...\"</span></div></div>",

He didn't see Akiza anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then felt a quick breeze on his legs, he wondered why, and as he looked down, he was met with surprise. He saw himself wearing the coffee shop's waitress uniform! He had on the white blouse with black skirt that he had seen Stephanie, the waitress with a crush on Jack, that worked there. He also noticed that on his arm, his Mark of the Dragon wasn't there, and if he could see his face, he'd also notice that his criminal mark was also gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could further think about what had happened, he saw Jack had come up to the cafe, and take a seat. He then looked right at Yusei, but rather than laugh at his team mates current attire, he didn't seem to notice anything strange at all. \"Stephanie, I'd like the usual. Blue-Eyes Mountain.\" he said to Yusei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>What?</i>' Yusei wondered in confusion. '<i>Does he somehow think that I'm Stephanie? Was this what the flash of light did?</i>' he thought, then decided that for now, he would play along. \"Okay, Jack.\" he replied before walking inside and after a while, came back out with a tray with cup of Jack's favorite coffee. He placed it on the table before walking away, and returned to thinking about what had happened to him.</span></div></div>",

The second, and much more pronounced differece was their clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei now wore a red corset and skirt with short, puffy light green sleeves, and over the corset he wore a magenta coat. He also now wore black gloves were elbow length and thigh high socks of the same color and red high heeled pumps. Around his neck was a red chocker and a necklace with an emerald crested golden cross medallion, and rolled in the front of his hair was also a silver device. On his face, his criminal mark was not there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza now wore a long sleeved blue jacket with amber gems on the elbows and shoulders and under that was a sleeveless black shirt with a red design, and brown gloves. She also had black jeans and brown boots. On her face was also the yellow criminal mark that was now absent from Yusei's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them were now dressed in the other's clothes. And despite their different sizes, they fit them perfectly, as if they were what they were made for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she took the sight before her in, Akiza recoiled back in surprise. \"Wh-whats going on here?\" she sputtered out. \"What just happened? And why are you in my clothes? And why are you in mine!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea.\" Yusei said, trying to remain calm and calm down the girl before him. \"Just relax and lets figure this out. We won't figure anything out if you start freaking out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza breathed in deeply, and did as he said. \"You're right. Freaking out won't solve anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now lets try to figure this out.\" Yusei said. However, before they can discuss things further, they heard the door of the garage open, and two people enter.</span></div></div>",

Oh, but wait, you can't hold a job. So stop wasting money on needless things!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you insult Jack Atlas like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them shouted a bit more as they entered the main area of the garage. \"Hey Yusei. Oh, and hey Akiza. Didn't know you stopped by.\" Crow said. Neither him nor Jack seemed to react to their current attire. They both just continued their argument.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAki was a little surprised and confused that neither of them found her or especially Yusei's state of dress to be strange. Yusei on the other hand, while embarrassed by being seen like this, wanted to investigate it further. \"Jack was at the coffee shop again, wasn't he?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course he was, Akiza! What else would he be doing? He doesn't work, he doesn't help out around here, all he does is waste the money that I earn!\" Crow yelled, infuriating Jack and their argument intensified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Akiza let out, furthering her confusion. Why had Crow just called Yusei by her name?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I see. So then they seem to think I'm Akiza, and I would assume that they think that Aki is me. That would explain why they didn't react to what I am wearing.' he thought. He then glanced at the card in his hand. Ever since the flash of light, he had been holding the blank card. Somehow, it had switched him and Aki's places. \"'Yusei.'\" he said to Akiza as he put his hand on her shoulder, getting her attention. She was confused at first as to why he had caled her by his name but quickly caught on. \"Lets leave these two to themselves for now. How about you and me head somewhere else. I was wondering if you could help me with something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, o-okay.\" Aki replied.</span></div></div>",

Though first they would have to get changed into their riding suits. Or rather, each other's racing suits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting the room to get changed, Yusei stripped out of what he was currently wearing, finding that under the clothes, he also had a lacy pink bra that seemed to be made just for his flat chest, and a matching pair of panties. Ignoring them, he noticed on his arm, his mark was different. Instead of the dragon's head mark, he saw the back claw in its place. Elsewhere, Akiza stood in nothing but a pair of boxers, and saw the dragon's head mark in place of her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to ignore it for now, he slipped into the red and black jumpsuit Akiza wore when using her Duel Runner, noticing it only seemed to go up part way on his chest and left a portion of it exposed. He then put on her red boots and then slipped on her red gloves. He then packed up the clothing he had taken off into a bag to bring with him. Aki also finished getting into his riding suit as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that they were ready, they got onto each others Duel Runner and rode out of the garage, Jack and Crow still arguing. They headed toawrds the highway, though not really heading anywhere in particular. Akiza also noticed that for some reason, she seemed to be driving a lot better than usual, even better than Yusei at the moment as she was currently in the lead of the two. For some reason, it just seemed a lot easier today. Yusei meanwhile was lagging a bit behind her, and noticed that he seemed to be having a bit of trouble driving, like he wasn't used to it, almost as if he didn't really have much experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what are we going to do, Yusei?\" Akiza asked as she slowed down and pulled up alongside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not really sure.\" Yusei said. \"But from what I can tell, we've switched places.

Heading to a bathroom to change, he took off the gloves and boots and slipped out of it. He then opened the bag he had packed Akiza's clothes into earlier, and with what would almost seem like a practised ease, dressed in them. Once dressed, he looked at himself in the mirror; at himself wearing Akiza's clothes. This was the first time he was seeing himself after this whole mess had started, and couldn't help but think that this was more than a bit weird.

He stepped perfecty in them as if he wore them every day; he walked the exact same way that Akiza had when she wore them, one foot in front of the other and his hips swayed with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eventually found that he had apparently absentmibdedly wandered to a specific room, and opening it up, he found that it was Akiza's own. Looking around the room, one thing that caught his eye the most were the photos. He saw a recent one that he recognized, one that the group had taken of them all. In it, just like their current situation, he and Akiza had switched places in it; he was wearing her clothes, and his pose and expression in it were the exact ones that Akiza had when it was taken, and the opposite was true with Akiza in the picture as well. And like that one, in all of the other pictures, he was where Akiza should have been.</span></div></div>",

She was now dressed in and orange and black jacket with matching orange pants,and around her forehead was a black headband with a metal plate with a leaf-like design engraved on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akiza?\" he spoke, getting her attention, and she turned to look at him. When she did, a look of confusion was on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yusei? What are you wearing?\" she replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then look downward at his own appearance as instructed, and was once again surprised. Like his friend was dressed in strange clothes, he was as well. He was dressed in a red sleeveless top, black shorts with a pinkish skirt-like cloth over them, and black sandals with heels. If he could have seen his head, he would have seen his hair had a red headband similar to the one Akiza had tying it up, and that his criminal mark was not on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we? Hoe did we get here? And why are we dressed like this?\" Akiza asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, but lets stay calm and try to figure this out.\" Yusei replied.</span></div></div>",

No longer in his usual clothes, he was now dressed in the what was perhaps the most ridiculous thing he had ever seen, let alone worn. He now wore a sailor fuku style white uniform with a very short blue skirt, and a red bow in front. He also had a red choker with a crescent moon on the front, and wore white gloves that went up to his elbows and red heeled boots that went up to his knees. And though he couldn't see it, there was a gold tiara on his forehead, and his criminal mark was absent from his face. There were also two round, red hair pieces in his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just how did I get in this?\" he said with a tone that reflected just how shocked he was. But before he could wonder further, there was a loud crash, and he heard screams, and instictively ran towards the source.

Opening his eyes he was going to ask what happened, but instead was stopped by another question, what happened to his arm? Looking at his arm after lowering it from his face he saw not his regular blue jacket sleeve with amber orbs on the elbow and shoulder but instead a clean, tight suit sleeve. The smell of perfume filled his nose as he smelt it and realized it was coming off of him. Looking around for a second he realized that he was in an office. He was seated at a desk at the end of the room, but as he looked at his hand, he realized something wasn\u2019t right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of his normal hand that was slightly tan in color he saw an almost ghost white feminine hand with long fingernails and dainty fingers. \u201cWhat, how did I- Yusei cut himself off as he covered his mouth with his new girl fingers, realizing his voice was now womanly, completely womanly with no sign of masculinity in it at all. Looking to his right he saw a flock of blue hair hanging above his eye. Lifting a finger to touch it he realized that it was his hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, Yusei could see that his, or now her, chest was no longer covered by his signature jacket and his legs in jeans, but in a dark blue blouse that went down to the thighs over a white undershirt and skirt. The blouse also had a cape on its bottom that covered the back of her new legs. Feeling the weight on his chest he felt his new breasts. He saw that they were covered by his/her blouse\u2019s v-neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her feet she no longer wore her white socks and boots but was now barefoot in a pair of blue heels. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Yusei felt something dangling on her ears. Touching his ears he felt an earring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei knew all of these traits looked familiar to him somehow. Whoever he became was familiar to him. It then hit him. He was Mina Simington. He realized that somehow his mind transferred with Mina\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving Mina\u2019s hand up and down it was clear that he was now in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat card did this\u201d he said in Mina's voice with anger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up on her heels, Yusei practiced moving with Mina\u2019s feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does he decide to do next?</span></div></div>",

It was seemingly in the middle of nowhere. Looking around, he spooted Akiza nearby, though he also instantly noticed that her attire had completely changed. Currently, she was dressed in a bluish-purple sleeveless shirt with matching pants, and a pair of boots on her feet. She also wore a pair of gloves, and a steel pauldron on her left shoulder. However, the most striking thing about her appearance was the huge sword strapped to her back. And strangely, she didn't seemed burden by its weight, when it was sure to be extremely heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akiza.\" he said to get her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yusei?\" she said as she turned to look at him, and he saw confusion in her eyes. However, that confusion instantly changed to surprise when she saw him. \"Um, what are you wearing?\" she asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to find out what she meant, he then looked down at what he was wearing, and discovered that he was dressed in a white tank top that exposed his midriff and black miniskirt. He also had on gloves that went up to his elbows, with a metal eblow guard on his left one, and a pair of boots. And though he could see his face, his crimal mark was absent from it, and he had a pair of teardrop shaped earings hanging in his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just whats going on here?\" Akiza asked him. \"Why are we dressed like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure.\" he replied, staying calm like he usually did. He knew it wouldn't do any good to panic. \"But lets stay calm.\"</span></div></div>",

Yusei then looked down at himself once more. He would have to admit, he looked ridiculous in his current attire. They were clearly clothes meant for a woman, though he clearly was not one. Though it was a bit strange that they seemed to fit him perfectly. \"Anyway, we should try to find a town. There, we should be able to learn aout where we are, and I can hopefully change out of these. Plus, we should try to find that card.

Just minutes ago, Yusei had been 19 and Akiza had been 17, and now, here the pair was, reduced to 12 years old. It was so strange, changing so drastically in such a short period of time. And to their four friends, nothing appeared to be any different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey also hadn't noticed, but their clothing had changed. Yusei's resembled his old clothes almost exactly, only missing the orange \"gems\" that decorated his clothes. It was exactly what he used to where when growing up in Satelite. Akiza was wearing a magenta t shirt with floral patterns and a red skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza looked over at Crow and Jack who had walked upstairs. She still couldn't believe that this was happening. \"Yusei? What should we do now?\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Yusei saw a picture of the six of them together. He recalled when it had been taken, though his memory of it and what the picture actually showed now were quite different. Previously, it had been a picture with the group standing in front of their four Duel Runners, with the twins holding their Duel Boards. In it now, there was only two Duel Runners, those being Jack and Crow's. And like their current situation, Yusei and Akiza had also changed, and were now in their new 12 year old bodies. Yusei was also holding a red Duel Board and standing next to him, Akiza was holding a magenta one, with the two boards vaguely resembling their former Duels Runners in some aspects. He also caught sight of a new picture next to it. In it, he saw his and Akiza's new younger selves standing with Leo and Luna, and several others children. The four of them, and all the rest, were all wearing the uniforms for New Domino's Duel Academy. It was most likely a class photo from the looks of it. 'I guess I'm a student there now.\" he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if answering his thought, Leo spoke up. \"So, Yusei, Akiza. You two wanna come back to our place and work on our homework? We'll all get done faster if we help each other out.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna sighed. \"Leo, you just want to try and copy Yusei's like usual.\" she said, and Leo laughed nervously at the accusation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving it a moments though, Yusei replied.</span></div></div>",

I promised Leo I would duel him if he managed to get a decent grade on a recent test,\" said Yusei as he started putting a few things away and preparing to leave the garage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sounds like a fun idea.  If he loses, I can make him dress like Luna,\" said Akiza as she started up Yusei's duelrunner and waited for him to get on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei smiled at Akiza's statement, \"Yeah.  That'll definitely make him want to win the duel then.\"  The two duelist laughed as Yusei finished his clean up.  Sliding on his famous red helmet, Yusei jumped onto his bike and the two were off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride to Leo and Luna's condo was a pretty quick one, though it did involve a few quick turns.  The only annoying part was once Yusei entered the city limits, the hectic of traffic always frustrated him, like any normal human being.  The continuos sound of car horns, the occasional shout from a late driver, Yusei had half a mind to go off the street and take a few side allies to get out of the oppressive traffic.  Thankfully, Akiza was there and noticed his irritation creeping onto his face.  With a quick squeeze, Akiza returned to Yusei's mind and he could not help but smile at the girl he was riding with.  However, what Akiza did not notice was the slight extra material in Yusei's shirt, of course how could she with all the noise and traffic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two duelists made it to Leo and Luna's parking garage.  There, upon turning off the engine, something strange occurred.  As Akiza turned to slip off the bike, one of her red high heeled shoes slipped right off.  Akiza only noticed this when her socked footed touched cold asphalt,causing her to squeak in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Akiza?\" asked Yusei, surprised by the cute sound that had just popped out of his girlfriend's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My shoe just slipped off is all,\" said Akiza who was about to reach for her.  Yusei, however, was already there and picked up the red-haired girl's shoe.  Deciding to play with Akiza a bit, Yusei knelt on one knee and extended the shoe to Akiza.  Taking the role of the princess, Akiza straighten herself up and extended her foot waiting for the glass slipper.  As Yusei slipped on and fastened the shoe, he found it odd that Akiza's shoe was probably a size or two too big for her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akiza, are these shoes new?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" answered the girl as she stood up and took Yusei's hand.  \"Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it looks like they're a little big for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's odd,\" said Akiza as she and Yusei made their way down the garage corridor to the elevator.  \"I do tend to buy my shoes a least a size bigger, in case I get that extra little growth spurt.\"  As Akiza walked, she was indeed surprised at how loose her shoes felt.  She could practically lift her entire heel before her shoe's backing would catch and allow the shoe to lift.  \"This is really odd,\" continued as struggled for a few more feet.  Finally, getting tired of struggling with her shoes, Akiza abruptly slipped her feet out of her shoes, grabbed her shoes in her left hand, and grabbed Yusei's right, not noticing the extra material nearly covering Yusei's hand.  \"There, much better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei accepted Akiza's simple response and the two continued on their way to the elevator.  Thankfully the elevator seemed to be waiting for them, and the two took it to the top floor where they quickly found and knocked on Leo and Luna's door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill Leo and Luna be there when Yusei and Akiza arrive?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With no response coming from the other side, the two duelists concluded that Leo and Luna must still be out somewhere, probably at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do we do now Yusei?\" asked Akiza as she reached down and adjusted her stockings, noting that they seemed to be slightly longer than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We go inside and wait for them.  Leo gave me an extra key they had in case we ever wanted to come over and just hang out,\" answered Yusei as he pulled out the key card and swiped it through the reader.  A few seconds later, Yusei and Akiza were standing in the entry way of the impressively nice condo.  Wood floors throughout, fully stocked kitchen, plenty of space, this was a place Yusei could only dream about when he was a child.  He only hoped that when the time came, he could give Akiza something similar if not better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing her red heels in the shoe rack and hanging her red coat on the rack, Akiza quickly stepped up into the kitchen and opened the refrigerator.  \"Yusei, would you like something to drink?  There's some lemonade here, as well as a few other juices.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A glass of lemonade please,\" called back Yusei as he hung his coat and stored his gloves in the pockets.  He then took a seat on the entry step so he could take off his boots.  Yusei looked down at his boot, grasped it, and prepared for the tug of war that was about to commence.  As much as he liked these boots, they were always a pain to get on and off.  However, in the name of politeness certain things must be done.  Returning his thoughts to his boot, Yusei heaved, and then fell backwards almost knocking his head on the floor.  Sitting up quickly, Yusei looked down in shock.  There was his foot, white socked and everything, and his boot off with not so much as a struggle. Sure, his white sock was a little loose on his foot, but it always was whenever he had to yank his boots off.  Yet, this time there was hardly any yanking at all, let alone difficulty. Placing his boot on the floor next to the shoe rack, Yusei turned to his other shoe.  Moving his foot around in his boot, Yusei could tell there was plenty of space in it, probably too much space.  Yusei paused for a second and then set the heel of his boot against the floor.  Using his other foot as a break, Yusei easily manage to slip the boot off.  Puzzled, Yusei set the boot aside and was about to notice how loose his other sock was when he felt a warm presence wrap around him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza gave her boyfriend a big hug and a quick kiss on the cheek.  \"Something wrong Yusei?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly, my boots were loose and easy to pull off, but they weren't that loose yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe some of the bindings in the boots decided to loosen?  You have had those boots for a long time.  Maybe you've finally managed to break them in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that could be it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on,\" said Akiza with a little complaint in her voice.  \"So what, you're shoes were loose.  Big deal.  we could either spend our time between now and when Leo and Luna get home mulling it over, or we could have some fun.\"  Yusei felt Akiza's warm arms let go only to hear a few seconds later a light yelp and a thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning quickly, Yusei saw Akiza on the wooden floor.  Rushing to her side, Yusei asked, \"Akiza are you okay?\"  However, Yusei's slippery sock could not gain traction on the wooden floor, causing the boy to slip, crashing and sliding right next to Akiza.  The red haired girl burst into laughter saying simply, \"I am now.\"  Standing up, the red haired girl offered her boyfriend a hand up.  He gladly accepted it and was soon on his feet... only to suddenly feel a shove from in front of him.  Landing on his butt with a thud not unlike Akiza's first fall, Yusei looked up at the now high and might Akiza, failing to notice that instead of her usual 16 almost 17 look, she now looked barely 15 if not 14, \"Why'd you do that?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I knew it would be fun,\" said Akiza as she skated away, her stockings acting like skates on the polished wooden floor.  Passing by the couch, Akiza grabbed one of the many pillows and threw it at Yusei.  Yusei rolled to dodge and succeded, allowing him to stand up.  He was about to protest, but another thrown pillow silenced Yusei.  After that, it turned into reflex training.  Akiza would throw, Yusei would attempt to dodge and sometimes succeed.  He was quickly getting into the fun of things, no doubt why he did not notice how his white socked toes were now the only thing that were able to be seen peaking out from the excess jean material.  Although Akiza was focused on Yusei, she was far too centered on aiming to notice her boyfriend's lighter skin tone and softer expression giving him a look closer to 15 instead of his usual 18.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, it was Yusei's turn to return fire which he did sometimes throwing two or three pillows at a time.  Akiza was able to dodge most of the barrage, but still took some hits.  She had to find a way to get back on top of this match.  Just then, as Akiza went for a catch, she saw what she could use.  Ducking behind her side of the couch, Akiza soon emerged with her arms bare and her black sleeves tied together into a loop.  Not seeing a problem with this new tactic, Yusei quickly threw another pillow at Akiza.  However, Akiza was ready for this.  Grabbing the opposite sides of her loop, Akiza turned the loop into a sort of cradle and easily caught the thrown pillow.  With a quick spin, Akiza then sent the same pillow back at Yusei, who had to dive away from his stockpile of pillows to avoid getting pummeled.  Now was her chance.  Skating forward, Akiza managed to cover just the ground she needed to slam Yusei with another pillow.  Knocked off balance, Yusei grabbed for the only thing he could and hoped it would prevent him from falling.  Unfortunately, it was Akiza so it did not.  The two duelists fell into a heap of human limbs and slightly oversized clothing.  The two landed with an all to common sound that was quickly followed by laughter and smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you got me Akiza,\" said Yusei through his laughter.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah I did.\"  Akiza then sat up and helped her boyfriend to his feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I cannot remember the last time I had fun like that,\" said Yusei as he began to pick up pillows, his face now looking younger maybe closer to 14.  Akiza grabbed a few herself and then sat down.  The pillow fight had taken quite a lot of energy plus she had to fix her stockings.  Reaching for the clasp that held up her stockings, Akiza adjusted it to the shortest it would go.  She then stood up and reached for another pillow, however her attention returned to her stockings.  Even at the shortest length, the stocking still felt big on her.  She began to wonder, but quickly came to the solution that the stockings were probably just old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning the last of the pillows to the couch, the two duelists sat down and sighed.  Reaching for the TV remote, Yusei turned on the TV and began to search for professional dueling programs.  It was not a long search as every channel wanted some sort of card game related TV show to pull in viewers.  Settling for a broadcasting of the Olympic dueling trials, Yusei leaned back his arm almost missing Akiza as he pulled her close.  Had the twins gotten a bigger couch since last time he was here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh bad move,\" commented Akiza as she watched an Olympic hopeful fall to a simple trap card. With a yawn, Akiza's feet curled up onto the couch as she rested her head on Yusei's lap. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now?</span></div></div>",

For starters, rather than standing on their feet, they were both hunched over on all fours. Secondly, their location had changed, and rather than Yusei's garage where they had been moments before, they were now in the middle of a park. And finally, and the most important of the differences, their clothes had disappeared, leaving them both completely naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing brightly, Akiza attempted to cover herself, but found that her arms weren't working right. Trying to get up, they also found that they couldn't stand up properly; they could balance on their feet for a few moments, but it was shaky, and they both ended up falling back onto their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yusei, what's going on!</i>\" Akiza screamed with fear, \"<i>Why am I naked?! Why can't I stand up?! Wha-</i>\" She cut herself off as she realized something else. Despite her screaming, she wasn't hearing her words - she was hearing barking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei meanwhile noticed something else. While he clearly heard Akiza barking, he found that he somehow undersood exactly what she was trying to stay. \"<i>What is going on?</i>\" Yusei gasped, and was greeted by a \"Woof!\" of his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Yusei, why are we barking like a dogs?! And why can we understand it!?</i>\" she screamed in another series of barks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I don't know.</i>\" Yusei said as calmly as he could. \"<i>But lets try to stay calm here. We can't panic.</i>\" His words were still coming as a series of barks and woofs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, look at that,\" a voice spoke up. Somehow managing to blush even harder, Akiza's head whipped up - and her eyes widened in further shock. There were some people walking towards her, except they were also naked and walking on all fours. More to the point, they were being led on leashes by dogs - dogs that were walking upright and wearing clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two continued to stare in shock, the dog wearing jeans and a shirt said, in perfect English, \"Looks like a pair of stray humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure?\" the dog wearing a dress asked, \"Better check to see if they have a collars.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them were frozen in shock, unable to move as the male dog handed his leash to the female, walked over to them, then one by one pulled their hair back to check their necks.</span></div></div>",

How is any of this possible!?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, my name is Rover, and I just found a pair of humans named Yusei and Akiza that apparently belong to you.\" He then paused for a bit. \"Got out on you somehow, huh? Anyway, sure, I can wait and keep an eye on them while you come to get them.\" He then hung up and kneeled before them. \"Hey there you two. Your master is on their way, so try to behave until then.\" he told them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei then looked over to the other humans that were on the leash that the female dog was holding. Their expressions were cheerful, and looked rather simple. \"<i>Hey.</i>\" he barked over to them and they looked at him. He decided he needed to check some stuff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hi!</i>\" one barked back excitedly in a friendly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Uh, whats going on here?</i>\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Our masters were taking us for a walk!</i>\" the other replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Maybe they'll play frisbee with us!</i>\" said hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>But why are dogs treating you like your their pets?</i>\" Akiza asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>What do you mean?</i>\" one dog asked with confusion. \"<i>Thats the way its always been!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was exactly as Yusei feared. He wasn't sure how, but somehow, he and Akiza had been transported to some strange reality where humans and dogs positions were reversed, and now he and Akiza were bound to the laws of that reality, making their abilities dog-like which explained their inability to to stand on their hind legs, their arms working differently, and why the only could seem to bark. He then remembered how his and and Akiza's \"owner\" was on their way to get them. They had to get away somehow, and then find someway to get back to their own reality.</span></div></div>",

Nothing appeared to have happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that was not truly the case. The card had indeed done something, which was now begining to take effect. Yusei felt a strange sensation coming from his abdomen, and placed a hand there reflexively. What was happening to him couldn't be seen with their eyes just yet, as inside Yusei, they were behining to rearrange themselves as they made way for something new. Something that wasn't part of the male anatomy: A womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments, his new organ was formed, and something appeared inside of it. It was reproductive material created to have belonged to Yusei and Akiza, and they joined together and became a fetus. And then, things that would normally take months began to accelerate and happen in minutes, as the fetus began to rapidly grow and progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, this became increasingly apparent as the changes started to show, and Yusei's belly began to swell up. As it did, his clothes also began to shift, with his pants disappearing, his shoes changing, and his shirt shifting. Once done, he was wearing a blue maternity dress to accomdate his new current situation and looser shoes. As the changes subsided, he was now obviously a pregnant, albeit still male, person in the 3rd trimester.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoincidentally, as his changes finished, several people entered into the area, with them being Jack, Crow, and the twins.</span></div></div>",

Jack!\" Glancing in the direction of the voice, he saw Carly waving to him as she came jogging up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, Carly.\" he replied. \"What brings you here?\" he said before taking another sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, check out this weird card I just found. I was doing an interview for a scoop, and as I left I found it on the ground.\" Carly said as she handed Jack the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its blank? What a useless card.\" he said before handing it back to her. \"Whats so interesting about a blank card?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No clue, but I'm gonna investigate it. Maybe I've found a great scoop!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the card began to glow, and there was suddenly a bright flash of light that engulfed the two of them.</span></div></div>",

In Leo and Luna's case, it's because they have simultanious control over Crow's body, so in order for them to move properly, they have to syncronize their every movement; otherwise Crow's body will feel really heavy. Plus, the simple fact that they are two minds in one body, will also add to their problems, especially since they can both feel what happens to Crow's body; whether it's just walking, grabbing objects, or simply moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Crow's case, it's because he now has control over two bodies at once! He is able to feel what both Leo's and Luna's body individually feels, so that can get really confusing. Plus; the fact that he's now looking out of two seperate pairs of eyes, isn't exactly helping either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow about it?</span></div></div>",

Their clothe began to change, shaping to match their new age. Luna's light pink jacket would remain the same, but her shirt beneath it began to change. Its sleeves retracted in and vanished, and it began to turn from reddish pink to a light blue color, and her shorts began to shift as the pants legs fused together, and became a white skirt tht went past her knees.

Leo, who was always lacking as a kid, now had an entirely new body. He grew a bit muscular, not as big as Greiger probably was, but he did gain a good bit. If averaged out, he was probably a bit more muscular than what Yusei was. Next, Leo's outfit changed to fit his new style. He wore a dark blue and black jacket, with a white shirt underneath. Long jeans and black shoes complimented the outfit.  His hair was the same, however the tail part of his hair was a bit spiky, and a few black streaks could be seen inside. He wore what looked like a blue visor on his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna, on the other hand, was the complete opposite of her younger self. If you saw her at a young age, you would have never guessed she would become like she is now. First off, Luna's face just seemed to describe beauty. Her eyes, lips, everything seemed model-like. Her hair, although cute with pigtails, now was held down. Her hair went all the way to her knees, however they were gathered together into two main strands about mid-torso level. Her hair had white streaks in them. Luna's body definitely aged, for now she sported D cup breasts, maybe even a bit larger. She had a thing waist and a round behind, along with long slender legs to compliment her body. Her outfit looked more like a dress than anything. She had a nice long white dress, a slit near the neck that exposed a bit of her cleavage for everyone to see. However she also wore a nice pink jacket, one that covered her arms a decent amount but was left open from her chest. She wore sandals and in her hair seemed to be a flower pin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike before, each twin did have something that they wore that was the same. They each had a wristband, same as they were kids, on their wrists. Both twins looked at each other in complete shock. \"Leo...\" Luna spoke with her new voice, \"What...what is happening to us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not sure\" he replied in his deeper voice. \"But wow Luna, you look really beautiful as a young adult.\" A blush came from his sister that made him smile. \"And look at me!\" He flexed his arms a bit, \"I'm not sure whether to be stoked or excited!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I think we should check with the others\" Luna spoke, \"They might be able to help us.\"</span></div></div>",

Just look at what you are wearing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo looked down and saw that he indeed wasn't wearing his usual clothes anymore. Instead, he was wearing some kind of green suit, a white flight jacket and some kind of odd-looking white boots. There was also a red scarf around his neck and a holster on his right leg, which held some kind of high-tech pistol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at Luna, he saw that she wore an almost identical outfit; exept her suit was orange, her boots were silver and she didn't have a scarf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wahhh!\" yelled Leo. \"What's going on?!? Why are we wearing these crazy clothes?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea,\" said Luna, \"But freaking out won't do anything, Leo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo took a few deep breaths to calm himself. \"You're right, Luna.

There's two choices.\" He pointed down the two ends of the corridor, discovering in the process that he was also wearing a pair of black, fingerless gloves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's try going the way we were facing when we showed up here,\" said Luna. \"That would be the best option right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that sounds like a good plan,\" said Leo. \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins started walking down the corridor. While they were walking, they noticed that the strange clothes they were wearing felt really comfortable; like they had been tailor-made for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's really strange, Luna,\" said Leo. \"These clothes are very odd, but they fit us perfectly. How do you think we ended up wearing them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it had something to do with that strange card that we found,\" replied Luna. \"I remember that I saw some text appearing on it as it began to glow, but I can't remember exactly what...\" Luna looked in Leo's direction and gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luna; what's wrong?\" asked Leo with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look at our shadows, Leo!\" said Luna in a frightened voice. Leo turned his head to look at the shadows and gasped as well; their shadows weren't their own!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough they were still humanoid, they were not human shadows! For one thing, they were disproportionally bigger in comparison to the twins' sizes; almost like the shadows of adults.<br>\r\nFor another; the shadows had obvious non-human features! Leo could see that his own shadow had a tail and dog-like ears, while Luna's shadow had a bird-like tail and a beak!<br>\r\nThere was no doubt that it was their shadows; they followed all the movement that the twins made!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay; this is freaky!\" exclaimed Leo. \"Why do our shadows look like that?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure,\" said Luna hesitantly. \"At least, I think I'm not...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna suddenly gasped. \"Wait a second! I remember now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember what, Luna?\" asked Leo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the Card that did this! That strange Card we found!\" replied Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait; what?!?\" sputtered Leo. \"The Card did this? What exactly did it do, sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's hard to explain, Leo,\" said Luna. \"If only there was a mirror nearby...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna suddenly looked like she got an idea. Much to Leo's surprise, she closed her eyes and appeared to be in deep concentration. After a moment she opened her eyes again and said: \"Follow me; hurry!\", before she sprinted down the corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey; wait up!\" yelled Leo, running after her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna kept running until she reached a white door on the side of the corridor. Leo came up close behind her, completely out of breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's... the... deal... Luna?\" he huffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's easier to explain when we enter this bathroom,\" said Luna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo looked at his sister with a puzzled expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know that this is a bathroom?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will explain everything, Leo,\" said Luna, \"but it will be easier to explain in there.\" She opened the door and went in, Leo following close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed to be an ordinary bathroom to Leo; a couple of toilets, sinks and a large mirror on one wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, Luna. If you wanted to go so badly, you should have said so,\" complained Leo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna shook her head. \"It has nothing to do with that,\" she said. \"I told you that I know what's going on, but I had to find a mirror to help explain it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err...why?\" wondered Leo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's easier to show you,\" said Luna as she went over to stand in front of the mirror. Puzzled, Leo went over to stand next to his sister, looked into the mirror... and screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reflections in the mirror were not their own, human reflections! Instead, Leo was looking at the reflections of two humanoid animals!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna's reflection was that of an athletic, blue-feathered bird-like creature with long blue tail feathers and red patches around it's blue eyes.<br>\r\nLeo's reflection was that of a green-eyed, fox-like being with orange-brown fur, with white fur on the muzzle and the tip of it's tail.<br>\r\nWhat was even stranger was that the two reflections were not only wearing the exact same clothes that the twins were wearing, but that they were also bigger than the twins were!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo stared in total shock at his altered reflection. And he was sure the fox-thing in the mirror was his reflection; it had the same shocked expression as he had and it mirrored all of his own movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luna... What's going on here?\" asked Leo nervously. \"Why do our reflections look like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, it's because of that Card we found,\" answered Luna. \"I remembered the name of the Card. It was called: Cross-Dimensional Life Exchange. We've swapped lives with two beings from another dimension!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err....What do you mean by that?\" asked a confused Leo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna sighed and looked her brother straight in the eyes. \"Okay; let me explain. We currently have the lives of those two beings whose reflections we now have. We still see ourselves as ourselves, but everyone else will see us as our current reflections. And since we're currently in their lives, they must be in our lives back in New Domino.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna turned towards the mirror again. \"You currently have the life of that orange one; Fox McCloud,\" she said, as she pointed at Leo's new reflection. \"He's the leader of a group of Spaceship pilots known as Star Fox.\"<br>\r\nShe then pointed at her own new reflection. \"And I have the life of his teammate; one Falco Lombardi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah... That's freaky,\" said Leo, as he moved closer to the mirror to see his, or Fox's, face close-up. \"So, does this mean that this dimension is full of these animal-people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much,\" said Luna, as she looked at Falco's reflection which was now hers. \"The reason why I know all this, is because we also got the memories of these two, since it's a part of their lives..... Hey; are you listening?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna huffed as she saw that Leo had stopped listening and was now occupied with making funny faces in the mirror, which Fox's reflection copied perfectly; something that looked really silly for an adult fox-man to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are so immature, Leo,\" she complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, Luna,\" grinned Leo as he turned to face her. \"You have to admit this is awesome! We get to be space-heroes! How cool is that?!?\" He struck a superhero pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't get it, Leo!\" Luna almost yelled. \"This isn't some kind of TV show; it's real! This isn't some kind of duel! There's real danger here! We could get hurt; or worse! Try accessing the memories of Fox; then you'll know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...okay,\" said Leo, now mellowed out. Closing his eyes, he tried really hard to think about his adventures in the past.<br>\r\nSuddenly, a bunch of memories came rushing in; not just his own, but also those of Fox. He saw dangerous dogfights between starships, skirmishes against invading armies and, to his horror, a climactic battle against an enormous, disembodied head!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Leo opened his eyes again, the expression on his face told Luna that he now understood how serious the situation was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa...\" muttered Leo. \"The Star Fox crew has been through a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you get it,\" said Luna in a careful tone. \"It's not as fun as it looks on TV.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's for sure,\" admitted Leo. \"But I do know something that is fun.\" He grinned at Luna. \"The fact that you swapped lives with a dude!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Leo sniggered, Luna became red in the face from both embarrasment and frustration.<br>\r\n\"I already know that, Leo,\" she huffed. \"It's bad enough that I had to swap lives with a male bird-guy, but you don't have to rub it in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo stopped sniggering, but still grinned at her. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"I just realized it after viewing those memories and it was too funny to not be said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna sighed again. \"You really are immature sometimes,\" she said, \"but you can't act like that while we're in these lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... why not?\" asked Leo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we shouldn't draw attention to ourselves,\" replied Luna seriously. \"Fox and Falco are grown-ups, so it won't do for you to act like that. We still see ourselves as us, but everyone else sees us as Fox and Falco, so if you act silly, it will look like Fox is acting that way and other people might get suspicious because of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, we're just kids, Luna,\" complained Leo. \"How are we supposed to act like grown-ups, when we don't know how to do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" said Luna, \"We could try to look into Fox' and Falco's memories again and then try to act like we see them do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like it could work,\" said Leo slowly,\" but you know what I'm like. Sometumes, I just can't resist letting loose with a joke. And when we pretend to be famous Duelists, I always end up being overdramatic.\" Leo sighed. \"I don't think I can pretend to be that fox-man well enough to avoid suspicion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna walked over to Leo and put her hand on his shoulder. \"It's okay, Leo,\" she said, comforting him. \"We'll get through this together; like we always do. And we will find a way to get back to our own lives. I'm sure of it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo perked up a bit at those words. \"Thanks, sis,\" he said. \"I needed to hear that.\" Smiling again, he continued: \"So; what do we do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"According to their memories, Fox and Falco were walking to the hangar where their Starfighters are,\" said Luna. \"So, let's go there first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great!\" exclaimed Leo as he opened the bathroom door. \"Let's go! I want to ser those starships!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna managed a small smile as she followed her brother into the corridor.</span></div></div>",

After blinking for a few times, the two, still a little dazed adjusted their eyes back to the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not sure Leo. I haven't seen a card do that before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not even when you were in the Spirit World?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Regulus didn't mention anything about that. And since it was a Spell Card, and not a Monster, it makes it even more strange as to how it activated, as it doesn't have any conscious I think...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so sis... Huh? Wait, where is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna dropped the card when the light hit them, but it was nowhere to be found near them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it... disappear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it did. I did feel a some of energy when I touched it, but I don't sense it anymore... so I guess it's gone now. Should we look for it and show it to the others?\", asked the girl, to which Leo shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, I don't think we have to. I mean, nothing happened right? Maybe it was a dud, or someone decided to pull a prank on us or something like that. I doubt it's anything serious since there wasn't a spirit around anyway. Maybe it was something a magician had or something. As far as we now, maybe it was supposed to be a trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And besides, would the others even consider this something serious? I can already picture Jack grinning and saying we act like little kids at how worked up we got over a card that shined and didn't do anything else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He isn't that mean to do that. But I guess he does dismiss us from time to time quite easily. I mean, I get that being around younger people isn't his thing, but he could be a bit more caring sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right? I know he was called the King once, but that doesn't mean he should just act high and mighty so often. And other than Yusei and Crow, he doesn't really talk too much with others like they are on the same level. I guess we and Akiza got into that group, but I would just want to understand him better and why he is so boastful at all times. I kind of wish both of us got closer to him, so that he will treat us better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too... Although, I think that's the way he is normally. He isn't really such a bad person, but he has a hard time acknowledging his faults. But Carly managed to get closer to him somehow after he lost the title, and he a little mellow around her, so maybe we should ask her how to make him be nicer to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? I would've personally asked Mina. She was his manager at one point, right? So she must know him better. And they are still a bit close even now, when she is helping Trudge as the new chief of Special Investigations...\", said the young boy before blinking and realizing something. \"Wait, did we just spend the last five minutes talking about Jack? Man, we are already late to meet with the guys. Let's just go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... And the card?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll talk with Yusei with it in private so that Jack wouldn't start snickering.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, he really isn't that bad of a guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the twins walked away, the two didn't notice how their bodies were covered by a faint light disappearing. Along with the light, Luna's Signer Mark and her connection to the Spirit World also disappeared. One thing was certain though, Leo's wish is going to be fulfilled in a way neither sibling would've expected....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But he isn't as bad as you make him seem to be. Sure, he can be a bit mean sometimes, but he is still our friend, isn't he? He may talk big, but he is quite soft, if you think about it. Why would he try to act as nice as he could around Yusei and Crow if they weren't close? He isn't bitter about him losing the title, and in fact was happy he could start back from the ground to make a name for himself again. And he is kind from time to time such as when he took us to that restaurant. He may look very boastful, but at heart, he is a little bit like Yusei isn't he?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I guess that he wouldn't be screwing around as much as he does if he was a very pompous guy that only cares about his reputation. And Crow does say from time to time that he is still pretty much the same Jack that lived with them in Satellite, but with an inflated ego added on top of it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that her brother was slowly warming up, Luna gave out a small smile as Leo put his hands behind his back as he pondered more about the former King. They didn't notice how the boy's hands slimmed down and his fingers became slightly longer, looking similar to his sister's while the golden designs they both had on their shirts completely vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am happy to see that you are starting to see how great Jack is, brother. We sure are super lucky we got to meet him and.... uh...\" Luna began to praise Jack, sounding almost ecstatic in doing such before realizing what she was doing and stopped herself as her cheeks reddened. In response, Leo could only look at her in slight confusion as he raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sis, where exactly were you going with that? I know you defended him before, you almost sounded like one of his fans there for a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sorry, I don't know what made me say those things. I just felt like... I had to say those things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did? Never thought you would be such a big fan of his.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not really one, but... I guess he is kind of cool, so maybe that's why... But it came out of nowhere... Sorry, I think I blanked out there for a second, so don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Okay, if you say so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them were fine with that answer, but Leo thought it was just his sister going off tangent to try and make Jack look better in his eyes. \"Weird... Why would she go so far? She made her point, and I admit, Jack isn't such a big jerk after all. He isn't as good as Yusei, but he's okay I guess. Still, saying that we are lucky to meet him? Way too much, sis, way too much...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand, Luna was bewildered by her own words, as she couldn't understand what made her speak the way she did. \"Why did I sounded so excited all of a sudden? And what made me say those things? This is so strange... Whatever it was, it appears to be gone now, so there shouldn't be any problems... I hope.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked, they slowly began to raise in height as their bodies started to lengthen, their clothes growing along with them. Luna's pigtails also rotated so that they were now facing backwards while Leo's hair smoothed out, losing all of its greasiness and becoming as silky as Luna's, yet neither sibling seemed to notice any of these changes.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Normally, Kuribon or Regulus would've tried to talk with her whenever she was feeling confused or conflicted, but with her link to her Monster Spirits gone, she was now unable to hear them anymore. And yet she still remained blissfully unaware of the fact, not even questioning why her spirit friends remained silent after her outburst. This was because her memories were slowly changing, adapting themselves to suit her current self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir pants also began to change, as Leo's white shorts started to become silkier and smoother to the touch, while Luna's were becoming rougher instead as they also started to gain a faint bluish hue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, have you seen the teams that will take part in the Grand Prix?\", asked Leo to try and take his sister's attention away from what happened before. \"Some of the groups are pretty much newcomers, but quite a lot of them are a little famous. I wonder which ones will they fight against.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not sure. It wouldn't be impossible to fight a strong team from the start, but I think Yusei and the others will manage. All of them have gotten a lot stronger lately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I am sure it will not be a walk in the park, but after the whole thing with the Dark Signers, they've got this. And besides, chances are a lot of them will get a bit intimidated by the fact that they're fighting both the current and former King. And with... Yusei's skills of course they'll win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna noticed her brother paused a bit, but didn't think too much of it, while Leo was now having his turn at being confused by his thoughts. \"Why was I ready to say \"Jack\" instead? Yeah, he is strong and all, but still not on Yusei's level. But I guess he is quite talented and smart, not that his pride isn't blinding him anymore. And he has been a bit more tactical with his plays lately, so he is getting better... Great, now I start to praise him more than I wanted. I guess a bit of Luna's enthusiasm is rubbing on me...\", said the boy to himself with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir thoughts regarding Jack Atlas were slowly improving, his more abrasive and sometimes mocking behaviour not bothering them as much, and began to see his more positive traits, such as his courage and respect for his opponent, to be more defining of his character. Neither seemed to be bothered by this, and instead actually welcomed them, as they wanted to see him in a better light, for a reason they really didn't get at the moment, but to which they weren't against.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they neared the group's apartment, their bodies grew once again as they also became older, both now being fifteen years old. This made Luna's small curves to become a little more apparent, as her hips and chest grew a bit as a result. As for Leo, he didn't gain any major muscle mass, as his body remained overall slim. However the changes didn't stop there for him, as his calves shifted a bit, their appearance now being more shapely and slim, and also a bit more toned, while his feet shrunk the same way his hands did and also gained a pedicure, making his legs look more like his sister's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they approached the door however, they noticed that it was unusually quiet. Normally, the guys would work on their D-Wheels, but there wasn't any sound coming from inside. Peeking inside the garage, they were surprised to see only one person in the garage.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only Zora, the landlady, was the only one there, sweeping the floors before she noticed the twins opening the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hello, Lio and Lana. Is there any way I can help you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were confused a little by the way the older lady called them. They simply believed she mispronounced their names, although a small part of their brains instead didn't seem to acknowledge that something was wrong with the way they were addressed. Not paying too much mind on, the two shook their heads before Lio replied to the lady.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were looking for Yusei and the others. He said we can come here and check out how they work on the D-Wheels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm afraid they already left. Yusei went with Bruno to look for more parts, while Crow went for his deliveries. As for Jack, he said he'll go to his \"usual place\", wherever that may be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe news immediately brought down the siblings' morale. The fact that they missed them meant they will most likely have to wait for them to return, and knowing how long it takes Yusei to find the best pieces he could find for his D-Wheel, given his high standards, it will most likely take awhile. But with Bruno joining him, maybe the shopping would be done quicker, so there was hope they won't be gone for too long. And Crow might actually be done with his work quite quickly, if he didn't had too many orders to take care of. But for some reason, despite not knowing when he will return, or they were that keen to talk with him in particular, both wanted for some reason to meet Jack more than the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLio's socks disappeared during their conversation while Lana's shrunk to the point where they weren't visible anymore through the shoes. As for their footwear, the latter's didn't changed too much as they morphed into a pair of yellow and white sneakers, while Lio's changed into a pair of brown slip-on shoes become a three inch heel grew from them. He had a few issues keeping his balance in his new high heels, but in a matter of seconds, he quickly grew accustomed to them, as he had no issues walking in them anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When exactly did they leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About an hour ago. Yusei said he plans to not have you wait for too long, and Crow said he will try and finish his orders as quickly as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we wait for them until they return?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can wait them here if you want, but promise me you'll keep quiet. It is usually so noisy here whenever they test out their engines, so I would like to be cleaning in quiet if you wouldn't mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, we won't make much noise.\", said Lana as both she and Lio went down their stairs, the boy trying his best not to make any noise with his heels, looking like he had years of practice in walking in them, not seeing anything wrong with his footwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked, Lana's hair started to grow a bit as her pigtails were slowly coming undone, while Leo's ponytail instead began to grow smaller. The twins didn't register the changes, instead feeling a slight each that didn't bother them too much to notice something was off. They both took a seat at a table in the corner of the room, while Zora returned to sweeping the floors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There really wasn't much to be done on their own and they already promised Zora that they will behave themselves. They could wait for her to be done cleaning and then look around the place to maybe check the blueprints or spare parts of the D-Wheels the guys had, but they didn't want to be scolded for snooping around their stuff without their permission in case someone returned. And speaking of returning, they both knew that the chances of Yusei or Crow returning so fast after they left would be quite slim, unless they were lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is getting boring Lana. Kind of wish we took our Duel Disks with us if I knew we would have to wait. I thought we'd come here and check out what the guys were working on, not sitting on a chair doing nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It can't be helped Lio. We couldn't have known the guys' schedule anyway. And besides, we can still Duel each other even without our Disks. Want to have a match?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of them noticed they called each other by the misspelled names Zora called them earlier, nor did the names themselves sounded wrong for them anymore. They also didn't see how their pants changed further with Lio's losing all of its pockets while Lana's began to grow out, now reaching her knees as the material continued to soften and toughen respectively for both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally Lio would accept any time to Duel instead of doing nothing, but now while his interest in the game didn't wane, he didn't feel as motivated to play right now. Lana seemed to have similar sentiments, as her proposal was lacking a bit of her usual energy when she would ask for a Duel, but it wasn't as bad as it was in Lio's case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sis, but maybe not now. I don't feel like it right now. And besides, without the Duel Disks, it kind of loses a bit of its charm anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so... The offer is still up if you feel motivated though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha... By the way, I was curious about something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you think Jack went? Not even Zora seemed to know.\", asked Lio genuinely curious. Normally he wouldn't care too much where the former champion would spend his free time when not working on his D-Wheel, but he was starting to feel an increasingly amount of interest in him, despite the fact that he just told himself earlier not to think about Jack too much. A part of him still agreed with that statement, but it didn't really stop his curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I am not really sure. I didn't had too many opportunities to talk to him lately... But I think I should know of at least one place he went at least during the weekends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did he ever tell you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really... But I recall a bit a time when I saw him at a caf\u00e9... Although I am not really sure when I saw him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you saw him when we were strolling around. Or did you see him on your own free time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it's the latter... I don't know why I feel so confused about this all of a sudden. There is something that makes me think that I know the place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be bother by it. It's not like it really matters. And besides, maybe it was just a one-time thing for him too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps it was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring their conversation, Lana's hair started to darken a little bit, now being a darker shade of green while Lio's was slowly turning into a light olive-green color instead. On top of that the bangs that were framing their faces were slowly receding and growing back into their scalps.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I can't help but think that you are right. We still know too little about who the guy in charge of the Ghosts are or how they even got their hands on the Duelbots. Yusei thinks that whoever took them is an expert programmer or a hacker, but even so, I can't really think a reason as to why they would do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both became silent as they recounted the events of the past few months. It started not too long after beating the Dark Signers, when Yusei Dueled against Ghost and realized that the mysterious Duelist that took out so many others was in fact a machine. What was even more shocking was the fact that it had a Deck which contained Monsters that could actually absorb Synchro Monsters, something which was never seen before. Then there was the incident when an impostor Jack tried to get rid of the real deal, with him having multiple copies of Red Dragon Archfiend, a Card only Jack should have, and then again, it was revealed that it was another bot. But as they were remembering the events, some parts of their memories were slowly changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoever is in charge of the Ghosts, must have some reason to do all this. A vendetta against people who just use Synchro Monsters is way too childish. Especially because they left the Duelists in the state they were found afterward. After seeing how bad Trudge was, I must believe there must be a deeper reason for this... Wait. I saw Trudge only in a cast, right?... No I remember I was there when he was hospitalized and saw how bad his injuries were. Those lacerations are hard to forget... But what was I doing there? I don't recall needing to see a physician at the time. Did Yusei pick me up, or I got there with a cab? I am  not really sure...And was Lana there? I don't think I remember her being with me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder why they would go so far? Stealing the Duelbots is one thing, but inflicting so much harm on regular people is too cruel. And what was that guy masquerading Jack about? How did they manage to make a copy that played so similar to the original is definitely scoop-material, since I doubt you can just mimic someone's Dueling style like that. They sure must have some futuristic machines with them... And it's weird how much he looked like the real deal, and he even talked a bit like him. I am lucky I managed to be there and take pictures of the whole thing... Huh? Was I there? I don't think I was. But I swear I saw someone who looked like Jack and had 3 Red Dragon Archfiends... I am not misremembering, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two were trying to sort their thoughts out, they felt like their chairs were getting comfier, but didn't bother to ponder too much on it. This was because their butts began to slowly grow in mass, and while Lana's would be explained by the fact that she was going through a accelerated puberty, the fact that Lio's was undergoing a similar process with his rear growing to match his sister's was certainly a little strange. In addition, Lana's shirt started to tighten a bit on her, revealing a bit of her figure while her brother's short sleeves were starting to lengthen together with his jacket, as they currently reached the middle of his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was also a certain event that was erasing itself from the twins' minds without them noticing. Their Duel against Lester, who used a similar Deck to the Ghost that Yusei fought, was slowly getting forgotten. While they still know that he is an enemy and how dangerous of an opponent he is, their battle was starting to fade from their memories, and were starting to think like they weren't the ones that fought Lester in the first place, but someone else entirely.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Upon looking at the clock, they saw that almost 45 minutes elapsed ever since they arrived. This surprised them a little, as they didn't expect time to go by so fast while they were deep in thought. \"I know Crow might be busy today as it's Saturday, but it is a little unexpected for Yusei to be running late. Although the young man did say something about finding a new place to shop for parts, and knowing him and his friend, they are bound to spend more time looking than actually buying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Jack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A mystery, as always. Only Yusei and Crow know where he is right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you call them to ask them where they are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would, but I am afraid I need to close the place for a bit. Me and my son need to go shopping ourselves, and I would be mad to let this place unlocked.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh... So we also need to leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can, but you may wait for them in front of the shop if you wish. They have the keys, so you will be able to get inside when they get here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were accepting to the idea of them waiting in the front, but something seemed to stop them from accepting the proposal. Suddenly, a certain location popped in their heads, one where a certain person seemed to visit frequently, and through him, the two also became familiar with the place as well. The place was Caf\u00e9 la Geen, a coffee shop which was known for selling very good, but also expensive coffee. And there was one person they knew that loved going there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time their began to lose their color, as they both were beginning to turn white, but there was a big difference between the way this was happening for each. For Lio, the material of his top was also becoming thinner and softer to the touch, while Lana's was turning white only partially, as some horizontal lines with the regular red coloring seemed to remain unchanged. They also began to feel a small pressure in their hips, as they were becoming wider. While the process wasn't as prominent for Lana, Lio's were actually stretching out to proportions that were now slightly bigger than his sister's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I was thinking of going after Jack.\", said Lana, which surprised her brother, while Zora raised an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Do you even know where he is right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might have an idea as to where he is. If Yusei returns, please tell him I'm sorry for leaving...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up.\", said the boy, drawing his twin's attention. \"If you know where Jack is, I am coming with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I also want to meet him. And it doesn't seem fair that you get to see him and I don't. Besides... there are also a few important matters I wish to discuss with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLana began to pout as both began to glare at each other a bit. Normally, there shouldn't be any reason for them to get angry at each other like this, but this time, both were starting to see each others as rivals of sorts, the other acting as an obstacle in their way to talk with Jack. While the main reason they were acting like this was a little foggy for them, another one was the fact that they started to not see each other as siblings anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem.\", said the older woman to the two, breaking their staring contest. \"If you two wish to argue, please do it outside. I will not bother you with your problem, as it's none of my business, but I would appreciate if you didn't start a fight over something as trivial as this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We understand\", said both siblings in unison with a grumble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. I will close this place in a few minutes. If you think you know where Jack is, please tell me next time we see each other. I need to know where exactly he is lazing off all day, while his friends are working.\" The stern tone she took, made the two sweat a bit, and feel bad for the old King a bit as they stood up and began to leave. As they were climbing up the stairs, Zora sighed to herself. \"I swear... Rivals in love are a lot more common these days, but it wouldn't hurt if those two would get along better. They showed before they can compromise, correct? Certainly, there must be a way to resolve this peacefully between them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, they were ready to start walking, when they noticed something near the house.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>In front of the building there was a Sector Security car, and it seemed that no one was inside. The twins didn't see the police car when they arrived, so they assumed the officer that was driving it left somewhere. But a few seconds later, their bodies aged up once again, as they quickly went through the years, turning eighteen as of this moment. Lana's figure matured further as her hips and butt grew proportionally with her, if not becoming a little bigger than average, while her chest grew to B-cup breasts. Her pigtails snapped as it straightened along with the rest of her hair, as the color continued to darken. As for Lio, his figure was resembling Lana's quite a lot, as his body didn't put on any muscle, leaving him quite slim, while his ponytail disappeared completely, his mane now touching only just below his neck. Along with the age progression, a few mental changes happened as well, which helped Lio realize who the car belonged to as he took a out a set of keys from his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you bring your car Lia?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I thought that it would help me find Jack faster. Now, if you excuse me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I'll come with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why? Can't you drive own car Cana?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do, but I left it at a car service today, as the engine got overheated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And is there a reason for me to take you? I don't recall there being a reason for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt should've confused the pair upon Lia refusal to go with Cana, and while they were a little scared deep inside, their relationship was already changing, which made the two didn't ponder too much on it. The memories they shared together were starting to differentiate, as they were slowly remembering different childhoods, in which they were apart from each other. This had an effect on their familial bond, as while they still considered to be a family at least for now, they no longer thought they were twins. In addition, they both got a few new interests, with Lia getting into management and police work, while Cana now enjoyed photography and writing reports.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Cana replied back: \"Because I know where he is right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do? Is it Caf\u00e9 la Geen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I've been there before with Jack before, so I know where it is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLia frowned at his sister's claim, and got a little irritated as he saw a small hint of pride in her smile. But while Lia knew Jack would be there, he didn't know the address, as he never was there before. Seeing that he needed someone to show him where it is, he reluctantly accepted. \"...Fine. You may come. But don't try and make me take a detour. We are going straight there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am alright with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was still a little tension between them, but they managed to find common ground, at least for now. The main reason they were acting the way they did was because of their desire to meet Jack in private for a more personal reason, which they didn't quite understand right now. Once both got in the car, Lia felt like his seating was a little more cushy than he remembered, but didn't think too much of it, unaware that his rear not only became a nice bubble-shape, but it actually was a little bigger than Cana's, something which he took a bit of pride in. With his new age, he also gained a driver's license, which made him perfectly capable of driving, and thus the two took off.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Are you certain we will get there faster this way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I've tested it myself. We might encounter more traffic lights, but it's not as roundabout. With a little bit of luck we might get there 15 minutes quicker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't say.... Fortunately, the traffic isn't so bad during weekends, so maybe it is worth a shot...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLia followed Cana's suggestion and followed her directions without objecting to it. He knew he could have used the GPS to find a faster route to the caf\u00e9, but thought that it wouldn't be so bad to know the usual way to get to there. And he knew this would be a good opportunity to ask his sister a few questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the car took a right, their jackets color slowly transitioned from pink to red for Cana and from white to a faded blue for Lia. Their appearance also changed, as the former's sleeves retracted completely, leaving her shoulders only covered by the shirt, while the fabric toughened a little, and for the latter it continued to grow alongside his shirt, as the material looked a bit softer and more expensive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way... I wanted to ask you a few things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are not personal are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I just wanted to know a few things...\", began Lia as he took a few glances at his passenger through the rear-view mirror before he went back to driving. \"First of all, why exactly did you go to see Jack's Duel with that impostor? It was quite dangerous from what I understood...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I was worried. It's not like I doubted Jack will win, but after I heard that copy had almost the same Deck he had, I knew I had to make sure he was fine. We both know he can get a little reckless when under pressure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand the feeling...\", mused the boy, somewhat satisfied with the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And besides...How many times do you see someone with Red Dragon Archfiend pretending to be Jack Atlas, and having a carbon copy of even his D-Wheel? You know that this is a scoop that any decent reporter would dream of. You saw how big it was in the paper the next day, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Cana's increased interest in journalism and even recalling a few times where she helped around for a local newspaper within her memories, it was becoming visible that she is eager in working as a reporter, and with her finishing high-school, she is happy to already learn the basics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your dedication sure is... something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. But in all honesty, I just wanted to be there for Jack. I know I can't do too much, but I am trying to offer my support. I can't be as reliable as Yusei when it comes to Dueling, but there's no way I won't be there to cheer for him if I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLia said nothing as he listened to the girl's declaration. He didn't want to admit it, but the fact that she cared so much about Jack, and because she seemed to care  about her work were both qualities he respected. During this time, their waists slimmed down quite a bit, with Lia's feeling a slight discomfort as his abdomen compressed down to be around the same size as Cana's, but he wasn't too bothered about the feeling to distract him from driving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what brought this about? It is a little strange for you to bring this up. Did you want me to describe how the Duel went? I wasn't there from the start, so I don't really know how it went down before I got there...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that... I just wanted to know your thoughts regarding the whole event, and what made you want to be there as much as you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Is it really so important?\", asked Cana, slightly confused by why her brother asked something like that, although deep down, she already had an idea s to why.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lia was initially reluctant to answer to the inquiry. One of the reasons being that not even he knew exactly where he was going with it. He didn't really get why he was suddenly so interested in knowing his sister's motives, before his mind underwent several changes to address the issue. New memories of him knowing Jack longer than he should entered his head, and along with this came new perspectives regarding the former champion. In exchange however, he lost a good portion of his memories of his childhood with Cana, but as the new thoughts emerged, he didn't feel bothered by it, actually finding this to be normal. Cana went though similar changes, as her several years of her younger years were replaced, with her brother slowly disappearing from her past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, Lia answered back, while still looking at the road. \"Do you remember when I told you I worked before as Jack's manager? Back then, there were plenty of people who looked up to him and wanted to try their hardest to take a photo together, have him sign something or shake his hand. After Yusei took defeated him, many of his fans left him. I kind of expected that to happen, but for that many to just shift their interest from him to someone else was certainly shocking. And some of the ones that remained didn't stick too long after that either. Since then, I wanted to make sure that if there wouldn't be someone who would go and praise Jack only to then give up on him after he disappointed them somehow... I don't him to go through all that again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So you think that I am that superficial to just abandon Jack, don't you?\", asked Cana as she started to get angry about the implications of Lia's words before he stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is not the case. I know you aren't such a person. After Jack lost his title, he became really downcast and then he went missing, and when I found him at that hospital, you were already there. I thought at first you were just a good Samaritan, but after that, Jack eventually got back on feet and during that time, he began talking about you from time to time... And then I got curious as to why he started to seemingly care so much about a person he didn't know too much about. Turns out you became quite an important figure to him after the short time you spent together... and I can't help but feel the same way too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he went on talking, their underwear began changing as well. Cana's pink panties dulled out to a dark blue, and lost its frills and ribbons, while Lia's white boxers darkened until they became pure black, with them also softening a little bit. Their hair shifted as well, with hers straightening out completely and continuing to grow further, while his now only touched his nape and some of his strands  became spiky as a result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir minds were further modified to suit the words that were coming from the boy's lips, with both of them gaining new memories that gradually replaced the old ones. As Cana listened, her previous anger was gone, as she listened intently to what her sibling had to say. There was a tinge of frustration somewhere in his tone, but it was a little surprising the fact that he acknowledged her to being someone really close to Jack. Which validated her feelings a bit, as she had quite the major crush on the former champion right now. As for what drove him to begin the conversation in the first place, she started to understand the reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And you feel that you didn't contribute enough to help him recover, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just that... I know him for such a long time, and I should know what to do if he ever feels depressed, but then a stranger appears out of nowhere, and not only they become friends, he actually helps him out without seemingly any major problem...\" It was evident from his voice that he was more angry with himself than with her, but Cana couldn't help but feel that she understand his emotions a bit.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Cana wanted to try and reassure Lia that there wasn't a reason to beat himself down the way she does, given that Jack was the type of person who almost never acknowledged his own weaknesses to others. But before she could do that, Lia then gave her an apologetic glance and averted her immediately after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And there was also what happened with the Dark Signers. I know you don't remember much, but... I never thought Sawyer would go as far he did just to cover his tracks but to learn what happened afterward was a shock for me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCana was confused by what did her former twin meant, but her memories appeared to be scrambled, as what happened during the span of a few weeks after meeting Jack became blurry. At first she thought she fought a Dark Signer together with her brother, but quickly brushed away that idea, deeming it something impossible. She could recall Dueling Sawyer after learning of some shady stuff regarding his background and practices, and then losing badly to him, getting injured in the process. After that, she could only recall several images and flashes of her trashing Sawyer, being comforted by Misty Tredwell about something, and then Turbo Dueling Jack before being defeated. The only thing that she remembered clearly was a pained, but caring look the former king gave her followed by complete darkness, as there wasn't anything that came to her mind past that moment. It wasn't until the whole ordeal was over, and regained consciousness that she learned of what she did, which made her quite remorseful of her actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, their bodies grew once again to twenty one years old, with their figures developing further. Cana's breasts grew to C-cups, while her top was now a white and blue striped-shirt that showed a bit of her bosom. As for Lia, his own shirt split opened, revealing his bare torso, before buttoning itself back up with its new additions, becoming a white collared blouse, as his back arched forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry Cary. I know I am digging up things you would rather not remember...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's fine... It is normal for you to bring it up, given that you pretty much supported him as much as you did while I was gone, which means you are aware of how I ended up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I shared Jack's sentiments about what happened and personally I would have never wished anyone to go through what you did. That's why I didn't stop him when he made it his misson to save you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I think it was natural for him to do that. When it comes down to feeling responsible for something, he is very stubborn. I am guessing you know that too, right Lina?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. I learned that the hard way after working with him for so long... I was happy that you came back to us in the end and I was grateful that you were a source of strength to Jack during the final battle, but...\" Lina sighed as she looked down. At the same time, I felt like I didn't contribute at all. I wanted to help him in any way I could, and I had the power to do so, and yet... When it came down to offer him moral support or words of encouragement, nothing came out of my mouth...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCary began to understand the reason Lina started the conversation, as it became apparent that she was disappointed in herself for feeling like he didn't do too much when he was a Dark Signer, and also a little jealous that she got to become closer to Jack, despite the fact she spent more time with him. Their hair completely changed color at this point, as her hair became pitch black, while Lina's went from violet to blue. The light then turned to green as he began driving once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...So that's why. Now it makes a lot more sense...\", said Cary to herself, as she rubbed her eyes, her eyesight starting to deteriorate as things became a bit more blurry to her.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Lina didn't seem like she wanted to continue the conversation, despite being the one who started it, something Cary did find a little ironic. But she understood that with how unwavering her answer was before, this maybe was the reason why he suddenly felt so down. Perhaps he wanted to find a flaw so that he might be able to feel better about himself or at least criticize her for it, but with the answer being seemingly a little too good than expected, Lina no longer had any desire to continue the conversation. Cary had a feeling why he didn't try to bring up what happened while she was under the Dark Signers' control, as she already figured out he was pretty much ignored by Jack during the time. She tried to think of something to say to make him feel better, but had a tough time doing this as she was getting constantly distracted by her increasingly blurry vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, her pants reached down to below her knees as they became a pair of blue jeans and her jacket became now a leather orange vest, while her black hair now reached down to her back and was styled like a downward arrow. As for Lina his plain white shorts fused together, forming a business skirt that showed a lot of his tantalizing legs, while his own jacket became  grayish-blue as it went further down at the back, reaching past his skirt, and his hair was not neatly trimmed, especially on the sides, with only a longer bang and a slightly wilder spike that pointed down covering his forehead. His belt also became more business-like and turned brown, while hers thickened and became a pink fanny-pack that was loosely tied around her waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than a couple of minutes later, the car took a sharp turn to the left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?

There should be a gas station not too far from where we are.\", said Lina, and true to his words, the station was just one hundred meters away from their current position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I also get out and buy something to drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Just make sure not to take too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the car was parked, both of them got of the vehicle, with Cary having a bit of difficulty walking straight as her vision kept worsening. Inside, Lina went inside the women's bathroom without noticing, while his sister stood behind, looking around the small shop. To call them brother and sister at this point however would be unreasonable, as they were no longer blood related. Physically, they barely looked like they were related anymore, as even their facial structures were starting to differentiate from one another. As for their memories, they no longer saw each other or any other sibling in their past, completely severing whatever familial bond they once had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd speaking of their memories, other than a few more details that needed to be changed, their new lives were pretty much complete. But there was one element in particular that was common for them: their crush on Jack Atlas. They were now deeply in love with him, and they weren't blind enough not to notice they were pretty much love rivals in this situation. But despite their mutual dislike, they still hold a reasonable amount of respect for each other, with their most recent talk possibly increasing it a bit as well.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As he pulled down his underwear, they quickly lost their legs and became lacier, turning into a pair of black panties. As he did his business, he couldn't help but think of his earlier conversation with his former sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It appears like she really is a decent person, just as I thought... I don't know why I even believed her to be any different. Anyone who would spend time with Jack long enough would eventually see his flaws and then leave, as their image of him is not as ideal as they thought. But Cary was there with him at his lowest, and kept being in touch of him lately. It is quite impressive that she till thinks that high of him after all this time, so I guess she is way above any regular fans...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring his monologue, his face morphed further, with his eyes changing into a pair of lovely golden orbs paired up with longer lashes, while his cheekbones went higher and his nose and ears growing smaller and his lips plumping up slightly. Also, his ears stung a bit as blue dangle earrings appeared, the pain from the holes in his lobes for them quickly vanishing, as his expression turned a little sour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Meanwhile, I, who have been his manager for a long time before, have barely seen him recently with all the work Sector Security has given me as its new chief of investigations, while Cary managed to spend a lot of time with Jack as her reports are mostly about him, thus her work actually is like a reward... I just don't get how things got this way. I used to be by his side all this time, and now I have been so busy, I barely have enough time to see him. He doesn't really need a manager right now, as he, Yusei and Crow need to focus on the Grand Prix, but I... I want to be closer to him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cheeks started to redden a bit as Lina thought about his crush.\" I want to go back to the days where we were barely able to be apart. I know it was Roman's suggestion to keep an eye on him for the sake of making sure he doesn't ruin his image, but after I found it he was a Dark Signer, I am guessing there might have been ulterior motives. Still, during that time, I realized I like him as a person. Yes, he needs to keep his pride in check, is very picky and a little spoiled at times, and has to stop acting to high and mighty now that he no longer holds the title of champion.. but his courage, his care for his close friends, his respectful side... I fell for him because of those traits of his. I am not going to say and Cary doesn't deserve to try to become his girlfriend, but... I feel like I am a little cheated right now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA black bra with a the same design as his panties materialized on his chest, subconsciously fixing a strap back on his shoulder. \"Is it because I am a guy? I kind of guessed he doesn't swing that way, but it still hurts a little... Also, I kind of wish Trudge would stop trying to court me. I didn't really thought he liked me until that invite to have dinner together. I appreciate the fact that he likes me, but I think I left behind enough hints for him to understand I don't see him as anything but a friend. I don't really know any other way to tell him that without hurting his feelings, so I hope he'll get the message. Still, if Trudge doesn't have any issue with me, I wonder why Jack doesn't really look at me that much... I sometimes wish I was a instead...\", said Lina under his breath as he wiped his boyhood with a small frown before pulling his clothes back on and then leaving the stall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon his wish would come true...</span></div></div>",

Keyword \"trying\", as she had difficulty seeing with her worsening eyesight. She wasn't getting as blind as a bat, but her surroundings were a little too foggy for her to properly see. She still could see the outlines of what was around her, and if people would come close enough, she would be able to see them properly, but currently, she was trying to stay a bit away from the other customers to not bump into them by accident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jeez, I didn't think my eyes were this bad... I don't think I had any issues in the car, but... Wait a second. Why am I not wearing my glasses? I thought I bought new ones after I got the prescription from the doctor. Where did I put them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to check her pockets unaware that a pink wristband materialized on her left arm. Upon checking her fanny pack, she breathed a sigh of relief as she pulled out a pair of tricfocal glasses that she promptly put on her face. And speaking of which, her features changed further, as her facial structure morphed into a slightly more mature visage that still looked a little goofy with the glasses she put on, after brushing two longer side bangs away, her face didn't resemble Lina's at all, as even her eyes changed to a gray color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Much better. I know it's been a while since last time I didn't war my glasses, but I didn't realize how hard it was to see. I can still figure out shapes and faces, but I guess I can't really go out anymore without them... Why didn't I put them on in the car though? I should have noticed they weren't on, or was I that absorbed by our talk that I forgot?... Sounds really implausible, but I can't really think of another reason... But then again, I don't seem to remember what I did early in the morning either. I know I stoop up late last night to finish the article, but maybe I was a bit too tired. Maybe I should've drank some more coffee...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her eyesight restored, Cary began looking around. While she had a little craving for sweets right now, she didn't see anything that would interest her, other than some candy she usually ate, but since she didn't get her monthly salary yet, she needed to be a bit more restrained with her money-spending. She decided to look for a beverage to have on the way, but as she did, she couldn't help but remember her conversation with Lina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he likes Jack as well as much as I do... Should have figured that out for a while now.\", murmured the young woman to herself. \"I kind of expected that would be the case, but I didn't think he would be this caring about their relationship. At first I thought it was just a crush and he wanted to keep it professional between themselves, but I see I was wrong. Although I did not anticipated she would value himself so little...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips turned into a sad smile, as she also felt the same way in a sense. She couldn't remember much during the time she was a Dark Signer, but she felt very guilty for turning on her friends and putting Jack into so much trouble. Unable to control her actions, and the fact that she couldn't do anything made her desire to at least help now. She wanted to somehow make it up to the old champion in some way, and thus tried to hang up with him more often. Cary was happy to see that her presence made some of his more subtle, traits such as his kindness from time to time, and was very happy he was still a caring individual beneath his boastfulness, like when he Dueled against that shady debt collector. After that event, she tried to write a few articles regarding the daily life of Jack Atlas based on her interactions with him, and while there weren't many people interested in that, there was a niche group that became avid readers of the newspaper because of this, much to her boss's pleasant surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I still try to be of as much use to Jack as possible even now, and I am flattered that he thinks I am that much of a source of support to him... But I guess that for Lina, she must feel like she is unable to do anything for him. Perhaps that's why she thinks she can't do much...\" As she leaned a bit to a wall in thought, her panties lost all of her frills and ribbons, making their overall design quite simplistic. Similarly, her cute pink bra that grew along with her chest did the same, and became dark-blue, just as its pair.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After Jack told her a bit about their shared past and Trudge described how she lead Sector Security, she came to like his word ethic quite a bit. He was almost like her boss, tough on the outside, but understanding on the inside, except he wanted to be more part of the action than just tell others what to do. Despite her dislike of him, she couldn't help but admit that as a person, she would be the adult some would look at as a role model, and deep down wanted to know how to do better herself to be more like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's why seeing him helpless when it came down to his love life was something that made her a little sad. While she was happy she was ahead of him when it came down to being close with Jack, she felt Lina would deserve a little bit more after all the effort she put in. At first, she was quite angry with how much he tried to divert Jack's attention from her, but given that the former king wasn't really interested in women in general at the time, it wasn't really a helpful act. She didn't really understood what exactly happened during the struggle against the Dark Signers, but she was happy that her crush paid more attention to her. It wasn't certain whether he saw her in a romantic light or not, but Cary definitely became someone Jack cared a lot nowadays. On the other hand, Lina became less and less prominent, as he was now busy with new duties, and as a result didn't spent as much time as he wanted with his love interest. Today's conversation pretty much confirmed the fact that he didn't give up on his love, but was now thinking quite lowly of himself due to his absence in Jack's life recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether with what Cary already knew, Cary sighed to herself wistfully. \"As much as I would want to get ahead of him, I guess deep down, I don't want to win this way...\", murmured the reporter. \"I understand where's she's coming from. Even now, I am not sure if Jack's into me or not, and for a while I thought our bond will be gone after we parted ways before. But I guess my fortune finally favored me for once and let me be with him more often. Although it looks like the same didn't apply to Lina. To work as hard as that, and not to be rewarded is something is plausible for everyone, but to lose confidence in yourself like that? I guess he was a bit more fragile that I thought underneath all that confidence. I really shouldn't be doing this, as most likely it will ruin my chances... but if there's one thing I believe in that should be karma. I think I have to do this because it is the right thing to do... Although I don't plan to give up! Not even one bit! My love for Jack is strong and pure and it won't go away any time soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Cary declared in her mind, her breasts grew one more time to medium D-cups that were outlined quite well by her outfit, as her new self was ready. Carly Carmine felt something was off for a brief second with her chest, before she brushed it off and went back to her earlier thought. \"I won't surrender to anyone. That's what I learned from Jack... But I can't leave her in the dumps like that, or there will be no satisfaction when everything will be over.\" With her mind set, she straightened back up and went back to looking for something to drink. As she checked her watch however, Carly raised an eyebrow. \"Still... What's taking her so long?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There are good reasons for Jack to like Cary, despite the fact that she isn't the ideal type of woman he would like. But being as devoted as she is, and the fact the fact that he appears to be enjoying her company, it must mean that if their relationship would take another step, it would most likely be a healthy one.... I just wonder what the reason I can't take that step with him too. I can't help that I am a male despite my feminine appearance, but is that really the only reason I can't do it? Other than Trudge, there hasn't been anyone recently that tried to approach me, so I am unsure if my gender is that much of an issue or not. Still... I really wish I was a woman sometimes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, his body began to heat up a little, making his cheeks flush, while his nipples tingled. They grew larger and more sensitive while their color lightened to a soft pink, with the tiniest of bumps forming underneath them. Meanwhile, his boyhood, which curiously didn't grow at all ever since the changes started to grow smaller as a pulling sensation affected his testes. His mind was now slowly drifting away back into his thoughts as everything seemed to get a little blurry, Lina needing to grab onto the sink as he felt lightheaded. However, he seemed completely unaware that something was wrong with his body, and instead focused on his dilemma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...I am sure Jack would like someone that more assertive when the situation needed. Someone who isn't afraid to speak their mind when he puts himself or his career and image at risk and who would look after him when he was feeling down or alone... Cary already fills the role of a potential lover, but so do I. Perhaps I am not really as outspoken or casual with him as she is, but I know him a lot better, and I know what he needs... The main problem is that he keeps so much to himself that sometimes it makes me wonder if he will ever open up to someone else who is not Yusei or Crow. It makes me kind of jealous of those two strangely enough. But in all honesty, I want to be as acknowledged as Cary and the guys... It feels like I've just taken a back seat because of my new post, and the time I spend with him is no longer enough it seems. If only there was something I could do that would draw his attention to me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was still thinking, his chest started to rise as the small bumps grew into a set of A-cup breasts that slowly continued to grow, pushing his bra and top out a bit. His boyhood also lost half of its original size and kept diminishing, as his testes were partially pushed inside his own body. During the process, his brain buzzed as his thoughts grew more hazy, as the new memories he gained regarding him and Jack made him a tiny bit turned on. Also, he began to think that the idea of him being a male was untrue, as he was having trouble identifying himself as a boy or girl, his initial disappointment regarding his gender being slowly erased from his head.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We don't really have the same hobbies, I don't know anything about Duel Runners, and when it comes down to Dueling, I... wait a minute... Perhaps there is something.\" While contemplating, his breasts became B-cups and kept growing, as his testes were completely pulled inside him, turning into a pair of ovaries. \"Of course! I built a new Deck recently and Trudge said it was a pretty good one. It still needs some work on it, but I am sure it's a lot better than Carly's. Hmm, I wonder if he will accept a causal match if I am to ask him. Well, he has to, it's not like he is as busy as before to refuse a Duel when he wants anymore, especially if it's from me. And if he isn't convinced, I guess I just need to pressure him a bit. After all, I know him too well to not be able to push his buttons a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lina chuckled to himself at his own comment, he realized something. It wasn't tied to his former sister's new name, but rather something in regards to his earlier statement. \"...Yeah. Maybe I should do that more often. Even if I can't spend enough time with Jack, that doesn't mean I can't try to have him meet me more often. I can be as bold as Carly in terms if invitations without needing to act any different than how I usually am. There's really no reason Jack would refuse me. Since he doesn't really grasp the idea of a date, I can just say we're seeing each other for the sake of reminiscence of the past, or \"a personal, but business related meeting\"... or perhaps I can even suggest a Duel. That way, I can learn more about him while we battle. I don't think he ever faced a Deck like mine in a long while, so he might be interested to see how he would fare against it.. Heh. I bet I am way better than Carly in terms of Dueling, given that I barely saw her in action and challenge someone to a battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more his confidence grew, so did so breasts, until they turned into large C-cups that were nicely shown through his shirt. While Carly's chest was bigger, Lina had a larger hips and butt, which made her to be slightly proud that she could keep up with his love rival in terms of assets. His boyhood continued to shrink until it was invisible through his panties, barely an inch long in terms of size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I still have a long way to go to even be as close with Jack as Carly is, but I know him better, and as we have a shared past together, he isn't in a position where he can outright deny my requests. I just have to know when to ask him to come see me and to make sure my schedule isn't too busy. Perhaps I can even ask him when we get to the caf\u00e9. Sure, I still need Carly to make some space for that to happen, but a few minutes is all I need. I may need to build some more courage to outright ask him on a real date... and perhaps an even better Deck in the future, but I am confident I can end up as his girlfriend... Jack Atlas needs someone who will support, but also who will keep him grounded. Someone who is strong enough to keep up with him and not back down when a problem arises. Carly may be devoted, but so am I! After all, what kind of manager or police chief would I be if I wasn't brave enough to express myself and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, his body heated up further, as the blush on his cheeks became more visible. Between his legs, his boyhood completely disappeared as new opening appeared in its stead. The the flower bloomed, the mental changes regarding her gender finished as well, as her transition to Mina Simington, the Chief of Sector Security and former assistant of Jack Atlas, was completed. It took the woman less than 30 seconds to recover, as she shook her head in confusion over what happened, the heat from before vanishing just as quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that...? For a second there, I felt really weird. It was almost like a hot flash... And my mind is a little hazy too... Wait, how long did I stay here? I need to leave.\", said Mina to herself in urgency as she turned off the water, tried her hands quickly with a paper towel and then exited the restroom.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Upon eye contact, the reporter called her, as she asked her a little concerned: \"Are you okay? What took you so long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just deep in thought, that's all. I hope I didn't make you wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. I was just paying for our drinks just now. You can go ahead and start the car. I'll be coming in a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina nodded in response, slightly surprised at how Carly acted. Normally she would be slightly more irritated and complain about how slow she was, before saying that they should hurry. However, she seemed a lot calmer this time, despite the fact that this was a matter regarding Jack, and thus she was curious if something happened while she was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then got back to the car and turned it on, with Carly coming a couple of minutes later, with two bottles of iced coffee in her hands. When she got inside, the two left and got back on the road once again. After giving a couple of directions, she passed down one of the bottles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go. I made sure it's one of the good ones, so it should taste a lot better than instant coffee, that much I can assure you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\", said the driver as she took a sip of her drink, enjoying the caffeine and the slightly bitter taste while she continued to drive. At one point, when she took a glance at Carly and saw that she was thinking hard about something. Before she could say anything however, her passenger began talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You shouldn't think of yourself so low.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean it. There's really no need to for you think that you aren't important or useful to Jack in any way. I know you two didn't meet with each other too much lately, but that's not a reason to think he doesn't value you.\" Mina was surprised by her friend's words, but decided to listen to see where she was going. \"...In my opinion, you have the qualities of a great person. You're smart, you don't shy away from sharing their opinion and you show good leadership over the members of Sector Security. And I am a little jealous of you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... I mean, you are very mature and mentally strong, and you are a lot more organized than I ever was. Meanwhile, I still goof off from time to time, don't really take care of myself too much and I don't see myself as a leader or anything of the sorts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But still... You are much more out-spoken than I am and much more attentive to other's feelings. Ever since I started working for Rex Goodwin, I haven't spent much time on regular relationships and instead focused on my work. Even after I became Jack's manager, I didn't really open up to others, except for him. It wasn't until recently after I was named the new chief of police that I managed to socialize more, but even so, I can't help but feel that I am too stiff around others. But you... you can talk so openly to people. I don't know if it is in your nature, or it is something you learned after you became a reporter, but despite the fact that you are a little awkward sometimes, you have a much more pleasant personality and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina's words were interrupted by Carly's soft giggle, which made her a little confused as to what she found amusing, before she replied: \"Thanks for thinking about me like that. I am sure that we could go on and on with this conversation, where we will just try to compliment each other while finding another flaw in ourselves... But let's be honest, we are both not feeling sure of ourselves because of Jack, right?\" As she was met with silence from her companion, Carly continued. \"We are thinking that we are not up to standard in terms of relationships, and we let that influence the way we see ourselves. But given that we just countered a bad trait with a good one for each other, I think it's safe to say that we aren't that unsuitable in having a relationship with Jack... So listen up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina fortunately had to stop at another traffic light when she had a finger pointed towards her. \"I don't plan to give up on Jack! There's no way that will happen, at least not without a fight. And you should think the same. We don't plan to just surrender our potential boyfriend to someone else on a whim, do we? But I don't want to hear anything about being unfit or unworthy. No one is perfect in this world, and neither is love. When Jack will make his decision, I will respect his decision, but until then... don't ever put yourself beneath me just because you are a little too busy with your work to talk with him. I wouldn't be satisfied if my \"love rival\" let me win because of a lack in confidence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe declaration stunned her for a second, before a fire started to burn in her eyes. Carly's words and her earlier decision made Mina realize that she shouldn't underestimate herself anymore. If even Carly thinks that she should be more assertive, then that meant only one thing for her. \"Don't worry. I don't plan to give up. Let's settle who gets to win Jack over fair and square. But don't worry, I will make sure to offer you support when you might be feeling down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you now get overconfident? Well, we will see who wins in the end.\", replied Carly with a small grin as they both looked at each other intently, before they heard a honk from behind. Seeing that the light already turned green, Mina quickly drove off, the pair giggling a bit at how distracted they were as they drank from their coffee.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The pleasant aroma surely is relaxing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was slowly taking another sip from his Blue-Eyes Mountain, a beverage he considered to be worthy of its renown and price. While it was true he considered it a little expensive, for him it wasn't really a matter of money, but rather taste. And besides, compared to the liquor he drank back when he was still a champion, the coffee was a lot more affordable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can never really get tired of this taste. It's so exquisite and yet so delicate at the same time. I don't expect Crow to have such well-developed taste buds to make a difference between this and his cheap instant coffee. If he did, he wouldn't admonish me for paying as much as I do...\", said Jack under his breath as he enjoyed both the taste as well as the quiet atmosphere of the caf\u00e9. Since it was a Saturday, most customers would rather come later in the afternoon, thus he was currently on his own right now. He was a little curious where Stephanie, his waitress, disappeared. She said she wanted to show him something, and ran back inside, but five minutes passed and there was still no sign of her. Not that he really paid too much attention to, as between sips, he mind went back to his earlier dilemma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where was I...? Ah yes, something to do about those two...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since the Dark Signers have been dealt with, the former champion had plenty of spare time to himself, now that he no longer held his title. That's why other than his time spent working on his D-wheel, relaxing and drinking coffee, he noticed something regarding Carly and Mina. They were fighting a lot. At first, he didn't really understand why. He never thought the two really hated each other, so to see them argue so often was indeed strange for him. It wasn't until one day when he accidentally eavesdropped on one of their arguments, he realized why they fought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you bothering Jack so much lately? Didn't he say he wants to relax before the tournament?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bother? I just want to talk with him. Now don't take it out one me just because you're jealous I get to spend more time with than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What? That's untrue! I don't want to disturb him, that's all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he never said anything that I was a nuisance, so I guess he might like me a bit more than you huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom that exchange, and from what came afterward, Jack needed a minute to digest the information. It was quite obvious what it was all about, and even now, he was not sure how to take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To think those two like me... Even now I find it shocking...\" The tabloids did lie when they said he was someone who understood a woman's feelings, but he was able to pick up at least that much. While he did feel a little flattered and proud of himself, he was nonetheless more than a little lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMina was the one that helped him climb the stair to success. She was also the most dependable person he ever met back then, and despite a rocky beginning due to how strict she was, they managed to form a relationship based on mutual respect and trust. Meanwhile, Carly was the individual that was right next to him after his defeat against Yusei and helped him a lot in seeing past his pride. And after all she was put through, the fact that she is able to smile like that makes his day a tiny bit better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... Where to even begin... They both have their flaws, obviously, but it is hard to find their company unpleasant. However, I am not experienced enough to know why or how they might've fallen for me. And unfortunately, I can't really think of a way to ask them outright about it. On the other hand, I really wish they would stop arguing all the time. There must be some way for them to not always be at each other's throats...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing his name being called, he looked to his side and saw Carly waving to him, and Mina walking next to her. What was a little surprising was the fact that they both had a smile on their faces, and seemed more focused on him rather than bickering. \"Well... This ought to be interesting...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Both women took a seat next to their crush, with Jack noticing that even when they were this close to him and to one another he couldn't really sense the same tension that usually existed between them whenever he was around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what were you doing? I hope we don't interrupt you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all. I only arrived here a few minutes ago. Me, Yusei and Crow were supposed to further work on our D-Wheels this morning, but we found out we were still in need of some more equipment, so Yusei and Bruno went to look for the parts we are missing, while Crow went back to focus on his deliveries. As for me, I decided to use my time on a bit of relaxation. Thus I decided to take a stroll around town and check up on a few things before I came here. By the way, do you girls want some coffee? It is very good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, actually, we each had one on our way here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But us aside... are you sure you can spend this much money? Didn't Crow get mad at you last time you did this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well he says that, but he quite a cheapskate, given he at times, he has us eat the spare fried chicken he has left after the deliveries. While I can appreciate the taste, it sure gets a little repetitive lately...\", said Jack as he took another sip, while the girls gave a small nervous laughter. \"But that aside, you two look like you are in god spirits. Don't get me wrong, I am glad there doesn't seem to be any animosity for one another anymore, but I am curious if something happened that I am not aware of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Mina and Carly nodded and smiled at each other a bit, before the latter began talking. \"Well, on our way here, Mina was nice enough to pick me up from your place, as my car is under repairs right now, and we had quite a lengthy conversation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We decided that we should stop with our childish banter for the moment, and instead would spend more time knowing a bit more about each other. The two of us came to the conclusion that it would be a good starting point to overcome our previous feuds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you don't say.\", said Jack now more than a little intrigued. For them to be able to bury the hatchet would seem improbable, especially after seeing how heated some of their arguments were, but for them to act so casual meant that whatever they talked about was something quite important. \"And how are you going to progress from now on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for starters, I was thinking of spending a bit of time to see what the other does on a regular basis. And honestly, I kind of like Mina's work ethic, and I want to find out if I can implement it. I need to please my boss a lot after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I want to be able to talk more freely around people, and learning from someone who has taken a few interviews before might be a good opportunity... And also... We agreed to help each other out with some of our more personal goals... Or rather a goal we both have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. We both want the same thing, and it is kind of like a race of sorts. It might be a competition, but we decided to try and aid each other and have a fair and square battle, where both have equal chances. It might not be the best way to achieve what we want, but it is what we consider to be the most honorable way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair both nodded at each other in acknowledgment of their decision. They both loved Jack and were not willing to have their romance unfulfilled in any form. But to accomplish this dream, they still had to be themselves while doing this. Despite the fact they will always be at odds when it came down to making any advances, when it came down to personal support and encouragement over not only their love affair, but their lives in general, they both decided to become friends and to possibly remain close even after one of them officially wins.  While they both were now looking peaceful, beneath their gazes lied a fire that said \"I will win! So no hard feelings.\" that would make their future interactions quite interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Jack, who realized what the whole conversation was about, brought to cup to his lips and closed his eyes, trying to cover his inner turmoil. \"Help each other? Are they serious? I didn't think they would actually find common ground over something like this. I guess I am happy for this development, as now they won't be bickering... Wait, does this mean I have a love triangle? And that I have to make my choice soon? If I had Mina's stubbornness with Carly's nonchalance... Oh boy... Well, I have to figure out how to deal with this as soon as possible. I can't really make up my mind which one is better for me without proper thinking. I am just glad there isn't another one...\", he murmured under his breath as he finished his cup and began to chat with the two women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh....\" Next to the door, Stephanie was growling as she stared at the newly arrived pair. \"I just went upstairs for a few minutes to show Jack this new dress I bought, and I return to this?! How am I supposed to make myself noticed by him if they are here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day was fairly normal for Jack, with his only slight surprise being that Leo and Luna didn't come to the garage anymore today after the boy made such a big fuss about coming to check on their work after they got a little sick. But that wasn't really on his mind at all, as he went to sleep wondering about his romantic future...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As she pulled over, she looked at where it had landed. Out of curiosity she walked over to it and picked it up. As she did, she saw it was blank. \"Hm? What is this? Theres no text or image.

That light had made her go unconscious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what happened\" Tori said as she stirred and got up although she noticed something was off. Her voice was different sounding, much more deep and woman-like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what happened to my voice\" she asked to no one in particular. She also felt heavy in her chest area. Looking down she saw a pair of giant breasts attached to her chest. \"W-WHAAT HAPPENED? My breasts, they are huge\". She said. As she stood up her breasts bounced and jiggled up and down from the motion, showing their hugeness. They were twice the size of grapefruits as they jutted out with gaping cleavage on a too tight white and pink low cut top. She squished one of them with her hands. It felt soft and marshmallow like and she could feel it was a part of her, confirming they were real. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then looked at her hand. Her fingers were longer and adult like, along with perfectly manicured pink nails that looked like they were long enough to be claws with rounded tips. On her right wrist is a bracelet covered in diamonds. She looked down at herself. Again she sees her giant jiggling breasts nestled in their place on her chest but also saw her clothes had changed into the aforementioned low cut white and pink top that showed her toned and very slim waist. Her skirt was a bright pink as it was just as ridiculously short as most of the skirts she owned. Finally her shoes were replaced with brown open toed heels showing her bare feet. She also noticed how much taller she became as she now towered at 6 ft. Above her breasts she noticed she now had a necklace..or rather a large tight golden choker with a heart shaped jewel on it. Feeling something on her ears she raised her hands to them. A pair of heart shaped earrings dangled from her ears. She noticed a nearby puddle and ran over to it. Her face was different as her eyes now had larger eyelashes and her lips with big pink and puffy. She also saw her hair..her very long hair. The ribbon in it tying her bun together stayed but the rest of her hair grew and extended down to her legs as if a green cascade of water was flowing from her head. Last she felt tightness in her backside, which leads to her putting a hand on her butt. Her butt was now huge and jiggly and round as she squished the blobby bottom and felt how soft it was like her breasts. It jiggled and swayed no matter how softly she moved, showing how much fat was in it as it pushed her skirt and almost revealed itself from how much it pushed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyaaaaah, what happened to me!? Why do I look like some sort of porn star\" Tori shouted out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh could you not yell\" said a familiar but different sounding voice. Tori turned around and noticed an even bigger shock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yuma\"? She said scared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats wrong Tori\" Yuma said then noticed his voice was different. It sounded like his sister Kari's or similar to it. He quickly got up and noticed things were very different. \"W-WHATS GOING ON\" he, or rather she asks. As Yuma stood he noticed how he was much taller. More than that he noticed he now had a giant pair of breasts on his chest. They jiggled with his every movement as he shook his body to try and remove them, not comfortable with this change. \"What are these things? Get'em off me\" Yuma said as he shook left and right as his breasts sloshed and swayed. It was to no avail. Tori could only stand and watch in fascination as Yuma shook himself while his breasts bounced and jiggled wildly. He then noticed his shirt changed into a red low cut top like Tori's, exposing his now girlish very slim midriff as his breasts show their massive cleavage through the top of his top, as well as a pair of tight white pants with his bare feet in red heels. He then noticed his hands have become a woman's with red sharp nails and a gold bracelet on his left wrist. His head and face had completely changed shape to be more like a girl's, more bigger and softer eyes and eyelashes along with big red puffy lips. On his neck was his emperor's key, unchanged but also a necklace with a green jewel on it. He felt his ears and felt earrings. He had a pair of star shaped earrings. His hair kept his pink highlights but they were now longer and draping his face. The black portion of his hair was super long and went down to his butt, which was also super huge, jiggly and round and made his pants feel tight. Finally Yuma was going to confirm of he really had changed into a girl and sure enough, when he went to feel his member, there was nothing but flatness. He was now a she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaaah what happened! I'm a girlwhatsgoingonwhydiditurnintoagirl\" Yuma said in a panic all at once. She cupped her massive breasts with both hands.

Whats that card you've got there, Jaden?\" Jesse asked as he walked up next to him to get a better look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I just found it.\" he responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure looks weird.\" Syrus remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And useless. Its completely blank.\" Chazz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, the card began to glow, and emitted a bright light that engulfed the group.</span></div></div>",

He was glad to see that nothing happened to her, but the same could not be said for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis, you ok\" Jaden asked, realizing wih a shock that \"his\" voice was softer and higher pitched. He put his hand up to his throat and felt it to see why he sounded so high pitched and looked at his hand, it was womanly with long fingernails and slender fingers, along with what looked like a bracelet. As Alexis unshielded her eyes she looked in front of her and was shocked at what she saw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-Jaden\" Alexis said. \"What\" he said again with his higher pitched voice. He looked down and was shocked to see that he now had breasts. \"Aaaahh\" he screamed as he fell down in panic of his new body. He was now a girl. \"Um, maybe you want to look in the mirror\", Alexis said as she pulled out a little mirror from a makeup kit in her miniskirt. Flipping it open she let Jaden see what \"she\" now looked like. Her hair was longer, reaching down to her back similar to Alexis' hairstyle except with the little tuft still going up from the back of her head. Her lips were a bit more visible and her eyes had longer eyelashes. Her ears now had circle shaped earings. Her arms were now slender and toned. In addition her wrists had two golden bracelets, adding to her new girl body. She was still wearing the Slifer red Uniform, only it was now sleeveless and unbuttoned, showing her shirt that was still black with her breasts pushing up against it. They weren't as big as Alexis' but they still pushed normally. Her jeans were gone and replaced with a white miniskirt. Seeing as her pants were now gone her deck box hung at the hem of her skirt. On her feet were a pair of high heeled boots that were basically a red version of the Obelisk blue female uniform's boots, and judging from the feeling on her heels, she could tell that she wasn't wearing socks anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I'm a girl\" Jaden said. Normally he would panic like crazy but since fusing with Yubel he had a more calmer, mature grip on his situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Jaden, you'll get back to normal, we just have to find that card and-\" suddenly she was cut short by a girly shriek. Both Jaden and her turned around too see what the commotion was about. It was Syrus, he had turned into a girl as well. Sitting in panic of her transformation she looked upon herself. She looked to have gotten shorter by half an inch and her eyelashes were elongated like Jaden's. \"Her once upside down W shaped hair had grown longer and flowed down her back, touching the ground since she was sitting. His lips were now visible and he also had earings only they were triangle shaped. She had breasts as well but they were small compared to Jaden's and Alexis'. They still pushed against her shirt a bit however, which by the way was now white under a sleeveless Ra yellow girls uniform, showing her shoulders. Her pants changed into a skirt and her feet had yellow boots with her socks gone like Jaden's, and presumably Alexis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Syrus\" Jaden said, in her girl voice. She ran over to Syrus to help her. \"Jaden, y-your a girl too? Whats going on, whats happening\" \"Just calm down Syrus\" Jaden said, putting her hand on Syrus' shoulder. Possibly the new emotional course in her body doing it,  Syrus felt calmer with Jadens reassuring long fingernailed hand on her shoulder.\"Thanks, Jay, but we've gotta turn back to normal\" Syrus said. . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd better find everyone else to\" Jaden said. \"Right\"alexis added in agreement. So the three ran ahead to find Chazz, Jesse, and Hassleberry, Jaden's earings dangling and her high heel boots clacking while Syrus hair blew the wind from how long it was. The two still not used to their bodies and jewelry. (Wow, their even girlier than I am) Alexis thought, which in a way was true.</span></div></div>",

Just then Alexis asked \u201cSo Jaden\u201d, she turned around to face Alexis, hair flowing in the same way Alexis\u2019 was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah?\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe we should start thinking about what your new names should be, you know, in case you\u2019re stuck like this for a while\u201d. Jaden and Syrus both stopped to think for a bit, their heads looking up in thought, letting their new long hair touch their lower backs as their heads tilted up.  \u201cWell how about Jade and Cynthia\u201d, Alexis said, pointing to Jaden and Syrus respectively, a smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyrus then said in her little girl voice that was high pitched \u201cThis isn\u2019t funny Alexis, both of us could be stuck like this forever and I\u2019m feeling more like a girl and less like me every second\u201d she said in a panic. She grabbed her long hair and pulled it in a panic and said \u201cI don\u2019t want to look like this\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden stood there and had to admit, Syrus was right, he was starting to feel different the longer he stayed a girl. The thoughts of combing her new long hair and looking at flowers flowed through her head, though her love of dueling was still intact. As for Syrus, she was more prone to cry in this situation more than if she was still a boy. \u201cWait Alexis\u201d Jaden said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d said Alexis. \u201cI think Syrus is right. I am starting to feel a little bit different. We\u2019d better fix this and fast before something else happens to us\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen let\u2019s get going\u201c Alexis said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe should find the others first\u201d Jaden said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyrus though, was checking her new breasts a bit. While small, they still poked against her shirt a bit and out of curiosity she decided to poke one a bit on the side. \u201cMan, this is so weird\u201d. And so they ran, Jaden and Syrus\u2019 jewelry jingling and high heel academy boots clacking once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had stopped as soon as they found the others. However it was a bit strange seeing what they saw. Blair, Mindy and Jasmine, who were alright, were on the ground laughing hysterically. A familiar looking girl with black hair stood with her arms crossed, an angry expression on her face. \u201cWait, who\u2019s that\u201d Syrus asked, her little girl voice sounding curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I know\u201d said Jaden, her girl voice announcing with its usual high pitched tone. From the spiky tip of her hair Jaden recognized the girl as Chazz, though not exactly the same. Her hair was long and kept its spiky pattern on the top while going down to her back. Her high heel boots a black version of the Obelisk blue girl shoes, her pants now a little black miniskirt that rode a little up her knees and her legs slim and toned like Jaden\u2019s became. Her waist now thin and her hips were now wide similar to Jasmine and Mindy. They stretched her open and now sleeveless black jacket, revealing a purple top. She now had breasts that were bigger than Jaden or Syrus\u2019 new ones, revealing a bit of cleavage through her top. Her arms slim and toned as well and adorned with black bracelets hanging from her wrists, dangling with each movement chazz\u2019s female arms made. Her hands had thin, long fingers with the natural feminine long fingernails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the girl Chazz stood another familiar girl who could be none other than Hassleberry. Her skin tan and smooth like the boy Hassleberry, but her arms, now no longer muscular were skinny and well toned, with her wristbands being replaced with two thick bracelets. Her new breasts pressed together in her shirt, revealing some cleavage. The shirt revealed a bit of her smooth midriff, no longer consisting of rock hard abs but now toned and flat, showing her naval. Her pants became shorter, reaching only up to her ankles, while her shoes became smaller to accommodate her smaller feet. Her legs became slimmer but still a bit muscular while her face had long eyelashes and visible lips. Her hair still in braids but now longer. Still keeping her general status, she was easily the tallest out of all the girls and former boy girls and it could be told that she had a southern country girl accent from the high pitched oohs and aahs she was uttering looking at her new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly was Jesse, who changed quite a bit in her girl form. She had longer eyelashes and clear toned skin. Her hair was long and pulled into a ponytail that ran down her back, a pair of bangs framing her eyes. Her shirt now transformed into a dress that ran down to her with puffy sleeves and a rather large pair of breasts pushing against the collar of the dress, revealing quite a bit of cleavage as they were squeezed within the confines of it. Her feet had white slippers and black stockings going up, stopping past her knees. Her arms and legs slim and toned as usual and her waist thin and hips wide, pushing at the sides of the dress. Curiously she was poking and squeezing her breasts a bit, her long nailed fingers poking the flesh that was showing a bit. \u201cPretty weird\u201d she said, her voice now high pitched while still as southern as it always was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, over here\u201d Jaden yelled with her high pitched girly voice as she ran, earring jingling and boots clacking loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJaden, so you\u2019re a girl too\u201d Hassleberry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, looks like we all are\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU\u201d a deep sounding girl voice screamed only to be discovered as Chazz. He she was now running towards Jaden, furious. She grabbed her by the collar, long nails cleaving into the cloth of the collar while her long hair swished up and down as she had a fit of rage. \u201cThis is all your fault, you did this to me\u201d she shouted at the female Jaden, loud new girl voice screaming at a higher pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyrus grabbed Chazz by her long coat and tried to pull her back. \u201cHey stop it, it\u2019s not his fault, he didn\u2019t know what the card was going to do\u201d Syrus said loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet lost shrimp\u201d Chazz shouted back. It appeared to Jaden as though becoming girls had intensified their emotions, though it didn\u2019t really show on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis, Blair, Jasmine and Mindy watched with embarrassment as the new girls were acting ridiculous, save for Jaden who was being held up by Chazz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Jaden was being gripped by Chazz, Syrus was crying on the floor after Chazz pushed her down, ovewhelmed by becoming a girl and beng pushed down on top of it. Hassleberry was calming her down as she cried and Jesse, lost in his/her own world, jiggled her new breasts, squeezing them within her dress as she watched them wobble back into place when she let them go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding she had enough Alexis put on a stern angry face and walked. She clacked her high heeled boots and she marched over to Chazz. \"Hold on Alexis, where are you going\" Blair asked. \"Yeah, shouldn't we wait until they've stopped\" Mindy said. But Alexis ignored the two friends in the back and grabbed Chazz by the collar. Pulling her by the collar she yanked Chazz away from Jaden, who caught her breath after being held up by the collar and fixed it afterwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alexis, what are yo-OW\" Chazz said as he was being pulled by the ear by Alexis. \"That's enough. All of you get in line\" she said. asserting herself and taking command of the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyrus and Hassleberry both got up after Syrus fhad inally stopped crying. They stood up and got in line next to Jaden, Jesse and Chazz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, its obvious that you're all overwhelmed by turning into girls, but overreacting like this is not going to solve anything\" she said. Jaden and Syrus looked at each other while Hassleberry and Jesse looked down in shame. Chazz simply turned her head, obviosuly retaining her pride in not admitting she was overwhelmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis crossed her arms over her chest continued. \"There's nothing that can be done at the moment and we're all going to have to cope with this new change. You all are going to have to get used to your new bodies. In fact, I will teach you\" Alexis said. the boy/girls looked up at her as she said this. \"Me, Blair, Jasmine and Mindy will teach you the proper etiquite, poise, and behavior of a girl. You all are going to talk like girls, walk like girls and most importantly- Alexis walked up to Chazz and looked her in the face as she continued \"BEHAVE like girls. Untl we can fix this problem\" Alexis said as she finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\" the 5 girls said in unison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, we're gonna have to pick out some new names for you to accomadate your current forms\" Alexis said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaden we know your girl name will be Jade\" Alexis said. \"Jaden nodded in acceptance of her new name.<br>\r\n\"Syrus, your Cynthia of course\". Syrus nodded emotionally.<br>\r\nAlexis turned to the other 3 girls and decided to which names to pick for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Hassleberry she said. \"Hassleberry, your new name will be Tina Hassleberry\" she said. \"Yes ma'am\" she said in a female version of her general tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesse, your Jane Anderson\" she said. \"Alrighty then\" she said in a higher pitched feminine version of her southern drawl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for Chazz\" she said, turning to Chazz. \"You'll be Charolette\" she said. Chazz immediately dissaproved of the name. \"Charolette, what\" she said. angry she lashed back and said. \"No way, I'm not gonna be Charolette\" she said, swerving her skinny arm to the right in disapproval, jingling the bracelet on her right arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any better ideas\" she asked. Mindy and Jasmine laughed in the back at Chazz's predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving up, Chazz crossed her arms and said \"fine\".<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Ok, we've got names for you, now lets start moving\" Alexis said. Turning around she swayed her hips and rear as she walked. \"'Sigh' this is gonna be a long day\" Jaden, or Jade said. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the light died down, they rubbed thier eyes in an attempt to clear their vision. When they all looked around wondering what happened, they were met with a shocking sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of Jaden where Alexis had been was a boy with short blond hair. He was weaing a blue coat that was the standard uniform for male members of the Obelisk Blue dorm. His face looked oddly familiar, kida resembling Atticus and... \"Alexis? Is that you?\" Jaden asked, also noticing that 'his' voice sounded much different, and had a softer tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy nodded. \"Ja-Jaden?\" the boy that was actually Alexis asked, noticing that 'her' voice sounded deeper, which alerted her to the changes, and how she was now a he. As Alexis took in his changes, Jaden started to notice the changes that had happened to 'him.' \"He' was a girl! Her brown hair had grown a bit, and now went down a few inches past her shoulders, though it still resembled how her hair had been when she had been a boy, only really having gotten longer. Her clothes had changed. Still wearing the Slifer Red blazer, it now lacked sleeves. It was also worn open like when she was male, showing her she still wore a black shirt, which evidently also was sleeveless. She also had on a white skirt. On his feet were a pair of of heeled boots that looked just like those that the Obelisk Blue girls wore, only red, while on her hand were red versions of the fingerless gloves that Alexis used to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked around to the others, he saw that the two of them hadn't been the only ones changed. All of their friends had apparently changed as well! Where Chazz had stood was now a girl with her black hair styled at the top like Chazz's, but now was much longer, and went down her back. She wore the standard Obelisk Blue girl's uniform, but over it was Chazz's signature black coat, and black boots versions of the standard blue ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby, Jesse had now wore a white dress with with short sleeves, a larger version of her previous vest that was closed. She also had black stockings that went up to her knees and a pair of white shoes. Her hair hadn't grown much, and was now much neater as it was pulled back into a high, short ponytail, with a a pair of bangs framing her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the now female Syrus, she had on what appeared to resemble the Obelisk Blue girl's uniform, but what was blue on the normal uniform was instead yellow on her new attire, showing that it was apparently a Ra Yellow version of the girl's uniform. Her hair was now much longer, and was tied into a braid that went down to her mid back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Hasslberry, in place the once muscular boy was now a tan girl who was on the tall side, who was the tallest amongst them by a few inches. Her hair had evidently remained the same, still in dreadlocks, and she still wore her dinosaur bandana. Her sleeveless Ra uniform had remained the same, abut her green t shirt nw showed her midriff, and his cargo pant had become shorts that went to her knees. And on her feet were still the same combat boots, though apparently now made for smaller feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlair's transformation into a male had given him a bit of height though he was still the shortest on there, and his blue hair had lost length, and become much shorter. He was wearing the regular Slifer Red uniform with the blazer open revealing a yellow t shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the now male Jasmine, his brown hair was much shorter, not going past his ears. Strangely enough, rather than the Obelisk Blue girl's uniform that he had been wearing becoming the boy's uniform like with Alexis, he instead wore the yellow blazer for the Ra dorm. As for Mindy, his black hair had lost the area she had kept tied together behind her his head. Like with Jasmine, he now wore a uniform for a different dorm, and was wearing the Slifer Red blazer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-what happened to us?\" Jaden asked worriedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>You all changed genders.</i>' Yubel stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, obviously...\" Jaden said under her breath. As she took in her new body, as her hands went up and hesitantly touched her new breasts. \"Yep, they're real.\" she said. They weren't as big as Alexis's former ones, being only a b cup, but they were still strange for her. Similarly, all the othe other boys turned girls also checked their new pairs. Syrus's was little more than an a cup, while Hasslberry's was also a b like Jaden. As for Chazz, her new pair were a nice c cup. As for Jesse, she was definitely the bustiest of the new girls, possessing a pair of perky d cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so weird!\" Jesse said, giving her new breasts a few more pokes and squeezes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay everyone, lets just stay calm.\" Alexis said, just as much for himself as anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, Mindy reached down to feel his crotch, and upon confirming his worst fears of the situation, was apparently the final straw for him. \"Calm!?\" How can I stay calm!? We just suddenly changed gender! I'm a boy!\" he said. The new boy was obviously freaking out. \"I've got a-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mindy, calm down!\" Jasmine said, grabbing his friend by his shoulders and giving him a few shakes, cutting him off and causing him to calm down a bit, ij just enough to become more rational.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Chazz, she ran over to Jaden, and grabbed her by the collar. \"This is your fault!\" she accused furiously, only to be pulled away by Syrus and Hassleberry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, leave Jaden alone!\" Syrus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, its not like e knew this would happen!\" Hassleberry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just relax, Chazz.\" Blair said. \"Flinging the blame isn't gonna solve anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. We need to figure out how to fix this.\" Jaden said. However, before they can talk, they spotted their friends approaching them</span></div></div>",

She then held up the strange blank card, still in her hand. \"This card somehow did this to us, so maybe it can change us back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but how do we make it work again?\" Chazz asked. \"Because you just holding out that thing isn't turning on the light show again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Hes got a point.</i>\" Yubel said. \"<i>I still sense something strange about the card, but it feels different now. 'Smaller,' somehow.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I say we should try to find out more about that card.\" Hassleberry suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is our only clue for now.\" Blair said. \"So we might as well investigate into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not like theres anything else we can do about this mess right now.\" Jasmine said. \"But how are we gonna look into things?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats a good question...\" Alexis said. \"We don't really know where to start.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden thought for a moment. '<i>Maybe I could ask Professor Banner.</i>' \"Well, lets head back to my room for a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? How come?\" Chazz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I figured maybe we could look into this by asking Professor Banner.\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that might be a place to start.\" Alexis said. And with that, the group of nine gender swapped teens made their way to the red dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they did, most of the the new girls were having a bit of difficulty walking in their new footwear. Jaden, Chazz, Jesse, and Syrus were all unaccustomed to walking in footwear with heels, and they tripped more than a few times. Hassleberry snickered at their difficulty. Lucky enough for her, only the size of her shoes had changed, leaving her without the same problem. \"Man, how do girls walk in these things?\" Chazz complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you get used to it.\" Jasmine replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd rather not get used to it.\" Syrus said with a sigh. This thing was all so weird. Suddenly being a girl and all that came with it. The clothes, the body, and all. She still wasn't used to her new, higher-pitched voice. She really disliked how much like a young girl she sounded like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this is so weird...\" Jesse said, once again giving her new breasts a few pokes. \"These things are way too big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, if I wasn't so worried about suddenly being a boy, I might normally be really jealous of Jesse.\" Mindy whispered to Alexis, Jasmine and Blair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is pretty annoying. Hes a boy, and yet hes got breasts like that.\" Blair agreed. \"But like you said, I'm more worried about changing back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the group all reached the red dorm, and headed up to Jaden's room to check for Pharaoh. Unfortunately, it didn't look like he was there. \"Lets all look for him.\" Alexis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope it just doesn't take too long to find that cat.\" Chazz complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they all looked around the room, Jaden found something that caught her attention. They were a pair of photos that she kept, both from the last days of the school year from the previous two years. However, there was something much different about them. The first picture had been taken for Zane's graduation at the end of his first year after their match, and in it had been her, Zane, Syrus, Alexis, Chazz, Bastion, Atticus, Jasmine, and Mindy. In it was still all the aforementioned people, but rather than as she remembered, there was a variety of differences, chiefly among them being that other than Zane, Atticus, and Bastion, they were all a different gender, the ones that they now were. The photo was now her and Syrus, who was wearing a red version of the usual female uniform, standing with Zane and Atticus, with her and Syrus both at the forefront. Nearby were the male Alexis, Jasmine and Mindy, the latter two whom had been standing close to Atticus as they fawned over him in the original, their new male forms now stood laughing at the male Alexis, who appeared to be flustered by something. On the other side was Chazz and Bastion. The other picture was from the previous year, with similar differences, with all of them in the picture now the opposite gender, though Jesse wasn't in it, as they didn't know her then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, guys, you might want to take a look at these...\" he said as he held out the pictures for everyone else to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...?\" Syrus let out as he looked at the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do we look like this in those pictures?\" Mindy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think...\" Alexis let out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think what?\" Jasmine asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That when that card did this, it might have also somehow altered reality to make it seem like we were always that way.\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What but thats gotta be impossible!\" Blair said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, about as impossible as turning somebody into the opposite gender.\" Jesse said. \"'Sides, we've seen some crazy stuff before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hes got a point.\" Chazz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMindy sighed. \"Things just keep getting worse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Jaden out as he inspected the room some more. He came to a pile of papers, some past school assignments. They were his, but written on it was the name 'Jadey Yuki' instead of 'Jaden.' Nearby were where Chazz, Jesse, Syrus, and Hassleberry had left theirs, the five of them having done their homework together the other night. The names on those were instead 'Chassidy Princeton,' 'Jessie Anderson,' 'Sydney Truesdale,' 'Tyranna Hassleberry.' \"Alexis might be right. Check these out.\" he said, showing the papers to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then, as far as everyone else knows, we really have always been like this...\" Blair said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sure looks that way.\" Hassleberry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what are we going to do? We can't really get anyone else to help us if they think we've always been like this.\" Syrus said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should go to class for now. Its going to be starting soon.\" Alexis said. \"I mean, its not like we have any other ideas for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I say we should just keep looking into this.\" Chazz said. \"This is a bit more important than class for now. The sooner we get back to normal, the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group then exited the room as they stood outside to think about their situation, and what to do next. As they did, Blair started to walk away. \"Hey Blair, where are you off to?\" Hassleberry asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm gonna check my room real quick while we're here.\" he replied, and Hassleberry, Syrus, Jasmine and Mindy decided to follow, leaving Jaden, Alexis, Chazz, and Jesse to talk about what to do next. Walking over to it, she opened it, and inside he found that it had greatly changed. For one, it now looked like there was a second person staying there instead of just him. Checking where he kept his schoolwork, he saw that the name that he seemed to go by was now 'Blaine Flannigan.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, check this out.\" Jasmine said, calling the others over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you find?\" Blair asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I think your new room mate is Mindy, or as this paper seems to call her, 'Mikey'\" Jasmine said, holding up a paper that had Mindy's surname, but the first name was just as Jasmine had said. Nearby the papers were a few photos that showed the trio of male forms of Jasmine, Mindy, and Alexis. There was even some notes that she had borrowed from Alexis and Jasmine, or 'Alex' and \"Jazz.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess that does make sense. She is wearing a red uniform now.\" Hassleberry said. \"And at least we're learning our new names.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How reassuring...\" Mindy said sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, lets get back to the others.\" Syrus said. As they exited the room, they found the others waiting outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we talked it over, and decided what to do now.\" Jaden said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well? Whats the plan?\" Blair asked.</span></div></div>",

As they entered, no one there paid them any more or less attention than thy usually did. Entering their classroom, they all took seats together. Not long after class began, Jaden soon had her head down, and was already falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whether Jaden is a boy or girl, I guess some things never change.\" Alexis remarked with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wish I could be that relaxed about this sistuation.\" Jasmine said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know.\" Mindy agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I wish I was that lucky.\" Jesse groaned. \"With these things on my chest, I just can't seem to get comfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than their new genders, class went by relatively normally up to the end.</span></div></div>",

He appeared to be in a training ground of some sort, and didn't appear to be anywhere on the Academy's island that he recognized, if he was on it att all. He then looked around, and nearby, he spotted Alexis, though a bit different that she had been a few moments ago. She was now dressed in and orange and black jacket with matching orange pants,and around her forehead was a black headband with a metal plate with a leaf-like design engraved on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to her, he was surprised to see none other than Yubel, standing there with a physical body. She was also wearing clothes, and was dressed in a short black jacket a gray high collared shirt that exposed her midriff, black pants, and black gloves with her index and thumb fingers exposed. Like Alexis, she also now wore a simillar headband around her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then look downward at his own appearance, and was once again surprised. Like his friends were dressed in strange clothes, he was as well. He was dressed in a red sleeveless top, black shorts with a pinkish skirt-like cloth over them, and black sandals with heels. If he could have seen his head, he would have seen his hair had a red headband similar to the one Alexis and Yubel had tying it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaden? Whats going on here?\" Alexis asked as she looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure.\" Jaden replied and turned to Yubel. \"Do you have any idea whats going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" she replied. \"I'm just as surprised as you. I don't even know how I have a body of my own again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I didn't think so.\" Jaden said, then looked down at his new attire again, and then to Alexis and Yubel's. \"And what are we wearing?\" he asked. He wasn't sure, but the clothes he was wearing looked like they were girl's clothes to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No clue.\" Alexis replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what is going on, anyway?\" Yubel wondered aloud.</span></div></div>",

Looking around, they saw a dog was napping near a tree. It also was easily apparent that their clothing had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo longer wearing his usual attire like his signature black coat, Chazz was now dressed in a loose fitting, long-sleeved, lavender and cream zip-up sweater with lavender cuffs over a mesh shirt, and navy blue pants and black, low-heeled sandals. Around his neck was a headband with a metal plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Jasmine, instead of her uniform, she was now wearing all black, with a leather form fitting black jacket, with zips over the chest and sleeves, along with black pants. On her forehead was the same kind of headband around Chazz's neck. She also had a pair of red, fang shaped tattoos oon her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck am I wearing?\" Jasmine asked, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me?\" Chazz said. \"I probably ridiculous dressed like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much different from usual.\" she commented under her breath. It was then that Jasmine noticed something, and her face was in Chazz's face in an instant. \"Hey, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your eyes, they're white.\" She said.</span></div></div>",

Looking around, it was obvious that they were no longer on Duel Academy's island, and they weren't even outdoors anymore. They both appeared to be in some sort of office, with Syrus sitting at a desk, with Mindy standing nearby. Nearby was a window, and they saw a strange village outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Where are we? How did we get here?\" Mindy asked as she looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" Syrus replied, then noticed something. \"Uh, what are we wearing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, their clothes had changed, and their uniforms replaced by clothes that they had never seen before. Syrus now wore a green robe, and nderneath it was a grey, kimono-style blouse with no sleeves, held closed by a broad, dark bluish-grey obi that matches her pants. The blouse was closed quite low, revealing a portion of his chest. On his feet were open-toed sandals with high heels. As for Mindy, she now wore a green short shirt kimono and matching pants; under which was mesh armor that showed out of the sleeves and legs of the outfit. Her new attire was completed with hand guards, a simple black belt, wooden sandals, a red cloak with two simple yellow circles, and a scroll on her back. She also had red lines going down from her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did we get into these things?\" he wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know...\" Mindy replied as she looked over herself, then at Syrus, and noticed something as she did. \"Syrus, are you wearing makeup?\" Mindy asked as she took a look at his face, and sure enough, there was pink lipstick on his lips. And both his fingernails and toenails were also painted with red polish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? How'd that happen?\" He wondered as he looked over his hands and feet. Seeing a mirror in the ofice, he walked over to it, wobbling a bit in his heels. When he looked into, he nearly stumbled back in surprise. Instead of his own reflection, he instead saw a beautiful woman with blond hair in the mirror. \"What the heck!?\" he said, the woman in the mirror moving in perfect sync with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats wrong, Syrus?\" Mindy asked as she walked over to the mirror, and was met with simillar shock. Instead of her relection, she saw an older man with long spiky whte hair. \"Whats wrong with my reflection!?\" she let out in surprise, the man in the mirror mimicking her movements and words.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the blinding flash of light died down, and Jaden's vision cleared, he quickly noticed a variety of differences. First and foremost being that he were clarly no longer on Duel Academy Island. Where he had been nearby the the forested area of the island mere moments ago, he was still outdoors, but was now evidently in a city, standing near the top of a large building. \"Where am I?\" he wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other difference was that his friends were nowhere to be seen right now. Whatever had happened, it seemed he had been teleported here without his friends. It was also then that he noticed that he also couldn't sense Yubel's presence within him. Ever since they had fused, he could always feel her there, even when she didn't make her presence known. But right now, he could feel even a trace of her. It was like the flash of light had separated them from one another. With even Yubel gone, he was now separated from all of his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the third major difference was his clothes. No longer wearing his usual attire of the red blazer, black shirt, and jeans that he always wore, he was now dressed in a strapless red camisole with a gold area resembling two \"W's\" on his chest, a golden belt around his waist, and blue briefs with white stars on them. On his feet were red heeled boots with a white stripe on the top, and a silver bracelet around each of his wrists. And finishing of things was a golden diadem with a red star on his forehead. He also ha a golden lasso hanging from his new belt. \"What the hell am I wearing!?\" he let out in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then he turned to a window nearby where he stood to get a look at himself in this costume. However, rather than his own reflection, he saw instead a beautiful woman with long black hair. As he waved his hands a bit, it was a sureal experience, watching the woman mimic all of his movements perfectly. He glanced down, seeing his regular own male body dressed in this new attire, but looking back at his reflection was that of the woman. The costume they wore was fitted perfectly for their bodies, with it looking ridiculous on his male body, but much better on the beautiful woman that was now his reflection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, whats going on here...?\"</span></div></div>",

She quickly noticed her location had changed, and now found herself standing atop a building in the middle of a city. \"What the heck? How did I get here? And what about the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did, it didn't take her long to notice that her clothes had changed, and now instead of the Obelisk Blue girl's uniform she normally wore was something completely different. She was now dressed in a blue skintight uniform with a red-and-yellow S shield on her chest, red trunks, a yellow belt, red boots and a red cape to finish things off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I wearing?\" she said as she looked herself over. It was then that she caught sight of herself in a nearby mirror. But instead of her own reflection was that of a muscular looking man with short hair. \"What the hell?\" she let out in surprise, and watched as the man's mouth moved in sync with her words. She made a few more motions and watched as the man mirrored them perfectly. Looking down at her body, still her own, female one, she was confused by just what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First I'm teleported somewhere else and put into these tight, and now I've got the wrong reflection as well.

How'd I get here?\" he wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then took a look down, and it was then that he caught sight of what he was now wearing. No longer in his usual clothes like his signature black coat, he now wore a white leotard with a hole at the chest, a red belt, blue gloves and heeled boots, and a red cape. \"Huh? How did I get into this weird getup?\" He felt ridiculous as he looked at the costume on his body. Turning to his side, he saw a window. Normally, he would see his reflection in said window, but right now that was not the case. Instead of himself, he saw an attractive woman with a bob of blond hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChazz flinched in surprise, and was still surprised as he watched the girl in the window mimic his action. \"Huh?\" Stepping forward, the woman he saw did as well. Placing his hand on the glass, the woman mimicked his actions perfectly. \"Whats going on here?\" he questioned, watching the woman lips move to his words. Other than his clothes, his body was still exactly the same, but his reflection was completely alien to him. Looking her over, he saw that the hole in the leotard gave him a glimpse of the woman's breasts, and with a blush, he looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on here?\" he questioned as he looked down at the city.</span></div></div>",

The shirt, pants, shoes, gloves, and hood she now had were all green. The only part of the costume she now wore that was not green was the black mask over her eyes. She also had a green bow and a quiver full of arrows on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats going on? How did we get here?\" Syrus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why are we dressed like this?\" Mindy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two looked around, they saw a window with a reflective surface, but instead of themselves, they saw something completely different. Instead of the short boy's own reflection was that of a beautiful woman with long blond hair that was much taller than Syrus, and instead of Mindy's was that of a man with blonde hair and a mustache and goatee. They were clearly confused by this. When they looked at themselves and each other, they saw their normal bodies, but the mirror showed them two completely different relections. The two in the mirror both mirrored their movements perfectly. The experience was definitely a strange one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on here?\" Mindy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I knew.\" Syrus replied.</span></div></div>",

He made a loud cry for help, but after a while he realized that he wasn't going to fall and that someone (in all probability) wasn't controlling his actions. Looking around the city, turning 360 degrees, he took in the wondrous panorama, seeing all the sites and hearing all the sounds and smelling all the smells of Metropolis. All at the same time. The wind swept across his chest, bare at the moment because of the hole in his new shirt. His red cape was flapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god, do people see me as that woman in the mirror?\" he asked himself out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, Chazz began moving towards the edge of building, and began descending to street level, slowly gaining speed as he got closer and closer to the ground as he got more confident in his control over...flying. He couldn't believe it. Chazz never would have believed that he would have been able to levitate like this, the way he was right now. He wondered if he could fly too, but his heart beat was pumping just too fast for him to try it out now. When he reached the ground, many different pedestrians looked in awe and shock at him as they saw the superheroine \"Power Girl\" just standing there on a busy sidewalk, looking scared stiff with an exhilarated look on her face as if she had never flown before. A little girl in a purple jumper and brown pigtails ran up to Chazz, saying \"Can I have your autograph, Power Girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Power Girl?\" breathed Chazz silently. What kind of a name was that? How egotistical this woman must have been to have named herself something like Power Girl!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um...sure. Do you have a pencil and paper?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Daddy, she needs something to write with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\" said the bemused man, searching his jacket pockets and pant pockets for his daughter to treasure forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry honey, I don't have anything\" he frowned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis daughter pouted even worse than his frown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry\" said Chazz. \"I'll just go inside this building and ask for some.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok!\" yelled the girl, her smile beaming at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Chazz looked quickly at the lettering above the entrance of where the three of them were standing. It was a major bank chain. Chazz knew that they must have paper and stuff inside there. He walked inside, being careful not to get his cape stuck in the revolving door, and as he went up to the teller, he heard a loud scream- the little girl's- as outside, a man who liked like a giant crocodile threw a big rock through the ground floor glass window. Stepping through shattered remnants, he pushed Chazz out of the way, as he was focusing solely on his mission to break open the bank vault with his bare hands. He didn't have a gun, but he didn't look like he needed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, Chazz wished he had one of his decks right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crocodile man did indeed break open the vault with his bare hands,  and he looked up and down at what was inside. No one tried to stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bags. I need bags to carry all these monies in\" he growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, a bunch of people were looking straight at Chazz oddly, as if they were expecting him to take care of the robber.

Looking up immediately from his bizarre reflection, Jaden ran to the side of the tall building where he saw a young man far below, maybe a few years older than him, holding onto a slightly younger woman who looked somewhat like Mindy. They were in an alley with no escape route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden ran to the other side of the building, his rather awkward boots not slowing him down one bit, where he saw the strange sight of several adult men in clown masks holding AR-15 semi-automatic rifles and rounding the corner from the sidewalk towards the frightened young couple. Meanwhile, cars and other people on streets adjacent to this one were busy going about their day, either oblivious to what was going on or apathetic to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden wanted to somehow help these people, but what was he to do!? He was in a strange town, somehow summoned away from Duel Academy, and who knows, maybe this couple had it coming to them for some reason? Jaden looked down again. They were holding each other tightly as one the men in clown masks began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Money. Cards. Amulet. Ring. In the bag now, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman grabbed onto her ring finger with her other hand, stroking it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I can't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you rather die? You can't use it. Give it to us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" chorused the other clown men, who were more like petty gangsters than children's entertainers,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden had had enough,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" he shouted from the rooftop. \"Leave those two alone, or you'll have to face me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, two of the clown gangsters suddenly started looked up in Jaden's direction and instinctively started to blow off their rifles in his direction. They were doing so in order to pelt him with bullets, perhaps to try and kill him. They knew they didn't have a shot against Wonder Woman, but they at least wanted to put up a good fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surprisingly well trained marksmen they were, the clown's bullets were all aimed towards Jaden's chest. But somehow, as if he had been doing this since he was born instead of dueling, Jaden's forearms caught and blocked every single bullet via Jaden's new silver bracelets. All of the casings fell back to the pavement in an amazing ballet of martial artistry. It was almost as if he were moving at superhuman speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh ho, Wondy. What are you doing in Batman's hometown?\" asked the apparent leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wondy? Batman?</i> thought Jaden. He didn't know who either of them were. They sounded like superhero names, from comics or the movies or TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jaden didn't answer them, the clowns started firing again, and sadly, one of the many spraying bullets(but only one) hit Jaden directly in the stomach area, causing him to lose his balance and fall down the building to the pavement below. It hurt like a mother______, but to his surprise, Jaden wasn't dead. In fact, he got right back up. The camisole was covered by an armor of some kind, which Jaden rationalized must have helped him break his fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clowns suddenly looked agitated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put the rifles down, please\" said Jaden, trying his best to sound intimidating. He would have to wait to find out who this \"Wondy\" was and give her her cloths back, and maybe get an autograph. Apparently, she was a tough broad enough for a hoods to listen to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clowns did in fact drop their rifles, careful to not set any of them off, and all ran away down a corner with their suit tails flapping behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Wonder Woman\" said the girl, genuinely grateful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" answered the out of breath man in turn. \"Thank you, Princess\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden turned around and saw the two shaking lovebirds.</span></div></div>",

Oh jeez, as if Yubel being inside of him wasn't bad enough, he now had to deal with people calling him \"Miss\" and \"Ma'am\" and all that. Jaden was never too comfortable around girls or femininity in general, so while some people might find turning into an amazing amazon a wonderful fantasy and a treat to enjoy, these bracelets which had saved his life fit more like chains of bondage to him. To make it worse, to top it all off with a cherry and whipped cream, he was pretty sure that he wasn't in the same reality that he was used to living in anymore. It made Jaden feel all uncomfortable in a really bad way inside to think that he was so far away from home, but he tried to keep a straight face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, he answered the couple this way: \"Don't mention it! All in a day's work. So,,,what were those guys trying to do to you two anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was some of The Joker's gang. Who knows what's up with them, they always cause chaos for the sake of chaos\" answered the man bitterly, looking down at his shaking girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no. Why were they wearing clown masks?\" asks Jaden. \"That's like the silliest costume ever.\" Thinking back, Jaden recalled this one costume party that he went to where someone dressed up like a giant old fashioned rotary telephone. Now THAT was silly too, but at least Kyon had the excuse that it was a fraternity rite(in order to get into the fraternity). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looked at Jaden with an odd look, his face suddenly cocking to one side. \"You don't know who The Joker is? He's like the most infamous criminal in the world. A terrorist if you ask me, but he gets off just because he's 'insane'.\" The man used those little finger quotes when he said the word <i>insane</i>, indicating that he didn't really believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And his gang all wear clown masks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the most part. Except for Harley Quinn, as she dresses up like a harlequin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time the man looked at him even stranger. \"I swear to God that I saw you arresting The Joker and Harley Quinn on the news once, princess. Don't tell me you don't remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...guess I don't\" answered Jaden, not knowing what else to say. Apparently, Wonder Woman was a big deal in this world. He would have to learn more about her as he looked around for his friends and maybe a way out of here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brad, leave her alone. Superheroes go through like a hundred criminals and terrorists a week. Hell, sometimes a hundred a <i>day</i>. She can't be expected to remember everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of the gang members said something about an amulet?\" asked Jaden to the couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah\" answered the female, pulling out a necklace from her purse that was indeed an amulet. It was one of the most beautiful things that  Jaden had ever seen. It felt...almost magical.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be worth a lot of money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it sure is\" said Brad. \"It belongs to her grandmother, and her grandmom was a witch. I guess they were trying to summon or extract whatever power is in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did they find out about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No idea\" answered the female. \"We were just minding our own business, coming out of a pizza joint, and then suddenly we were being chased down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the ring?\" Jaden asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My engagement ring. It's worth $2,000.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden shook his head. This all seemed to be shaking out and making sense. Well, at least as much sense as Jaden could make out of this weird world. The couple seemed fairly rich, and of course rich people were more high profile and likely to be targeted for thefts and kidnappings than poorer people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time\", he suggested, \"don't bring such valuable property in public with you if you can't protect it. I won't be around to save you forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple shook their heads in agreement. \"Thanks again, Wondy\" said Brad's girlfriend.</span></div></div>",

First and foremost being that he were clarly no longer on Duel Academy Island. Where he had been nearby the the forested area of the island mere moments ago, he was still outdoors, but was now evidently in a city, standing inside a large building in a city park made of glass housing many different species of plants. \"Where am I?\" he wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other difference was that his friends were nowhere to be seen right now. Whatever had happened, it seemed he had been teleported here without his friends. It was also then that he noticed that he also couldn't sense Yubel's presence within him. Ever since they had fused, he could always feel her there, even when she didn't make her presence known. But right now, he could feel even a trace of her. It was like the flash of light had separated them from one another. With even Yubel gone, he was now separated from all of his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the third major difference was his clothes. No longer wearing his usual attire of the red blazer, black shirt, and jeans that he always wore, he was now dressed in a constricting green woman's top made of plants tightly weaved together, a pair of green tights, with thigh high green boots covering his feet. Elbow length green gloves covered both his hands and forearms. Everything was very green, and very feminine. He didn't like it at all. \"What the hell am I wearing!?\" he let out in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nt was then he turned to a window nearby where he stood to get a look at himself in this costume. However, rather than his own reflection, he saw instead a beautiful woman with long red hair. As he waved his hands a bit, it was a sureal experience, watching the woman mimic all of his movements perfectly. He glanced down, seeing his regular own male body dressed in this new attire, but looking back at his reflection was that of the woman. The costume they wore was fitted perfectly for their bodies, with it looking ridiculous on his male body, but much better on the beautiful woman that was now his reflection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, whats going on here...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was now dressed in an expensive men's business suit, she couldn't tell what brand, with a futuristic looking watch on her right wrist, and a pair of loafers made of the skin of an endangered animal covering her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I wearing?\" she said as she looked herself over. It was then that she caught sight of herself in a nearby mirror. But instead of her own reflection was that of a well built but middle aged bald man. \"What the hell?\" she let out in surprise, and watched as the man's mouth moved in sync with her words. She made a few more motions and watched as the man mirrored them perfectly. Looking down at her body, still her own, female one, she was confused by just what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First I'm teleported somewhere else and put into these tight male clothes, and now I've got the wrong reflection as well. Just what is going on?\"</span></div></div>",

How'd I get here?\" he wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then took a look down, and it was then that he caught sight of what he was now wearing. No longer in his usual clothes like his signature black coat, he now wore a very strange outfit that seemed meant for a girl. It was a hot pink leotard type outfit that covered his entire body except for a large part of his torso(his stomach and chest were completely exposed, but everything else was covered by the pink fabric). There was some flap like material which could stretch out to the center of his chest which Chazz assumed was for breasts. On his feet were a pair of similarly pink thigh high boots, and he could feel on his face a strange type of mask which traced the edges of his eyes and went around his forehead, but wouldn't actually conceal his identity, which Chazz thought masks were for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Huh? How did I get into this weird getup?\" He felt ridiculous as he looked at the costume on his body. Turning to his side, he saw a window. Normally, he would see his reflection in said window, but right now that was not the case. Instead of himself, he saw a tall, attractive woman with a long black hair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChazz flinched in surprise, and was still surprised as he watched the girl in the window mimic his action. He also noticed that the mask was also hot pink, and as he suspected, didn't cover his face enough to hide this woman's identity. \"Huh?\" Stepping forward, the woman he saw did as well. Placing his hand on the glass, the woman mimicked his actions perfectly. \"Whats going on here?\" he questioned, watching the woman lips move to his words. Other than his clothes, his body was still exactly the same, but his reflection was completely alien to him. Looking her over, he saw that the flaps in the leotard were now holding the woman's large breasts, and with a blush, he looked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on here?\" he questioned as he looked down at the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He took a covered hand to feel around his face, which was the only part of his body still exposed, but he discovered the rest of his head was also covered(much to his dismay, the top of his weird costume seemed to be covered with triangular cat ears, and he also seemed to have sunglasses handy).

She was incredibly curvy and sexy looking, and filled out this weird costume much than Syrus did, who only saw himself inhabiting it when he looked away from the window reflection. Her face was beautiful, with red lipstick covering her lips, and sexy, sultry eyes that would make Syrus want to drool if he didn't already somehow know that he <i>was</i> her.

He was now wearing a hunter green dress of some kind, with a long flowing cape made of the same fabric right behind him. His wrist had several metal bracelets on them, all with different looking symbols and even jewels on them. He also seemed to be wearing a belt of some kind, as well as an ankle bracelet on his left ankle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting a large dressing mirror on the wall Tyrano walked over to it, when he noticed that he wasn't wearing any shoes, and gazed at his reflection.There he saw an attractive woman of indeterminate age  with long purple looking hair  wearing the same clothes he was wearing and mimicking every move he made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just whats going on here?\" He thought, still gazing at the beautiful woman in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly therewas a knock on the dressing room door and Tyrano walked over to it and opened the door to reveal Blair and Jasmine wearing ridiculous clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlair was wearing a blue bodysuit that covered her entire body, with what looked like a pair of red men's underwear on the outside of the suit, with a yellow belt right above it, and a long, flowing red cape in the back of her. She had a symbol on her chest, a red backwards \"S\" on a yellow background, which itself was surrounded by a red outline.

She was wondering how that was possible, especially how she was now separate from Jaden after the two had previously fused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she looked down at her once again physical body, she saw that she was now wearing a purple suit. Inside the suit was a green vest, a funny looking tie, and a blue and white checkered dress shirt. Her hands had thick but non constricting purple gloves on them, and her feet had some simple but snazzy black men's shoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I wearing?\" she wondered aloud. She then looked around at her surroundings, seeing that she was in a city, and was standing atop a building. Looking around, she saw a window with a reflective surface.Walking over to it to get a look at herself, she was surprised to see not her own body, but that of a human as her reflection. Her body had remain the same as it had been before regaining a physical form again, but her reflection was not her own. And even stranger, was that it was clearly a man. He had long and stringy green hair, and was wearing what looked like clown makeup on his face. He had two scars on both of his cheeks which had long ago scabbed over, possibly through a knife would of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yubel? What are you wearing?\" asked Jesse as he made his way towards Yubel, still looking at the strange man inhabiting her reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around to see Jesse, who was not wearing his old attire, and was dressed also a bit like a clown. The costume was bizarre looking, a red and black checkered woman's costume that contained Jesse's entire body. On top of the costume were two pigtail looking pieces of cloth, one red and the other black, with white puff balls on the end of each. Jesse's eyes were surrounded by what looked to be a black domino mask, but it didn't do a great job of concealing his entire face. Speaking of his face, it too like her was covered in a thick layer of white clown makeup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I knew\" said Yubel, still observing her reflection as a strange man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJesse slowly approached Yubel, and looked in the window himself. What he saw surprised him great. Instead of the reflection showing himself wearing these ridiculous looking, feminine clothes, instead it showed a shapely, curvaceous woman with large breasts inside her costume and an innocent looking, sweet face covered in clown makeup. And standing next to her was a weird looking green haired man with two scars on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK, this is freaky\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Syrus wished his brother Zane were here. Or Jaden. Or Tyranno. Or any of his friends, really. He didn't care if they saw him in this ridiculous outfit. Or hell, he didn't care even if they <i>saw him as this sexy catgirl cosplayer</i> that was his new reflection. He just didn't want to be alone because he had a bad feeling that Duel Academy was a long way from home. Deep inside his gut, he even had a feeling that he wasn't in the same universe he was in a just a few moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnowflakes began to fall from the evening sky. The large, monolithic buildings set below the dark visions of the nighttime clouds gave a claustrophobic, closed in feeling, and Syrus had a feeling this wasn't the best of areas to be in at night. Pulling on an invisible strand of long hair that existed only in the window reflection, Syrus then stuck out his tongue to catch the snow. The sweet taste, oh how sweet it was! Maybe this wasn't such a bad place afterall...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BEWARE THE POWER OF NIGHTFIST!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyrus turned around to his direct right where he saw four people in a scuffle behind a nearby brick building below. Walking closer to the scene, near the edge of the building, he saw what was going on. One man, dressed in a ridiculous costume like himself, was screaming obscenities and dodging the other three as they attempted to dog pile him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyrus pulled the sunglasses down on his face even though it was dark, in order to protect his identity. \"I might as well, it's part of the outfit it seems\" he reminded himself. To his surprise, the sunglasses were actually night vision goggles, and really good ones at that. The sky was almost as bright as mid morning through the lenses, and Syrus could see the four individuals much more clearly than he did a second earlier. The man in the costume had a crazed look on his face, and the other three seemed more desperate looking, as if they just wanted to get out of the alley. Syrus couldn't really tell who the \"good\" guys and the \"bad\" guys were in this fight. There seemed to be bags of a white, powdery substance in the alley to, which Syrus immediately deduced must be cocaine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's a drug war? Hmm...I probably shouldn't do anything about this. But then again, I usually am a coward in dangerous situations, and that's the wrong thing to do. I...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyrus decided just to see what would happen if he just made his presence known. 9 times out of 10, people won't want to fight about drugs in the middle of a witness. And if things got out of hand, thought Syrus, he always had this cool looking bullwhip at his side. Syrus took the whip off of his belt, and uncoiled it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now how do I work this thing?\" he said out loud. With a flick of his wrist, the limp whip suddenly rattled like a rattlesnake, so he did it again. *Snap* *Snap* *Snap*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerfection. Somehow, Syrus could use the bullwhip like a natural. Being more daring all of a sudden, he decided to come crashing in on the other guys like Tarzan did in the old movies. There was an escape ladder attached right next to the building where the fighting was going on. The whip was long enough to tie it around the ladder. So that's what Syrus intended to do. He couldn't explain how he was about to go about it, but he would try his best. He knew that Jaden would do the same in this situation. Syrus flicked the whip in the direction of the ladder, and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bullwhip somehow tied itself perfectly against the metal ladder at the front of the building, almost as if Syrus' muscle memory had recalled doing this a thousand times before. Quickly doing the sign of the cross with his right hand, Syrus walked off the edge of the building and held on tightly to the whip as he came crashing down right in front of the fighting men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkiding across the pavement in the strange costume's black heeled boots, the screeching noise alerted the men to Syrus' presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit, it's Catwoman! Run!\" said one of the three men fighting the masked vigilante, so he ran in the opposite direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? These guys see me as a woman too?\" thought Syrus. \"How odd...how embarrassing,\" His musing was cut short as...</span></div></div>",

Now feel the wrath, and the fist, of NIGHTFIST!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNightfist began to charge wildly at Syrus, who tried his best to get out of the way and evade the man's bladed punches. The man was very athletic, almost like someone who just missed out on qualifying for the Olympics. Syrus, to be fair, was also quite athletic and good at evading the man. For some reason, he didn't feel like he was in his own body, as his own body wasn't so nimble and graceful. It was almost catlike, the way he could easily somersault over the charging lunatic with ease, and could run up brick walls like it was nobody's business. As he continued to battle, Syrus was beginning to get the feeling that he was switching lives with this woman- whoever she was. And whoever she was, she apparently was feared enough for people to run at the sight of her. Catwoman. That must be an alias. Who was she really?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Syrus dodged another punch, Nightfist went out of his way by a few feet to extract three knives from a hidden compartment in one of his gauntlets. He tossed the first one with deadly accuracy, and through only God's good and this woman's equally athletic prowess was Syrus able to dodge it. The second time, the knife came even closer to killing him, almost reaching his heart, but Syrus deflected it away with a garbage can that he was using as a shield. On the third try, just as Nightfist was about to throw again, a man from behind suddenly grabbed his gauntlet laden wrist and twisted it into an uncomfortable position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're under arrest Nightfist. You too, Catwoman\" he said, making clear at last that he was actually a cop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyrus panicked and turned around, where there were four other cop cars with policemen and policewomen outside pointing semi-automatics at him to make sure he didn't get away. Syrus was screwed. What was he going to do? This lady may have been fast and nimble, be he wasn't exactly sure that she could outrun or out-dodge an array of gunfire. Syrus hypothesized in his head that he potentially <i>could</i> have gotten away had he saw the blinking lights in the distance fast enough a moment or two earlier, but when he was struggling to avoid this crazy guy without hurting him, his time was too preoccupied to notice what was down the street. Syrus didn't want to give up, but he couldn't think of any other options but to go quietly into one of the police cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\" he said. \"I give up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then\" said one of the officers. \"Put your hands behind your back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSyrus did so, and was then cuffed. He was led to the back of one of the police cars, but not before the officer discreetly patted Syrus hard on the ass, to which Syrus became hot with embarrassment. Then the cop tried the oldest trick in the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch your head\" he said, shoving Syrus against the top of the car, indeed banging his head roughly, before lowering him not anymore gently into his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Syrus and the crazy man known as Nightfist were driven away in separate cars to county lockup in the center of Gotham.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Instead of her uniform, she now wore what looked like a blue one piece swimsuit covered in silver star ornaments, and light blue high heels. She also had a bush of long feathers coming off of its rear which was what had brushed against her legs, which reminded her of a peacock's tail. There was also a hat on her head with simillar feathers in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I wearing?\" she voices aloud, feeling a bit embarrassed wearing such an outfit. She had never been one to like these kinds of clothes. She then walked over to the dressing room mirror, and was shocked when instead of her own reflection, she saw a completely different woman in the mirror instead. Instead of herself, there was a woman with brown hair mimicking her movements. She then reached over to grab a lock of her hair with the woman doing the same. Her hair was still blond unlike the woman's in the mirror. So her body was still the same, but her relection was different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she stared in amazement at the strange reflection in the mirror, there was suddenly a knock on the door. \"Kylie, 10 minutes until showtime.\" a voice said.</span></div></div>",

And when he followed it and looked down at the rest of him, he was shocked to see that his clothes had changed into something ridiculous. Instead of his usual attire, he saw that he was wearing a black leotard with the neck and shoulder area exposed, and on the rear of it there was a white cottonball tail. His legs were clad in black pantyhose, and on his feet were a pair of high heels. On both of his wrsits were a pair of shirt cuffs attatched to nothing, and around his nect was a collar with a bow tie on it. And completing his new outfit was a pair of bunny ears on his head. He was dressed like a bunny girl! \"What the hell!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nearly freaked out further when suddenly he saw a mirror nearby, but instead of his own reflection of himself dressed in this ridiculous getup, he instead saw a beautiful blond woman with an ample bust. Her expression was the exact same one of confusion, and to confirm things, he waved back at her as she mirrored his movements perfectly. \"Huh!?\" he let out, looking down and still seeing his own male body. For some reason, his reflection was all wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could wonder further on what was going on in this crazy situation, someone walked over to him. \"Whats taking you, Holly?

Instead of their own reflections, they instead saw something else. All ten members of the group now had completely different relections. Instead of the ten of them, there was a group of teenage girls who looked much more normal dressed in the uniforms than the five boys and Yubel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden now had the beautiful reflection of girl with long blond hair. Chazz now had a red headed girl for his relection. Syrus's reflection was now that of a cute asian girl with shoulder length hair, and realized that he wasn't wearing his glasses anymore but had no trouble seeing without them. Tyranno now had a black girl with long dark hair for his reflection. Jesse's reflection was now a busty girl with brunnette hair. And Yubel, despite her non-human looking body, now had the reflection of a regular girl with long black hair. And it wasn't just them, the real girls in their group also had different reflections. Alexis's reflection was that of a brunnette girl. Blair reflection was girl with black hair. And Jasmine and Mindy now had the reflections of an pair of identical twin girls with blond hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" Alexis asked. She looked around the room, with everyone looking normal to her, but in the mirror she saw a group of girls in their place. Jaden waved his hand in front of the mirror and then placed his hand on it, the blond girl that was his reflection mimicking his movements perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but this sure is weird.\" Blair replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're telling me.\" Mindy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as they were about to discuss what was going on, a few other girls entered the locker room, and saw the group. Now rather than react badly to the sight of boys in the girls locker room, or the sight of Yubel's monstrous form, they didn't seem to react much at all. \"Great, you guys are already here.\" one of them said as they began to undress, and the boys blushed as they averted their eyes. Once they were all dressed in the same uniform that Jaden and his friends wore. \"Okay, now that we're all here and ready, lets go out there and...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a moment, the blinding flash of light began to die down, and Jaden found his perspective had shifted, and he was in a whole new location. While he had been near the Academy's forest, he was now indoors, and lying down in a bed as well. For some reason, he also let out a yawn, feeling as if he had just woken up<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Where am I and how did I get here?\" he wondered aloud as he sat up from the bed and took a look around. The room was large and clearly belonged to a female based on such things as the open closet that revealed itself to be full of clothes, the vanity tables full of makeup supplies, and other such feminine stuff. He also saw that there was another bed on the other side of the room, one that from the looks of it, had an occupant asleep under its covers, though he couldn't make the person out as they had the blanket pulled over their head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to get out of bed, as soon as he pulled the blanket off of himself, he was met with another surprise. His clothing had changed, and replacing his uniform was now a pink nightgown. \"Huh? How did I get in this?\" he questioned with surprise. He then noticed a picture nearby, and saw a pair of blond, nearly identical girls in it, with the only difference other than their clothes being their hair, with one of them having longer hair than the others. He realized that this room must belong to the twins in the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that he saw the person in the other bed began to stir. Figuring it was the girl whose room this belonged to, he was worried what she would think, seeing a strange boy in her room instead of her sister, and dressed like he was. He knew he wouldn't have time to hide, so he was about to brace himself for the innevitable when suddenly a very familliar person's peaked out from underneath the blanket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYubel let out a yawn as she stretched her arms, appearing to have just woken up. Jaden was surprised by this, as it appeared that she was no longer in her spirit form now had a physical body again. \"Jaden?\" she questioned, letting out another yawn. As she gained more awareness, she saw what Jaden was now dressed in. \"What are you wearing?\" she asked with an aumsed amirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm not sure...\" he replied. \"But what about you? You have a body again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do?\" It was then that she started to notice that he was right. Her body was solid again, just as it had been in the other world before fusing with Jaden. As she sat up in bed, she then saw that her body was also clothed, wearing a feminine pajama top and pants. Her wings stuck out of the back through a pair of holes. \"Huh? How did I get in this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Jaden replied. \"Probably the same why everything else happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two looked around the room for a moment, they discovered something strange. As they looked into the full lengthed mirror near the closet, they were met with another surprise. Instead of Jaden's male body and Yubel's non-human one, they instead saw a pair of regular teenaged girls, the same ones that Jaden had seen in the picture. Jaden's reflection was now that of the twin with the longer hair, and Yubel's was the other. Jaden placed his hand on the mirror with the girl in it doing the same in perfect unison. \"Well, things just keep getting weirder and weirder.\" Jaden said, the lips of the girl in the mirror moving with his own words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the two could discuss what was happening, there was a knock on the door, before the door opened and a woman looked right at the two, and they guessed it was the mother of the twins' whose room this was. However, rather than react to the strange sight of a boy and a monsterous figure in her daughter's room dressed as they were, she didn't even bat an eye. Looking right at the two, she ten said \"Amber, Nina, You two girls better get ready for school. Once you're done, I'll take you..\" After saying that, she left the room and closed the door behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What just happened?\" Jaden asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure.\" Yubel replied. \"But I think that maybe somehow, we've replaced the two girls whose reflections we now have. So now, everyonre else appears to actually believe that we are them.\"</span></div></div>",

She had waved at the mirror and other such things, and each time the boy mimicked her actions in perfect unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what is going on here?\" she questioned at the strangeness of this all. And it was even stranger when someone, a woman, had come in and called her 'Adam' and told her to 'get ready for school.' It was like she believed that Alexis really this 'Adam' guy.

The floor also had various dolls, stuffed animals, and other stuff that were clearly girl's toys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that he realized that he had been holding something close to him, and saw that he was holding a stuffed doll.

Walking over to the mirror, the girl did too. He still had his own body, but the mirror showed a different image than it should. It was weird, as the girl in the mirror that was now his reflection was much shorter than him, so he had to kneel real low to get a look at her. She appeared to be about 7 years old, and had brown hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on here?\" He questioned. It was then that he realized something else: He couldm't sense Yubel's presence within himself.

But now, it was like they had been separated again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he got up, he was about to try to think about what was going on, when suddenly the door open, and in walked a woman.

As she sat up in the bed, she took a look around the room she was now in. From the looks of it, the room appeared to belong to a young boy. There were action figures and other toys littering the ground. The blanket over her also had a variety cartoonish robots and machines. \"Where am I, and how did I get here?\" she wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat up in the bed, she looked down at herself, and was surprised to see that her uniform had been replaced, and she now wore a baggy blue shirt with a cartoon character on it, and a pair of pajama pantts decorated with similar pictures. \"How'd I get in this?\" She then stood up and looked down at the clothes.

Are you here?\" he could Luna ask as the twins entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm here. I'm just working on the Duel Runners.\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins came into the main area, Carly with them. \"Hey Yusei, on our way here, we ran into Carly, and then we found this really weird card.\" Leo said as he held out the card for everyonre else to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its blank?\" Sherry questioned as she examined it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. We just found it lying on the ground and picked it up and figured that We'd show it to you guys.\" Carly explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see whats so interesting about it.\" Jack said. \"If its blank, its not a very useful card.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is weird, though.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I wonder where it came from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, the card began to glow, and emitted a bright light that engulfed the group.</span></div></div>",

Confusion rising and having a bad feeling, he raised his arm and reached forward, and his hand met the solid reflective surface of a mirror as he was afraid of. Even more confused then before, he looked down, but rather than seeing a woman's body, he saw his own male one only wearing the same bra and panties as the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So only my reflection is different...?\" he thought, looking back and forth from the wedding dress he wore and the woman that was now his reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on here!?\" he heard a voice demand beside him, and saw Jack, only he was wearing a white dress and had make up on his face, and a pair of feminine earings in his ears. He was looking into the same mirror as Yusei, which seemed to cover the entire wall. Next to him was Leo, also wearing the same thing as Jack, with the white dress, makeup, and earings. Like Yusei, the image of their reflections in the mirror were replaced by women instead of their own, with Jack's being a blonde woman, and Leo's being a redheaded woman much older than himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere, but in the same building, Akiza was also dressed different, and was confused by her new attire, now wearing a tuxedo instead of her usual victorian-inspired dress. Looking around, she saw Carly standing nearby, also wearing a tuxedo, and was just as confused as she was. They then spotted a mirror, and in it, instead of seeing themselves, they saw a pair of men in their place instead, comletely moving in sync with their actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, whats going on here?\" Akiza questioned her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere, Crow, Sherry, and Luna were just as confused, and in Crow's case, extremely embarrassed. Crow found himself wearing a white dress that looked to be slightly childish, while Luna and Sherry were both wearing tuxedos, with Sherry's seeming slightly more childish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez, what am I wearing!?\" Crow let out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And whats up with our reflections?\" Sherry asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking into a nearby mirror, they saw instead of themselves, completely different people as their reflections dressed like them. For Crow it was a young girl, Sherry a young boy, and Luna's was a grown man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on here?\" Luna questioned.</span></div></div>",

But while they weren't aware of it, something had change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like, what just happened?\" Leo wondered aloud. His tone of voice was different than normal, though he, nor anyone else seemed to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno.\" Luna replied casually with a shrug. She also spoke with a differen tone than normal, but it was still not noticed by anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if nothing appears to have happened, I guess nothing nothing happened.\" Jack said. He also appeared to be acting calmer than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess not.\" Carly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well thats boring.\" Akiza pouted. Like the others, she was acting differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what did you want to happen Akiza?\" Yusei asked, sounding more cheerful than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno. Something really cool!\" she said waving her arms a bit for emphasis. Yusei giggle a bit at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds pretty childish.\" Crow commented as he <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you know what?\" Jack asked everyone. \"Its such a nice day. Why don't we spend it outside the garage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you have in mind, Jack?\" Carly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. We could go for a walk around the city, maybe get something to eat later.\" he said with a gentle smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo, who was currently looking at his reflection in the mirror, turned over to Jack. \"Hey, would anyone mind if we also stopped to do some shopping? I was just thinking about getting some new clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see why not.\" Jack said. \"Anyone up for a trip into the city?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not?\" Sherry said. \"I guess I could join you guys since I've got nothing else to do today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter agreeing on what to do, the group of eight all left the garage to head to their destination. The group was completely oblivious that their personalities had been altered, and now viewed as they way that they each acted to be completely normal. Yusei and Akiza were the first outside, laughing as they ran out the door. With their new personalities, they were just like children. Yusei now had the personality of a sweet and innocent young girl, while Akiza had the personality of an excitable young boy. The two<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No running you two.\" Carly said as she walked out. \"And don't go too far ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" the two agreed and slowed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those two can be a handful sometimes.\" Carly said as Jack walked out and alongside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I suppose there isn't anything wrong with that. After all, let them enjoy theirselves, honey.\" Jack said. His stride was different than usual, walking with a mincing gait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you insist. You know I can't say no to you.\" Jack and Carly now had the personalities of a typical mother and father respectively, and thus now treated Yusei and Akiza like a parent would their own young children. Their attatchment to each other had also been made to match that of a loving husband and wife, and while they weren't actually married, they certainly acted that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo was next outside, and he walked in a feminine fashion with his hips swaying with each step. He now had the personality of a typical teenage girly-girl, with a love of fashion and shopping. His sister followed right behind him, walking casually with her hands in her pockets, Luna now hacing the personality of a relaxed teenage boy. Crow and Sherry were the last out. Crow was also walking in a bit of a feminine way, also having the feminine personality of a young woman, but with a more mature attitude than Leo's new personality. While Sherry seemed to have a bit of a more masculine stride, having the personality of a young man.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a long walk, the group reached the city.  The first area they reached was a large shopping mall, and walking inside, Leo quickly became exited. \"Oh my god! There is a sale going on! I am soo excited! This is perfect! Now I totally have to get some new clothes!\" he<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I'll come too.\" Crow said. \"I could use a change of clothes myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I think I could also use a change of clothes.\" Jack agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too!\" Yusei chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From the sounds of it, we all want some new clothes, don't we?\" Carly asked and everyone agreed. And with that, they headed into a nearby clothing store. The eight of them then split off into two groups, with them heading into the men and women's sections. However, it was the guys heading into the women's section and the girl into the men's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking around, Leo spotted several things he would want. \"Oh my god, these are just so cute!\" Leo said as picked it up. He then ran over to grab more. He was planning to go on a spree, as he could afford anything here thanks to the monet his parents sent him and Luna, he was quite rich. He then took the stuff to a nearby clerk. \"Excuse me, does any of this come in my size?\" he asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot seeming to find anything odd about a twelve year old boy asking if clothes meant for a teenage girl came in his size, she replied \"Well, not normally, but this store has state of the art tech that lets us modify anything here to any size so that we can make sure people can find what they want in their size. Just take anything you want to get fitted for you to the 'Alterations' section, and they'll take care of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a lot.\" Leo said before joining the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a few hours later, the four of them had picked out new clothes for each of them. Leo now wore a blue tank top with a white miniskirt. On his feet were a pair of heels that were open at the toes. He had also bought a designer purse, which was now slung over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe admired himself in the mirror and struck a pose. \"I look so hot.\" he said. Normally, such clothes wouldn't fit them, but he had paid the store extra to have them, and all the other clothes he had bought modified to fit him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow meanwhile now wore an orange blouse with a pair of black pants with a black jacket, and a pair of heels on his feet. A black purse was slung over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Jack, he had picked a simple white dress. On his feet were a pair of high heels, and he now had a simple purse slung over his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd finally, Yusei was now wearing a frilly blue dress. On his feet were socks that went up to his knees and a pair of mary janes. In his hair was a pink ribbon. Normally such clothes wouldn't come in his size, but Leo had helped out and paid for his new clothes to be modified for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough these were what they were wearing, they had all bought completely new wardrobes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lets go join the others. I'm sure they've waited long enough.\" Jack said as they walked out of the store and saw the others waiting. All of them were now dressed differently as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna now wore a red t shirt and a pair of baggy jeans. Carly was now wearing a white shirt and a pair kahki pants. Akiza now wore a red t shirt with a cartoon character on it and a pair of boys jean shorts. And Sherry now wore a black shirt and a pair of jeans. \"Finally! Took you guys long enough.\" Akiza complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you can't rush beauty.\" Leo said with a wink, and the Akiza and Luna rolled their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But really, how do we look?\" Crow said as he placed a hand on his hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, I guess.\" Luna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And me?\" Jack said as he walked over to Carly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look beautiful, Jack.\" Carly replied. \"As usual, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei then walked over to Akiza. \"And what about me?\" he asked her sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well, I guess you look pretty, and uh, cute, Yusei.\" Akiza said with a bit of a blush, averting her eyes a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" Yusei said, seeming to become even more cheerful at her compliment, then kissed her on the cheek. He giggles as she becomes more flustered. Her crush on Yusei from her previous personality remained, and evidently Yusei's new personality seemed to have one om her as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, aren't you two just the cutest little couple?\" Leo teased, causing Akiza to blush even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, now what are we going to do?\" Sherry asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, me, Crow and Leo were thinking about heading over to do a bit of shopping for some other stuff.\" Jack said. \"What about you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Sherry and me were thinking about heading somewhere by ourselves.\" Luna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you, Carly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got nothing in mind right now.\" she replied with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why don't you take a walk with Yusei and Akiza.\" Jack suggested. \"Why not get the two something nice, like some ice cream. Or maybe take them to the toy store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not? I'll do that for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" the two asked, becoming excited thanks to their new childlike personalities. \"Yay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. We'll meet back up in about two hours when we're all done then.\" Jack said.</span></div></div>",

The two happily licked at their cones as they walked through the mall and headed towards the shopping center's toy store and went in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, the two young adults with the personalities of children looked absolutely ecstatic. \"Now, you two can each pick out two toys and I'll get them for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" the two said before heading off into the store, with Akiza running over towards the boy's toys, and Yusei heading towards the girl's section almost skipping. With Akiza, she ran through the aisles, looking at a variety of action figures that she thought were just so cool, looking for the best one. With Yusei, he was looking at a variety of dolls that had caught his eye, looking for the prettiest one. After a while, the two returned to Carly who was waiting near the registers. Akiza had picked a pair toy robot while Yusei had gotten a doll that came with a variety of clothes, and a stuffed animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter paying for them, the trio left with Akiza immediately opening up her toys and pretending to have the robots fight while providing voices and sound effects. Yusei meanwhile held his new stuffed animal in his arms while holding the bag with his other toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of them then looked around. \"Well, we got some time to kill before meeting up with Jack and the others. What do you two want to do?\" Carly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking about it for a bit, Yusei and Akiza looked at each other and knew what they wanted to do. \"Lets go to the park!\" Yusei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Akiza agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay then.\" And with that, the two left the complex and went to the park that was accross the street. Carly took a seat as Yusei and Akiza started running over to play, leaving their new toys with Carly. \"Don't ruin your new clothes.\" Carly told them. \"Jack would never let me hear the end of it.\" she added to herslf. She then took out her phone and sent a text telling the others to meet them here when they were done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the park, Yusei almost immediately saw a group of young girls playing and went over to join them. \"Hello!\" he greeted them cheerfully. \"My name is Yusei. Can I play with you?\" he aked them and the group agreed without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza meanwhile saw a pair of boys playing around and headed over to join them. \"Hey, I'm Akiza! Can I play with you guys?\" she asked, and the two agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the two groups matched their new mental ages and mindsets, the two of them enjoyed themselves as they played with then.</span></div></div>",

No one seemed to recall how terrible of a chef Jack was with his old personality, now only remembering him as an excellent cook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is yummy!\" Yusei complimented as he and Akiza were the first at the table, and started eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Akiza agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you two always say that.\" Jack said, but knowing the two meant it. He then looked over at Leo. \"Put that phone away.\" he said strictly as he took a seat, instictively crossing his legs as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know.\" Leo said, as he sat down(also crossing his legs), putting a yellow phone that he had bought today away. It had a picture of his Life Stream Dragon on the back. \"I was just checking the time. I only got it today, so its not like I can text people I don't know with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even so, I want everyone to enjoy a nice meal together without distractions. Like a proper family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not really, a family, though.\" Sherry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. But we feel like one.\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I agree.\" Carly said from her seat next to Jack. \"Jack and I are the parents while Yusei, Akiza, Leo, and Luna feel like our own cheldren most of the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you think of yourself as their father, Jack?\" Sherry asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I don't know.\" Crow said. \"Jack acts more like the mother to me, while Carly is the father.\" he said with a slight laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't really see anything wrong with that.\" Jack said. \"I don't mind being either the mother or father. As long as I've got Carly and a loving family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You both feel like my real parents!\" Yusei said sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thank you Yusei.

I just want to call and make sure it was okay with her parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, we don't mind.\" Akiza's mother said over the phone. \"She loves spending time with you all so much that she practically lives with you all. Its almost like you're her mother sometimes. As long as Akiza is enjoying herself, we're fine with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. Have a good night.\" Jack said, and Mrs. Izinski returned before the two hung up. Jack then went over to the bags that they had brought home and looked for a pair of boxes and took them out just as Yusei and Akiza came out of the bathroom. \"By the way, I got these for you while shopping. I had them made just for you both.\" Jack said, handing Yusei and Akiza a box each. In Yusei's was a sky blue frilly nightie with a picture of his Stardust Dragon on the front that was drawn in a way to make it look a bit cuter, while Akiza's had a set of red boys pajamas with a picture of Black Rose Dragon roaring on the front of the shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, thanks Jack!\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Jack!\" Yusei said. The two childish young adults then hugged him happily before going to get changed for bed. Once readym they went into the bedroom, and got into the beds there. Sitting in bed, the two begged Jack to tell them a bedtime story, who happily agreed. Once the story was done, the two were just dozing off, and nearly asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, mommy.\" Yusei said just before the two fell asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe comment from Yusei made Jack happy, even if he was called the \"mom\" by the half asleep Yusei, it warmed his heart to know Yusei thought of him enough as a parent to sometimes refer to him as one. With a smile on his face, he headed back into the main room, and took a seat on the couch next to Carly and lovingly cuddled like the married couple they acted like. \"Anyway Carly, Crow and I were talking today, and we were thinking that Yusei and I would move out.\" Jack said. \"I was thinking of finally moving in together with you, and obviously I'd take Yusei with me since we can keep and eye on him better than Crow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't be against that, but where would we stay, dear? My apparetment isn't big enough for three people, and of course Akiza will be over so much that she'd practically live with us as well.\" Carly reasoned. \"We'd need a bigger place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that easy.\" Leo said as he joined the conversation. \"I told him you guys can like move in with with me and Luna. Besides, you are our \"parents\" after all, so its totally okay.\" he joked, refferencing the eariler conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there is plenty of room.\" Luna said. \"Our place is so big, we could have two families stay there comfortably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say?\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds perfect.\" Carly said. \"I've been wanting you to move in wirh me forever. And with a set up like that, we'll be a as close to being a real family as you can get without actually being one.\"</span></div></div>",

As they reached it, the woman working there took a look at them and smiled. \"Oh, are you taking care of your sibling today?\" the woman asked Leo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm watching Yusei, but hes not really my sibling. We're not related.\" Leo replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? You two seem like a real pair siblings.\" the woman said. \"You remind me of how me and my younger sister were. You two seem just like we used to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting something to eat, the two resumed their walk. \"You hear that Yusei? We're like sisters.\" Leo said as the two walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't mind if you were my big sister.\" Yusei said with a smile. It was quite an odd situation. Before their personalities had been altered, Leo had looked up to Yusei as an older brother figure. But now, their roles were reversed, with Yusei now looking up to Leo as an older sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I guess I wouldn't mind being your big sister.\" Leo said with a bit of a girlish giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then can I call you 'Big sis?'\" Yusei asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an odd question, the young man asking the child if it was to call him his older sibling, let alone as one of the opposite gender. But rather than noticing the odditity, Leo was flattered. \"Sure, but then only if I can like call you 'Little sis' then.\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! Thats fine with me, Big sis!\" Yusei said happily. \"We're sisters now!\" It didn't really seem odd to either of them that a pair of boys being sisters was strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we are.\" Leo said. \"So then, what do you want to do now, Little sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, Yusei noticed a poster on a nearby wall. The poster had a picture of a pair of female Duel Monsters called Pikeru and Curran, and it was for a movie about them called \"Trial of the Princesses\" that was inspired by the cards about the two Magicians becoming princesses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we go see that?\" Yusei asked hopefully. \"It looks like a great movie!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I can take you.\" Leo agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the best, Big sis!\" Yusei said as he kneeled over and gave Leo a hug.</span></div></div>",

As they played against one anoher, the matches were just about even, both winning as much as the other. After a while, they decided to play another game, and looked around<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey saw a pair of boys, a younger one and an older playing another game, beating another pair of boys at one of the games, and bragging about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over, they decided to challenge the two boys. \"Hey, can we play?\" Akiza asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why bother? We'd just beat you!\" the younger boy taunted. \"Me and my brother are the best!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well Luna and I are just as good as you and your brother!\" Akiza argued with the boy, not liking his attitude. \"We can beat you guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but we're better because we're brothers!\" the boy retorted, his logic not really making much sense, but being young, he thought he and his brother were unbeatable at the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well then me and Luna are brothers because we're gonna beat you!\" Akiza said, sticking out her tongue at the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right. Prove it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine! C'mon Luna, lets beat them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" she said, shaking her head a bit at Akiza's childishness.  The four began playing the game. At first things were even, but then the two brothers started to gain the upper hand. But after a bit, Akiza and Luna began to make a comeback, and in the end they beat their opponents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Akiza said as she threw her arms up in triumph. \"Told you we could beat you two!\" Akiza bragged, and being sore losers, the two boys left. \"Heh, guess me and you are just as good as real brothers, 'Big bro.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not, 'Little bro.'\" Luna said.</span></div></div>",

And even though her breasts hung freely, no one seemed to pay her any attention.

Yay!\" Yusei said as he hugged her once more. \"Lets go play!\" he then said to her and the two happily ran down to the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yusei and Akiza did, Leo decided to set up a spot, and placed a towell on the sand and then lied down on it on his stomach, and planned to take in the sun for a bit. Luna then took a seat nearby as she watched Yusei and Akiza play down by the water. \"So, how was your day so far, Leo?\" Luna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its been okay.\" Leo replied. \"Me and Yusei have had fun so far. Oh, and me and him are like sisters now. Hes calling me \"Big sis\" while I'm calling him \"Little sis.\"\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Thats a funny coincidence, because me and Akiza are calling eachother brothers, anf shes my \"Little Bro\" now, while I'm her \"Big bro\" apparently.\" Luna explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess that like makes them both are little siblings.\" Leo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Luna said. \"Of course, they're definitely more than like siblings to each other.\" she commented, watching Yusei give Akiza a hug and kiss her on the cheek while she blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. Those two are like, just such a cute little couple.\" Leo said. \"I bet once they get more mature, they'll be dating each other. Might even get married someday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with Yusei and Akiza, the two decided to build a sand castle, and had sat down on the sand while the twins watched them.</span></div></div>",

You mean with Akiza and Big Sis at Duel Acadmey?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not exactly.\" Carly said. \"We think you should start with the basics first. After all, you're good enough so you do't really need to learn anything about dueling. We've already enrolled you at the local elementary school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay.\" Yusei said.

Akiza would also be going with him, having decided she wanted to go to school with Yusei. It would be both of their first day, and they were both a little nervous but still looking forward to it. As he walked out of his room, Akiza also came out of hers, which was right accross from his new room, having spent the night. She currently wore a blue t shirt and a pair of shorts. The two then headed into the kitchen for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a bit, Leo came into the kitchen, now wearing what had used to be Luna's Duel Academy female uniform, but now believed it to be his own. Luna followed behind him, and the same applied to her and the male uniform that had been Leo's. \"So Little Sis, you looking forward to starting school today?\" Leo asked as they all sat at the table, waiting for Jack to finish breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little.\" he replied. \"But I'm a bit nervous, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be, sweety.\" Jack replied. He currently wore a light blue sundress with a white apron over it, and a pair of ballet flats on his feet. \"I'm sure you'll have lots of fun at school. Plus, Akiza will be going with you, and today will be her first day at that school too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarly then entered in and took a seat at the table, and opened the newspaper to read as she waited. She currently wore a pair of kahki pants and a white dress shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way, I got these for you two.\" Jack said, holding out a pair of childish looking backpacks. One was pink, with a picture of his Stardust Dragon made to look cuter. The other was red with a picture of Black Rose Dragon shooting flames from its mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, thanks Jack!\" Akiza said taking the red one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, mommy!\" Yusei said taking the pink one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mommy, huh? So then I take it that name is sticking?\" Carly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh-huh!\" Yusei said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I like it.\" Jack said, serving breakfast for everyone. As he served Carly's, she gave him a kiss on the lips, and he rturned the action. \"Anyway, hurry up and eat you four. You've got to get to school!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after, Yusei and Akiza were dropped off by Carly at the local elementary school. No one there found the anything wrong with the two walking into the building and taking a seat in their new classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere, Leo and Luna arrived at the Duel Academy. However, rather than walking into their usual classroom, they headed into the classes for the older students of high school age. No one found anything odd about that.</span></div></div>",

Even though Yusei was 19, and Akiza was 17, they now had the intelligence of their new mental ages as well, and were the equivalent of the class of kindergarteners they were now part of. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the class was given some free time, and some of the students decided to get to know Yusei and Akiza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!\" a girl who say next to Yusei greeted him cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!\" Yusei returned with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Samantha.\" she introduced herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Yusei.\" he replied, even though he knew she already knew his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yusei, do you want to be friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay! C'mon, I introduce you to my other friends.\" she said as she lead him to <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Akiza, she was making friends with several of the boys in the class. \"You're so cool Akiza!\" one boy said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know.\" Akiza said. \"So what are your names?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Johnny.\" one introduced himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Mikey.\" another said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Billy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Timmy.\" the last of them said. The five of them then went to go find something to do together for their free time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Yusei, he sat with a group of girls, all of them playing with some dolls and a doll house. He was enjoying himself, and really liked his new friends. Other than Samantha, there was Erica, Kate, and Jenny. All four had already taken a liking to him. Even though he was male and much older than them, it was as if he was just another little girl like them as far as they were concerned. With Akiza, she and her new friends were playing with a variety of toys, pretending the dinosaurs and robots were fighting. Like with Yusei, the boys treated Akiza as if she was one just like them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, their free time ended, and they all returned to their seets and the lessons resumed. They also had an art class, and the students were told to draw themselves as somerthing they'd like to be, real or not. Yusei drew a crude drawing of himself as a princess, coloring in the dress he wore in the picture pink, and he was being saved by a knight that looked suspiciously like Akiza. Akiza meanwhile drew a picture of herself as some kind of a superhero, fighting a giant monster, and protecting someone that looked just like Yusei from it.</span></div></div>",

No one seemed to realize that these two had never been in this classroom before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they waited for class to start, Leo found himself listening in to the girls nearby, and after a bit, joining into their conversations about fashion, television, gossip and other subjects as if he had been a part of the conversation from the start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leo, like how come we've never hung out before?\" one of the girls asked him.

But while they weren't aware of it, something had change.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that all about?\" Luna questioned out loud, voicing the question on everyone's mind. She was also speaking with a different tone to her voice, adding a bit gruffer tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm, I'm not quite sure.\" Leo said as he crossed his arms. He was now speaking with a relaxed and somewhat feminine tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So then, like, what just happened?\" Jack asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't look like anything happened.\" Carly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats kinda boring.\" Sherry complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, at least we're all okay.\" Yusei said in a caring voice. \"Hey, you know what? Its such a nice day. Why don't we spend it outside the garage?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you have in mind, Yusei?\" Akiza asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. We could go for a walk around the city, maybe get something to eat later.\" he said with a gentle smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo, who was currently looking at his reflection in the mirror, turned over to Yusei. \"Hey, would anyone mind if we also stopped to do some shopping? I was just thinking about getting some new clothes. These are just too childish for my tastes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a good idea.\" Jack agreed. \"I could like, totally go for some shopping.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter agreeing on what to do, the group of eight all left the garage to head to their destination. The group was completely oblivious that their personalities had been altered, and now viewed as they way that they each acted to be completely normal. Crow and Sherry were the first outside, laughing as they ran out the door. With their new personalities, they were just like children. Crow now had the personality of a sweet and innocent young girl, while Sherry had the personality of an excitable young boy. \"Bet you can't catch me!\" Sherry taunted Crow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No fair! You got a head start!\" Crow whined. The two were acting like a pair of young siblings playing with each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No running you two.\" Akiza said as she walked out. \"And don't go too far ahead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe, okay.\" the two reluctantly agreed and slowed down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those two can be a handful sometimes.\" Akiza said as Yusei walked out and alongside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but I suppose there isn't anything wrong with that. After all, let them enjoy theirselves, honey.\" Yusei said. His stride was different than usual, walking with a mincing gait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you insist. You know I can't say no to you.\" Yusei and Akiza now had the personalities of a typical mother and father respectively, and thus now treated Crow and Sherry like a parent would their own young children. Their attatchment to each other had also been made to match that of a loving husband and wife, and while they weren't actually married, they certainly acted that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo was next outside, and he walked in a feminine fashion with his hips swaying with each step. He now had the personality of a more mature and feminine young woman at least twice his real age. As for his sister Luna, she now had a more masculine stride, having the personality of a young man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Jack and Carly, the two walked out with Jack lovingly hugging onto Carly's shoulder. The two now had the personalities of teenagers of their opposite gender. Jack had the personality of a teenage giry-girl with a love of fashion and shopping, and Carly now having the personality of a relaxed teenage boy. Another thing that had altered thanks to their personalities was that they acted like a pair of teenagers in love, and now believed they were dating.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a long walk, the group reached the city. The first area they reached was a large shopping mall, and walking inside, Jack quickly became exited. \"Oh my god! There is a sale going on! I am soo excited! This is perfect! Now I totally have to get some new clothes!\" he squealed with delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, I'll come too.\" Leo said. \"I could definitely use a change of clothes myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I think I could also use a change of clothes.\" Yusei agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too!\" Crow chimed in. \"I want something pretty and cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From the sounds of it, we all want some new clothes, don't we?\" Akiza asked and everyone agreed. And with that, they headed into a nearby clothing store. The eight of them then split off into two groups, with them heading into the men and women's sections. However, it was the guys heading into the women's section and the girl into the men's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking around, Jack spotted several things he would want. \"Oh my god, these are just so cute!\" he said as picked it up. He then ran over to grab more. He was planning to go on a spree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Leo, he took a few articles to a nearby clerk. \"Excuse me, but does any of this come in my size?\" he asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot seeming to find anything odd about a twelve year old boy asking if clothes meant for a grown woman came in his size, she replied \"Well, not normally, but this store has state of the art tech that lets us modify anything here to any size so that we can make sure people can find what they want in their size. Just take anything you want to get fitted for you to the 'Alterations' section, and they'll take care of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds perfect. Thank you.\" Leo said before joining the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a few hours later, the four of them had picked out new clothes for each of them. <br>\r\nLeo now wore a crisp, white, womens blouse, and from his waist was a short, tight, black skirt that came down to mid-thigh. A pair of shiny, black pantyhose were on his legs and a pair of two inch tall pumps were on his feet. Strangely enough, he had also gotten a lacy bra that he now wore underneath, modified for his flat, boy chest. He had also gotten a a purse. He looked at himself in the mirror. \"Much better.\" he commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei now wore a simple sky blue sundress, and a pair of heels. Like Leo, he had also gotten a bra and had it modified for his flat chest. A simple purse hung from his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack now wore a white sleeveless too that would have showed off some cleevage on a woman, but since he was male, just gave people a view of his chest. He also wore a blue miniskirt, and a pair of stockings and a pair of black high heels. Like the other two, he also now wore a bra. A designer purse now hung from his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd last amongst the group was Crow, who now wore a frilly yellow dress, and on his feet were socks that went up to his knees and a pair of mary janes. He also had a bow in his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this was only they were currently wearing. They had also bought completely new wardrobes, and had delivered back to the garage for them so that they wouldn't have to carry around the bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lets go join the others. I'm sure they've waited long enough.\" Yusei said as they walked out of the store and saw the others waiting. All of them were now dressed differently as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna now wore a white shirt and a pair of jeans. Carly was now wearing a white t shirt under a blue jacket and a pair kahki pants. Akiza now wore a white dress shirt and a pair of  kahki pants. And Sherry now wore a black t shirt white a cartoon character on it and a baggy pair of jeans. \"Finally! Took you guys long enough.\" Sherry complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you can't rush beauty.\" Jack said with a pose and a wink, and the Sherry and Luna rolled their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you definitely look hot, Jack.\" Carly complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks! You're so sweet!\" Jack said as he hugged her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But really, how do we look?\" Leo said as he placed a hand on his hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bad, I guess.\" Luna replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And me?\" Yusei said as he walked over to Akiza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look beautiful, Yusei.\" Akiza replied, giving her a light embrace. \"As usual, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow then walked over to Akiza. \"And what about me?\" he asked her sweetly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you look very cute, Crow!\" Akiza said with a tone that one would use when speaking with a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Crow said, seeming to become even more cheerful at her compliment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, now what are we going to do?\" Sherry asked, rolling her eyes at Crow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was thinking about getting some other stuff\" Jack said. \"What about you guys?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was going to also do shopping.\" Yusei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Leo said. \"We could go together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not?\" Yusei agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Luna and me were thinking about heading somewhere by ourselves.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you, Carly?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got nothing in mind right now.\" she replied with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why don't you take a walk with Crow and Carly?\" Yusei suggested. \"Why not get the two something nice, like some ice cream. Or maybe take them to the toy store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not? I'll do that for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" the two asked, becoming excited thanks to their new childlike personalities. \"Yay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then. We'll meet back up in about two hours when we're all done then.\" Yusei said. He then handed Carly some money to spend on the kids. \"Here. And thank you for watching the two for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\"</span></div></div>",

Yusei, Jack and Crow now had personalities were now those of sweet, innoncent, and very girly little girls. Their thoughts were now occupied by things befitting their new personalities such as dolls, cute things, and other such stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza, Carly, and Sherry had undergone the exact opposite kind of change, and now had the personalities of exciteable and childish little boys. They now thought of \"cooler\" things like those that little boys would like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo's new personality was now that of a mature woman in her mid twenties. He was now feminine, but in a much more mature way than the other males. And as for Luna, her personality was now a that of a man in his mid twenties. The reverse of her bother, her personality was now much more masculine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut none of them seemed to realize that they were acting was strange or different. They all believed that the way they were acting was perfectly normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Akiza kept trying to make the card flash again to the amusement of the guys, Leo started to make his way to the door. \"Where are you going, Leo?\" Luna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To do some shopping.\" he replied. \"I need something different to wear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" Luna said, then looked down at her own clothes, . \"I think I'll come to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about Yusei and the others? We can't leave them here alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then can we come?\" Yusei asked hopefully, and he and the others all pleaded with their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you can come.\" Leo said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Yusei cheered, and he, Jack and Crow skipped to the door as Akiza, Carly, and Sherry ran out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're such a handful sometimes.\" Luna remarked as the twins followed them out.</span></div></div>",

Being a 19 year old male, it didn't look like it would be even close to fitting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks too small for you.

Thank you.\" Leo said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Yusei cheered, glad he could get the dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then walked back over the others, and told them about the Alterations section. A few hours later, they had bought new clothes for themselves, and each now wore a new outfit. Leo now wore a crisp, white, womens blouse, and from his waist was a short, tight, black skirt that came down to mid-thigh. A pair of shiny, black pantyhose were on his legs and a pair of two inch tall pumps were on his feet. Strangely enough, he had also gotten a lacy bra that he now wore underneath, modified for his flat, boy chest. He had also gotten a a purse, and his face was now decorated with expertly applied make up. As for Luna, she was dressed simply, and now wore a white collared shirt, and a pair of kahki pants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei, Jack, and Crow now wore frilly dresses, with Yusei wearing a pink one, Jack wearing a blue one, and Crow in a yellow one. And on their feet, they all wore socks that went up to their knees, and mary janes. They also now had new hair adornments, with Yusei having pink ribbon that matched his new dress, Jack having a black alice band, and Crow with a yellow bow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as for Akiza, Carly, and Sherry, their clothes were now the kind one might see a young boy wear. Akiza wore a red t shirt with jean shorts and a baseball cap. Carly wore a blue shirt with jeans. And Sherry wore a yellow shirt and jean overalls. All three of their shirts had cartoon pictures on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd this was only they were currently wearing. They had also bought completely new wardrobes, and had delivered back to the garage for them so that they wouldn't have to carry around the bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go. Much better.\" Leo said as the group left the clothing store, his hips swaying wth each step and his new heels clicking with each step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah!\" Yusei said as he skipped out of the store. He then turnned to Akiza. \"Akiza, does my new dress look pretty?\" he asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, well, yeah, it looks very pretty on you.\" she replied with a blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akiza and Yusei, sitting in a tree!\" Carly and Sherry teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sh-shut up!\" she protested as she and Yusei blushed at the comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit picking on them, Carly!\" Jack said, and Carly stopped instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" she said. The six young adults were acting like a group of little kids, but no one in the mall seemed to find anything odd about the sight. When the card had altered their personalities, it had also altered reality to make their new attitudes seem normal to other people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow then noticed another nearby store. \"Leo, Luna! Can we go to the toy store?\" he begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we?\" Akiza asked with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Pretty please?\" Yusei joined in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleeeaaaaase?\" the other three joined in.</span></div></div>",

They all went into the toy store with Leo and Luna following, and inside the the six of them splitting up into two groups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei, Jack, and Crow had gone into a section full of dolls, the three of them giggling like the young girls they now acted like. \"Ooh, I like this one!\" Yusei said as he picked one off the shelf for himself. \"And then we can get this one too. And this one! And that one!\" he said as he picked several more out for them to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets also get this stuff.\" Jack said as he picked out some doll accessories such as extra clothes, other stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we've got to get this doll house!\" Crow said, pointing at the large doll house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Akiza, Carly, and Sherry, they were picking out action figures. They had chosen out stuff such as superhero ones, robots, and other stuff that young boys would like. \"This one is so cool!\" Akiza said as she picked one out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if we get that one, we've gotta get this guy for him to fight against!\" Carly said as she grabbed the enemy of Akiza's figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this too!\" Sherry said as she grabbed a vehicle that went with Akiza's figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the two groups met back up with the twins who had been waiting for them. Both groups were pushing shopping carts full of toys. In the boys' carts, other than the doll stuff, they also had several cute stuffed animals, several other girlish toys like a tea set, and a whole pile of dress-up costumes that they wanted to get modified to fit them. For the girls, their cart was full of different kinds of action figures and toys that went with them, as well as other typical toys that young boys would like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, isn't that an awful lot of toys you all picked out?\" Leo asked. \"Don't you think you picked out a little too much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please? We don't really have any toys, so we got a whole bunch.\" Yusei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And its not like these are all for only one of us.\" Akiza said. \"We're gonna share 'em.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleeeaase?\" the other four joined in the begging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we'll get you all this stuff, but only because you guys don't have any toys.\" Luna said sternly. \"And its just this once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" the six agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the agreement reached, the group brought the full carts to the cashier to check officially purchase the toys. \"Wow, you've got a lot of stuff here.\" the cashier remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not a problem.\" Luna said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we'll need the sizes of the costumes altered to fit them.\" Leo said, gesturing to Yusei, Jack, and Crow, and handed the measurements for them to the cashier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\" the cashier replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And have all of this delivered to this address.\" Luna said giving another paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that done, the group left the toy store. \"So, now what should we do?\" Leo asked.</span></div></div>",

She was wearing her usual outfit, a blue blouse with an orange bow attached to the front, a miniskirt that hung from her waist and knee high socks and shoes. Her hair was in twin ponytails and she was wearing her red glasses<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to see my precious Yugipoo\" Rebecca said happily. Despite being a college student she was still a little girl who had a big crush on Yugi and squeeled like one too. Even if she was more intelligent than the average 12 year old being skilled with computers to a high degree as well a dueling prodigy she couldn't help but like dolls, flowers and other little girl stuff. However when it came to her crush she had some competition, Tea. Rebecca and Tea have been competing for Yugi's love since the day she met her. She rival's Tea, but likes her for her tenacity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRebecca was on her way to meet Yugi in the city, her freckled face smiling like a giddy schoolgirl, which is what she is. she practically skipped down the sidewalk happily when she saw something that caught her eye. \"Huh, what's that\" she said as she saw something blowing in the wind. Looking closer she saw it was a duel monsters card. She watched as it twisted and turned in the air and finally settled down on the ground in front of her gently, almost as though it wanted her to pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird, cards don't just fly through the air like that\" Rebecca said as she picked up the card with her little fingers. Fidgeting with her glasses using her other hand she examined the card. \"And they certainly aren't blank either\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the card began glowing in her hand. Rebecca closed her eyes in surprise as she was blinded by a bright light that blasted through the card.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happen's next...</span></div></div>",

She stood with sand blowing in her face outside of a large pyramid. \"Whe-where am I\" she said in shock of the sight in front of her. As she looked onward she saw nothing but sand, dunes of sand below a bright sun. As she lifted her hand to shield her eyes from the sun she noticed that her arm was bare, no longer clad in her blouse sleeve, which led her to look down, suspecting that her clothes were no longer the same. She was right. Rebecca was no longer wearing her blouse. Instead, she wore a white silk dress that was strapless, the kind of dress that went down to your knees. It revealed her shoulders and lower legs and had a hood, presumably for the sun. Her arms were adorned with a pair of bracelets attached to her wrists and her biceps. Her hair no longer in twin ponytails was now let loose down behind her, two of her bangs hanging down her face. On her feet she no longer wore any socks or her shoes, but a pair of simple brown slippers in bare feet. On her ankles were two gold anklets, adding to her outfit\u2019s Egyptian theme. She wore a choker on her neck, golden colored like her bracelets and anklets, and although she couldn\u2019t see it, a jewel encrusted circlet was on her forehead. All in all she was dressed like an Egyptian, adorned with beautiful jewelry. <br>\r\n\t\u201cHey, where am I, hello\u201d she shouted towards the desert landscape. \u201cOh man, am I in Egypt? And what\u2019s with these white clothes\u201d she said. \u201cDarn, that card did this to me\u201d she said. Looking around for the card, to no avail, she saw that there was nobody else, just her in the middle of a desert.  She wanted to take off her Egyptian clothing but there was nothing else for her to wear. Curiously she tugged at her dress. As she tugged at her new dress she noticed something sticking out of the sand. \u201cWhat\u2019s that\u201d she said. Bending down to pick it up from the sand she found...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a beautiful day at duel academy. The sun was shining brightly on the campus grounds. Alexis was walking happily, her blue high heeled boots clacking against the floors of the academy while her hips swayed as she walked, which was her own personal fashion of walking. She was known as the most beautiful girl in duel academy. Every male student wanted to be with her but she was interested in only two students in particular, Jaden Yuki and Syrus Truesdale. There was no doubt that Alexis had a crush on Jaden. He was funny, friendly and a great duelist. She had feelings for him as soon as he entered the academy, and even before that. As for Syrus, she adored his cute demeanor and small size. Considering he was so small he was like a little boy and she just wanted to put on an apron, cook a meal and place the dish in front of his cute little head. His cute little bug eyes, small stature and adorable appearance made him a little puppy that every girl in the academy, even some of the teachers just wanted to hug and smooch. Of course, it wasn\u2019t good for Syrus that he was so adorable. Sometimes he would have to run to class to avoid the mobs of overexcited fangirls that would love to get their manicured hands on his soft little baby cheeks and smother him with home cooked food, kisses and love altogether. Alexis however was more mature than practically all the girls as she was willing to help the poor boy avoid the love crazy girls in student uniforms. Despite her more mature demeanor she secretly wished to pinch his little boy cheeks and kiss them while hugging him in her bare arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her way to her next class she heard a loud rumbling, but to her the rumbling was all too familiar. Tilting her heel she turned around to see a petit blue haired little boy running for the hills, a terrified look on his face as a cloud of dust blown by a mob of love filled girls were right on his tail, hands reaching out to grab the little boy teen. It wasn\u2019t too long before the boy screamed for help. \u201cAaaaaahhh\u201d. To his luck he saw Alexis and she hinted him to go inside the room she was next to. Syrus wholeheartedly agreed and quickly turned to enter the room with Alexis. Slamming the door shut he was relieved to be rid of the ravenous fangirls that were always after him. Taking a breather, he slumped to the floor, gasping for breath from running. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep running like this you know, sooner or later their gonna catch you\u201d Alexis said, her arms folded across her large chest and her bare feet moving in her shoes as she stood with them pointing at different directions. \u201cWell, what am I gonna do, you heard what they said. When they capture me, they\u2019ll stuff me full of food till I get fat, I don\u2019t want that\u201d Syrus said about to cry. Alexis, feeling empathetic, bet down towards him and spread her arms across him and hugged him gently. \u201cDon\u2019t worry you\u2019ll get through this\u201d she said gently towards him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking forward, Syrus noticed the room that he was in. It looked like a kitchen. In the rush, Alexis probably didn\u2019t know which room she was going into. Turning around, Alexis and Syrus stood up to look around the room. There were many pots and pans hanging on shelves. They knew right away that it was Mrs Dorothy\u2019s kitchen. \u201cWow, never been inside this place before\u201d Syrus said. The kitchen was the worst place for Syrus to be. He knew what those girls wanted and that was to hold him down and stuff him up till his small tummy fattened up into a big jiggling belly that bounced up and down out of his to be too small shirt. Syrus and Alexis both looked around the kitchen. As they turned they saw something that caught their attention. They saw</span></div></div>",

Walkng over ahead of Syrus, Alexis picked up a breadstick from the cup. \"It looks like Ms Dorothy made breadsticks\" she said. \"Yeah but why, I've never seen breadsticks being served in the cafeteria\" Syrus stated. \"Neither have I\" Alexis replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, there are my breadsticks\" said a deep yet feminine voice coming from behind Alexis and Syrus. Turning around the two saw the ever friendly Ms Dorothy. \"Thank you so much for finding them\" said the friendly lunch lady. She walked over to where Alexis was and picked up the cup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi Ms Dorothy\" said Syrus, a bit nervous havng snuck into her kitchen without her knowing. \"Hello, sweet syrus\" Dorothy said, smiling at the boy. \"Alexis, how are you doing. Thank you so much for finding my breadsticks\" she said holding the cup with them. \"Oh, um, your welcome Ms Dorothy\" said the blonde girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it wasn't for you two I would never have found them so quickly. I thought i took them with me to the cafe but they weren't with me at all. I came back here to double check but they were here all along. Guess I shouldn't have panicked so much giggle\". Alexis and Syrus just stood there, not able to respond due to the lack of words to say. Not wanting to be rude, they muttered a small chuckle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But i wonder, what are you two doing here\"? Realizing they were caught, they tried to hide the panic in their faces. Then Alexis spat out an answer. \"We were just curious that's all\" she said with a smile. \"Yeah, never saw the kitchen of duel academy before\" said Syrus following along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a reward for finding my breadsticks I'd like you to try them\" Ms Dorothy said. \"Um, sure\" Syrus said. Taking one out with a slightly porky finger, Ms Dorothy lowered towered Syrus first. giving him a stick. Taking it Syrus held it in his hand. \"Thank you\" said the boy. \"Oh your welcome sweety\" Dorothy said patting his head. Moving towards Alexis she took out another stick and gestured it toward her. \"Here's one for you Alexis dear\" she said happily. Being a top student and a very neat girl, Alexis avoided any kind of fatty substance so as to not ruin her slim figure. she was proud of her skinny body and wanted to keep it that way. But she also knew it would be rude to turn down an offer like that. After all it was one breadstick. What harm could that do?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok\" Alexis said, taking the bread in her dainty long nailed fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a bite out the bread, they chewed as Ms Dorothy watched eagerly as they consumed her latest...concoction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting the last piece of bread they chewed happily and swallowed as the bread landed in their stomachs. Gurgling peculiarly, but not extraordinarily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, that was really good\" syrus said. \"Yeah, I don't think I've ever had a breadstick that good before\" Alexis added. \"Good\" Dorothy said. \"Because its my special science experiment bread I made\". Looking wide eyed, the two teens loudly said \"WHAT\"? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden Alexis and Syrus's stomachs started to growl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yusei shook his his head and blinked to get the stars out of his eyes. What had just happened? He had been working on the Duel Runners, when Akiza and the twins had entered the garage and wanted to show him something they had found; an odd looking Duel Monsters card. He had just taken the card to look at it, when it let out a very bright light, that engulfed all of them; hence his current head-shaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everyone alright?\" he asked. A small scream then came from Luna's direction. \"We're fine physically,\" she said meekly, \"but I wouldn't say the same thing about our clothes.\" A small pause was followed by two more screams, this time from Leo and Akiza. Yusei finally blinked the stars out of his eyes, took a look at himself and also let out a shout of surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei was wearing his usual attire; the black  T-shirt with the red markings on it, the dark-blue jacket and blueish-black pants, both with orange pads on them, a brown belt and gloves and boots of roughly the same brown colour. However, the mysterious card had altered his and his friends' perception on whose clothes belonged to whom, so everyone now thought that the clothes Yusei was wearing, were actually Luna's! Similarly, they also thought that the clothes Luna was wearing, (the white shorts with the red belt, the long-sleaved red undershirt with gold markings, the light-pink vest, close-to-knee-high white socks and white and pink sneakers), were actually Yusei's!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei then turned his attention to Luna, who looked ready to burst into tears. \"Yusei, what's going on?\" she halfway sobbed. \"Why am I suddenly wearing your clothes, while you are wearing mine?\" Yusei went over to Luna to comfort her. \"Don't cry, Luna,\" he told her. \"We're going to figure everything out, I promise. But right now, I've got to calm down your brother, first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo was also wearing his usual clothes; the white shorts with a blue belt, a blue undershirt with gold markings, a white vest, black and white armbands, and blue and white sneakers, but everyone now thought that those clothes belonged to Akiza, and that Akiza's clothes, (the dark red top and skirt, black stockings, red high-heeled shoes, black long fingerless gloves, the necklace, the red choker, and the red and white, long femenine jacket), were really Leo's! Because he now thought he was wearing Akiza's clothes, Leo was understandably freaking out, a lot more than his sister was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WhatisgoingonherewhyamIwearingAkiza'sclotheswhyisshewearingminethis isreallyfreaky!!!\" he rambled off very quickly; not to mention, very loudly. Yusei hurried over to try to calm him down, before he got too freaked out. \"Calm down, Leo! Take it easy, okay?\" said Yusei with raised voice. \"Take it easy? Take it easy?!?\" yelled Leo. \"You can't be serious! Look at what I'm wearing!\" He gestured to his clothes, that they all now thought were Azkiza's. \"These are Akiza's clothes! I can't be seen in these! I'd be the laughing stock at Duel Academy! And you are wearing my sisters clothes! This is horrible! What are we going to do?!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Calm down, Leo!\" bellowed Yusei. The loud shout instantly stopped Leo's tirade. Yusei sighed, looked Leo in the eyes and said: \"Look, I know how you feel. This is just as awkward for me as it is for you.\" He stopped and started fidgeting with the gloves he was wearing. Because of the alterations that the card had made, Yusei thought he didn't wear gloves normally, so they felt really odd and constricting on his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, stop that, Yusei,\" complained Leo. \"Those are my sisters clothes, remember? I don't want you to ruin her gloves. Those are her favorite pair.\" Yusei stopped fidgeting right away and apologized. \"Sorry about that, Leo. It's just, I don't normally wear gloves, so I just thought they felt wierd and I was trying to make it a little more comfortable for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well, I can understand that,\" said Leo and pulled on 'Akiza's' shorts. \"I think these feel really wierd to wear. They are so... inclosed compared to my skirt. I'm used to having a bit more room to move my legs, when I'm wearing my skirt; I don't have that with this. I feel like I can barely move with these on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, hands off, Leo!\" said Akiza. Leo, Luna and Yusei all turned to look at her, Leo letting go of the shorts immediately. \"Those shorts are the best pair I have. Anyway, speaking of movement problems, I have some too,\" Sure enough, she was trying, and failing, to walk around in 'Leo's' high-heels. She wobbled around, barely able to keep her balance and she kept on falling everytime she had taken just a few steps. After her ninth fall in a row, she looked at Leo and said: \"You know what, Leo? I honestly don't know how you can even walk around with these things on. They are almost like mini-stilts strapped to your foot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all thanks to skill. Something which I happen to have a lot off,\" said Leo proudly. Akiza huffed and retorted: \"Maybe so, but I think I look ridiculous wearing these shoes; even more ridiculous than I look with this skirt on.\" As she said the last part, she tugged on the skirt, almost like she was trying to make it cover more of her legs. Of course, the fact that Akiza was a girl, and so there was nothing wrong or silly about her wearing high-heeled shoes and a skirt, was completely lost on all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, be careful, Akiza!\" exclaimed Leo. \"That's my favorite skirt and I don't want you to rip it!\" \"I'm sorry, Leo,\" said Akiza and let go of the skirt right away. \"I just feel so exposed around my legs, with this silly thing on.\" \"Since we all feel wierd about this,\" said Luna, \"then we should switch our clothes back as soon as possible. Preferably very soon; this thing just doesn't fit me at all.\" she added and pulled on 'Yusei's' shirt. The fact that it was actually her clothes, and so it did fit her perfectly, went unnoticed by all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, don't pull on that shirt, Luna,\" said Yusei. \"It's my best one, so I am a bit sensitive about that.\" \"Oh, my! I'm so sorry about that, Yusei,\" apologized Luna and stopped the pulling. \"It's alright,\" said Yusei. \"You are right, though. We need to switch back our clothes, before anyone sees us like this.\" \"I agree,\" said Akiza. She had decided to take off 'Leo's' high-heeled shoes, so she could stand without falling. \"But we can't just take them off right here and now; th\u00e4t would be quite embarrassing.\" \"So, what do we do?\" said Luna. \"I don't know,\" said Leo, \"but we'd better think of something fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey stod there, thinking, for a little while; both trying to come up with ideas on how to change their clothes, with out making it too awkward, and trying to avoid touching and pulling on the clothes that they now thought belonged to each other. The last part was by far the hardest, because all of them felt very uncomfortable with the clothes that they currently wore, and they wanted to get out of them really bad and into the clothes that they thought were their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got it!\" exclaimed Yusei suddenly. \"We can use one of the screens that me, Jack and Crow use to divide our workspaces. One of us will be one each side of the screen and hand the clothes over to each other. The other two will have to go upstairs, to make it less awkward, and when the two of us down here are finished, they go upstairs and then the other two can change their clothes down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea, Yusei,\" said Leo, as Yusei found the screen in question. \"But, who do you think should change their clothes back, first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\"</span></div></div>",

You can let go, now!\" complained Leo. Luna did as Leo wanted and let him out of the hug. That's when Akiza reminded him, that they should get upstairs, so Yusei and Luna could change their clothes in private. \"Well, see you in a few minutes, sis,\" said Leo, and followed Akiza up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Yusei and Luna were alone in the garage. \"Well, we'd better get to it,\" said Yusei. \"Right, and let's do it fast,\" said Luna, as she and Yusei placed themselves on each side of the screen. \"My feet are starting to icth, from being in your sneakers, Yusei.\" \"Speaking of that,\" said Yusei, as both of them began to remove their footwear, \"I don't get how you even wear those boots. They feel so stiff, to me. I personally prefer my sneakers. At least I feel I can move around in them.\" \"Hey, I happen to like those boots,\" said Luna, as they finished taking off their footwear and moved on to their shirts and jackets. \"But what I don't get is how we even swapped clothes in the first place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think it was thanks to that strange card you guys brought,\" said Yusei, as he got ready to take 'Luna's' pants off. He then heard Luna gasp: \"Well, if it was the card that did this, then it was very thorough. It even swapped our underwear!\" \"What?!?\" yelled Yusei, and quickly pulled 'Luna's' pants off, so he could check for himself. Sure enough, he was wearing what he thought to be Luna's blue boxer-shorts! \"Hey, Luna,\" he said. \"Are you really wearing...\" \"Yup,\" answered Luna, timidly. \"I'm wearing your panties, Yusei.\" \"I figured,\" said Yusei back, \"because I'm wearing your boxers, Luna.\" Neither of them noticed the sheer oddity of those statements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei looked at the boxers again and said: \"You know, Luna, these things are actually quite comfortable.\" As soon as he had said it, he heard a sound from Luna's side of the screen. Sobbing. Luna was crying! \"I can't believe you said that, Yusei!\" she sobbed. \"I just want my clothes back! I want my boxers back! And I don't want to wear your panties anymore; they are too thight, they itch, they are so boyish...\" \"Don't cry, Luna! It wasn't meant like that!\" Yusei hurriedly apologized. \"It was just a statement, nothing more! Here...\" he took of 'Luna's' boxers, put them with the other clothes and reached over the screen to give them to Luna. \"Here's all of your clothes, Luna. Are we good, now?\" \"Yeah, we're good,\" said Luna, as she stopped crying and took the clothes that she thought were hers. She then took off 'Yusei's' panties and gave them, and the rest of the clothes, that they now thought were Yusei's, back to him, as she said: \"And here's your clothes back. Now let's get dressed properly.\" \"Agreed,\" said Yusei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them, then started to put on the clothes that they thought were theirs. But, because those clothes really belonged to the other, it would be a very awkward sight to see, for anyone whose perceptions weren't changed by the strange card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei was putting on Luna's clothes, but thanks to the card, he percieved them as his own, so he didn't realize that they were actually too small for him to wear properly. He started by putting on Luna's panties; Being much too small for him in reality, they rode up the crack of his butt and didn't even cover his manhood fully. He then turned his attention to Luna's red shirt. Somehow, he managed to squeeze his arms and his head through the appropriate holes in the shirt, without ripping it, though because of it's size, the sleaves of the shirt didn't even reach down to Yusei's elbow, and the shirt itself barely covered his upper torso, and didn't even reach his stomach. Then came the shorts. Because of their size, they snagged before Yusei even got them past his knees, but, again, he succeded in putting on clothes that should, by all counts, have ripped when he put them on, but didn't. He even managed to tighten the belt on them! And even though Luna's shorts could barely be considered boxers on Yusei's large frame, and should have been painfully tight, especially on his manhood, he didn't seem to be in pain at all. If anything, he seemed to be relieved that he was finally wearing what he thought were his own clothes again. Then, he put on Luna's light-pink jacket and, once more, he fitted the much too small jacket on his much too large body, without causing as much as a single thread to tear. Then, it was time for him to put on Luna's footwear. Whereas the socks would have gone up close to knee-hight on Luna, on Yusei, they only went up to his ankles. And finally, the shoes. Now, one wouldn't think that someone of Yusei's size, could ever manage to get his feet into sneakers that were, at least, six sizes too small for him; but he did it! Now Yusei was completely dressed in Luna's clothes, which he percieved to be his own, but incredibly, even though those clothes were way too small on him, he wasn't in pain from any of it; neither from the shirt, the shorts, or even from his feet being squeezed into Luna's much too small (for him) sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was because, when the strange card changed  the four friends' perceptions on clothes, it also made three other modifications. First, it made it so that the none of the clothes would ever rip apart; no matter who wore them. Second, it made it so that the clothes would always be comfortable on anyone wearing them, exept for the original owners of the clothes (in most cases). Lastly, it made it so that the wearers of the clothes, would not suffer from constriction on the bloodvessels, tightness, ect. for wearing clothes too small for them. That was why Yusei now stood there, wearing all of Luna's clothes and not feeling any uncomfortableness from that, and being glad that he was once more wearing what he thought to be his own clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, it was also awkward on Luna's side of the screen, but for the exact opposite reason. Luna was putting on Yusei's clothes, but thanks to the card, she percieved them as her own, so she didn't realize that they were actually too large for her to wear properly. She started by putting on Yusei's boxers; being much too large for her, they actually looked like slightly bigger shorts on her, than those she wore before, and she had to hold them up, to keep them from sliding down all the time. She then proceeded to put on Yusei's shirt. It was so big, that it covered nearly her whole body, bar the lower part of her legs. Of course, she needed both arms to put on the shirt, so Yusei's boxers slipped off of her legs, as she put the shirt on. She quickly pulled them back up though, when she had put the shirt on. The next article of clothing she put on was Yusei's pants. Of course, due to the size of the pants, she had to roll up the pant-legs, just to be able to get her comparetively tiny legs to fit in them, but even so, they were still too big for her to put them on normally. She had to tighten the belt extra much, so she'd be able to hold up both the pants, and the boxers too. Next up, was Yusei's jacket. She had to roll up the sleaves to be able to put it on, but even so, it was still so big, that the ends on the jacket scraped across the ground as she moved.  Then she put on Yusei's footwear. The socks were big enough to actually go up over her knees. The boots were almost just as big, going up to her knees, which would have made it difficult for her to walk, normally. But since she now thought that the boots were really hers, she knew how to move about with them on. Finally, she put on Yusei's gloves. It didn't matter to her, that the gloves went all the way up to her elbows; she was just happy to have, what she thought was her clothes, on again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it, I'm done,\" called Luna. \"Me, too,\" answered Yusei. They stepped out from their respective sides of the screen, to look at each other. To any onlooker, they would have looked ridiculous; Yusei was squeezed into the clothes of a 12-year old, little girl, while Luna was almost swimming in the clothes of a 19-year old, young adult male. Yusei and Luna did not find anything strange though, as they both thought that this was how they normally dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel so much better, now that I have my own clothes on,\" said Luna, as she adjusted 'her' gloves. \"You said it,\" said Yusei, while he smoothed out a wrinkle in 'his' shirt. \"We'd better go up and tell Akiza and Leo, that it's their turn, now,\" he added. \"I'm sure he'll be trilled,\" said Luna and smiled, as she walked upstairs after Yusei.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Leo and Akiza were patiently waiting on a sofa, still wearing what they thought to be each others clothes, when Yusei and Luna came up the stairs. Although the two of them were presently wearing each others clothing, everyone thought that it was how they normally dressed. Leo was excited to see Luna dressed as usual (to him). \"Hey, sis,\" he said and hurried over to them. \"It's good to see you in your normal outfit, again.\" \"It's good to BE back in my normal outfit again,\" said Luna back. \"Yusei's shorts and sneakers were really uncomfortable to wear, not to mention his shirt. It felt very odd to be dressed as a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know exactly how you feel, Luna,\" said Akiza, who as far as everyone thought, were dressed as Leo. \"Anyway,\" said Yusei, as he adjusted 'his' jacket, \"We just came to tell you, that it's your turn to change your clothes back.\" \"Really?\" exclamed Leo. \"Yep,\" answered Yusei. \"It's all ready for you, downstairs.\" \"Great!\" shouted a very happy Leo. He almost ran to the stairs as he said: \"Come on, Akiza! The sooner we get down there, the sooner we'll be back in our own clothes. I don't want to wear your girlish shorts, anymore than I have already!\" \"I'm coming!\" said Akiza and followed Leo. \"I want out of your boyish skirt, as much as you want out of my shorts.\" \"We'll be waiting up here for you,\" said Luna, as her brother and Akiza went downstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne short moment later, and Akiza and Leo were standing on each side of the same screen, that Yusei and Luna had changed their clothes behind. \"Guess there's nothing left, but to go for it,\" said Leo, as he started to remove 'Akiza's' clothes from his body. \"Finally,\" said Akiza, she too began to take off 'Leo's' clothes. \"Your clothes were starting to itch on my chest. I don't think I could have handled being dressed as a boy much longer.\" \"You're telling me,\" Leo called back. He had already removed 'Akiza's' sneakers and socks, and was well on the way to removing 'her' jacket. \"I know I definitely couldn't handle being dressed like a girl, anymore. My feet felt so cramped inside your sneakers, Akiza. I'd much prefer my high-heels to your sneakers, any day. Speaking of wich, did you bring them with you?\" \"Of course I did,\" said Akiza. So far, she had removed 'Leo's' stockings, gloves and jacket. \"I wasn't wearing them, though. I couldn't walk in them, at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not,\" said Leo, as he took of 'Akiza's' shorts, without noticing what was under there, and then moving on to the shirt. \"It requires a lot of practice to walk in them. And that's something that I...\" His voice trailed off as he was looking at his bare torso. Then he screamed. \"Is something wrong, Leo?\" asked Akiza with concern. She was almost done taking off 'Leo's clothes; all she was missing was the combined top/skirt, that she thought Leo usually wore. \"Y-yes,\" stuttered Leo. \"Something i-is very w-wrong Akiza. M-my bra... It's gone!\" \"What do you mean 'gone'?\" asked Akiza. \"I meant exactly what I said!\" Leo half-way screamed. \"I had just finished removing your clothes, when I looked down, and both my bra and my panties were gone! Instead, I'm now wearing blue boxers!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza froze, as she heard Leo say that. She had suddenly gotten a creepy hunch about what Leo said and the itching on her chest. She slowly took off the top/skirt combo, looked down and screamed, when she saw her hunch was right. \"Leo,\" she said, \"whatever swapped our clothes, also swapped our underwear. I'm wearing your panties and bra and you are wearing my boxers!\" \"Eeewww!\" shrieked Leo, and pulled the boxers down as fast he could. \"I can't believe I wore girl underwear! Gross! Here are your clothes, Akiza. Now, give me mine back, before I really flip out!\" He hurriedly send all of 'Akiza's' clothes over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm trying, Leo, but this thing is hard to get off,\" said Akiza, as she fumbled with the straps of the bra. One short moment later, and she had unfastened it, leaving her breasts to bounce freely without anything holding them in place. She then placed the bra and the panties with the rest of 'Leo's' clothes and handed them back to him, while saying: \"It was so constricting on my breasts, that I don't get how you can even wear that.\" \"Speak for yourself,\" huffed Leo. \"I wouldn't be able to make it through the day without it.\" The fact that Leo, being a boy, shouldn't wear a bra, and that Akiza, being a girl, should, was lost on both of them. \"Well, now that we have our own clothes back,\" said Leo, \"what do you say to; less talking and more wearing them?\" \"I'm all for that,\" said Akiza and began to do just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza started with putting on Leo's boxers. Due to the magic of the strange card, they did not rip, but they were still much too small for her. They only covered about two-thirds of her sizeable butt, yet she was still satisfied, because she thought she was wearing her regular underwear again. Then, she put on Leo's shirt. Because of it's small size, it only managed to cover about two-thirds of her boobs, leaving the remaining third bare. The jacket was next. It went on easily enough, in spite of being quite small on her. Although, the jacket did emphasize, just how much her boobs were pushing out on Leo's shirt. Then it was time for her, to put on Leo's shorts. Though the shorts were only slightly bigger than the boxers, she managed to put them on too, but this time, she did manage to get them to cover her whole backside, unlike the boxers. Leo's wristbands were next. They were by far the easiest to put on; she just put them around her own wrists, and that was pretty much it. It was also relatively easy for her to put on Leo's socks and sneakers, even though they were vrey small compared to her. And there was Akiza, dressed up in Leo's clothes, but thinking they were hers all along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Leo's side of the screen, it was somewhat similar, yet for the opposite reason, since he was putting on Akiza's clothes, that were too big for him in reality. He started by putting on Akiza's panties. Fortunately, they were of the kind that can be tightened with a string, so Leo could get them on like that. Otherwise, the big woman panties would not have been able to fit on his small boy body, at all. Next, he put on Akiza's bra. He put it on easily, almost as though he had had years of practice in doing that.He dressed up in the rest of the clothes very quickly. He had to roll up Akiza's fingerless gloves, and her stockings to be able to fit in them, the top/skirt combo was almost covering his body completely, even with his feet in the high-heels and the lower part of Akiza's jacket was dragging behind him on the ground, but he took no notice of that. He was just happy that he wore what he thought to be his normal clothes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now that we are properly dressed,\" said Leo, \"what do you think we should do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" said Akiza.</span></div></div>",

Leo shrugged it off and was about to continue heading to Yusei's garage when he got a weird feeling. Instead of wanting to go to Yusei's garage now he felt like he had to go to Akiza's place.  He went over to her place and knocked at the door, but she didn't answer. Leo remembered that Akiza said she had a lot of errands to run earlier. He was about to leave, but he couldn't get rid of the feeling that he needed to get in there. Akiza gave him and Luna's spare keys to her place in case they needed to get in there for some sort of emergency. Leo went in, though he still had no idea what he wanted to do now that he was there.  Leo felt another urge to move to another place, and found himself in front of Akiza's drawer. Leo wondered why he wanted to be here so bad, until he noticed that he was taking off all of his clothes. He felt like he couldn't control himself as he opened up the drawer. Leo blushed as he stared at dozens of pairs of Akiza's panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As hard as he tried, he couldn't fight the urge to try them off as he put on a pair of frilly red panties.  Moving on, Leo opened another one of the drawers and was greeted with the sight of dozens of red corsets. Leo didn't know what it was, but still couldn't help himself as he tightened the corset. The corset was really painful, though Leo was more concerned that something didn't look right. He figured it out as he grabbed some of Akiza's socks and filled the cups of the corset with them.  Leo closed the drawers and went over to Akiza's closet and looked inside. It had a couple different types of outfits, but there dozens of copies of Akiza's normal dress that she wore. Before he could put on the dress he tried on the short skirt that Akiza wore with the dress. He felt drawn to the dress and became blissful as he grabbed the dress.  The dress was magenta colored with big puffy light green sleeves, it was shorter and pleated in the front. Putting it on made Leo feel much more relaxed, and he stopped thinking of wearing these clothes as weird. He was close, though he still had a couple of things left to put on. He slid up some long fingerless black gloves, and some black leggings. He attached the leggings to the skirt with some suspenders.  Finally Leo grabbed a pair of high heeled red pumps, although he had trouble walking in them. After a bit of practice he made it to the mirror and looked himself over. He was in a bit of a trance as he happily admired his reflection, but he felt that something was missing. Eventually he realized what it was and finished out the outfit with a red choker as he twirled in front of the mirror. Looking around he caught sight of some makeup that Akiza had, but also what she sued to style and maintain her hair. Leo felt the urge to try them both, though he would have to pick one to do first.</span></div></div>",

He also had on a pair of red and black glove, a red belt, and a pair of white and red shoes. Yuma couldn't help but think this boy looked familiar, and he even had a cannon just like Anna's, though his was red..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Yuma asked the boy, and noticed that his voice sounded strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who am I? Who are you?\" the boy asked. \"Hey, whats wrong with my voice?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? My name is Yuma.\" Yuma replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yuma...? Ah, it is you!\" the boy said looking surprised. \"But... how are you a girl all of a sudden!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!?\" Yuma said as he looked down, and saw that he now had a pair of breasts comparable to Anna's! His clothes hadn't changed much, only his pants had been replaced with a white skirt, and the rest of his clothes had been modified to fit a girl. He then hestitantly reached down and felt that it was flat, and his little friend wasn't there any more! \"Gah, I'm a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, then...\" he boy looked down at himself and started to freak out. \"Ah! I'm a boy!\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Wait, Anna, is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>This turn of events is most strange.</i>\" Astral chimed in. \"<i>Though I'm surprised it took you both so long to realize you had changed.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Astral...\" Yuma complained. \"Now what are we going to do? I don't want to be a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I don't want to be a boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two thought about their situation, Yuma then spotted some familiar people.

She wanted to walk with Yuma but he had already gone ahead of her, something that peeved her a bit.  She looked at the ground while walking when she saw something that was quite peculiar. It was a card, but it wasn't just a card, it was a card with no picture on it. It was green framed so she guessed it was a spell card, since she's seen enough duels with Yuma to know green cards were spell cards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird\" Tori said as she picked up the card and held it up to look at it. \"Don't cards usually have pictures on them\"? <br>\r\n<br>\r\njust as she said that, the card began to glow.

As she looked up the mailbox beside her was the size of a building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh-whaaaa\" she said in a panic, but she noticed her voice was very shrill and squeaky, like she was a mouse. She had apparently shrunk down to a foot tall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she panicked she looked down at herself. Her school uniform consisting of a white and pink blouse with a pink miniskirt, was replaced by a frilly pink dress with a super small skirt and lot of hearts and ribbons. The dress was a thin plain form fitting garment that left her arms bare as it was sleeveless. It ended with a skirt that barely covered her upper legs with the outer part a pink flower shaped tutu that flared out. The hearts were on the front of her dress and colored a very bright pink, 2 small ones on opposite sides of her front waist with a huge heart on the front, taking up the entire torso and waist are of her dress. Kotori felt one of the small hearts with her fingers, which now had pink nail polish on them. They felt solid and bulgy like jewels, but they were very real. On her waist was a very large ribbon tied around her dress. It ended in a large pink present bow behind her, keeping the dress tied together. Her hair and hairstyle were the same, but her ribbon was now longer and extended down her head to her neck as well as having a large heart shaped hair clip on her hair on the ribbon. She looked down at her neck to see a cute looking red choker attached to her neck with a pink heart on the center of it. Looking down below the dress, her feet were barefoot, not a single shoe or sock to be seen as she felt the cement sidewalk on her soles. Her toenails however were adorned with bright pink nail polish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah-ah-AAAH what happened to me, i'm super small and ended up in this dress\" she said tugging on her hair with both hands. As she did though, she noticed something pointy touch her arm as she lifted it. Feeling her ear, she noticed it was huge and pointy. She had grown pointy ears that were as big as an elf's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have to be kidding me, i have pointy ears? What am i an elf\" she asked in frustration. By reflex she felt something on her twitch behind her. It felt like it was connected to her body. Tori turned around and noticed she now had a large pair of wings. They were see-through and bug like and stuck out gracefully behind her back as they were clasped together. An extra tiny set of fairy wings were below the large and long set, barely visible but still there. The wings protruded from her back through her dress.<br>\r\n\"Fairy wings\"? She said curiously. She brushed her left hand against her left wing. It felt soft like a curtain, but it was also like she was touching her own arm. She could feel it as she rubbed it, the feeling of an appendage coming out of her back, confirming the wings were indeed coming out of her skin. \"I wonder if i can fly...\" she said to herself. She tried triggering her brain to flap her wings. She managed to get one flap, but couldn't get any more than that. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Pant, pant\" Tori went as she put her hands on her bare knees, exhausted from attempting to fly. Looking down at herself she was a bit taken back by her new form. \"I can't believe i'm a fairy\" she said looking at her soft smooth dainty hands which seemed more petit and childlike now. Once again she pulled at and touched her now pointy ears. They weren't sharp but they had hard tips and definitely felt real. She always liked fairies and despite not being a duelist, fairies were her favorite type of monster cards. She didn't know if it was the girl in her acting out but they were just so cute to her.  She just couldn't believe she was one now and she didn't know if she was ok with this. She looked herself over again and looked at her dress. The big puffy flower tutu was too girly in her opinion, although a part of her loved it. All in all she looked like a very pink, cute girly heart themed fairy.<br>\r\nExamining her dress, she blushed and hoped she didn't lose any important clothing, so she decided to check what was underneath her tutu. She sighed in relief as she put a hand underneath and discovered she was wearing panties, which were a bright pink as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that she would be seen she decided to find a place to hide. Looking around she saw a bush and ran to it, her feet pattering on the ground. She felt disgusted at how dirty they were becoming. She ran inside the bush, peeking outside as she saw the tall legs of people walking by. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned around and looked at her see-through wings. She felt them again and they twitched from how sensitive they were. She could definitely feel them like they were her arms. <br>\r\n Despite being curious about being a fairy, she didn't exactly like being small and wanted to go back to her human self as she wasn't comfortable with her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to become normal sized and human again..\" she said worried she could be stuck like this forever, feeling her wings brush up against a large leaf in the bush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she noticed something in her dress collar. Pulling it out, she saw it was the card from before that turned her into a fairy. It was now extremely small, the size of her hand, as it accommodated itself to Tori's size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU, YOU DID THIS TO ME\" Tori yelled in her squeaky voice at the card in her hand. \"CHANGE ME BACK\" she yelled to the card. <br>\r\nThe card began glowing and...</span></div></div>",

Right now\" Tori yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the card started glowing, the blank image glowing a brilliant white as it shot a light at Tori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaagh, what's going on\" she said scared of the bright light shining on her. All of a sudden she felt her body getting lighter. Looking down she sees her feet and legs become covered in some sort of blue light different from the white light enveloping her currently. The light spread all over her body from legs to wings to head. Soon her head was covered in blue light as she now looked like a bright blue silhouette of herself. She felt her body change shape and compress and morph into a small ball of light. The ball went directly into the blank image of the card and disappeared as the card collapsed in on itself and vanished as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooooaaah\" Tori said as she was being beamed at lightspeed to who knows where through some dimensional rift as a ball of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the middle of a meadow with flowers a portal opened up. Out flew Tori, back as her fairy body. \"Aaaaah, oof\" said Tori as she landed on her face, her butt and pink panties sticking up from her pink dress as her wings drooped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooooh that was not fun...\" She said as she sat up, her bare feet touching grass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I...\" She asked aloud to no one. She looked around. The surrounding area was a big meadow, not a tree in sight. Only grass was around as far as the eye could see. There were also some butterflies much smaller than she was, which was strange since she remembered she shrunk. Getting up, she decided to walk around and find someone for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also noticed that the card was gone. \"Oh man, how am I supposed to get back to Heartland without that card...not like it really helped anyway since it brought me here in the first place\" she said as she continued walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wished she could actually figure out how to use the large wings that stuck out from her back to fly. She really wasn't feeling comfortable in this pink skimpy dress with hearts on it and her feet getting dirtier with each step she took. She liked pink but this dress was not for her. She then looked at her left foot's sole. It was brown and filthy. \"Geez...\" She turned around to see her wings and tried to fly again. She jumped but there was no flapping or flying and she fell on her face again. \"Ugh....\" She said picking herself up and spitting out some grass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she saw an exit to this endless meadow. It looked like some sort of treetop city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, civilization at last hopefully\" she said running towards the trees. She figured this was some alternate dimension so tree cities weren't too surprising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her attention was caught by...</span></div></div>",

Looking around her surrounding she was surprised to find that she was in a different area. \u201cHuh, where, where am I\u201d Tori said worriedly. No longer in Heartland city or any city for that matter, she found herself to be in some sort of empty sandy dessert, with no trace of any people anywhere. The wind and small sandstorm blew the sand dunes and sandy landscape that surrounded her. \u201cUgh, oh man, how\u2019d I get in the dessert\u201d she said with the blinding hot sun beaming down on her head. She lifted her hand to cover her head from the heat, but as she lifted it she noticed something strange. While usually sleeveless and showing her skin in accordance with her school uniform, her arm was now adorned with 3 golden bracelets that clamped to her wrist along with a ring on her ring finger. Looking down at herself she saw her clothes had also changed. No longer clad in her school dress and small miniskirt, which barely covered her thighs, she now wore a white strapless sundress that left her shoulders exposed and had a longer skirt that went down to her knees. Her legs were now bare, with 3 anklets attached to her ankles, fitting her new Egyptian look. Instead of her school shoes and knee length high socks, she was barefoot, wearing no socks and on her feet she wore a pair of slippers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up her sundress with her right hand she went crazy trying to figure out what\u2019s going on. \u201cHey, what is this, where are my clothes, and why am I in the desert\u201d she said to no one, with of course no answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking along, she felt the sand go into her shoes tickling her feet. Looking down, she looked at her dress  depressingly, seeing how tattered and torn up it was. She couldn\u2019t believe that she was in the middle of the dessert wearing rags and bracelets because of that card that she found. How could it teleport her like that. Number cards were extraordinary cards but this one took the cake. <br>\r\nWalking and walking, she looked around. Only to find something that caught her eye. \u201cHuh, what\u2019s that?\u201d she said as she saw something sticking out of the sand.  It gleamed a bright color.

Its blank.\" There was no name, picture or text. The only distinguishing thing about it was the color, green, which told him it was a spell card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Such a strange card.</i>\" Astral commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder wy its blank.\" Tori commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he wondered about the card, he heard someone call out to him. \"Hey Yuma!

What about Tori?\" Yuma said, and he turned to his friend and was met with surprise,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori was sitting on the ground in a crouching position with her hands planted in front of her just like a dog, and she was completely naked with a pink collar around her neck with a tag that had her name on it, connected to a leash that Yuma realized he was holding. She had a strangely vacant look on her face, eyes wide and glazed, while her tongue was sticking out slightly from her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tori? What happened to you?\" Yuma asked in concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then turned to look at him with a inquisitve look, then with a happy look on her face, she stood up on her legs, but put her hands on him for balance as if she couldn't stand up on her own, and licked him in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, Tori! What are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead of replying, she merely made a barking noise. \"Woof woof!\" she let out cheerfully. She backed off Yuma and then when down to the ground. She stood on all fours and panted as she let her tongue hang out a bit. She then started to walk and Yuma was forced to follow or let go of the leash. Wondering what was going on with his friend, he followed and Anna trailed behind him just as confused. As Tori walked, they watched her sniff the ground a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so weird...\" Anna commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tori, why are you acting like a dog?\" Yuma asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>I don't think she is acting.</i>\" Astral said as he floated next to him. \"<i>I think that the card did something to her. From the way she is behaving, I think she really believes that she is a dog. This is very peculiar.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuma then looked at the card in his free hand. It was still blank. \"We've got to find a way to get Tori back to normal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah.\" Anna said. She hated to admit it, but part of her liked this strange turn of events. If Tori was a dog, then that took away a bit of competition for Yuma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arf Arf!\" they heard Tori bark, and they looked ahead. They saw some of their friends, and Tori was leading him right to them.</span></div></div>",

Dr Faker made it in a way to apologize to the public for lying to them about the whole Duel Carnival. Not everyone knew the whole truth, but the people already forgave him nonetheless. The park had everything from roller coasters to a small shopping mall, and everything was relatively cheap. To enter you just needed a small fee and to make a registration tag for the day, which consisted of a photo of the person, his name and a few minor things to enter. It seemed strange for some, but in reality it was a security measure in case suspicious people came into the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuma and Tori made plans to visit the theme park for today, with the latter making sure Cathy or the guys didn't know about this. They both wanted to have an enjoyable Saturday. He was sitting on the bench for 15 minutes before saying:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Tori sure is late. I wonder if her work she had to do at her home is the thing that's holding her up. She said that she was quite busy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably... But by the way Yuma...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think you should have put on something else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuma was wearing his typical outfit of a red jacket, a purple and green sleeveless shirt, white pants with orange designs and a pair of black and blue shoes. He also wore his brown fingerless glove and his bracelet as well as the trademark Emperor's key hanging on his neck alongside the ID tag. However, he didn't have his Duel Disk with him as he put in a locker at the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said it yourself. This is a special occasion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that special. Besides, having different outfits to change daily is something I am not too comfortable with. And let's not forget that there is the chance that I would dress with something she might not like. This one is the safest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose...\", said Astral calmly. \"But now let's get back on the topic of the blank card.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right...\", said Yuma as he pulled a black dueling card from his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found it on his way back from school yesterday on the ground. It seemed like an ordinary card, but Astral could feel that it had tremendous power in it. While he was unsure of its purpose or origin, he deduced that it could somehow grant wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think this wish thing is real?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By my analysis, it appears so. This card contains an energy which apparently has the ability to grant people's desires...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it didn't work before remember? I wished for some extra cash for today and it did nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe the wish needs to be something more meaningful than something as simple and material like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So if I wish the Barians to end their invasion, it will do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt that. Despite the power, it isn't something found in either the Astral or Barian World. I doubt anything related to other worlds will matter in this situation. In fact, it seems more like it is imbued by spiritual power by a human more than anything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Do people like that exist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is beyond my comprehension. But as your friend, Anna Kaboom said, I believe it is something to do with \"fighting spirit\".\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuma sighed and grumbled a bit in annoyance, which prompted Astral to ask him:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong? Did you and Anna have a fight that I don't know of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not that. It's just that... recently she has been really annoying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was she?\", asked Astral as he raised his eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She always comes whenever me and the gang want to do something and she always invites herself for said activity. The guys don't mind it, but me and Tori really have gotten tired of this. I understand her wanting to spend time with us after the time we dueled together, but she doesn't have to do it daily. And whenever I ask her why exactly she came, as I am sure she has her own plans for that day, she just fidgets and says she wanted to spend more time together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuma really didn't hate Anna, but whenever he remembers the times she not only caused damage with her cannon, but also got a bit too clingy to him. He didn't mind her company, but her constant decision to invite herself in his plans and arguing with Tori about who knows what really began to irritate him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you two have a duel scheduled with her tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do. Tomorrow I may ask her about why she wants so much to spend time together... And as for the \"fighting spirit\" thing, that means to be more passionate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at the card. He wanted to know Anna better so that their relationship  wouldn't be so awkward. He surely knew that there was something else to her. With the card in his hand, he then thought of something. He knew the chance for that to work was slim, but still, it was worth a try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Astral, mind if I try another wish?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may as well I suppose... I am curious to find out how this card works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" He then closed his eyes and when he opened them, he said to the card: \"I wish I understood everything there is about Anna Kabbom, 100 percent!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to the shock of the two, the card emitted a bright light that covered them. The wish was made, but it wouldn't be in a way Yuma ever thought...</span></div></div>",

He was still on the bench, and upon checking his thoughts, there was nothing new he learned about Anna. But there was something that disappeared...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Where did the card go? Hey Astral, do you- Astral?\", he asked around as the spectral figure was no longer next to him. When he went do check his pendant, he was in for a shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n... okay, there were two things that disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Where did the Key go?!\", asked Yuma aloud, some people looking at him confused. \"S-Sorry.\", replied the boy he sat down on the bench, trying to keep his voice down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, calm down. Was the card a trap? No, Astral said that it wasn't dangerous. And it can't be a dud as it made the Key vanish... How is this related to my wish in the slightest? It doesn't make sense. Anna even barely says anything about it whenever she talks, and she isn't even interested in Astral that much... What is going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yuma was trying to grasp the situation, his wish started to kick in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis shoes suddenly lost their laces as they better conformed on their feet as the color was starting to fade from them, starting to get whiter. Speaking of his feet, they became a bit smaller as his toes gained a pedicure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he ignored the slight discomfort from his shoes as he decided to look for the key.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It has to be here somewhere. I doubt the wish would've sent it somewhere too far... Just have to hope for the best I guess... All right. It's time to feel the flow!\", said Yuma to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began looking around, checking in the bushes, under the benches or the grass. He believed the card wouldn't just get rid of something that important for no reason, so he hoped that it would be near. But he still couldn't find out how was this tied to the wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just why did it make it go away? I can't see the logic here. It me finding the Key somehow tied to the wish? I doubt it. And even so, there must be another way to do it... Ngh, this is starting to get on my nerves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuma, while hot-blooded, wasn't the person with a short fuse. He didn't get angry over anything too easily and he got frustrated quite seldom, but mostly due to Astral's random comments or the gang's antics. But right now, he seemed like he wanted to just yell out his frustration. He grew increasingly impatient with him not finding the key or thinking as to why it vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continued searching, his hair started to change. The back black strands that spiked upwards seemed to be starting coming together as the four spikes seemed to get closer, almost like they were trying to merge together. Also, his feet finished changing, becoming petite, but they didn't seem to have lost their strength, in fact, they might've gotten a bit stronger and flexible.</span></div></div>",

While initially he tried to restrain himself, after 30 minutes of searching around the area, and not finding anything, he stomped his foot on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it! Where the heck is that thing?\", he exclaimed aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, some people turned at him, surprised by the yell and confused as to what happened. Upon noticing the stares, Yuma awkwardly walked away as he apologized for the racket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked, his shoes turned completely white but suddenly the soles started to turn dark-pink. Initially it was just a few spots of color but as he got out of the park and got near the shops, the whole bottom part was now pink. And it didn't stop there, as the color began spreading the sides of his shoes. Speaking of them, they seemed to get a tad sturdier as they also got a bit longer, now covering his ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got himself a good distance from the park, Yuma sighed to himself as he stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, that sure was embarrassing... As annoying as the whole situation is, I really need to keep my cool.\", said Yuma to himself. \"I am sure Astral would say that I need to think rationally about this and all..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was thinking, his skin got a shade or two paler as his calves began altering. The muscles remained as strong as they were, but they got more shapely and slender in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... But honestly though... How am I supposed to find why the wish made the Key to disappear if that and making me understand Anna better are completely unrelated?\", he asked himself, the more abrasive side from before reemerging, as he put his hands on his hips, not noticing how they were starting to shrink and slim down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngh... There is no point in trying to understand the wish right now. I just need to find Astral and the Key and then wonder about the whole wish thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuma knew that if he asked somebody for help and told them about the circumstances, they would just laugh at him as nobody would believe in cards that grant wishes. He had to ask his friends for their help...  But he could also ask the workers of the amusement park about it, asking if they somehow found the key. It wasn't that great of an idea, and calling Tori seemed like a better idea... But a part of him seemed to think differently...</span></div></div>",

He wanted to show that he could do things on his own... And on top of that, the idea of calling Tori seemed to be denied a bit, even if he didn't understood why exactly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess I'll go and ask someone then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started walking around, hoping to find a security guard or a worker to tell them about the missing pendant. He could just lie and say he simply lost it somewhere in the park. He would then wait to see if someone finds it. If not, then he would call his friends for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yuma was walking around, more changes took place. His side bangs continued to get closer to each other as the upwards spikes were starting to straighten. As for his front spike, it also began to flatten backwards as the red on it became a bit lighter in color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of not finding anyone, Yuma thought of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah! I can also ask an employee at a store for that as well... Duh, how come I didn't think of that sooner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then entered a clothes store that was near him. At the counter there was a young woman in her mid-twenties with brown hair. She seemed kind enough to be asked about the pendant. Yuma however had to wait a little bit as she was currently busy with another customer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was waiting, his thighs began to slowly get thicker. Some of the mass from his calves migrated upwards to them as they were gradually expanding. This put some pressure on his pants, but they also began to succumb to the changes. Firstly, they got a lot tighter on him and they also began to shrink, now leaving his ankles and reaching the middle of his calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the customer left, Yuma got up to the counter, where the woman welcomed him with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning sir! You can I be of use to you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuma smiled a bit at the woman's kindness before he asked a bit sheepishly:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning. Um, I am here to ask if you found a pendant around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pendant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I kind of lost it... I went through here earlier and I was wondering if you found it by chance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was hoping the woman would buy his lie. It sounded a bit forced, but he was betting on the fact that the store was quite full all day long, and thus he didn't get noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my. No, no one came to say anything about a missing pendant. What does it look like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yuma was telling her about how the pendant looked like, she was taking notes on it in case someone else found it to know how to recognize it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Thank you for the details. Oh, I almost forgot. I also need your name for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Yama Tsakomo...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Mr Tsakomo. Once I find anything, I'll call you. In the meantime, you can look around the store.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks...\", said Yama, as he left to look around, a bit confused at the name he called himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman then looked on her computer to check the security camera to see if Yama had the Emperor's Key with him, this being something he had not accounted for. This would be a great issue to him, as it would completely blow his lie off. However...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he was here... I didn't recognize him at first, but he seems to have come here before. He doesn't seem to be wearing the pendant though.. I think I should check up with Midori before I ask Tohru-san about it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYama was indeed on the camera feed. He actually didn't even go in there today, but reality was warping around him. He was still unaware of the whole camera thing, but soon it wouldn't matter at all for him.</span></div></div>",

I hope the lady figured out that I said my name wrong, but what about my family name? I think I should clarify it later. But why did I spell my name wrong? Was it a slip of the tongue? Or I got flustered with all that happened and I screwed up?... Whatever, what's done is done. Maybe looking around a little might help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYama looked at the various clothes that were on display as he tried to forget a bit about the whole trouble. The entire floor seemed to be dedicated to men's wear, but there were some unisex clothes as well. There were some really nice jeans, hoodies and T-shits that he liked, all of them looking really nice in his imagination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, some of these look really cool. Maybe when I get my allowance I may buy a few. The red ones look awesome. I wonder what else is there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was looking around, his pants continued to grow smaller, now resting just below his knees. But there was something else that happened. The orange crescent marks that were at the bottom gradually faded out until they were completely gone. Also, the material seemed to darken a little bit, the immaculate white now being a faint gray as they seemed to get a bit more stretchy as well. In response to this, his shoes got higher on his legs as they covered his now bare calves, the pink line in the back extending as an orange dot formed on top of his feet. His socks didn't change much, as they stayed white, but seemed to also get more elastic in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile looking around, a thought occurred to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder though... Should I try and change my style a bit? I mean, red is cool and all, but maybe something else might work... I don't know, maybe white? Kite seems to be rocking it quite well... I don't know, maybe once I see anything interesting I might consider it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then began to look around for clothes that weren't as predominantly red as the ones from before. White, black and light-blue seemed to appease to him somewhat, but he still could feel like there might be some other color that would go better, thus he continued looking around. As he did, his hands finished becoming quite delicate and petite, but in reality they got a lot more grip strength than before. His nails grew a bit as well along with his fingers, but they didn't got any treatment, leaving his hands with a small sign of a rough look. The changes went up to his arms as they began following the same example as his hands: looking more slimmer, but getting a bit stronger in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe soon got to the unisex area. Yama initially wanted to leave, but then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm... Some of these shirts look pretty cool... And I am digging the yellow and- Hold on!\", said Yama to himself as he tried to get a grip. \"I am not into these sort of clothes, and what was I saying about yellow? Actually, they might look better on Tori... Maybe I should look to see if there is something for her here as well... But there isn't as much as...\" He stopped himself upon noticing a set of stairs that goes upwards. \"This place has two floors? I wonder what is upstairs...\", he wondered as went up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once Yama reached the second floor, he saw that it was a mirror image of the previous floor, except that this one had women's clothes instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so the girl clothes are here huh? Well, there isn't much for me here... but I guess I should look a bit for Tori. Who knows, maybe she'll like what I found. She may even come here to see what else is in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYama didn't have his wallet at him at the moment, but figured that in case he finds something interesting, he should make a mental note. He had a few options for himself downstairs. He still waited to find something that would intrigue him, but currently he decided to check out the girls' section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pretty diverse selection from dresses and skirts to various sport wear. Yama had a little trouble deciding what exactly he should look for, since Tori would swap outfits from time to time and each had various accessories and such. But he remembered that she would more often than not, wear pink. With that in mind, he started looking through the clothes, trying to find something that would look more interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked around, the red bang that was once his front spike completely fell back, not touching the rest of his hair. The red that got a bit lighter then started to leak onto the rest of his hair as the color spread. But interestingly enough, the process seemed to avoid the lower parts of his hair. His face also got more rounder as he continued looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was something else that was changing. While he was initially still concerned about the whole situation with the Emperor's Key and Astral, Yama didn't seem to be as alarmed as before. While he still knew he had to get back his pendant, a part of him wanted to get a bit more laid back and enjoy visiting the shop. Also, certain aspects such as Zexal, Astral's mission and the various names of the Number Cards seemed to get cloudier in his head, as he was slowly forgetting about them. But at the moment, he wasn't paying attention to these thoughts, as he found something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well this looks nice.\", said Yama with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spotted a dark-pink blouse with a slightly frilly collar and some butterfly designs. It was quite honestly something that would appeal to any girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The color, the design... it's all so cute!... I mean nice!\", corrected Yama. \"Geez, if I say something like that out loud people will surely get the wrong idea... But seriously, it looks so nice! How can anyone say it isn't?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was admiring the blouse, his sleeveless T-shirt was also starting to change. The margins of the green \"D\" were fading, merging together with the purple as the overall color was darkening, some spots turning black as it began to slowly rise, currently just below his bellybutton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, while looking at the blouse, a thought came to his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But it would be a shame to just give this to Tori... I mean, she can buy it herself if she wants it, she doesn't need me to tell her to. Besides, she already has all those outfits while I barely change mine. And on top of that, she also tries to impress others with that... If she wants to get it, then let her come here and find it.\", said Yama with a huff, not noticing his voice was higher by an octave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I should look for myself a bit more then. Downstairs wasn't anything special though... I guess I should check the unisex area too. Who knows, maybe I can find something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put the blouse the back on the hanger as he left to the unisex section. He looked back at it for a second, thinking that it still was cute and pretty, but he then walked away, not because he thought it was silly to think that, but just because he wanted to check what else was in the store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But he remembered she telling him once that he didn't have that great of a fashion sense. A bit upset with that, he looked at a full-body mirror on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's so untrue. I mean, just because I like to dress myself with one particular outfit, it doesn't mean it's not fashionable. I mean, I look at myself in the mirror and I see nothing wrong with what I am wearing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile looking at himself, he didn't notice that his pants continued shrinking, now passing his knees as their color continued darkening, not being more of a dark-gray. The material also got more elastic as his pockets were starting to fade away. As for his shoes, they continued growing longer, now resembling boots, as the pink line from the back going back to the top section. The trailing pink line seemed then to converge in the top portion, the rest disappearing, as long with the one that crossed his ankles seemed to expand a bit the more the color accumulated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, she always changes her outfits. It makes it hard to decide which style she likes most. I say having a main one with a few secondary ones is the best option.\", nodded Yama to himself. \"If she comes here and likes the blouse, then good for her. But I am not going to fill up her closet just because I want to be nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased with his thought, Yama looked at the unisex section. There were some nice shirts and jeans that drew Yama's attention, especially the black and blue ones. His likeness to red still remained, but it was now mostly buried by his other favored colors. He then noticed something that intrigued him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now this looks good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe picked up a black training jacket with pale-green accents. The design was mostly simplistic, but it seemed quite attractive to Yama.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, efficient, and screams \"sporty\". I like it! It is perfectly for my morning jogs too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYama was indeed an active person, but he usually wouldn't do many physical activities outside the ones at school if there wasn't a reason. But he seemed to want to keep himself more fit at the moment. He was quite well-build anyways, but he also didn't seem to want himself to gain weight. This was something that never bothered him before and seemed weird at first, but his mind calmed him down as he thought there was no disadvantage in a bit more training, as jogging, swimming and rock-climbing seemed more appealing to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was admiring the jacket, his thighs, which slowly grew all this time reached their final size, as they became quite large and looked a tad strange on him, but looked quite nice in his changing pants. The changes didn't stop there as his hips also started to get wider as his waist began to do the opposite, becoming a bit smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This would look great with my new sport attire. I just need a new pair of sneakers and I'm set... I wonder how much he'll like it...Huh?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could have the chance to figure out where the last thought came from, a voice came from the speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr Yamna Tsakoom is asked to come to the front desk, please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamna recognized the voice as the woman at the counter, but was confused by the way she called him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she say my name wrong? Wait... That's the name I told her at the start, wasn't it?... Well, I'll tell her about that once I get down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe put the jacket back on the rack as he went downstairs. He took one last glance at the jacket... and then at the blouse before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That blouse was as cute as the jacket was cool... I guess I know what to spend my money on next time I get here. Just gotta pray no one buys them...\"</span></div></div>",

He seemed to be part of the park's security.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Yamna-san you've come back. This is Batsu-san, a member of the security.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning. I am Batsu Takigawa. Are you Yamna Tsukoom-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's me. Nice to meet you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamna was confused as to why he didn't correct himself over the name issue, but Batsu interrupted his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've received a report that you lost something around this place. Is it true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamna nodded and wanted to clarify what it was, but he was having some difficulty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why is my mind so muddled? I lost... my pendant wasn't it? Yeah, I think it was. Did it had a name too? Um... I can't remember... Why is it so difficult? Did I let my mind wander too much that I forgot?!... Calm down Yamna... You don't want to cause a scene in front of these people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was thinking, his vest lost the buckles it had to close it. Instead, a light green zipper formed to take their place. Also, the white in his hood was starting to leak into the vest, gradually replacing the red. But despite all these changes, neither Yanma nor the others noticed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes... I lost it around here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you come with me to the \"Lost and Found\" office? Sayaka-san already gave me a description of the object that you lost. We might have found it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Really?\", asked Yamna. He didn't expect someone to actually find it so quickly. \"Of course I'll come! Thank you very much\", he exclaimed not noticing his voice went higher by an octave again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem. It is just our duty.\", smiled Batsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sorry we interrupted you. Did you find anything you like?\", asked Sayaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I did. I was wondering if you have more of the same thing in case someone comes to buy it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure we have. We have a few copies of each item in stock. You can come later if you want to buy something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? Thank you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying goodbye to Sayaka, Yamna and Batsu left the shop. She then took a glance at the note with Yamna's description of the object she lost and murmured to herself: \"How in the world he did he lose something like that? Well, I am sure Tohru-san and Batsu-san found it. It would be impossible to find that.\", before she went back to her work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way, Yamna experienced a breeze of cold air, which made him to shiver a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brr... Was it this cold when I came here? It sure feels like that... But it wasn't like this... Whatever, it's not that bad. I can take a small gust any day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cold was actually coming from his silky smooth skin, his body hair falling off, leaving him hairless everywhere except for his head as his skin got another shade paler. Speaking of his hair, the top part was now mostly ruby-red, together with the upper part of his side hair, his former spikes fusing together to form two side-points. But that wasn't all. His red side hair that once supported the front spike was gradually turning orange as the color began spreading to the lower half of his hair. Finally, his mane also started to grow, his hair getting a bit longer overall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't I remember what I lost?\", asked Yamna to himself. \"I am sure it was a pendant... wasn't it? I mean, it has a lot of sentimental value after all... Grr... This is so frustrating! If I wasn't with Batsu-san, I would be banging my head to a wall, trying to remember... No, bad Yamna. I need to calm down. They already found the thing already. Most likely, after they bring it to me, I am sure I'll recognize it... But wasn't there something else I forgot? Was it about my name..? Did Sayaka-san say my name wrong on the intercom?... I don't recall...\"</span></div></div>",

But it wasn't really that important. Is there something you wish to ask me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, there is. Regarding the item you lost, how exactly did you misplace it? It is quite hard to believe something like what Sayaka-san would be lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYamna didn't predict to be asked so directly about how he lost his pendant, as he took a second to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is bad. I need to make a good story... But what did he mean by that? Is a pendant that hard to lose...? Wait... was it a pendant? I am pretty sure I lost it and Astral-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis thoughts were interrupted as a small wave of vertigo took over him. It wasn't enough to make him lose his balance, but Batsu still grabbed his shoulder in case he would fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis memories were starting to change more than before. His childhood seemed to be gradually changing as images of fighting bullies were replacing the ones of him training with his father. What memory he had about the Emperor's Key was reduced to basic knowledge of the design as all of its abilities as well as other important knowledge about the Astral and Barian Worlds also disappeared. The name \"Astral\" still ringed a bell for him, but it didn't seem to be as personal as before. As for his catchphrase, other than the fact it sounded cool, it really didn't have that much of relevance for him anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this time, his boots finally finished their changes as the pink on top became an extension of the footwear that covered his legs, in a slightly softer material, up until his knees as a orange diamond formed just below it. The lower part became a bit bulkier as it became some sort of ankle protector. His arms also finished changing, becoming smooth and slender, but still brimming with power as his shoulders became rounder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay Yamna-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... Sorry, I got dizzy there for a second.\", said the boy as he was recovering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need to see a nurse? The medical office isn't too far away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I am all right, thanks... As for how I lost it... I went into a store and spend a bit too much time in there I guess. When I got out, it was missing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... It is possible that a worker might have found it and thought it was unusual and took it to see what it was sine there was no one next to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most likely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. We already brought it from the main office. You just need to pick it up using your identification tag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will. And thanks again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two continued walking towards the \"Lost and Found\" office, with Yamna wondering where the dizziness from before came. He decided to put it behind at the moment, agreeing on resting a bit after the whole situation is over. If he would look at his tag, he would've seen his changed name, including his altered appearance in the picture. He wanted to check it out as well at first, but right now, any doubts about his name was gone, agreeing that \"Yamna\" was indeed his name and that he may have heard Sayaka wrong on the intercom. But there was something that caught his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Was my right arm always this bare? Was I wearing something on it?... Nah, it must be my imagination.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn reality, his gem bracelet that he would always wear vanished during the time he was lightheaded. But he didn't remember wearing it anymore. Instead, it seemed to him that he saw it on someone else...</span></div></div>",

If he would've paid attention, he would've seen he entered the women's bathroom. But the lack of urinals didn't faze him, as he entered a stall. Once inside, he was ready to do his business, but a gut feeling that he should stay down formed in his head. He was confused at first, but obliged it nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was sitting down, a cushy feeling was developing, giving him the impression he was sitting on a pillow, which was impossible, so he ignored it. His butt was gradually expanding, in a proportionate amount of fat and muscle, as his hips spread wider. Both of them still had a little more to grow, but they definitely didn't look like they should belong to a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he was preoccupied with something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so mishearing my name and forgetting why I am here for aside... What was that thing of \"dressing nice so that he might like it\"? Who am I trying to impress? My father? Well, I want him to see me more like an adult. The blouse and jacket seemed more mature, but still... I don't think this is about him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his memories changed, so did his family. A new father, and a new mother, who never went away in a trip that they haven't return yet from were appearing in his mind. Truthfully, they also looked quite different than the ones he originally considered as his parents, but that didn't faze him in the slightest, as pleasant memories of them spending time together filled his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it isn't about him, then who? A friend of mine?... Why should I care about their opinion about this? I mean, Bronk, Caswell and Flip are nice guys, but I wouldn't dress nicely for them. And Shark is way too indifferent to care about this... Well, I will surely make Cathy and Tori jealous, that's for sure.\", grinned Yamna to himself. \"Then who-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden growl of his stomach broke his train of thought as he put his hands on it. This was because his waist continued to compress, but for him it was a sign of hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I should grab some grub after all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he finished, he pulled up his underwear just as it began to change. His red boxers began to tighten as it started to blacken, shrink and get more elastic, but also softer as well. This constricted his groin a little together with his pants, but it felt much better against his larger hips and rear. His top also seemed to do the same as the boxers as it rose higher on his torso, getting more black by the second as the material changed again, becoming similar to his underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he didn't notice anything, as he left the stall, more concerned with his thoughts.</span></div></div>",

When he looked at his image, he wasn't shocked at his altered appearance, but rather confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Is it just me or I look different in a way? Is it my hair?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange was now covering most of the lower part of his hair as a red bang fell from the front a little as the mane continued growing. On the side of his face, two small bangs were starting to form, beginning to frame his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, it's not that. But I can't help but feel that something is different...\", he mumbled to himself as he washed his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small itch on his face prompted him to wash it as well. As he rubbed it, his cheekbones became higher as his nose, chin and ears got smaller. His eyelashes also got longer while his eyes got bigger. After rubbing it off with a paper towel, he took a glance at his new face. He wasn't confused about that, but about something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong with my eyes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, his originally red eyes were now closer towards an amber color. The rest of the face however seemed normal to him however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they more orange than usual...? No, it must be my imagination. But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he took another glance at the mirror and looked down, he found out that his vest was open, revealing his tank top. Seeing this, he blushed massively as he quickly moved his hands to the zipper, fumbling a bit with it due to how flustered he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gah! W-Why didn't anybody tell me about this?! Was this the reason why I was feeling cold? Did Batsu-san notice? No, he didn't say anything, so he didn't... Thank Goodness... How absentminded must I be to not notice?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile trying to zip up the vest, his hood was reforming around his neck, becoming the collar of the vest, with the same light-green edge from the zipper forming on it. The material of the vest became a bit softer overall as it became completely white. As for the top, it was now almost black, as it resided just below his torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pants finished their changes as they reached the middle of his thighs and got tighter on him and darker once more, becoming a pair of black compression shorts. It hugged his lower body quite nicely, showing a little of his curves as his groin was feeling a little restricted, but nonetheless he found nothing wrong with said feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter zipping the jacket up, he breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah... I am so glad it went by unnoticed... I hope it did... No one turned around to look or even comment on it. Huh. I may be a scatterbrain, but some people need to pay much better attention to their surrounding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he turned away, he noticed two round hairpins with a light-blue gem in the middle and silver edge. He put them on his longer bangs, not finding it odd in the slightest as he moved his hand through his hair, lifting the lower portion a bit upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Now I don't look plain anymore. Hehehe, not that it could ever be possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a small giggle from the last comment, he left the bathroom. Just then, a pink diamond formed on the back of his vest.</span></div></div>",

I'll go help out Tohru-san at the counter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBatsu left, as Yamna got in line. Despite the outbursts from before, Yamna was quite calm this time, not trying to rush things up by skipping the line. He was going to get his property back after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was waiting, he rubbed his neck with his gloved hand. He felt a little discomfort in his throat ever since he left the shop, but it wasn't too unpleasant. However he noticed his voice sounding a bit off the more the feeling persisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should've drank some water. Do I have something in my throat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe more he rubbed his neck, the more his Adam's Apple was shrinking. By the time he found a bulge in the front, it was the size of a pea. He gently pushed it back and swallowed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. Much better.\", he said quietly in a familiar, high-pitched voice. \"Now with that out of the way, now I can just wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minutes were passing a bit slow, but Yamna decided to let his mind wander a bit as he began thinking about Duels. As he did, more changes happened. His glove was splitting into two parts and changing color in the process. One part got tighter onto his hand, changing material from leather to something more elastic as it became pure black while the other seemed to cover the previous one, from just over the wrist to below his knuckles. As for the pink diamond on his back, it became quite large, covering a good part of his vest...but by this point, the material seemed to resemble a sturdier shirt. From below the diamond and around the shoulders, pink splotches similar to the diamond formed as they began extending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn his mind, Yamna was recalling some strategies he used in some of his previous Duels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe... That was a good final turn. If I knew he didn't had protection against Effect Damage, I would've tried to end the Duel with Gustaph much sooner...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis Duel strategies were changing. His more composed style he learned from Astral, was replaced with one more reckless, but also more efficient in his opinion. And even the cards he used were different, with his ace Monster being \"Gustaph Max\" instead of \"Utopia\". He also seemed to get more fond of trains as this seemed to be the Deck he owned in his mind. By now, all of his knowledge about Zexal, the Numbers and even Astral were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only I had a cool Number card... That would be so awesome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he came down to reality, he was surprised to see that 20 minutes passed already and that he was already at the counter. At the desk was a man, a bit older than Batsu with a serious expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your name please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's Amna Tsaboom.\", said Amna, too flustered by the man's stern behavior to see he called himself differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I see your ID tag please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he got the tag and checked it in the database, a small chuckle escaped his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see... So you've come to pick it up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please wait until I bring it back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man left, letting Amna wait a bit. This helped him try to gather his thoughts again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My did he smirk? What exactly did I lose? Was it... a pendant? No, it can't be that, I don't wear anything like that... Then what it is... Try to remember... I came here this morning, wanting to check the shops. I stopped at a ice-cream stand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was thinking, his shirt seemed to get longer as the material started to extend below his belt. Speaking of which, the silver buckle suddenly changed shape, becoming an oval as the color became orange. In the middle, a large blue button formed, which replaced the original one he had on the side. As for the belt itself, it became wider and a bit thicker turning from black to dark-pink. The belt also got a bit tighter on him, finishing making his waist smaller, giving him a nice hourglass figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Then I played that shooting game at the arcade... Heh, my aim sure is getting better... Then I flew over to that photo booth and- Wait, flew?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisrupting his thoughts, the man returned with the object he lost. Just then, the pink began to expand forming thick lines that started to circle around its arm holes and stretch upwards and to his sides from  around his shoulders and from his back respectively.</span></div></div>",

Amna was confused about it at first, but within 5 seconds, he immediately recognized it. But instead of asking about his pendant, he now knew in his mind that the cannon was his missing object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Thank you so much! Where did you find it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was near a photo booth. The workers believed at first it was some kind of prop, but soon they realized it was more than that. They brought it here afterwords. While this thing is quite dangerous and we normally we would hold onto any kinds of weapons, it has a safety mechanism that prevents people to use it as they please. This makes this thing much more harmless, unless you are its owner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made that thing myself. Well, with a little bit of help, I am no mechanic. But yes, I went into that booth and then I quickly went into another shop, forgetting about it near the booth. I stood there quite a while, so I am not surprised about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two were talking, the pink lines from his shirt completely circled around his shoulders as the lines that came from his back were continuing going to the front, more specifically to his chest area. As for the section that spouted from the bottom of his shirt, it didn't give as much restriction as the shirt as it gently flew in a slight breeze that came from the window as pink stripes were forming on it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please be more careful Mr Tsaboom. Even if it isn't remotely dangerous, there is a chance children might hurt themselves with this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, and I am sorry Mr...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yamada. Tohru Yamada to be more precise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Mr Yamada. I promise I will not lose it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With pleasure.\", answered Tohru with a faint smile as he handed the boy his cannon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thanked once again before leaving with his contraption at his back as Tohru looked at him, with Batsu getting near as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kids these days sure get a lot of weird toys, huh Tohru-san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. But it wasn't a mere toy. In fact, it could be really dangerous in the hands of other people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't that bad. Sure, kids might blow up stuff with that thing, but it has that safety on it, so it would be impossible for anyone to use it unless you own it.  Besides, if he got it, that means he is responsible with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so. Still, to be called that a cannon was found is not something I here every day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\", laughed Batsu a bit as Tohru gave a small smile in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Amna got behind the building to check his cannon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I really need to pay attention. I only noticed it was gone only after I got out of that shop. I am so happy I asked Sayaka-san about it the moment I realized... But how could I forget what I lost? What did I think was missing? A pendant? That's stuff Tori would have. She even has one in the shape of a heart too... Whatever, they are way too girly for me. Besides, I have my own charms. I don't need any jewelry to make myself look good.\", said Amna proudly to himself. \"Still, I wonder why my head was so cloudy today... Meh, I am sure it's nothing. I mean, everything is clear now.\", he continued with a carefree smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he checked the cannon, the orange bangs that were once just around his eyes now lowered down to his chin as a tuft of ted hair covered now his forehead. His hair was now a complete balance between red and orange, giving him a very familiar hair-style. Also, when he had to rub his eyes again, they completely changed color, being now a very distinct yellow color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the hydraulic system seems to be fine... and so does the firing mechanism,... I am amazed they didn't say anything about the motor it has. They might just thought it was just a cannon, but it surely is a lot more than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pressing a hidden button on the handle, the cannon opened up, with two propeller wings now being on its sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure these guys never thought it was also an aircraft.\", giggled Amna softly.</span></div></div>",

Besides, it is much faster than walking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe revved up the engine, making the propeller speed up and hot air came from the back of the contraption. After he strapped his legs on, he then moved the handle upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aaaannddd take off- Whooa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe panicked a bit as the cannon lifted itself off the ground, but caught a gust of air, making him trying to reassert control as he began leaning on one side and then backwards. As he was doing this, his back was strained a bit by the constant movement. In this time, his spine curved, making a perfect arch.  This made him have a slightly better control of the aircraft as he could bend much easier. After a couple more seconds, he managed to have the cannon under control as he reached the same level as the building's roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Much better now.\", he smiled to himself as he flew away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter fixing the speed, he then strolled through the air. He occasionally looked down at the people and the park, noting if there was something that would catch his attention while he focused on piloting. After a few minutes, he began thinking about what happened during the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never thought I would see the day I misplace my cannon. I don't know what possessed me today. Whatever it was, it sure had something to do with the brain freeze I had. Seriously, I forgot what I lost... I hope I am not getting dumber. That would be awful... I am sure it was just a fluke. There is no way it was anything else...\", he muttered, trying to put behind the whole incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, the pink stripes reached his chest area and stopped right to the sides of his zipper as the pink lines from below became indentations on his shirt, the lines expanding as they became another layer of material underneath the upper layer, becoming partially visible The shirt was split in front and in the back of his legs, partially showing the pink fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should better keep quiet about all this. I don't want Yuma to think I am that clueless and forgetful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this moment, Amna no longer thought of himself as \"Yuma\", but as a different person all together. The strange thoughts about him trying to impress someone were getting clearer as the figure became Yuma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only he would notice me more... I thought after the Duel with Brooke we might get closer, but he is as occupied as ever the whole Number business... I understand that it is tied with saving the world and such, but still... He should have some free time for me as well... I envy Tori. Not only does she gets a better grip of the whole Astral World or whatever, but she is also his childhood friend... I don't see what she has that I don't. A nice figure? Yeah, right. No one beats mine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amna huffed with pride, his hips and butt grew one more time, completing his womanly figure. They were bigger than the average for a 14 year old, looking much bigger than the ones Tori had, especially his gorgeous heart-shaped behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I guess though she is more calmer than I am. And she doesn't get mad with him easily since they were friends since they were little kids.\", said Amna a bit dejected. \"Meanwhile I confused him with my school crush and nearly knocked his lights off. And then I barely showed up in his life until that last big Duel. I tried to hang up with him, but he is clearly uncomfortable... What I must do so that could be more likable?\"</span></div></div>",

I really need to scratch it... But I don't want to lose control and hit my head onto something again... I need to wait a bit until I find a nice place to land. I don't want to cause a commotion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmna tried to contain his desire to rub his chest as he was looking for a landing spot. The sensation was given by his nipples which pinkened and grew larger. They also became more sensitive as they poked a bit through his shirt, making it harder to keep focus. But the discomfort was slowly going away as his top finished shrinking stopping shrinking just below his pectoral area as it became pure black. His neckline plunged quite a bit as it lowered itself in the back as well, the material becoming quite elastic, without causing his nipples much discomfort as it seemed to contain the itchy feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the ID tag with his picture, his name family changed once again becoming \"Taboom\". The reason only his surname didn't change was because the wish was nearly done, as it was really little to change at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmna soon spotted a cafe, which at the time seemed to not have any customers at the time. Thanking his luck, he landed right next to the tables, making sure he wasn't seen by people. Once he landed, he deactivated the cannon's flight mode and then started to rub his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm.... This feels better. I was a bit concerned that it was an allergy or something, but it seems to be going away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fading sensation was partly because his top, underneath his shirt became a black sports bra, protecting his chest from any potential contact with his shirt. The other was because his chest began to grow out, fat accumulating behind his nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he stopped rubbing, a waitress in a black and white uniform noticed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning! Welcome to our cafe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh... Good morning... And thank you.\", said Amna a bit awkwardly, not expecting someone to notice him so quickly. \"I-I thought you were closed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We aren't, it's just that people usually come here during lunch, so we just opened. Please take a seat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmna took a seat at a two person table as the waitress asked him for the tag. Once she registered it, she gave it back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Mr Taboom, do you wish to eat something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No, I am not hungry yet. Um, do you have something healthy to drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have included several smoothies in our menu. They are all really nutritious and healthy. But I recommend the kale, apples, cucumbers and grape one. It is one of my favorite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds good. Then I shall settle for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, it will be ready in a few minutes.\", said the lady as she left for his order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hope I have enough money. I didn't predict going to a cafe. But it is still better than to have people ask me what I am doing here... It's a miracle she said nothing about the cannon. She may have thought it was a toy, given how calm she seemed about it. I guess that's for the best.\", thought Amna, as he put the tag on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder where Yuma is right now... He said he would go to the park too. I wish I would just meet him here, as unlikely as it sounds... And maybe take him on a ride with the cannon... in the sunset... No no! Be realistic! That is not my style!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep down however, he was still thinking about it. As he was imagining a romantic date flying through the sky, even if he didn't want to, his lumps on his chest began to grow larger, currently being at large A-cups and continuing to expand, as the bra was growing together with his chest. Down below, his boxers, which have been changing slowly ever since he left the bathroom completely lost their legs as they became a similar material as the bra, becoming a pair of black panties with a small red line of the top. This brought more discomfort for his groin, but it didn't feel as tight as it slowly began receding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the tag on the table, his current name, \"Amna Taboom\" was going through its final changes. The top portion of the \"T\" was breaking into two segments as they started to migrate to the side, while the \"m\" was starting to have his last leg removed.</span></div></div>",

But it's very unlikely. I mean, not only he doesn't notice my feelings due to how dense he is, but I must compete with Tori and Cathy for him too.

I mean, I know I am better than Cathy, and definitely Tori, but how can I stand a chance if he became so good so fast?... I wish I had a Number. I know it's risky and all, but that would at least make me be close on even on par with Yuma... The perfect Number for me would be like \"Gustaph Max\" but more futuristic and with a larger cannon... Hehehe... It would surely look amazing...\", giggled Amna a bit before an image came t his head. \"Me and Yuma Tag Dueling, both our Numbers on the field... That would be amazing... I don't know about romantic, but-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a dull pain manifested in his groin. He quickly moved his hands to see what happened, but was confused when the pain began to diminish as quickly as it came. His testes were pushed inside him, changing function as they became ovaries as they were linked to a newly formed cavity in his abdomen. The surge of estrogen made his breasts grow a bit faster, now being C-cups as they were almost done with their growth. Before he could question what was the cause of the pain, he started to feel a bit dizzy, as his mind got a bit muddled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ngh... Not this again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis identity was almost done changing, as he now was getting confused as to what gender he was at the moment. On the tag, his family name was now \"Kaboom\" as the \"m\" in his surname had its last leg partially missing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the waitress came back with his drink. Not wanting to worry her, he acted like nothing was wrong, despite feeling a bit woozy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is your drink Mr Kaboom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thanks...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you need something else, please call me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman bowed before she left, leaving Amna with his drink. The dizziness seemed to be slowly going away, which was a relief for him, but he got a bit concerned nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where is this coming from? Is it because I didn't sleep enough?... Argh! My head is still foggy. I should ask Mom what she thinks the cause is when I get back home.\", grumbled Amna under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another minute trying to clear his head, he looked at the smoothie he ordered. He was a bit turned off by how green it looked, but since the lady described it as being one of the healthiest in the menu, he compromised and took a sip. He was quickly amazed by how refreshing the drink was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this much better than I thought it would taste! It's fresh, and tasty and it's good for you... Maybe I should come here more often... Only if it isn't that expensive...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was drinking, underneath his boyhood, which lost more than half of its original size, an opening was starting to form, as his thoughts about his identity were getting clearer the more he drank.</span></div></div>",

I am not really in eating too much kale, but the cucumbers and the apples sure makes it taste a lot better. Perhaps I will come here another time. And maybe I will also invite Yuma as well then...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed his eyes once he finished his thought, as his mind started to wander off again. His boyhood was now so small it became invisible through the tight pants. It was almost time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah... It seems I can't help it. I don't know since when I started to feel like this. It surely began after my first Duel with him, but it was merely a small feeling back then. I was too preoccupied with other things at the time. I was shocked that my childhood crush was someone else entirely, and that I confused him with someone else just because of the name... I don't know what was dumber... The fact that I got the name wrong or that I didn't even notice he was completely different than the boy I remembered... Then I tried to just wipe things away. But after I helped him against that gang at the tournament, I realized that I may have fallen for him. It became obvious after the Duel with Brooke as well... I know I have been away from him for quite a long while, but still... I-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother wave of drowsiness took him over, clouding his thoughts one last time as the changes reached the end. Between his legs, a young womanhood blossomed as on the tag, the last leg of the \"m\" completely vanished. Her new name and identity, Anna Kaboom, filled her head as her head got clearer, the new persona integrating in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again...? Jeez, I hope I am not getting sick. It's been happening so random though... I should ask Mom to go to a doctor if this happens again.\", murmured Anna, unaware that this was the last time he would feel like this, as the wish ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now where was I? Oh yeah. I will from now on try to be more active in this whole saving the world thing. I don't want to just be on the side, rooting for Yuma. This is to get stronger and also closer to Yuma... I know I have a lot to catch up with, but I hope he might be able to see that I am capable to fight by his side... Hehe, that would surely score some points for me. Tori might be his childhood friend, but I am the best of the gang at Dueling by a mile!\", said Anna to herself with a proud smile, before making a meek expression, as her cheeks flushed slightly. \"... I know I fell for you Yuma... I wonder if Tori feels the same as I do, but if she does, then I guess why she gets so clingy whenever I'm around... Well, I am not going to give up so easily... I need to take things slowly... then I could imagine ourselves piloting my cannon into the sunset.\"</span></div></div>",

She believed another customer came, as the lady said that they just opened, so they should receive more people. Indeed there were quite a few who began sitting at the tables as some servers began taking their orders. Anna was ready to finish her drink, when she noticed someone. Yuma was slowly walking over, with a slightly troubled expression on his face, looking for an open table. Upon noticing him, Anna stood up and waved to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Yuma! Over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Anna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit surprised by seeing her, Yuma walked in her direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this seat free?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it is. What were you doing here?\", asked Anna as he took a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was supposed to meet with Tori today and walk around the park, but she caught a cold and her mom messaged me about it. I already came here fully prepared for a day of fun, but it will surely be boring on my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanking her luck, Anna smiled and then offered: \"Then how about we spend the day together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and me?... Are you sure? I mean, you must have already something planned.\", said Yuma a bit concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really. I just came to check some shops, but if you want to have fun together, it will be perfectly fine with me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuma didn't know what he should do. He considered asking Astral, who was floating next to him, also assessing the situation, but he probably didn't had any helpful advice to give him in this situation. He really didn't want to deal with Anna's shenanigans today. But he wanted to do something about their Duel for the next day, so a little time together might be necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I will. But under one condition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't freak out when I show you this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of his pocket, he handed her a card. When looking at it, her eyes opened wide when she read its name: \"Number 81: Superdreadnought Rail Cannon Super Dora\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh?! You're giving me a Number?!\", asked Anna as she suddenly stood up, her small D-cups bouncing a bit at the movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shh! Be quiet! People will start watching!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh, sorry...\", she said meekly as she sat back down. \"But really, are you giving me a Number?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... in a way yes. Me and Astral fought this guy who had this card. It seemed super random to have it, but then I thought, that maybe you should try using it. I mean, you already have a full Deck with cards like these, and maybe you should try it as it would be constructive for your strategy development. I planned to use this for tomorrow's Duel and... Are you listening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna was in shock, as her cheeks became pink. She was ready to pounce Yuma and hug him for giving her a Number just like that. Especially since he thought of her when he saw the card. She wanted to kiss him as well, but she was snapped from her fantasy when Yuma waved her hands in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Earth to Anna. Are you listening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Huh? O-Oh yes, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got bored at my smart talk didn't you? I told Astral people will not take me seriously when I do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not that. So... can I really have it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, for the moment. Still, it is dangerous as people could get possessed by these cards. Tomorrow is a trial run in case something goes wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Are you sure I'll be fine then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure. I- I mean me and Astral thought about your whole fighting spirit talk from before and decided at would be a good try. I-We are sure you'll do fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna's face brightened as she she gave him a big smile. \"Thanks Yuma. It really means a lot. Tomorrow it will be time that I should feel the flow, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-Sure...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna giggled as she went back to her drink as Yuma was laughing a bit nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After tomorrow, if everything goes fine, and Tori or anyone else doesn't see, I'll steal a small kiss at the right moment...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Anna was happily fantasizing, Astral approached Yuma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you lie that I suggested her using that Card? It is true that I thought about it, but you were quite eager to have her try it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-It's just out of curiosity. I mean, in a way, this seems like a Card made especially for her. I am amazed a random dude had it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with how the card ended in that man's possession... But why aren't you just telling her it was a gesture out of your kindness instead. I am sure she already knows that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Don't be silly. It is merely for the sake of testing the Number, nothing else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah... I can't do anything about yourself not really being honest with yourself, but be it as you say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuma frowned a bit at the specter's words, but in reality, he thought that doing something nice for Anna might make her spill the beans as to why was she following him all the time. That and... well, because he believed it was a nice thing to do. He still cared about her... she just had to calm down a bit with her \"fighting spirit\"...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in a dark room, a magician was sorting through his things, when he noticed something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Is one of my wishing Cards missing? Well, I guess someone will have a great day with their wish. There isn't a big problem for me. It only makes true the pure-hearted ones after all.... Whatever it is, it makes the wish become true in the end...\"</span></div></div>",

On his legs were black thigh high socks of the same color and red high heeled pumps on his feet. Around his neck was a red chocker and a necklace with an emerald crested golden cross medallion, and rolled in the front of his hair was also a silver device.

The four duelists had originally come from different times, and had now swapped lives with people from different time periods then their own. Now instead of transporting them to the different time periods, it did something else. It created a new time period, one that was a combination of the four different ones, and transported them to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the light died down for Yugi and Yuma, and their vision cleared, he found himself in a new location. They were standing near a forest, and looking around, they spotted a pair of buildings, and over the forest they could see a city in the distance. In this new combined time, the Duel Academy of Jaden's time, and the New Domino Duel Academy of Yusei's time were both part of the same facility. In in this new reality of a combine Duel Academy, Akiza was also part of the same class as Jaden, Alexis, and their friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on? How'd I get here?\" Yuma questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi then saw Yuma was with him. \"Hey, you're one of those who was with me after that card teleported me to that weird place and changed my clothes.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Yuma repled. \"So uh, any idea whats going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, no clue.\" Yugi replied. As he looked around the area he had been transported to, he then spotted someone familliar to him. It was Tea! But she was dressed much differently than usual. She was now wearing an open red blazer with a black shirt under it, and jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the light died down for Jaden and Yusei, and their vision cleared, he found himself in a new location. The two were standing in the middle of a sidewalk, and nearby they saw a pair of school buildings. In this new combined reality, the high school that Yugi, Tea, and their friend went to was right next to the middle school that Yuma, Tori, and their friends went to. It was also common for members of either group to walk to school with one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're Jaden, right?\" Yusei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? You know me?\" Jaden questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<i>He doesn't remember when we met? Hm, maybe this is a Jaden from a time before we met.</i>' Yusei thought. \"I've heard of you. Anyway, any ideas of what happened? Why we're dresed like this or what is going on?\" Yusei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two thought about what had happened, they spotted two people a distance away. The two people were familliar to them as well. They were Alexis and Akiza, both of which were dressed differently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexis was wearing a loose white t-shirt and a blue jacket with matching pants , and Akiza was now wearing a white shirt with red-lined sleeves and collar, a red tie and blue pants. Around Alexis's neck was a goden pyramid-looking object, and ahanding from Akiza's was a strange golden object that was triangular overall.</span></div></div>",

With him were his friends from school Joey, Tea, Tristan, Duke, as well as Joey's sister Serenity, and Mai and Rebecca who were also in the area visting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they made their way to their destination, Yugi spotted something on the ground, and saw that it was a Duel Monsters card. But strangely enough, it was blank. Other than its green color that told him it was a spell card, it had no name, text, or picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What an odd card.\" he commented as he examined it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatcha got there, Yugi?\" Joey asked as he saw his friend looking something over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just found this weird card on the ground.\" he said as he showed it to his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Its blank?\" Tea questioned as she saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is it blank?\" Joey wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It probably means its as useless as you.\" another voice said, and the group saw Kaiba walking up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that, Kaiba!?\" Joey demanded. However, he was ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping to get a chance to duel you again.\" he said to Yugi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, maybe another time Kaiba.\" Yugi replied. \"I was going to spend the day with the others. Besides, I'm interested in this card.\" Then suddenly, as if on cue, the card began to glow, and emitted a bright light that engulfed the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a seemingly normal at Duel Academy, and Jaden was making his way to class. Suddenly, he noticed something lying on the ground, and picked it up to see that it was a card. It was green, indicating it was a spell card, but other than that, it was blank. No picture, name, or text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats with this weird card?\" he wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful.\" Yubel said. \"It doesn't feel normal. There is something weird about it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden was examing the card when he heard someone call out to him. \"Hey Jaden.\" Alexis said as she walked up to him, accompanied by the rest of his friends; Syrus, Hassleberry, Chazz, Blair, Jesse, Aster, and Alexis's friends Jasmine and Mindy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing alone?\" Blair asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Whats that card you've got there, Jaden?\" Jesse asked as he walked up next to him to get a better look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I just found it.\" he responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure looks weird.\" Syrus remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And useless. Its completely blank.\" Chazz said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, the card began to glow, and emitted a bright light that engulfed the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a seemingly normal day, and Yusei was currently working on Duel Runners in the garage. Along with his own, Crow's and Jack's were there as usual, as well as Akiza's, and even Sherry had come to him for some help. As he was working on them, Crow, Akiza, and Sherry stood nearby. Jack meanwhile was enjoying a cup of ramen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was working, he heard the sound of the door opening. \"Yusei? Are you here?\" he could Luna ask as the twins entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm here. I'm just working on the Duel Runners.\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins came into the main area, Carly with them. \"Hey Yusei, on our way here, we ran into Carly, and then we found this really weird card.\" Leo said as he held out the card for everyonre else to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its blank?\" Sherry questioned as she examined it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. We just found it lying on the ground and picked it up and figured that We'd show it to you guys.\" Carly explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see whats so interesting about it.\" Jack said. \"If its blank, its not a very useful card.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is weird, though.\" Akiza said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I wonder where it came from.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, the card began to glow, and emitted a bright light that engulfed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a seemingly normal day in Heartland, and Yuma and his friends Tori, Bronk, Caswell, Flip, Cathy, and Anna were had all met up outside Yuma's home, with Astral floating behind Yuma, unseen by all but him. As they gathered outside the house, Yuma noticed something on the ground nearby the door. \"Huh? Whats that?\" he wondered aloud as he walked over to it to pick it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats up, Yuma?\" his older sister Kari asked as she followed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw something.\" he said, reaching it, and picking it up. \"Huh? A card. And its completely blank.\" he said as he looked it over. There was no name, picture or text. The only distinguishing thing about it was the color, green, which told him it was a spell card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a strange card.\" Astral commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, check this out. I just found a weird card outside my house.\" Yuma said as he and Tori walked back over to his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Why do you think its weird?\" Tori asked, with her being the only one of the group not being well knowledged when it came to duel monsters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its blank.\" Bronk explained. \"Thats not exactly normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just found iton the ground over there.\" Yuma said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is pretty weird.\" Caswell said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where'd it come from?\" Flip asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm... Maybe this could be an interesting scoop.\" Kari commented to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they were all wondering about the blank card, a familliar motorcycle was pulling by as Yuma called over to is rider. \"Hey, Shark!\" he said with a wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Shark said as he took off his helmet. As he did, another motorcycle pulled up, the rider of this one being Kaito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Shark, Kairo, check out this weird card I found.\" Yuma said as he held it out for him to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is it blank?\" Kaito questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No clue. But I wonder what it does.\" Yuma wondered aloud as he looked it over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly, the card began to glow, and emitted a bright light that engulfed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bright light died down for each of them, and the four groups from different times all found themselves somewhere else, now in an empty field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey each looked around in confusion, and noticed all the others who had been transported there as well. But before they could say anything, the four cards began to glow again, and they were all once again engulfed by a bright light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen?</span></div></div>",

Thats weird.\" he said as he took it from her. It was green, indicating it was a spell card, but there was no name, picture or text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just found it on the ground and figured that I'd show it to you since you know more about the cards than I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its deffinitely wierd.\" he said as he looked it over. Then suddenly, the card began to glow, and emitted a bright light that engulfed the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a seemingly normal at Duel Academy, and Jaden was making his way to class. Suddenly, he noticed something lying on the ground, and picked it up to see that it was a card. It was green, indicating it was a spell card, but other than that, it was blank. No picture, name, or text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats with this weird card?\" he wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Be careful.</i>\" Yubel said. \"<i>It doesn't feel normal. There is something weird about it...</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden was examing the card when he heard someone call out to him. \"Hey Jaden.\" Alexis said as she walked up to him. \"Hm? Whats that card you've got there?\" she asked as she walked up next to him to get a better look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I just found it.\" he responded. Then suddenly, the card began to glow, and emitted a bright light that engulfed the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a seemingly normal day, and Yusei was currently working on his Duel Runner in the garage. Crow was out on deliveries, and Jack was elsewhere, most likely at his favorite coffee place, leaving Yusei the only one in their home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was working, he heard the sound of the door opening. \"Yusei? Are you here?\" he could Akiza ask as she entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm here. I'm just working on my Duel Runner.\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack and Crow aren't here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Crow is working, and I don't know where Jack is.\" he said as he stood up and walked over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. By the way, I found this strange card on the way here.\" Akiza said as she held out the blank card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its blank?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I just found it on the ground and picked it up and figured that I'd show it to you.\" she explained. Then suddenly, the card began to glow, and emitted a bright light that engulfed the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a seemingly normal day in Heartland, and Yuma was walking down the street, with Astral floating along behind, unseen by all but him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Yuma! Wait up!\" he heard someone call out to him, and turned around to see Tori walking over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good morning Tori.\" he greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning.\" she replied. \"I just found something that I wanted to show you.\" she said, showing him a blank card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Its completely blank.\" he said as he took it from her. There was no name, picture or text. The only distinguishing thing about it was the color, green, which told him it was a spell card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a strange card.\" Astral commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just found it a little while ago. I thought I should show it to you since I don't really know much about the game.\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what it does.\" Yuma wondered aloud as he looked it over. Then suddenly, the card began to glow, and emitted a bright light that engulfed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bright light died down for each of them, and the four groups from different times all found themselves somewhere else, now in an empty field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey each looked around in confusion, and noticed all the others who had been transported there as well. But before they could say anything, the four cards began to glow again, and they were all once again engulfed by a bright light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen to them?</span></div></div>",

No longer near wherever they were, they were now indoors, and in some kind of locker room.<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\" Jaden asked as he saw their surroundings.<br>\r\n\"How'd we get here?\" Alexis asked.<br>\r\n\"Uh, guys... what are we wearing?\" Yugi questioned, drawing everyone to their clothes. What they had been wearing moments ago was gone, and they were all now clad in identical uniforms. Cheerleading uniforms. They now all wore the same pink and white uniform clearly made for female cheerleaders. T\u00e9a, Tori, and Akiza couldn't help but giggle at the sight of the boys dressed in such attire as the boys blushed in embarrassment.<br>\r\nIt was then that Jaden noticed something else, that there were now eleven of them in the group, with Yubel, Yami Yugi and Astral (To Yuma's surprise) all now with a physical body each and, like them, was also dressed in the same cheerleader uniform. Yubel looked amused by the current situation.<br>\r\n\"Yubel?\" Jaden questioned. \"You've got a body again?\"<br>\r\n\"I suppose so.\" she replied.<br>\r\n\"Uh, guys, I think you might want to check this out...\" Yuma said as he looked into a mirror.<br>\r\n\"What? You want us to see how ridiculous we look like this?\" Yusei asked as the group all walked over to the mirror where Yuma was looking into and were met with shock. Instead of their own reflections, they instead saw something else. All eleven members of the group now had completely different reflections. Instead of the eleven of them, there was a group of teenage girls who looked much more normal dressed in the uniforms than the five boys, plus Astral and Yubel.<br>\r\nJaden now had the beautiful reflection of girl with long blond hair. Yuma now had a red headed girl for his reflection. Yugi's reflection was now that of a cute Asian girl. Yusei now had a black girl with long dark hair for his reflection. Yami's reflection was now a busty girl with brunette hair. And Yubel, despite her non-human looking body, now had the reflection of a regular girl with long black hair.As for Astral, despite his non-human looking body, he had a pale skin girl with milky-blue hair as his reflection. And it wasn't just them, as the real girls in their group also had different reflections. Alexis's reflection was that of a brunette girl. T\u00e9a's reflection was a girl with black hair. Akiza had a pink headed girl with a heart tattoo on her left arm for her reflection and Tori now had the reflection of a girl with blond hair with pink streaks.<br>\r\n\"What is going on?\" Alexis asked. She looked around the room, with everyone looking normal to her, but in the mirror she saw a group of girls in their place. Jaden waved his hand in front of the mirror and then placed his hand on it, the blond girl that was his reflection mimicking his movements perfectly.<br>\r\n\"I don't know, but this sure is weird.\" Akiza replied.<br>\r\n\"You're telling me.\" Tori said.<br>\r\nJust as they were about to discuss what was going on, a few other girls entered the locker room, and saw the group. Now rather than react badly to the sight of boys in the girl\u2019s locker room, or the sight of Yubel's monstrous form, they didn't seem to react much at all. \"Great, you guys are already here.\" one of them said as they began to undress, and the boys blushed as they averted their eyes. Once they were all dressed in the same uniform that Jaden and his friends wore. \"Okay, now that we're all here and ready, let\u2019s go out there and...\"</span></div></div>",

I'm just working on my Duel Runner.\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack and Crow aren't here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Crow is working, and I don't know where Jack is.\" he said as he stood up and walked over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. By the way, I found this strange card on the way here.\" Akiza said as she held out the blank card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its blank?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I just found it on the ground and picked it up and figured that I'd show it to you.\" she explained. Then suddenly, the card began to glow, and emitted a bright light that engulfed the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bright light died down for each of them, and the two groups from different times all found themselves somewhere else, now in an empty field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey each looked around in confusion, and noticed all the others who had been transported there as well. But before they could say anything, the two cards began to glow again, and they were all once again engulfed by a bright light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen to them?</span></div></div>",

Suddenly, he noticed something lying on the ground, and picked it up to see that it was a card. It was green, indicating it was a spell card, but other than that, it was blank. No picture, name, or text.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whats with this weird card?\" he wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful.\" Yubel said. \"It doesn't feel normal. There is something weird about it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden was examing the card when he heard someone call out to him. \"Hey Jaden.\" Alexis said as she walked up to him. \"Hm? Whats that card you've got there?\" she asked as she walked up next to him to get a better look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I just found it.\" he responded. Then suddenly, the card began to glow, and emitted a bright light that engulfed the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a seemingly normal day, and Yusei was currently working on his Duel Runner in the garage. Crow was out on deliveries, and Jack was elsewhere, most likely at his favorite coffee place, leaving Yusei the only one in their home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was working, he heard the sound of the door opening. \"Yusei? Are you here?\" he could Akiza ask as she entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'm here. I'm just working on my Duel Runner.\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack and Crow aren't here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Crow is working, and I don't know where Jack is.\" he said as he stood up and walked over to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. By the way, I found this strange card on the way here.\" Akiza said as she held out the blank card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its blank?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I just found it on the ground and picked it up and figured that I'd show it to you.\" she explained. Then suddenly, the card began to glow, and emitted a bright light that engulfed the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a seemingly normal day in Heartland, and Yuma was walking down the street, with Astral floating along behind, unseen by all but him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Yuma! Wait up!\" he heard someone call out to him, and turned around to see Tori walking over to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good morning Tori.\" he greeted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning.\" she replied. \"I just found something that I wanted to show you.\" she said, showing him a blank card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Its completely blank.\" he said as he took it from her. There was no name, picture or text. The only distinguishing thing about it was the color, green, which told him it was a spell card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a strange card.\" Astral commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just found it a little while ago. I thought I should show it to you since I don't really know much about the game.\" she explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what it does.\" Yuma wondered aloud as he looked it over. Then suddenly, the card began to glow, and emitted a bright light that engulfed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the bright light died down for each of them, and the three groups from different times all found themselves somewhere else, now in an empty field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey each looked around in confusion, and noticed all the others who had been transported there as well. But before they could say anything, the four cards began to glow again, and they were all once again engulfed by a bright light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen to them?</span></div></div>",

As he did, he caught sight of a strange blank Duel Monsters card on the ground. It was the that things started to come back to him. He had been hanging out with Joey and Tea when the three of them had run into Mai. The four of them had decided to catch up since Mai hadn't been around for a while. As they hung out, Yugi had found the strange card he was looking at. As the examined it, it suddenly started glowing and a bright light engulfed the four of them, and that was the last thing he remembered before waking up here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi then picked up the card and looked around, seeing that he was now in an empty clearing, which was definitely not where he was before the flash of light. He also saw Tea, Joey, and Mai nearby. However, the four of them weren't the only ones there. Several other people were there as well. Amongst them were two he recognized, and they were Jaden and Yusei, the two duelists from the future that he had teamed up with to stop Paradox from erasing Duel Monsters from history. Nearby Jaden was a blond girl wearing a uniform with a white top and blue miniskirt. With Yusei were more people, such as a blond man wearing a white coat, an orange haired man with yellow markings on his face, a girl with red hair and a red dress that looked victorian inspired, and finally a pair of nearly identical children with green hair. And finally, there was another pair of kids separate from the others, a boy with black hair and two red spikes in the front, and a girl with green hair. Like him, everybody was starting to come to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, where are we?\" one of the twin children, the one with a ponytails was the first to ask what was on every body's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think anyone knows, Leo.\" the other other twin, who had twin pigtails, said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei looked around, noticing Jaden and Yugi, and recognizing them immediately. \"Yugi, Jaden, its a surprise to see you two.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say.\" Jaden agreed. \"Didn't expect to see you guys so soon again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow!\" the boy with the black and red hair said. \"I can't believe it! Yugi Muto, Jaden Yuki, and Yusei Fudo! You guys are three of the greatest duelists ever! I don't know how I'm getting to meet you guys, but you won't hear me complaining!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks.\" Yugi said, a bit embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you recognize us, I take it you're from a different time after our own, aren't you?\" Yusei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right. Yeah, I'm from a different time in the future after you guys.\" the boy explained. \"By the way, my name is Yuma Tsukumo. And this is my friend, Tori.\" he said as he pointed to the girl with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hello.\" she said with a wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since we're all confused, maybe we should all introduce ourselves and talk about how we got here.\" Yugi suggested, and everyone agreed. \"These are my friends, Tea, Joey, and Mai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hi.\" Tea greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Joey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you.\" Mai said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll go next.\" Jaden said. \"I'm Jaden, and this is my friend, Alexis.\" he said gesturing to the blond girl with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\" she greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Yusei.\" Yusei introduced. \"The rest are my friends. Jack, Crow, Akiza, and the twins, Leo and Luna.\" he said as he pointed to each one. \"How did everyone come to be here?\" he then asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was with my friends, when suddenly I found a card and it started glowing and a light engulfed us when we suddenly woke up here.\" Yugi explained as he held out the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you too?\" Jaden said, then held out a card that was exactly the same as the one Yugi had. \"I was meeting with Alexis, when we found the card and the same thing happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same thing happened to me and my friends.\" Yusei said, also holding out a blank card.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Woah, this is too weird. The exact same thing happened to me and Tori!\" Yuma said holding up a blank card as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Well, this certainly is a strange turn of events.</i>\" a ghostly figure of a demonic looking woman said as she appeared next to Jaden. She was a duel spirit by the name of Yubel, and normally, she would only be visible to Jaden and others who could see duel spirits, but that was currently not the case, and her sudden appearance surprised almost everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, what the hell!?\" Joey let out in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Jaden let out in confusion. \"You guys can see Yubel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a duel spirit too, Jaden?\" Luna questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know about them, huh?\" Jaden said to the young girl with a smile. \"Anyway, Yubel here is one of my duel spirits, which are spirits that live in cards that only certain people can see. She is a bit special though, since shes actually a part of my soul. Long story there, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, enough about that.\" Jack said. \"I think the important thing we should worry about right now is why we're here, and how we're gonna get back to where we belong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta agree with Jack here.\" Crow said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but how are we supposed to do that?\" Joey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Akiza said. \"Maybe we should take a look at those cards since they brought us all here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is a start.\" Tea agreed, and everybody gathered around Yugi, Jaden, Yusei, and Yuma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They really are weird cards.\" Mai said. \"They're almost completely blank, other than being green which tells us they're spell cards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how did a card suddenly bring us here, especially if we're all from different times?\" Tori wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be surprised what cards can do sometimes.\" Alexis said. \"I've seen some pretty strange things done by cards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really is strange that this card can bring people from different times together like this.\" Yugi said. As they all looked over the four cards, they suddenly began to glow, and emitted a bright, blinding light that engulfed them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what will happen to them?</span></div></div>",

As everyone unshielded their eyes Yusei asked \"Hey, is everyone Ok?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden replied by saying, \"looks like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's a relief\" Yugi said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the deal with these cards anyway\", Leo asked. As he asked this he heard a sound that sounded like someone gasping for air. He turned around and saw Luna holding her chest as she breathed heavily. Being the big brother he was Leo immediately aided his little sister. \"Luna are you OK\u201d. She looked up at him as everyone else began to gather around her, worried about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s like the air, the air is choking me. My throat feels so dry, I\u2026 I  think I need water.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeo was shocked to hear this. \u201cThe air is choking you? What do you.. aagh\u201d. Suddenly Leo began having shortness of breath. Everyone looked as he stumbled to the ground on his knees gasping for air and holding his throat with his right hand.  \u201cGasp , gasp, can\u2019t breathe\u201d Leo said desperately. Whatever was happening seemed to have hit him pretty hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLeo, not you too\u201d Yusei said. The two kids sat on the ground, gasping a little bit like fish out of water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNeed water, don\u2019t know why but I need water\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWater?\u201d Yusei said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrow came into the issue to say \u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re fish or something\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo which Yusei nodded in agreement with a small \u201cYeah\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Jaden began to notice something. Something was forming on Leo and Luna\u2019s throats. Looking down on closer examination he saw that two pairs of crescent shaped lines sprouted on their throats. \u201cWoah, uh guys, you may wanna check this out\u201d Jaden said with a stutter. Everyone had replied with a bunch of gasps, oohs and aahs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAkiza then said, realizing how the familiar looking crescent lines and need for water come together \u201cThey\u2019re, They\u2019re growing gills\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, that\u2019s insane\u201d Yuma said loudly. Just then as if it was a virus infection, everyone began feeling something on their throats. They saw that they were beginning to grow gills as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting a finger on her neck Alexis said \u201cUh oh\u201d as she felt a gap on her throat. As she looked among the crowd she saw gills on everyone\u2019s throats, however she noticed nobody was suffocating. She figured that either the first victims of the effect succumb to it or that the age of whoever acquires the gills determines if they suffocate faster or slower than others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yuma felt the tingling feeling on his throat he started to panic as he felt the unusual pair of lines on his neck. \u201cAaaah, I\u2019ve got creepy lines on my neck\u201d Yuma said in his usual panicked expression. \u201cHelp, help\u201d Yuma said as he continued panicking, drawing embarrassing attention to himself as he received looks of embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTori, standing next to him handled the situation a bit more calmly. Despite also having grown gills she wasn\u2019t as hysteric as her pink and black haired friend. Putting a hand on his shoulder she stopped Yuma and said \u201cCalm down Yuma, you just grew gills\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah right, how can I be calm when I\u2019m gonna suffocate and- as Yuma was going to continue he suddenly noticed something surprising about Tori\u2019s hand . \u201cUh, T-Tori\u201d Yuma said stuttering as he gestured towards Tori\u2019s hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, what is, GASP\u201d Tori gasped in shock as she looked at her hand. It had grown webs between the fingers, the kind of webs you see on flippers that help your hands push water to swim. \u201cMy- my hands are becoming fins\u201d she said, looking at her flippers. Looking up to Yuma she also looked at his hands. \u201cYuma, your growing flippers too\u201d Tori said, this time with panic in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh\u201d Yuma said. He looked at his hands and was even more shocked then Tori. \u201cAAAAAAHHH, m-m-m-my hands are getting all webby\u201d Yuma said as he looked at his hands that he held up to his head, webs between the fingers. Suddenly Tori felt something on her elbows. \u201cWhat the?\u201d she said. Lifting her arm she looked at her elbow and saw a fin on it. She presumed that her other arm had it too. The fin was the same color as her hair, green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Yugi stepped in to explain what he though was happening in this situation.\u201dWell it looks like we\u2019re all growing aquatic features. \u201cNo way, I\u2019m not gonna be a walkin\u2019 fish\u201d Joey said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, we\u2019ve got to assess the situation\u201d Yugi said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

As he did, he caught sight of a strange blank Duel Monsters card on the ground. It was the that things started to come back to him. He had been hanging out with Joey and Tea when the three of them had run into Mai. The four of them had decided to catch up since Mai hadn't been around for a while. As they hung out, Yugi had found the strange card he was looking at. As the examined it, it suddenly started glowing and a bright light engulfed the four of them, and that was the last thing he remembered before waking up here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYugi then picked up the card and looked around, seeing that he was now in an empty clearing, which was definitely not where he was before the flash of light. He also saw Tea, Joey, and Mai nearby. However, the four of them weren't the only ones there. Several other people were there as well. Amongst them were two he recognized, and they were Jaden and Yusei, the two duelists from the future that he had teamed up with to stop Paradox from erasing Duel Monsters from history. Nearby Jaden was a blond girl wearing a uniform with a white top and blue miniskirt, and a boy with blue hair wearing white and blue. With Yusei were more people, such as a blond man wearing a white coat, an orange haired man with yellow markings on his face, a girl with red hair and a red dress that looked victorian inspired, a pair of nearly identical children with green hair, and a girl with long hair, glasses, and clothing somewhat resembled what he would see Mokuba often wear. And finally, there was another set of kids separate from the others, a boy with black hair and two red spikes in the front, a girl with green hair, another boy with long blue hair that curved up at the ends, a girl wearing glasses with long gray hair that somewhat resembled cat, and a girl with red and orange hair that had circle hair clips in the front. Like him, everybody was starting to come to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, where are we?\" one of the twin children, the one with a ponytails was the first to ask what was on every body's mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think anyone knows, Leo.\" the other other twin, who had twin pigtails, said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYusei looked around, noticing Jaden and Yugi, and recognizing them immediately. \"Yugi, Jaden, its a surprise to see you two.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say.\" Jaden agreed. \"Didn't expect to see you guys so soon again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow!\" the boy with the black and red hair said. \"I can't believe it! Yugi Muto, Jaden Yuki, and Yusei Fudo! You guys are three of the greatest duelists ever! I don't know how I'm getting to meet you guys, but you won't hear me complaining!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, thanks.\" Yugi said, a bit embarrassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you recognize us, I take it you're from a different time after our own, aren't you?\" Yusei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, right. Yeah, I'm from a different time in the future after you guys.\" the boy explained. \"By the way, my name is Yuma Tsukumo. And these are my friends, Tori, Shark, Cathy, and Anna, plus my bi.\" he said as he pointed to the others with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hello.\" the green haired girl said with a wave. the boy and the gray hair girl remained silent with passive expressions while the red haired girl crossed her arms in frustration, her expression also showing her displeasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since we're all confused, maybe we should all introduce ourselves and talk about how we got here.\" Yugi suggested, and everyone agreed. \"These are my friends, Tea, Joey, and Mai.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hi.\" Tea greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey.\" Joey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you.\" Mai said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I'll go next.\" Jaden said. \"I'm Jaden, and these are my friends, Alexis and Jesse.\" he said gesturing to the blond girl and blue haired boy with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello.\" she greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" the boy greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Yusei.\" Yusei introduced. \"The rest are my friends. Jack, Crow, Akiza, the twins, Leo and Luna, and Carly.\" he said as he pointed to each one. \"How did everyone come to be here?\" he then asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was with my friends, when suddenly I found a card and it started glowing and a light engulfed us when we suddenly woke up here.\" Yugi explained as he held out the card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you too?\" Jaden said, then held out a card that was exactly the same as the one Yugi had. \"I was meeting with Alexis and Jesse, when we found the card and the same thing happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same thing happened to me and my friends.\" Yusei said, also holding out a blank card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, this is too weird. The exact same thing happened to us too!\" Yuma said holding up a blank card as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this certainly is a strange turn of events.\" a ghostly figure of a demonic looking woman said as she appeared next to Jaden. She was a duel spirit by the name of Yubel, and normally, she would only be visible to Jaden and others who could see duel spirits, but that was currently not the case, and her sudden appearance surprised almost everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, what the hell!?\" Joey let out in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Jaden let out in confusion. \"You guys can see Yubel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a duel spirit too, Jaden?\" Luna questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you know about them, huh?\" Jaden said to the young girl with a smile. \"Anyway, Yubel here is one of my duel spirits, which are spirits that live in cards that only certain people can see. She is a bit special though, since shes actually a part of my soul. Long story there, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, enough about that.\" Jack said. \"I think the important thing we should worry about right now is why we're here, and how we're gonna get back to where we belong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta agree with Jack here.\" Crow said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but how are we supposed to do that?\" Joey asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would any of us know?\" Jesse said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all just as confused by being here.\" Shark said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should take a look at those cards since they brought us all here.\" Akiza suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it is a start.\" Tea agreed, and everybody gathered around Yugi, Jaden, Yusei, and Yuma. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They really are weird cards.\" Mai said. \"They're almost completely blank, other than being green which tells us they're spell cards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how did a card suddenly bring us here, especially if we're all from different times?\" Tori wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd be surprised what cards can do sometimes.\" Alexis said. \"I've seen some pretty strange things done by cards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It really is strange that this card can bring people from different times together like this.\" Yugi said. As they all looked over the four cards, they suddenly began to glow, and emitted a bright, blinding light that engulfed them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, what will happen to them?</span></div></div>",

It's......completely blank.\" Yuya said as he took it out from the wall. \"Excuse me?\" Yuzu said in shock. Yuya was right; There was no name, picture or text on the card.

Then suddenly, Yuya's Pendant began to glow, and then the card began to glow, and emitted a bright light that engulfed them, blinding them. The two teens screamed, and then as quickly as it had begun, it ended. Shocked, it took a moment for the two to regain their eyesight. </span></div></div>",

Be creative and with similar stuff, don't always make ito go the same direction as other paths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, while it only starts with the selected character(s), feel free to involve others on the character list, and even have similar paths from a selected Yu-Gi-Oh! series intersect. For example, say Yusei and Akiza of Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's swap lives with a character from another series, and their fellow 5D's characters, Jack and Carly swap lives with different characters from the same series in one of their options, feel free to have them meet up in either path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">No sex</span>.
