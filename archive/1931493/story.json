It was a revolutionary device capable of influencing the size of matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was the big day that you decided to begin testing. You were beaming with pride as you glanced down at the device sitting on your bedroom work desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe metallic device was about a foot tall and wide like a boombox. Its base was covered with various switches and buttons that would make any average person dizzy. Its most prominent feature however was a shiny red bulb hanging down inside the heart of the device. It looked like something straight out of a mad scientists' lab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFinally ready to test this baby out~!\u201d You muttered to yourself with a pie-eating grin. Just as you prepared to flick on the device, the bedroom door behind you audibly creaked open...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon turning around, you immediately caught sight of your nine year old brother peaking his head through the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle!  What did I said about coming into my room!?\u201d You groaned with annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err.. I'm not actually IN your room\u201d the boy said meekly, with a hint of playfulness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be a smartass. What do you want?\" You were already growing impatient with the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom and Dad just left for their trip. They told me to tell you that breakfast is on the table....\u201d Kyle replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap....they left already?? ...\u201d You muttered, guiltily rubbing the back of your head. You were so busy with your work that you didn't get to see them off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth you and your brother were going to be home alone while your parents were away on a weekend long sailing trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what's that thing???\u201d Kyle asked, staring at the strange looking contraption on your desk. His eyes were gleaming with child-like curiosity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for you to realize Kyle was referring to your matter altering device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's none of your business. Now get out. I'm busy\u201d You curtly replied. Your brother was always such a nosy nuisance whenever he caught wind of your inventions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoaaah, what do all those buttons and switches do??\u201d Kyle persisted as he took a step forward into the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you were really getting frustrated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyle, I'm not kidding around! The last time I showed you one of my inventions you ended up breaking it, remember??\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAww! Pleeeease~?? I promise I'll be careful this time!\u201d Kyle pleaded, taking another step forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething inside you finally snapped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKYLE!  Mom and dad are gone for the weekend. That means I'M in charge! So stop annoying me and GET. OUT. OF. MY. ROOM!\u201d you loudly yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bright playfulness in Kyle's eyes darkened with disappointment.  His hurt expression quickly evolved into one of bitterness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine! I wasn't even interested in your dumb robot anyways!\u201d Kyle yelled as he pulled the door shut with a loud slam. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt's not a robot! IDIOT\u201d  You shouted back while rolling your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs silence began to fill the room, you let out a sigh of both relief and guilt. You were happy that Kyle had left, but at the same time you felt sort of bad about how you handled the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your brother used to be much closer in the past, but a tumultuous rift had begun to form between you in the past year or so. You both had very different personalities and had very little in common. The tension seemed to be getting worse by the day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n You'd actually been planning on reconnecting with him at some point during this weekend, but that seemed pretty unlikely now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, so much for that..\u201d You shrugged, turning yourself back towards the device. <br>\r\n---------------------<br>\r\n[an hour of tinkering later]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a few more minutes to make sure that you had properly calibrated the device, you were finally ready to test it out for the very first time<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright perfect~ Now I just need my test subject~\u201d You stated, walking over to the adjacent desk and picking up the red apple you'd prepared for the test. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell....here's to success...\u201d You muttered, giving the apple a quick kiss for good luck. You placed the fruit in a cavity directly underneath the glowing red orb in the center of the device.  Just as you were about to press the activation button, the house phone began to ring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on! Really??\u201d You groaned, lowering your hand away from the device.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKYLE!! ANSWER THE PHONE!\u201d </span></div></div>",

You groaned before hurrying out of your bedroom to answer it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you began to descend the stairs, you failed to notice your little brother peeking his head out from his bedroom further down the hall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you were even out of view, Kyle was already hatching an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mischievous young boy quickly darted down the hall to your now vacant bedroom. A wide grin spread across his young face as he stared at the untended 'robot' on the desk. He quickly ran up to it and started pressing all the buttons and turning all the dials he could get his hands on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe... Let see how long it takes him to fix this!\u201d He giggled to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore he could mess things up too much, he was cut short by the sound of your footsteps heading back up the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh oh....\u201d the boy muttered as he totally froze up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking, Kyle jumped onto your bed and attempted to hide himself behind the assortment of pillows. He held his breath and didn't move a muscle, hoping that neither of his feet or head were peaking into view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou returned to your room with a scowl. The call ended up being an automated reminder for Kyle's upcoming dental check up.  As you stepped into your bedroom, you didn't seem to notice that anything was off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll your focus had already returned to your device. This was it, it was time to test! No more distractions! You proudly walked up to the desk. Your hands were almost shaking with excitement as you reached out to press the green start-up button. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kyle was secretly looking on through a gap in the pillows. He was trying his best to hold in his laughter; He eagerly awaited to see your reaction when you realized all the knobs and switches were all wrong.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't end up checking the calibrations though, confident that they were as you had left them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was as if time slowed down as your finger closed in to press the green start-up button; You bit your lower lip as Kyle quietly held his breath with anticipation.  The younger sibling wasn't sure what would be the result of his tampering, but he hoped that it would at least be funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCLICK</span></div></div>",

The unexpected blast of light caught you totally off guard, forcing you to shield your eyes. You could feel an almost static like cling across your entire body, causing all your hair to stand on end. By the time your eyes recovered, you quickly realized that something was definitely not right. The world around you didn't seem familiar anymore. You had no idea where you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what...?!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter rubbing your eyes a bit, it became shockingly clear that you were no longer in your bedroom anymore. For starters, you were now standing knee deep countless bushels of thick, rope-like twine. At first you assumed that you were outside, but then your realized the sky was actually a ceiling, and the sun was artificial. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-where am I?!\u201d  You yelled out in fear as you pushed away at the thick springy ropes engulfing your legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you turned around, you came face to face with something that sent a shiver down your spine.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo..wait.... that\u2019s .. that\u2019s impossible. \u2026 How could...?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, towering over you like a building was a stack of gigantic engineering textbooks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait....no,...no way\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tilted his head higher and higher until you came to finally recognize the huge wooden structure looming over you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 my desk\u2026?!!?\u201d You gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the puzzle pieces were quickly forming into a larger picture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...shrunk??! H-how?! How small am!?\u201d  Your heart was now beating like a drum. As you stood there, trying to calm yourself down, a far away noise suddenly captured your attention.  There was a loud, ominous shifting sound emanating from the other side of the room where your bed was. The platform where you usually slept now looked absolutely mountainous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a deafening creaking of springs as something large began to shift atop the mattress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait...what the hel--\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, without warning....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***THOOOOOOM***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe floor beneath you shook with a force comparable to an earthquake. Before you could stabilize himself, a second tremor knocked you off your feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW-what the hell is happening!?\u201d You screamed, fearfully clinging to one of the countless carpet fibers surrounding you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe consecutive tremors were rhythmic, and growing more intense by the second. Unsure of what was happening, you just held your head down and braced yourself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the loud, booming earthquakes were at their worst, the shaking stopped. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still trembling as you slowly lifted up your head and opened your eyes. For some reason, everything on the floor around you seemed a little bit darker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when you finally looked up that you realized why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were being eclipsed by the shadow of an colossal giant standing over you.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blood rushed from your face, leaving you ghost white as you recognized the looming titan. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201ck-k\u2026\u2026\u201d   You were unable to summon words.  Nearly two yards away from you were two massive, socked, house-sized feet connected to two colossal legs covered by a familiar pair of blue pajamas. You continued to tilt your head higher up to a white white tee-shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god.....\u201d You whimpered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeyond the tee-shirt was your younger brother\u2019s head, which was tilted down towards your direction. The giant boy's seemingly blank expression was shrouded in shadow. </span></div></div>",

After a moment of silence, the boy felt compelled to see the results of his mischief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(5 4 3 2....)\" he counted to himself internally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(1!!!)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle burst from the pillows, preparing to jump off the bed and run for the door while laughing. He stopped short however, after he noticed that his older brother was no longer standing where he had been.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wide-eyed, gleeful expression on Kyle's face slowly turned to one of puzzlement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy looked suspiciously around the room as he began to wonder if his brother was about to jump out of nowhere and strangle him. That was when he noticed that it wasn't just his brother that was missing, but the 'robot' on the desk was gone too.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling like he should investigate, the boy hesitantly dangled feet over the side of the bed and plopped down onto the floor below. After taking a few steps toward the desk, he came to a stop when he noticed that there was something tiny sitting atop the desk where the 'robot' had been. He leaned over and grabbed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-woah... the robot... it got super tiny!!\"  Kyle gasped in awe as he examined the now candy-sized object. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill suspicious about his brother's whereabouts, he decided to call out your name <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-brandon, are you in here???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around the room waiting for a response. The door was still closed. There was no way that his brother had the time to leave the room during the moment that he wasn't looking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmm\" Kyle pondered to himself quizzically as he crossed his arms in thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDriven by curiosity, Kyle walked over to the bed and got on all fours.  He slowly lifted up the hanging bed sheets to see if his brother was hiding under the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Where the heck did he go...?\" Kyle muttered as he scanned the empty area under the mattress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so weird....\" The boy muttered as he lifted himself back up to his feet. As he stood there contemplating what happened to you, something suddenly caught his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Out of the corner of his eye, the nine year old saw a small movement on the floor nearby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looked downward, allowing his eyes lock on to what appeared to be a small insect scurrying towards him from the direction of the desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnown to be easily distracted, the 'bug' immediately captured the grade schooler's undivided attention. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy turned himself towards the approaching insect and watched with curiosity as the 'ant' crawled right in front of him.  It was a scene he had witnessed many times before: an ant mindlessly crawling around on the floor without a care in the world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle reacted just as <i>any</i> boy his age would react upon seeing such a thing. With a blank, indifferent stare, he began to lift his foot over the tiny pest. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Adrenaline was pulsing through your entire body. You've never felt so defenseless and insignificant before, ESPECIALLY not in relation to your little brother.  Kyle seemed to be looking for something. He was probably trying to figure out where you disappeared to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He must have saw the beam go off, but hasn't realized that I've shrunk\" you say to yourself as you watch the boy turn around.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that no matter how hard try to yell for his attention, he'll never even hear a squeak of it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Kyle began to walk over to the bed. You realize that you're going to need to get his attention if you're ever going regain access to your invention and return to your normal size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt truly began to dawn on you that your device actually worked. You'd take a moment to celebrate if your current situation wasn't so dire. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could this have happened? All the setting were correct! I checked them twice and ever-\" You thought to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole floor shook violently, knocking you off your feet again. You winced before trying to lift yourself back up. The tremor was caused by Kyle dropping down on to all fours, likely to continue searching for you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when it hit you; this was your best opportunity to get his attention! You quickly began to run towards his direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It didn't take long before you realize how long a distance it was from the desk to your bed.  Normally it would only have taken you four footsteps to cover the distance, but now it seemed like a quarter of a mile.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a half a minute passed as you finally started closing the distance. Just as you began to feel a sense of hope, it was shattered as Kyle started to stand back up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'NOOoOOOOOO! KYLE I'M DOWN HERE!! KYLE!!!' you screamed at the top of your lungs while waving your arms desperately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou refused to give up and continued to run. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'KYLE!!!!!! LOOOK LOOOOK!!!!!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant, Kyle's eyes fixed onto you.  You suddenly felt a strange sensation; it was a mixture of joy, combined with an unnerving fear.  You ignored these feelings and continued to run and shout<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'YESSS!! KYLE I'M HERE!!!!' You shouted with a massive open-mouthed smile across your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle turned himself towards your direction as you finally stopped a yard away from his feet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was staring directly at you, there was no way he hadn't noticed you.  You simply stood there waving for moment, waiting for him to kneel down and carefully pick you up. (\"Then he would just have to take me up to the device, and I'll just walk him through setting it up and'..\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour internal dialog suddenly slowed to a halt as you notice that Kyle didn't appear to be displaying any sort of shock or surprise upon seeing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Kyle! Hurry! Pick me up!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when it happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Kyle's right leg started to extend forward, lifting his massive socked foot up into the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were utterly speechless as the colossal foot began to envelope you in shadow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'K-Kyle''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to slow as you stared at the impossibly vast sole of your kid-brother's foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fabric underneath was grayed out and slightly moistened by foot sweat. The fabric was cohered directly to the underside of his foot, making all the soft, lumpy details of his sole stand out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA voice in the back of your head was telling you to run, but your legs wouldn't budge an inch. You could only stand there in complete terror as the young boy's foot hovered directly over you. You felt a wave of absolutely dread washed over you as you realized just how small you had become. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were the size of a bug, and apparently, that's exactly what your brother had mistaken you as. You realized how huge of a mistake it was trying to get his attention at such a puny size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n It began to occur to you how many insects have died this way; Mostly on accident, but many squashed merely for momentary amusement or satisfaction. There's no way your life could possibly end like this. Squashed beneath your kid brother's foot??<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no...NONONO!!!..\" You began to enter complete panic mode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-KYLE!! NO!! IT'S ME!! YOUR BROTHER!! KYLE NOOOO!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll you could do was back away and scream in terror as your kid brother's foot quickly began to descend to stomp you flat. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Huh, that's weird....It's not running away..\" He thought to himself in disappointment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy moved his foot away from the trembling 'bug', and set it down to the side.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling more curious about this odd ant, Kyle got down onto his knees and began closer inspection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmm\" he hummed as he focused on the 'insect'. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly his eyes snapped open. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait a minute...

The scent of maple syrup and pancakes washed over you as the strong gusts of his breathing blasted into you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes! Kyle! It's me!!\" You began to call out. This was the first time in your life that you've ever been intimidated by your younger brother. Kyle wasn't even trying to come off that way intentionally, he was just SO gargantuan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOW, you shrunk!!!\" Kyle yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegaining your composure, you stood up and started to shout more confidently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes!! My machine shrunk me! You need to carry me over to it so we can fix this!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW LITTLE YOU ARE~' Kyle shouted again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seemed as though Kyle was able to hear you. That was a good sign. The problem was that he didn't really seem very interested in anything you were saying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle! You need to listen!

The robot!\" He shouted excitedly'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, Kyle stood up and reached over to the desk.  He lowered himself back down and carefully placed the machine on the floor next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasped in shock. The machine had shrunk along with you!  In a way you were slightly relieved that you didn't need to talk Kyle through resetting the device himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Now I just need to fix the settings and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a shadow loomed over you.

Kyle's massive fingers quickly curled around you, effortlessly carrying you up to his face.  He opened his hand, sending you tumbling into his palm. The massive fleshy surface extended out in all directions. Above you was Kyle's massive smiling face, staring down on you as if he had just picked up a shiny quarter. He never imagined he'd get a chance to hold a tiny person like this, let alone his OWN brother. Something about the experience sort of made him feel all excited and tingly inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is so cool!\" The colossal boy whispered, utterly fascinated with your new size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle! What were you thinking!? You could have hurt me! You need to be careful!\" You shouted out condescendingly, attempting to re-assert your control over the situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-oh.....sorry!\" Kyle said with genuine concern; It didn't last long though, as his face reverted to one of playful awe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... I really almost stepped on you' back then! haha..\" You can tell by Kyle's introspective expression that he was imagining what it would have looked like had he finished lowering his foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-alright Kyle! You need to bring me to my device! I need to fix this!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, I didn't think messing with that robot would cause something like THIS to happen.\" Kyle began to laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a second for the boy's words to sink in. You couldn't believe it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait....WHAT?!?  <b>YOU</b> DID THIS??!\" You yelled out in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmhmm!\" Kyle playfully hummed while trying to hold in his trademark giggle. He didn't appear to think that this situation was serious at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realized that he must have tampered with the device while you went downstairs to answer the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THIS ISN'T FUNNY! YOU'RE GOING TO BE IN SO MUCH TROUBLE WHEN I GET BACK TO NORMAL\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe big dumb smile on Kyle's face immediately faded. He knew how badly he was going to be punished once you returned to your normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(\"If only I could just keep him this way....\") The giant boy's thoughts began to stir as he looked down at his palm, his gaze fixed in on your puny form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once, Kyle suddenly seemed to realize the opportunity he had within his grasp.  </span></div></div>",

Before any of this happened, it was always Kyle who was the one being restrained. He remembered all the times when you two used to wrestle. He hated how you were always easily able to force him to say uncle before letting him go. No matter how hard he tried to fight back, you were always bigger and stronger than him. But now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle stared down at his fist and giggled as he tightened it a little, causing your movements to weaken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continued pounding over and over again, crying out in desperation as the walls closed in further. The space within Kyle's hand was beginning to get clammy as sweat started to form on the walls of his palm. You began feeling yourself running out of steam as the heat became more and more intense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle!!...let me out of here!....let me........\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the outside, Kyle was mulling over his thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, THIS is fun~\u201d He stated excitedly <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew that if he wanted to, he could keep you like this until your parents got back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again....why let the fun stop there? Why should he let you return back to normal at all? It would serve you right for being such a mean jerk!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoahhh.... I bet I could have his room!...' Kyle began to daydream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy eventually returned his attention back to his fist. There was a look in his eyes that seemed to suggest he had made up his mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you felt like you were going to pass-out from heat exhaustion, Kyle finally opened his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took a deep breath, trying to recover from the brutal heat box of your brother's fist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkaaaay, you win, I'll let you see the robooot~\u201d Kyle whined as he rolled his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly he lowered you down to the carpet below about six inches away from the device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sighed with relief. Apparently your brother was done having fun. As you began to hurry over to the device, you began to wonder if you should be easy on him once you return back to normal...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't get much time to think on the matter further, as a dark, ominous shadow suddenly settled over the device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you were able to figure out what was happening, it was already too late. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of Kyle's giant socked feet suddenly came down from nowhere and planted itself onto the device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehe, Say bye bye to mr. robot!~~\" Kyle giggled as he began to apply pressure to the device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart skipped a beat. A strong wave of dread coursed through your entire body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cno...NO!.....STOP!.....KYLE! THAT ISN'T FUNNY!!\" You yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou ran over to the side of your brother's foot, frantically attempting to lift it off; Your effort was obviously futile. You just hoped that this was all just a cruel joke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn actual crunching sound began to emanate from beneath Kyle's foot. The sides of his mouth grew wider and wider as he watched your pointless attempts to stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-kyle! I'm sorry! I promise I'll be a better big brother! Just please stop this!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, I don't WANT a big brother anymore~\u201d Kyle declared in between his monstrous giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crunching got louder along with the increasing pressure until the underside of Kyle's foot was firmly pressing down against the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment that seemed like an eternity, the foot finally lifted back up, unveiling a flattened, unrecognizable disk of metal and wires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell to your knees in horror. . <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour machine was the only way to grow back. Without it, you'd be stuck this way, like cowering insect....forever...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now he was actually claiming his dominion over you \u2013 It was something that the boy had probably always dreamed about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, you were absolutely powerless as your 'little' brother trapped you in his grasp. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It didn't take long for Kyle to see that the sock had fallen. He quickly began to scan the floor before his eyes locked onto you. His fearful expression melted away into a soft smirk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'well well well' he said with his mouth full of Doritos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked past you, covering the entire distance you had been running within a few footsteps. He pulled the chair you had been trapped on in front of you and placed the bag of Doritos on the desk.  Taking a seat, he positioned himself so that his two sneaker'd feet were on both sides of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you enjoy your run across my floor?\" The young boy mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared up at the boy-god sitting in what looked like massive throne. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look a little tired.

You can see Kyle flexing his toes in delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell wasn't horrible, but it was still inescapable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both of his Sneakers out of the way, he slowly began to peel off his socks one by one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a loud, almost sticky sound as the sweaty fabric pulled away from the soles of his moist feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-kyle! Please don't!!!\" You cried out as you slowly started backing away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment Kyle crushed your machine, you knew that he never intended for you to be big again. He knew that he could do anything he wanted to you without having to fear the consequences. In his eyes you were just a toy. A toy that he now wanted under his feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could finish evaluating your thoughts, Kyle had pivoted his massive bare foot over you.  You remember all the times in the past when you would punish him by tickling his feet until he begged for mercy.  It was hard to believe it was the same foot. Not only because his feet had grown bigger since then, but because of your new-found perspective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a visible sheen of sweat spread across his sole, and even some areas where tiny rivers of sweat were starting to drip down. He wriggled his toes as he let out a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhh, that feels good! but I know what will feel even better!\" He said with a cruel boyish smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could even register what was happening, Kyle was bringing his foot down on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cried and attempted outrun it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were running, you noticed small droplets of sweat dripping onto the wide floorboard around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow that surrounded you became darker and darker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before you felt the hot, moist sole make contact with your back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fell to the floor as it impacted with you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant he felt your body against his sole, Kyle pulled back for a moment. It was as if one final piece of his conscience was telling him that he was going too far.The feeling only lasted for a passing moment.  No one was around to see or stop him. YOU certainly weren't in any position to object. Why should he have to think about your feelings at all?  Besides, you're HIS possession now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above, Kyle simply closed his eyes as he lowered his foot once again. He felt no more hesitation as he pinned you to the floor. He simply sat their savoring feeling of his once bigger brother's entire form now struggling to survive under his steamy bare foot. The power he felt over you was indescribable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, he began to feel a dark urge to crush you right then and there. All it would take was a small bit of pressure and you'd be squashed like a bug. The boy's tongue darted across his lips as he imagined it. Luckily for you, he able to resist these feelings and just enjoy the experience. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle continued to carefully roll you back and forth under his foot for a good few minutes. After a while, he placed his toes over you, flexing them over your body, covering you with even more sweat. It felt even better then he imagined it would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter spending another three minutes under his colossal feet, Kyle decided that he was finally satisfied.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy-god began to lift his foot off of you; however, the perspiration caused you to stick to his sole for a moment before sending you falling back down onto the surface below.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large pool of sweat in the shape of Kyle's foot now surrounded you across the wooden floor. </span></div></div>",

Above your tiny form on the floor, a lump was beginning to protrude from the front his shorts. He reached down and poked at it with his index finger and it seemed to stiffen even further. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>And that feeling got even stronger.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to stay on your feet the slippery floor, you looked up at the towering boyish god that just a few minutes ago had been your little brother. However, the very act of trying to look up at something so tall put you off balance, and the next thing you knew your back hit the disgusting, sweat-coated floor. The breath was knocked out of you, and before you could recover you heard snickering booming down from high above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard your massive brother snicker. You opened your eyes, still recovering from landing on your back, only to wish you had closed them as you're treated the view of enormous Kyle grinning down, his arms behind his back... with his gargantuan wiener sticking out, his shorts pulled down slightly. It was wobbling back and forth, just moments ago released from its prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you didn't even think it was fully erect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what are you DOING!?\" you yelled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" he laughed. \"You're being rude to your new best friend, bug. Well, he's probably gonna turn out to be a big mean bully, actually,\" Kyle grinned down, from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle NO! You can't--\" you start, before your brother's massive form crashes down as he drops down on his buttox. Tears stream down your eyes as the reverberation of the floor seems to shake your brain loose. Opening your eyes, your view was eclipsed by the massive member hovering and bouncing over you, as loud, boyish snickering boomed down from high above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou... you suspected as much, but to see it there, completely out in the open... What kind of freakish hell have you be jettisoned into... just minutes ago, you were bickering normally with your little brother. Now you're the size of an insect, exhausted, humiliated and crushed on the floor underneath him. All hope of return to normal-size had been literally crushed, and Kyle had every reason to not only keep you this way, but keep you hidden. And now... <b>this</b>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, I wish I had a hot-dog bun,\" he snickered, taking his fingers and moving his massive penis to the side to look down at your puny form underneath it. Just seeing you at your tiny, insignificant size, cowering underneath his own enlarged private part, knowing there was absolutely no one, no way, who would be able to help you... just knowing he had a full week with the house all to himself, with all that time to smash and smother you into submission underneath his massive cock while he figured out some way to explain your disappearance. He was already imagining attending your funeral with you screaming down in his pants, with you somehow hopelessly tied, or taped, or glued to it... he witnessed his penis becoming longer, wider, and the head almost becoming shiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You realize this is what the rest of your life is gonna be, right?\" he grinned down. \"No more girlfriends, no wife, no job, no friends, no house, no car!\" he added cruelly, waving his massive fully erect member around mockingly over you. \"NOTHING BUT MAKING ME FEEL GOOD!\" he laughed, supremely satisfied with himself. \"SEE? Are you sorry you kicked me out of your room NOW? NYAHHHHH!\" he added, sticking out his tongue, using his fingers to guide his gargantuan penis down overtop of your insect-sized body, muffling out your protests entirely.</span></div></div>",

But there wasn\u2019t any. No air. When you tried to fill your lungs, the flesh would simply suction around your mouth and nose instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard Kyle\u2019s dominant, muffled snickering from high above\u2026 And you were already bruised and beaten to pure exhaustion, but the sheer bizarre, freakiness of what was happening to you caused you to flail and thrash with the little remaining strength in your already broken body. It hurt, but apparently, you had more than I thought I did left. It may have simply been the adrenaline pumping, but for a moment you knew that with all your rage and fear, and what is right in the world, you could at least lift the Kyle\u2019s private fleshy member up off you, to get a breath of air. But as you expended every last ounce of strength, tears started streaming down you cheeks as you gasp for air again and again, to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heard more boyish snickering, as the ceiling of flesh began to pulsate and forward and back. You could only imagine, in your suffocating panic, that what you were feeling was Kyle using his finger to press down on the top of his penis, rubbing it around to make it feel even better. You went limp finally, from complete exhaustion. You had absolutely nothing left, and submitted to letting the terrifying burning feeling in your lungs build. And build. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn\u2019t even budge. You had already used up <i>beyond</i> your last reserves of fuel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly though, the enormous fleshy ceiling lifted, allowing you to fill your lungs. You laid there on your back gasping for air several times, as Kyle\u2019s massive domineering member moved to the side to revealing Kyle\u2019s giant, grinning freckled face staring down at you. \u201c<i>Aww was dere\u2019 no air for da\u2019 buggy?</i>\u201d he said with a huge ear to ear grin. With that, his enormous cock came back down on top of you, knocking the breath out of you, and again sealing you in a heavy vacuum of flesh and darkness which you couldn\u2019t possibly escape. For several seconds you simply held your breath and let him rhythmically press the flesh forward and backward on top of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMove!\u201d you finally heard his muffled, booming, boyish voice say.  But there was no way that was going to happen. Your arms and legs were already so drained they felt glued to the floor from the sheer force of gravity. \u201cI said MOVE!\u201d he commanded again. \u201cIf you DON\u2019T MOVE I\u2019m not gonna let to breathe at all!\u201d he added impatiently. And the rhythmic forward and backward movement continued. Doing the only thing left at your disposal, you opened your mouth as wide as possible and chomped down as hard as you could on the suffocating flesh that went inside. You the waited for the result, for Kyle to yelp or scream and finally lift the smashing, suffocating monster off you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhh\u2026 Brandon? That <i>tickled</i> a little. Is that all you got left?\u201d you heard giant Kyle snicker. \u201cYOU\u2019RE SO PATHETIC NOW BRANDON. Payback time TIMES A MILLION!\u201d he laughed. You suddenly saw light and took the moment to get what little air you could, but before you could get much, Kyle\u2019s massive penis shaft slammed back down onto you. HARD. Then it lifted again, rising to its full height and displaying its full majesty as he scooted his massive body back a bit and smirked down with his young freckled face high above. He leaned in, moving his penis out of the way, to get a closer look at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat not do it bug? Awww, <i>I was going for the KO!</i> I just thought of the best punishment EVER but I want it to be a surprise,\u201d he said, leaning back up. \u201cWell anyway, I know THIS will do it,\u201d he chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it!\" you screamed, but there was nothing you could do as Kyle used his hand to swing his massive throbbing member downward, now perfectly aligned so that the shining purple head of his fully erect dick came down on you like a hammer. Your head is concussed against the hard floor, leaving you seeing spinning shadows. The last thing you remembered was hearing echoing, boyish laughter as a blurry penis shaped shadow lifted up again to full height, before slamming back down atop of you again, and again, smashing your arms, legs and ribs, and slamming your head hard against the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were having a dream that your mom wanted you to pick up Kyle after school, but you blew him off to hang out with a girl you\u2019d grown up with. You had gotten in trouble. You slowly realize you were just dreaming, and reach to pull the covers off of you, but find that they are somehow pressing down so tightly on your body that you can\u2019t even move. Extremely tight. So tight can\u2019t budge your arms or legs from their positions splayed out to their sides. And it\u2019s really hot. As your vision slowly returns, you realize that there are no covers at all\u2026 you can also hear a rushing sound in your head. Yeah, you remember now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething hit your head. You probably, no, definitely have a concussion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd your entire body feels just like it did after you were in a full body cast after a car wreck years ago. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, suddenly, you remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrunk to the size of a bug, you were slammed and smashed under the erect penis of your little brother, who had crushed the only device capable of returning you to full-size and claimed you as his toy. Not only that, you\u2019re stuck with him, alone, all weekend. Suddenly you long to go back to your \u201cbad\u201d dream, but you know the truth. As nightmarish as it seems, this cruel reality is the true waking world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKYLE!!\u201d you scream at the top of your lungs. You begin to flail and squirm with all of your strength. In response, you hear a boyish chuckle, as your entire being and the thing you\u2019re attached lifts into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou realize that feels good, right? Keep it up, you\u2019re gonna make it grow again if you wiggle like that,\u201d he mocks, as his lifting member treats you to a view of your new predicament. You\u2019re somehow plastered to the enormous bottom side of Kyle\u2019s enormous penis, held firmly by some transparent substance. Kyle is now completely naked, laying on the sheets of his bed, his legs spread out comfortably to the sides and his hands fiddling with the bottom of the shaft of his penis, waving it around carelessly. And you\u2019re stuck to it. The sweeping motions are making you sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, by the way, in case you were wondering\u2026 you\u2019re like, just a little over half-an-inch tall now,\u201d Kyle chuckles. \u201cI measured you while you were knocked out,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd yeah, this stuff? PERFECT for what I wanted to do to you!\u201d he continues, his right hand reaching over to the nightstand and grabbing a small bottle, pulling it to your vision. At least, small from his perspective. The bottle itself dwarves you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cL I Q U I D  * B A N D A G E\u201d you see written on the front of it. And you realize, that\u2019s the clear substance that\u2019s holding you so tightly to the giant wall of brotherly penile flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNyah nyah!\u201d he mocks, putting the bottle away, but his hand returns with another, even larger object. \u201cOops, better do some prep work,\u201d he continues with a snarky grin, as you see a huge bottle of grape-scented hand lotion coming your way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Grape-scented lotion. You remember long, long ago that your mom gave you a talk, when she caught you playing with yourself when you were younger. She gave you the standard talk about how it was \u201cokay and natural\u201d and but that you should keep your door locked when you wanted privacy. Your dad didn\u2019t want anything to do with explaining this these things, so your mom had made sure you understood the importance of moisturization and of disposing of your used tissues yourself. She had used it in a lead in to the larger \u2018talk\u2019, the birds and the bees and all that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut yeah. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly he\u2019s had the same talk. She had provided that same, grape-scented hand lotion to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further warning, you\u2019re covered in a cold slathering of lotion along with the wall of hardening, bouncing flesh to which you are plastered. His hand grips around his massive member, sliding up and down, up and down, with you caught in between each working of his shaft. \u201cSTICK\u2026 OUT\u2026 YOUR\u2026 TONGUE\u2026\u201d he demands between passes of his hand. You don\u2019t know why but in the insanity of it all, you actually do what he says. You obey. He has claimed you, and you are his. You stick out your tongue and press it against his enormous, grape-lotion covered shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about ten minutes of moaning and whispering to himself (you think you hear him whisper the name of one of his teachers and a couple of his classmates), you feel a large vibration and realize that your giant little brother is finally jizzing, confirmed by the sudden appearance of a tissue high above wrapped around the head of his penis. You watch helplessly as he expertly cleans and collects the semen with only a drop or two escaping the first tissue, in the end tossing three tissues aside into his waste basket. Nice and tidy, like he\u2019s been doing this for a while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he sits up, naked and shirtless in bed, holding his now slightly less erect penis to the side to look down at you, admiring how you are so helplessly stuck to it. You were hoping to see some sign of sympathy or remorse after what he had just done to you. With his load released, and all. But all you see is a tired, sleepy-eyed boy grinning down proudly and possessively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026So, I\u2019m gonna have to keep you like this. How are we gonna deal with Mom and Dad?\u201d he eventually says, after caressing your trapped body with his finger for a minute or two. \u201cI mean, I guess I\u2019ve got to make them think you ran away, or SOMETHING. Can you come up with a good plan that would actually work?\u201d Kyle says, looking down at you quite seriously, as if he expects you, currently plastered with adhesive to the bottom side of his semi-erect, throbbing penis, to offer suggestions on this matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat! Why would\u2026 I\u2026 help\u2026 you\u2026 \u2026!\u201d you weakly say up at him, flailing and kicking to no avail. It only produces a giggle from Kyle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t come up with something good for me I\u2019m gonna start smothering you with my balls,\u201d he retorts, sticking out his tongue. With that, he reaches down and effortlessly pulls you loose from the adhesive bandage on his shaft. The adhesive thrown away, you fall to the mattress with a thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you weakly roll over and look up, you see Kyle\u2019s enormous testicles sprawled out in front of you like giant steep hillsides. \u201cDude, I\u2019ve got ALL weekend. And I won\u2019t smother you out just once, and when you wake up, I\u2019ll just sit them back on top of you and smother you again, over and over, until you come up with a GOOD plan. I can sit here and play my Gameboy all day while you\u2019re smothering down there,\u201d he adds, with a huge, bratty little brother grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that\u2019s how it is. At this point your only hope of being anything besides your own little brother\u2019s tiny slave for the rest of your life is for your mom and dad to catch him, and he knows this.

You didn\u2019t know why getting you off bought him so much pleasure. He always looked so bored while doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings had gotten slightly better in the last few months. Sure, you were played with like a toy, and still helpless and weak, but after so much effort and hard work, Kyle had stopped mocking you at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were there to help him with his homework. When he bathed you tred water in the bath and told him how great he was. When some kids at school were rude to him, you stayed up with him planning the best way to handle it. He even fed you that night, without making you jump for scraps in the palm of his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, Kyle yawned as you came. You hated his thumb and how he abused you with it, but again, gritted your teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle kept you naked so there was no way to hide what his thumb did to you. One night he spent twelve hours trying to prove how many times he could \u201cmake it happen\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm... I have a long day today... soccer later too. I\u2019m going to... keep you\u201d Kyle smiled, before going to fetch the rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was wearing a shirt that exposed you today. He didn\u2019t care. You knew better then to move or scream for help when he walked with you down the halls. And the one time you had screamed to be seen by your parents, they hadn\u2019t even heard you. Kyle had covered you in honey for that offence, and taken you into the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019d watched and dangled you over ants nests. Smiled as you begged for forgiveness.

Like Kyle, they enjoyed skateboarding, video-games, soccer, and junk food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlond-haired Nathan had celebrated his 13th birthday five weeks earlier, and he had already hit his growth spurt.

I'm not some toy for your friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SURE,\" Kyle said with his expression set in a smirk. \"GO AHEAD.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAjay poked at the tiny guy and nearly bowled him over.

After what he\u2019s already put you through?<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe\u2019ll probably find some way of keeping you a secret from your parents on his own anyway. Despite this, the very thought of knowing you HELPED him seal your fate\u2026 the thought of going through the rest of your life being smashed and smothered and by his enormous erect penis, hidden from the world in his underpants, seeing him grinning down at you, knowing you actually HELPED him keep you that way\u2026 it leaves you with only one choice:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s NO WAY I\u2019m gonna help you keep me like this,\u201d you say up to him.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSo you\u2019d prefer to be smothered under my balls then?\u201d he quickly retorts. With a sudden movement he scoots forward, and suddenly your tiny form is dwarfed by his enormous testicles, looming over you threateningly. \u201cCause I\u2019m gonna do it!\u201d he says in his obnoxious, bratty little brother voice.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou see his enormous penis begin to throb, and while it had become a bit more flaccid over the last few minutes, you see it\u2019s already becoming thicker, and is nearly horizontal after a moment or two of making this threat. Clearly, he\u2019s enjoying the prospect of going through with this.<br>\r\n\u201cKyle, I\u2019m NOT gonna help you!\u201d you yell up at him defiantly.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOkay then!\u201d he says with a boyish snicker, which continues and becomes muffled as he quickly scoots forward. You\u2019re suddenly covered entirely by a ceiling of soft, squishy flesh, heat and darkness, you tiny, broken body covered up and pressed helplessly into the mattress where you had just been deposited a moment ago. You begin to push against the wall of flesh, which does have some give, but no matter how hard you push or thrash some more always finds a way onto your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s incredibly effective. You can\u2019t breathe at all. You can\u2019t hope to. You kick and thrash with all your energy, causing giant Kyle to shift his weight around on you mockingly. After only about ten seconds, which feels like a lifetime, you see light as Kyle\u2019s fingers reach down and lift up his testicles from the front. Tears are running down your eyes so it\u2019s hard to see, but you gasp and fill your lungs with all the precious air you can.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSooo\u2026 got any ideas yet?\u201d giant Kyle laughs, leaning down and getting his freckled face into your vision. You don\u2019t respond, you just lay there anticipating what\u2019s about to come next. \u201cGuess not,\u201d he grins, releasing his fingers and letting his enormous testicle fall back down onto you, knocking the breath out of you. You hold your breath as long as you can, but it\u2019s not long before your lungs are screaming for air.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTen seconds pass. Twenty seconds. Forty. You hear muffled whistlingcoming from high above, intermixed with the sound of a heartbeat and rushing blood. You\u2019re panicking. There\u2019s absolutely no way to get air, and the person in charge of letting you breathe has the mind of a 10-year-old. Any movement you make only results in you burning more oxygen, and is met with a snicker as you pleasure your giant sibling. Even so, in your panic, you begin to thrash for air.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou\u2019re met with another glimpse of light as your face is finally uncovered and you\u2019re met with the wonderful gift of fresh air. You fill your lungs, gasping, over and over. You look up to see gigantic Kyle holding his enormous testicles off of you again, grinning down with his obnoxious bratty little brother face just as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about now?\u201d he says with a confident smile. You really don\u2019t want to go through that again. You don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever held your breath that long before, not on purpose, or underwater, or anything. It was so painful. You wonder if Kyle really knows just how torturous this is for you. \u201cThat was TWO MINUTES. You ready to help me? If not I\u2019m gonna go get my Gameboy and some snacks,\u201d he adds, mockingly shaking his torso to move his fully stiff, erect penis around above you. You can\u2019t lie, with all the power he has over you now, this fight seems pretty hopeless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no. You have to hold on. The only hope you have is your parents catching him, and that\u2019s not going to happen if you start working with him to ENSURE that doesn\u2019t happen. In fact, two or three fairly fool-proof schemes he could use to keep you hidden away permanently have already formulated in your mind, despite intentionally trying not to think of any. Sometimes you regret being so smart.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nActually, yeah looking up, at your power mad little brother who has decided to make you a toy for his private parts\u2026 yeah you definitely regret it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, whatever!\u201d he grins, as you don\u2019t reply. The bed shakes and bounces, throwing you around, as massive Kyle hops up. You can\u2019t help but watch his enormous, naked body, his naked butt, and erect bouncing penis, as he leaves his room to venture into the empty house to go round up some snacks. You\u2019re barely half-an-inch tall, beaten, recently smothered, and completely exhausted on the near center of his mattress. He\u2019s pretty confident he\u2019ll be back before you can get far.</span></div></div>",

You had played that game for countless hours and would never let him touch it before. He must have stole it from your room. Not that it really matters in relation to current matters, but looking at the delighted, all powerful grin on your brother\u2019s face it\u2019s just the icing on the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyle, I won\u2019t tell Mom or Dad what you did to me, just help me!\u201d you say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response he just sticks out his tongue and tilts his hand to the side, sending you plummeting with a thud back onto his mattress. With a bounce and a quick roll you find yourself on your back again, but it\u2019s not like you have a chance in hell at escaping, as naked Kyle\u2019s massive legs almost immediately close in around you. He sits down cross-legged, trapping you between his legs, mockingly scooting forward so that his junk is hovering threatening above you. He takes a moment to get the Gameboy set up and puts your favorite game in the slot. Then Kyle begins to scoot forward. His massive penis is already about halfway erect, while his huge, suffocating balls are inching closer and closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning down from ear to ear, he takes one last look down as he scoots all the way on top of you, and just like that, you\u2019re lost underneath his scrotum in the soft, squishy, suffocating darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t want to panic, but there\u2019s not really any choice in the matter when you\u2019re being deprived of precious air. The more you struggle, the faster you burn oxygen, and the more you hear your massive brother giggling at you tickling his scrotum. \u201cI\u2019ve got to stop it! I\u2019m just pleasuring him!\u201d you think to yourself\u2026 but in this irrational, incredible pain you can\u2019t stop clawing and fighting to escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the burning in your lungs grows\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026you scream muffled, terrified screams for SOME mercy\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026SOME relief from this hell\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all you hear is snickering laughter, as Kyle shifts his weight around on top of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026.</span></div></div>",

You open your eyes to see the huge, smiling face of Kyle, upside as before, as he has lifted his enormous testicles up off of you and is leaning down into your vision. The cordless phone is pressed up to his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don\u2019t remember him lifting them off of you. You must have completely passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad to hear you two are finally getting along!\u201d you hear your mother\u2019s distant, delighted voice from the other end of the line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...Mooom!,\u201d you cry in pure despiration, reaching your trembling hands toward the sound of her voice, praying that she can somehow hear you. But deep down you know better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m winning BIG TIME,\u201d he says, scrunching his nose up at you, knowing there\u2019s not a damn thing you can do about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWill you two be okay if we stay an extra few days? Tell your brother he can use my credit card if he needs to, it should be in the top drawer of my bed-stand,\u201d you hear your mom say.

I've got a lot of games I want to play with Brandon,\u201d he says, as he grins his bratty grin and releases his fingers, letting his gigantic testicles fall back down, smashing and smothering you back down into the hellish darkness again. You immediately lose your senses, and reflexively start struggling and fighting. You do this despite in the back of your mind knowing all you\u2019re doing is pleasuring him. You wish with all your heart for your mom to ask to talk to you, so that maybe, just maybe he\u2019ll slip up and get caught in this lie. But as your brother\u2019s massive body wiggles back and forth mockingly on top of you, you hear the muffled conversation come to an end without further mention of you, and the phone beep, with your lungs still burning in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026Excruciating seconds pass, with you hearing the muffled sounds of the Gameboy beeping\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026and the crunching and chewing of chips\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026as the cold, crushing, darkness of suffocation slowly begins to pull you away\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...hmm hmm hmm hmm!\u201d Kyle hums.  You awaken, both horrified and frustrated to find yourself in the exact same situation as before, but now even MORE tired and exhausted, something you thought wasn\u2019t possible. His huge freckled face is again upside down in your vision as he holds his gigantic balls up off of you. \u201cThis is fun!\u201d he grins. \u201cHey, before we go again, do you know where I need to go to find the Maximo Potion in the first part of the game? I don\u2019t know where it is and I can\u2019t get anywhere without it,\u201d he says, finally scooting back. With you out of the way, he lets his testicles fall down in front of you, taking hold of his fully erect penis and stroking it unabashedly, as he looks down at your tiny, helpless form, waiting for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the cave in the north of Ceslia\u2026 you have to talk to an old man in there to get it\u2026 \u201d you say, in a mix of anger and tears, as Kyle leans down closely to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve already been there I thought...\u201d he says, looking back at the Gameboy in his other hand.  \u201cOh, wait, there\u2019s another cave!\u201d he finally says. \u201cThanks bug!\u201d he adds, before releasing his penis and beginning to scoot forward again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKyle please!\u201d you cry, helpless to stop him as he thoughtlessly slides his scrotum back on top of you. You\u2019re horrified at how casual this has become for him so quickly. \u201cPlease... please... I\u2019m your brother...\u201d you cry to yourself, more than anything else, trying to convince yourself it\u2019s still true.</span></div></div>",

It took a second for you to notice that Kyle was standing up, making you nervous as you look around his giant room, still breathing hard from being deprived of fresh air for so long!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" you ask, in an exhausted, frightened voice. Kyle just giggles as he starts to walk out of the room, \"Where are you going?\" you shout up to him, sweating profusely as you feel him suddenly turn to enter the bathroom. Oh no.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The last time I left you alone you tried to run away, so you're not leaving my sight for a second!\" He finally spoke as he walked up to the toilet, using the hand you were held in to grip his boyhood, pressing you hard into it as he let loose. The sound and vibrations his cock made as he relieved himself were haunting. When he was done he wiped his slit with some tissue before flushing, then he looked down at you and asked, \"By the way, I'm stuck again in the game, I don't know where to go.\" He said, bringing you back to his room while idly stroking himself with his free hand, wondering why it felt so good to touch it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got back into the position he was in before, but he didn't pin you under his sack this time, he crossed his legs and put you in the open space between them, right next to his gigantic genitals! He lowers the Gameboy down so you could see the screen too, you knew immediately where he was in the game, and where to go from there to continue. You think to yourself for a moment though, \"Why am I helping him?\" as he asks you to point him in the right direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould you help him, despite the fact that he'll probably stuff you under his balls anyway?</span></div></div>",

You're awake,\" he snickered. I thought I might have clobbered you a bit too hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle, you could have really hurt me,\" you complain. In fact, based on the way your head aches, you're fairly confident you may have a mild concussion. \"You need to stop this and help me get...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle interrupts as he finishes attaching your tiny cube to his necklace. He lifts the cube, and you, up to his face. \"This is the perfect way to keep you very close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep me close!\" You burn with outrage and hurl your right shoulder against the wall, only succeeding in giving your already battered body another bruise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDangling from the chain, you watch two fingers from his free hand come up and pinch the cube. \"I could just crush you instead,\" Kyle threatens. To demonstrate, he does apply some force and you hear, or imagine you hear, cracks developing in the transparent walls of the cube.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, please don't!\" You cry out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stops instantly and smiles. \"Don't worry...

That dark urge he had felt earlier was quickly returning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy was battling with long and short term satisfaction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis brain had registered the small creature on the floor as a bug. It's default response was to crush it right then and there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was also trying to convince himself to keep you alive so that he may enjoy this fun forever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was even a very very small part of his conscience that kept nagging him in the furthermost recesses of his mind. It was the part that still cared about you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys heart started to beat loudly in his chest. Something had to give. He needed to stop this internal conflict now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to lower his foot back onto you, your form directly under the balls of his right foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were finally getting re-balanced, the massive foot pinned you down once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cursed out loud as you truly thought that it was finally over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it\" Kyle thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could crush him right now!\" Just thinking it to himself sent a massive jolt of pleasure through his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel his older sibling's soggy struggles for survival. The sweat on the floor had cooled along with the tiny teen, making the experience even more enjoyable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in his desire to feel more, he began to put more pressure on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHH!! KYLEEEEE! STOP! THIS HUURTS! KYLE!\" Your plea was smothered by the moist sole on top of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nine year old could still hear you though; It made him whimper with guilty pleasure as he pressed the foot down harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ky...KY...\" You could no longer breathe. You felt a few of your bones starting to give out as the pressure became unbearable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll it would take is one more indulgent press and you'd be paste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye bye little bug..\" The boy whispered quietly as his foot muscles tensed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRUNCH* The sound was almost inaudible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm\" the boy hummed as his toes curled with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally lifting his colossal foot, the only thing left of you was a red blotch on wooden floor and his plump sole<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe propped his leg up on his other knee and just stared at it. Relishing the fact that he had just crushed an entire person as if they were an insect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot just any person either, his older brother. The one who had always treated him as if HE were the small one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remained missing for weeks, then months, and eventually years to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle ended up getting your room, as he wished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven by the time he was 15, Kyle would sometimes masturbate to the memories what he had done.

HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?!\" You cried with anger and sadness over the destruction of your only way back to normal size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy only smirked as he leaned his face close to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehe, because I CAN!\" Kyle was practically speaking an inch away from your trembling form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour chest is then hit with a small splash of saliva as the boy speaks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"eugh!!\" You frantically attempt to wipe off, only to have it cover your entire hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle giggled at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were kneeling down to wipe your sticky saliva-coated hand onto the kitchen table, a large shadow is cast over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your horror, Kyle's head was now hovering directly over you. He had a cruel yet innocent gleam in his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy began puckering his lips as a long gooey strand of saliva started to ooz from his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!!! STOP!!!!!\" You shout frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attempt to run, only to smash straight into the side of one of Kyle's hands, which quickly cupped itself around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T DO THIS!! PLEASE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were in no position to stop him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy hummed playfully as the clear gooey saliva continued to descend down onto your position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember how he had attempted to do this to you when you were sleeping once. Luckily, you were able to wake up just before he had a chance to succeed. You had given him a good spanking for that one... but now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperately trying to escape his hand,  you suddenly felt the warm gooey strand make contact with your shoulder. You helplessly attempt to hit it away, only to have your entire arm adhere to it. You can only scream as more continued to pour down onto you, quickly enveloping the rest of your body as it pooled down at your feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above you could hear Kyle humming with laughter at the sight of you nearly drowning in a mouthful of his own saliva. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle began to wonder whether or not he could pull the saliva back up into his mouth like he usually does. Without giving it another thought, the boy started to greedily suck saliva back through his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel a pull as the saliva began to carry you skyward. You scream as the world around you plummets, looking up to see the massive boyish face quickly approaching. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SLuuuurrrrrp!* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYLE!!! PLEASE STO-...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one final slurp, you're sent rocketing through the young boy's lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were now laying on your younger brother's hot quivering tongue. Attempting to pull yourself up, you quickly find that it's nearly impossible to move. Your whole body was completely soaked with the thick fluid, your entire form had now totally cohered to the massive tasting organ. \"PLEASE LET ME OUT OF HERE!!!!\" You cried fearfully. The inside of the boy's mouth was like a warm gooey cavern, completely covered with layer after layer of never-ending saliva.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle had heard your cries, but it only made him want to play with you even more. Here he was, with his older brother trapped in his MOUTH, practically swimming in his own saliva. The amount of power he felt over you was incredible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for Kyle to begin to wonder what you actually tasted like. He playfully rolled your small form from side to side with his saliva coated tasting muscle, sucking you for every last bit of flavor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cried out in pain due to the friction between your body and the roof of the boy's mouth.  It was as if you were being treated like a human jolly rancher.  The boy giggled at the feeling of your tiny struggles across his warm tongue.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mmmm\" the 8 year old hummed.  You actually didn't taste that bad...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Kyle had the sudden urge to swallow you.  It was only natural after all. You were in his mouth, and you were tasty; that certainly registered as food to Kyle's brain. Just the idea swallowing his big brother whole made the boy's entire body tingle.  He closed his eyes as he tried to imagine what it would be like from your perspective. The way you would frantically scream as his massive tongue carried you to he back of his hungry mouth. The way you would desperately beg for him not to swallow you as your legs dangled over the entrance of his throat. Then... all it would take is one greedy .....gulp. ..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle let out a low \"mmmm~\" as he engrossed himself in the short fantasy. His imagination alone was causing the inside of his mouth to water more then usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Kyle's eyes quickly opened as he snapped back to reality. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[I'll finish off this route  if someone asks for it -NEDM]<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The features and his expression looked weirdly distorted. Brandon tried looking at a different angle and got the same result. Slowly, realization dawned on the unfortunate sibling. Kyle had dropped him into the empty fish bowl, the same home that had once house Barry, the Siamese Fighting Fish, long deceased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon shuddered as he remembered that they had sent Barry off to his reward with a flush down the toilet. \"If...if I can't endure much more of this, will that be how I end up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHY SO GLUM?\" Kyle asked. \"YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF ROOM.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Brandon surveyed the glass bowl, which seemed the size of a sports dome, he had to agree with Kyle's assessment. Plenty of room and no possible means of scaling the smooth glass walls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, Kyle. Let me out,\" Brandon begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I TOLD YOU NOT TO TALK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You asked me why I look so glum,\" Brandon defended himself quickly. \"I'm trying to explain to you. Would you be happy kept a prisoner in a damn fish bowl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN A NICER BROTHER.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least he's acknowledging your relationship to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" Brandon agreed readily, anything to get Kyle to free him and perhaps help him repair the machine. \"I'm so sorry. Please, can't you forgive me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'LL THINK ABOUT IT,\" Kyle said and shoved you and the entire bowl way beneath his bed. The younger brother had anticipated that one of his parents might come in his room and notice tiny Brandon in the bowl. This way, Brandon remained out of sight, but Kyle could pull the bowl out any time he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon sat in the dark, entrapped by glass walls, and cried in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For a moment there he almost actually......swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the boy placed his right hand outside his lips,  ready to catch his tiny 'big bro', something stopped him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring the tiny, yet noticeable struggles in his mouth, Kyle was hit with a dark yet tempting realization.  If he really wanted to... he could make his fantasy REAL.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy's hand began to slowly lower back down as he weighed his options. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp until this point,  he was only playing around and teasing, much the way brothers normally would. Still, Kyle knew very well that he was one gulp away from changing his life forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle smiled.  He couldn't deny, it was tempting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nbut It was then that all the fond memories of you two getting along started to surface. All the times you would play video games with him. When you helped him home after he scrapped his leg outside. ect<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle frowned as he was now feeling a pinch of guilt. The boy's conscience was being pulled in two directions. Every time he thought he had made up is mind, another memory tipped the scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it seemed like he would never make up his mind, the reasons that justified swallowing you quickly began to overwhelm his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd get his room\"<br>\r\n\"I'd get his games\"<br>\r\n\"I'd never get pushed around by him ever again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy's smile began to reform as the temptations continued to build on one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the good things you ever did for him in the past were immediately thrown out as Kyle began to make room for his selfish desires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't realize it from within the 8 year old's mouth, but Kyle's desire to swallow you was no longer just a playful thought, he REALLY wanted this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy's eyes shifted nervously around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(No one was around....No one would even know)\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it. Left to his own devices, Kyle's mind was made. He couldn't help being a bit impulsive, he was only eight after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously tilting his head up, Kyle scrunched his eyes closed and.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were too busy struggling in the thick goopy saliva to realize what was about to occur. At least not until after the loud wet<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*GULP*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's neck bobbed slightly. After a moment that seemed to last forever, he slowly opened his eyes......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D..........D-did I really just do that?\" Kyle asked innocently. The reality that he had actually just swallowed his brother still hadn't hit him. The boy looked down at his torso with wide eyes. His expression of awe quickly turned into a huge grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you were writhing in horror as you slid down the giant boy's throat, never to see light ever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long before Kyle forgot about you. He was too busy enjoying being an only child. Though, there were still times when memories of you would surface. A smirk would form on his face before taking a bite of food.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Aren't you interested in what it's like to be small?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were kind of taken caught off guard by the sudden question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hmm\" you think to yourself.

It's not like you'd be shrinking yourself again after this is all over..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"well...I guess, but only for another hour!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge smile beamed off of Kyle's face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yaaay!\" He cheered.

I keep forgetting how BIG everything must be for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were already starting to feel mild regret for allowing this to continue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what should we do? What kind of game should we play?\" The young boy's excited voice nearly pushes you over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll definitely want to avoid doing anything too physical at this size.\" You think to yourself as you look at the clock on your dresser.  It's then that you realize that it's almost about dinner time. You decide that your safest option would be to eat. Besides, you were kinda fascinated by the idea of eating food many times your size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about we have dinner?\" You make the request, hoping he takes the bait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately, you hear Kyle's stomach rumble from behind his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I'm starving!\" He says while placing you on the bed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go get some food from the kitchen!\" He runs out of the room, causing a back-draft that nearly knocks you over for what seemed like the hundredth time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that point that you remembered that he had left the machine on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! If only he put me on the floor before he left\" you think to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long you hear the sound of his feet running back up the staircase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly start to worry that he might forget about the machine on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, he had JUST placed it there\" You think to yourself reassuringly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you finish that thought, Kyle comes bounding around the door way and directly towards the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh no.....\" Your heart stops as you notice that he's not even looking at the floor. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You grumble with annoyance after landing back onto the soft mattress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle! What did I say about being careful?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I brought cookies!\" He exclaimed happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You weren't sure if he didn't hear, or was just deliberately ignoring you (something he was never able to get away with when you were bigger)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C...cookies? for dinner?\" you ask in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! I've always wanted to have cookies for dinner!\" He said as he turned your TV on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a reason you don't have cookies for dinner! It's not healthy!\" You knew no matter what you said, he was still going to eat them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned the channel to cartoon network <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! Gumball is on!\" He hopped a little bit in his seat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter regaining your balance you decided to climb the plate. It was a definitely not the type plate you'd use to be eating cookies off of. We usually use these plates for steak dinners. You assume that for Kyle, formal things like that aren't really important. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pulling yourself up onto the plate, you stare off in amazement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was entirely covered by a massive pile of chocolate chip cookies, each cookie layering over one another. The smell of chocolate was almost intoxicating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, here!\" Kyle said as he began to pull all the cookies to his side of the plate. He then placed one cookie on your side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There! That can be your cookie, and the rest can be mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hardly had any objection, it was not like you could possibly finish off even a quarter of one of those cookies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as Kyle took a cookie out of his pile and brought it into his mouth. You found it oddly amazing that he was able to fit the whole cookie inside as he began chewing. You probably wouldn't have even thought about it had you been your normal size. Heck, you'd be able to do the same thing. (\"Something about being this small really puts things into perspective.\") You think to yourself in wonder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MMMMM YUMMY!\" The boy chimed with his mouth full and eyes closed, savoring the delicious cookie as he chewed. The once circular treat meeting it's ultimate end in the moist cavern. Kyle tilted his head back happily, releasing an almost cute sounding *GULP* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were amazed again when Kyle was already reaching for his second cookie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(\"wow, he must have really been hungry\") You thought to yourself as you begin to walk up to your trampoline sized cookie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell was even more intense up close. You reach out and try to pull a peace off. After a moment of struggle, you were able to break off literally a crumb. You happily began stuffing your face with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mmmm\" You hummed as you chewed,  \"it actually tastes better when you're small\" You hum to yourself happily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kyle was preoccupied with his favorite cartoon. Judging by the pile of his cookies, he's probably downed nearly half of them already, and he didn't seem to show any sign of stopping either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou attempt to pull another crumb off of your cookie but can't seem to pick it out. A good five minutes go by as you circle your cookie, trying to find a loose piece.  Eventually, just as you're about to give up, you notice a rather broken looking crumb sitting on the center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still hungry and it didn't seem like you had any other choice. You slowly started to climb over the edge of the cookie, beginning your walk towards the center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was finally reaching for his last cookie which he happily picked up and stuffed his face with, giggling at a scene from the cartoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reached the breakable looking piece and began your excavation.  After two or three pulls you were able to yank it right out, falling over as you did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle, who was still engrossed in his cartoon began to reach over for another cookie, not realizing that his pile had already been finished. His hand darted back and forth across his side of the plate until the tip of one of his fingers tapped your cookie. Without giving it any thought, Kyle grabbed the cookie and started to bring it back to his hungry mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were startled as the world around you began to shake and a huge gust of wind knocked you flat on your face. It was then that you heard a loud crunching noise coming from in front of you. Being confused as to what was happening, you lifted your head to see something horrifying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before you was Kyle's massive lips. He was still chewing away at his previous cookie. His eyes completely focused on the TV in front of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sickening sloppy sounds of his chewing eventually stopped as he tilted his head back slightly. It was then that his throat emitted a horrifyingly loud, wet gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYLE!!!!!\" you began to scream at the top of your lungs. The sound of the television was completely drowning you out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch in horror as your kid-brother opens his impossibly large mouth. You're instantly hit with the aroma of chewed up cookies. You can see wet remnants of previous cookies scattered across his tongue and teeth. Three large strands of saliva connected from the top of his mouth to the bottom. His massive pulsating tongue wriggled as if in anticipation for the next treat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYLE NOOOO! STOP! I'M DOWN HERE! I'M ON THE COOKIE!! DON'T EAT ME!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle however wasn't listening for whatever his cookie had to say. Why would he? It was only a cookie after all.  Kyle's only interest was watching his show and enjoying his snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream the loudest you've ever screamed in your life as the shadow of the 10 year old's mouth began to slowly pass over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He must have been able to hear your final scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes dart around the room and towards the empty plate, confusingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was never that quick when it came to moments like this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of being worried, the boy simply assumed that you had finished off your cookie and were now playfully hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small smirk appeared across the left side of the giant mouth as he re-initiated chewing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his lips closed, there was no way he could hear you anymore. Your only hope was that he would open his mouth for just long enough that you could shout to him your location.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're now completely soaked with the boy's gooey enzymes as he continues to chew from side to side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looks under the plate<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe saliva and cookie mixes, causing you to get stuck a massive blob of chocolate chip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle looks under the pillows<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYLE!! GET ME OUT OF HERE!! HELP MEEE!!!!!\" You screamed in desperation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for you, Kyle was too self-assured in his hide-and-seek abilities to ask for help. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blob slowly made it's way to the back of his mouth, ready to be swallowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you're yelling at the top of your lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's at that moment when Kyle spots the last possible place on the bed that you could be hiding. A small container that you kept the apple in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly reaches for the apple container; Licking his lips in anticipation of finding his brother, all while simultaneously proving that he is the best at hide-and-seek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle pulls open the lid, but only ends up discovering that the container was completely empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDisappointed, Kyle finally sends the delicious cookie glob down his throat with yet another loud, wet gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"KYYYYYYYYYLLLEEeeeeee-.........................  . .    .    . \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slightly visible lump travels down his neck and into his young developing body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww! Where are you???\" Kyle asked disappointingly, finally giving up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think you can hide from me!\" the boy chimed charismatically as he searched the house for the rest of the night, only making the digestive process faster..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou kicked and screamed at the stomach walls, fighting for your life. Kyle would occasionally feel a tickle in his belly, but simply passed it off as nothing as he continued his search. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cried as the Kyle's digestive system began to burn your skin away, eventually melting you into a soup of nutrition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle eventually called it quits and went to sleep.

THE MACHINE!!!!\" <br>\r\nThe boy was too far away to make out or hear your pleas as his massive socked feet slapped across the hardwood floor. <br>\r\nYou could only watch in terror as his right foot lifted into the air, casting a shadow on the machine below. <br>\r\n\"KYYYYYYYYYYYYLEEEEEEE!!!!\" You made one final scream as the foot began to descend on the small object. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRUNCH* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact of his foot was so great that the whole machine was crushed instantly. <br>\r\nKyle's expression turned to confusion as he came to a halt, wondering what he had just stepped on.<br>\r\n\"A dorito?\" The boy thought to himself as he looked down on the floor. <br>\r\nKyle stood still and looked down at the flattened pile of scrap between his feet.<br>\r\nIt only took a moment for Kyle to realize what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....oops\" he whispered guiltily, much like any boy his age would after making a mistake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn't just a mistake though. That simple action had great consequences. <br>\r\nKyle sorrowfully lifted his head towards the bed, prodding his index fingers together in shame.<br>\r\nYou were no longer standing. The moment the machine was crushed you fell to your knees. Your vision was blurry with tears. You could only slightly make out the massive shadow of your brother standing over where the machine once sat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I'm sorry..\" Kyle was genuinely apologetic. He began to walk towards the bed with a bowl of cereal. <br>\r\nThe boy sat down next to you. He didn't really know what he should do. <br>\r\n\"M-maybe you can build another one\" He said in an attempts to raise your spirits, while at the same time trying make light of what he had just done. <br>\r\nYou shook your head slowly. \"No... it would be impossible at this size\" you thought to yourself. <br>\r\n\"errrm, I brought us cereal!\" the boy decided to change the subject, still not truly understanding the impact of his carelessness. <br>\r\n\"Had he just let me see the machine earlier. Had I just not agreed with him\"  You begin to wonder to yourself if the eleven year old had any intention of allowing you to get back to normal in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's lucky charms!\" Kyle said as he nudged the massive bowl towards you. <br>\r\nYour only hope was that your parents would be able to find someone who could read your blueprints and assemble a new one. Even then, there were still a few details that only you yourself knew. <br>\r\n\"Common Brandon! eat!\" Despite the terrible thing he had done, your sibling was now growing impatient with you. <br>\r\nYou cringed as saw the shadow of Kyle's hand envelope you. You didn't resist. The act of being picked up didn't phase you anymore. <br>\r\nKyle dropped you on the circular ledge of the bowl. For a moment you almost lost balance and plunged into the milk soaked lucky charms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yourself were starting to get a little ticked off at this point. <br>\r\nKyle could tell that you were still feeling a little down, so decided to turn on the television to make you feel better. At least that's what he thought in his mind. He quickly turned to cartoon network, knowing very well that you stopped watching cartoons a long time ago. <br>\r\nIt didn't take long for the boy to become engrossed.<br>\r\nYou just sat there, hugging your legs, tucking your face into your knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Kyle started laughing at a scene from one of his favorite cartoons.  He reached for the spoon and began to chow down on the cereal. <br>\r\nYour anger continued to grow as you were splashed with milk each time Kyle lowered the spoon into the bowl. Kyle laughed again, a chunk of chewed cereal flew from his mouth, hitting against you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it...\"<br>\r\nYou began to get up, getting ready to scream at the top of your lungs.<br>\r\nYou didn't notice the puddle of milk that had formed at your feet as you shifted yourself into a standing position.<br>\r\nYour foot slipped, causing you to lose your balance on the narrow platform. You waved your arms desperately, but it was too late. <br>\r\n\"Gauaahhh!\" you screamed as you fell face-first into the milky cereal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*SPLASH*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGHHh!\" you wiped the milk out of your eyes as you checked your surroundings. You frantically began a short swim in the milk until you found something colorful to grab onto. You were now hanging on to one of the many marshmallows floating around the bowl. <br>\r\nYou looked up in horror to find that your brother was still watching the TV. He has yet to even notice that you fell from the bowl.<br>\r\n\"KYYYYYLLLEE!!\" you screamed the loudest you could. Your voice was completely drowned out by the television. Kyle was just finished swallowing a mouthful of cereal. You began to panic as the boy started to lower the spoon for more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily the spoon had landed on the other side of the large bowl. You watched in fear as the spoon picked up around 9 pieces of cereal, all around the same size as the marshmallow you're floating on.  You continue to watch as he effortlessly lifted the spoon to his open mouth, enveloping the entire spoon easily. With a loud slurp, the boy pulls the metal utensil out from his lips. <br>\r\nYou look around you for a way out. The milk level was still high enough for you to perhaps reach and pull yourself onto the rim. Unfortunately all of Kyle's spoonfuls have caused you to drift close to the center of cereal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFueled by fear and will-power, you began to climb up onto the marshmallow, hopping across the cereal as quickly as you can. You fall a two times before realize you were too late. Between the time you began, up to the second time you fell, Kyle had taken five spoonfuls; enough to lower the milk level to a point that you didn't stand a chance of reaching. Kyle's continued interaction was also causing you to be pulled back to the center. <br>\r\n\"There has to be another way..there has to be-\" You desperately search as Kyle's spoon descents upon you. You don't even have time to react as the waves of the milk knock you to your knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world around you begins to blur as the spoon is lifted to Kyle's moist lips. <br>\r\nIt was impossible to keep balance on the marshmallow as you attempted to wave and shout as loud as you could. The boy's chewing alone was far louder than your screams could ever be. <br>\r\nYou could only watch in terror as Kyle tilted his head slightly, emitting a loud wet gulp. A small bulge visibly traveled down his neck, right past his collar bone. His tongue slurped around the outside of his lips, licking up whatever milk had accidentally been left behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle didn't open his mouth immediately, he was busy laughing at a funny scene in the cartoon he was watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared up at his happy boyish face. His skin was still baby smooth, his eye glimmered with youth and innocence. It was a face you knew too well. He was your little brother. You watched him grow up. You consoled him when he hurt himself. You taught him so much about life. He happily consumed every answer to every question he gave you... and now..<br>\r\nThe nice viewed quickly changed as he began to open his mouth wide for the next bite. <br>\r\nYou've seen the inside of his mouth many times before. You have a memory of looking into it in order to check if he swallowed his vitamins.<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n\"Open up! Let me see if you swallowed them!\" you spoke with a sense of responsibility.<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhhhh\" The young boy vocalized cutely as you examined the inside of his mouth.<br>\r\n\"Alright, good!\" You tussled his hair as he smiled.<br>\r\n-----------<br>\r\n Back then, from a normal perspective, it looked so harmless and innocent, but now....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of his massive mouth was littered with massive bits of chewed cereal the size of basketballs. Strands of thick milky saliva quivered from the top of his mouth to the bottom. His massive tongue wriggling with anticipation for the next delicious spoonful. It was like something from a nightmare. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou screamed as the spoon began to pass his wet lips. Drops of gooey saliva started to descend onto the spoon as it made it's entrance. The scent of chewed cereal was absolutely inescapable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYYYYYYYYYYLLLLLLLLEEEEEE!!!!!!!!! STOOOOOOOoOOO-----\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour voice is silenced as his lips close over the handle of the spoon. <br>\r\n\"mmmmmmm\" Kyle hummed as he slid the spoon back out. His lips completely puckered to the spoon, as to make sure nothing was left behind. <br>\r\nWith a small -pop- the spoon was free.<br>\r\nYou're thrown around the boy's mouth from side-to-side. Each of your screams are cut off every time a splash of milky saliva mix hits you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cereal around you is eventually turned to mush. You manage to avoid being crushed by his molars, only to get stuck in the sticky bolus of cereal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle begins to laugh again while his mouth was still still full. You reach your hand out towards the light entering his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKYLEEEE!! PLEASE!!! I'M IN HERE!!!!!!! KYLEEEEEEEE!!! DON'T EAT ME!!!!!! -----\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light is cut off as Kyle takes a deafening  wet GULP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile on the outside, Kyle's show had finally ended. He stretched his arms up into the air as he fell back onto the bed, happily rubbing his belly. <br>\r\nHe looks up to find that you were no longer on the ledge of the bowl, which was now empty and practically dripping with milk. <br>\r\nKyle quickly assumed that you were still mad at him and went off somewhere else. <br>\r\nHe considered to go looking for you, but inevitably decides he'd rather take a nap instead. <br>\r\nHe cuddles up onto his side, closing his eyes with a small content smile on his face, a small drip of milk slowly drying across the side of his mouth. <br>\r\nHis belly gurgled as it began to digest his yummy meal. <br>\r\nWeeks, months, and years passed, after you went missing. <br>\r\nEven by the time he was your age, Kyle never realized that he had unknowingly swallowed you on that one fateful night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kyle's door sized fingers enclosed around you with their warmth as your whole body was pressed into the boy's fleshy palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe G-force of being pulled upwards made you slightly dizzy for a moment, though it only lasted for a second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight quickly broke through the spaces between Kyle's fingers as he spread open his palm nearly two inches away from his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tumbled over onto warm bumpy surface; The smell of Kyle's sweet syrupy breath now completely enveloping you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously, you slowly began to look up at his enormously innocent smiling face; totally brimming with awe from ear-to-ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something enrapturing about it to you. It's weird. Back when you were still normal sized, you never got this feeling when you looked at your little brother's face. Something about your new-found size and perspective must have really changed the way you looked at things. To you, Kyle literally looked like an all-powerful boy god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woooow! you hardly even weigh anything!\" Kyle playfully jolted his hand up and down, causing you to go air-born two or three times. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alight! alright!....\" you groan as you attempted to stand yourself up again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle giggled at this \"Heh, sorry!\"  The boy squinted his face, sticking his tongue out as he rubbed the side of his head apologetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't help but watch as Kyle's enormous wet tongue obtruded from his adorably moist lips. Words couldn't describe how fascinating it was to simply just watch. It felt so odd to see something so big move so fast and vividly. You almost felt a pinch of disappointment when he pulled it back through his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLittle did you realize that Kyle must have picked up on how you were staring at his mouth. Finding your reaction to be interesting, Kyle slowly stuck his tongue back out and began to dart it back and forth across his lips;  all the while watching you closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking that Kyle was just being goofy, you took the opportunity to watch the entrancing display; your own mouth slightly ajar with intrigue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing only an 10 year old, Kyle was immediately amused by your apparent fascination with what he was doing. He then started to imagine how he himself must have looked from your perspective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... I must look like a GIANT to you..\" Kyle whispered out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately snapped out of the spellbind, slightly blushing in embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what's that supposed to mean?\" you asked, clearly flustered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanna see my tongue? UHHHH?\" Kyle pointed to his mouth as he stuck the massive saliva-coated tasting muscle past his lips once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...Why would I want to do that?\" your face burned with further embarrassment now that you knew your brother was aware of your fascination with his tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've seen your tongue a bunch of times before...\" You were telling the truth, but deep down you really did want to get a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but now you're tiny\" Kyle spoke down to you with a slight giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying another word, Kyle brought his hand up to his drooping tongue which was now hanging from his moist pink lips<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heart started to race. There it was, an arms length away from you. Your eyes widened as you watched it wriggle eagerly; small droplets of saliva slowly dripping down the front of it. You could actually feel the heat coming off of it by just standing there. Gulping with nervousness you started to give into the temptation of getting closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took two steps forward. The massive red surface was like a bumpy wet wall to you. You subconsciously began to reach for it, but quickly pulled your hand back the instant you realized what you were doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(\"...Should I really touch it?...What would Kyle think? Would he even notice?\") You thought to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe enticement was becoming too much. You couldn't just stare at it. Slowly, you began to raise your hand towards the warm wet mass. You took a deep breath and pressed your palm into it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was warmer than you had anticipated. The saliva that was slowly flowing down the pink surface now completely covered your hand. For some reason an odd jolt of pleasure quickly traveled through your body for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, the wall started to quiver slightly as Kyle began to giggle at the feeling of your tiny hand's contact against his tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling your hand back, you simply stared at the gooey substance now coating it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive tongue slurped back into boy's impossibly wide lips as he smiled; a small flow of saliva had dripped down the right side of his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! I didn't think you were going to touch it!\" Kyle chirped gleefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blush returned to your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as Kyle rolled his eyes as he hummed to himself, likely trying to pick up any taste from where you had touched his tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, I don't think I got a good taste\" The boy sighed jokingly with a hint of actual disappointment. He stared down at you as if he was formulating something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Um...Hey.. Close your eyes for a second\" The boy whispered as he brought his lips closer to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could already tell what he was planning. You didn't mind though. Deep down you wanted to continue experimenting with tongue. There was no denying it anymore. Something about this whole situation aroused you somehow. Ever since you touched his tongue, a tightness had been growing in your loins. A part of you felt a little ashamed of having these feelings, but at the same time your desires were pushing you to keep going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle also seemed to be enjoying this, but you assumed it wasn't for the same reason. More likely because he was just enjoying the control and influence he physically had over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even waiting for you to close your eyes, Kyle's enormous tongue drooped out and began to sweep forward across his palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only watch with nervous excitement as it came closer and closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you had time to brace yourself it had already made impact with your body. Your face had now directly pressed into the warm wet wall. Pulling your head back slightly, strands of gooey saliva had formed between you and it's surface, creating a sort of binding tension.  The cohesion made it nearly impossible for you to distance yourself from the wriggling surface. The tongue slurped up, causing your body follow it momentarily due to the stickiness. You opened your eyes slightly to see something incredible not far in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle had pulled his tongue back just enough for you to see see past his lips. The Inside of Kyle's mouth looked like a dark, gooey, wriggling cave. It was at that instant that you felt pure arousal. The feeling of Kyle's thick, warm, wet, gooey tongue against your entire body and the view of the inside of his massive mouth was too much. Your semi-erect cock bobbed against the inside of your soaked shorts.  Just as you were secretly hoping he'd pull you inside, gravity began to peel your body off of the tongue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou experienced a short free-fall as you landed back onto the pink plump platform below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere you laid, sprawled out on your little brother's palm, utterly soaked with the boy's saliva. You had begun panting rapidly due to all the sexual stimulation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above you could hear Kyle humming again, but this time it sounded much more pleased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmmm, for a little person you actually taste kinda good\" Kyle giggled. He was only joking, but his words had a great impact your growing titillation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was having so much fun that he brought his head down to begin licking you some more. You didn't even have time to react as it pinned you down onto your back. You made no effort to resist. Wave after wave of Kyle's licking sent your body into a cyclone of pleasure. You let out a soft whimper as your now fully erect cock was begging to be released from it's confinement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle pulled his face back up and stared at your puny drenched form. All around you Kyle's palm glistened with saliva. The boy was starting to feel a sensation he's never experienced before. It was hard to describe, but it made his body all tingly and warm. The only thing he could safely determine was that it felt good. In his mind, if it felt good, it was good. The sensation caused him to blush a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a deep breath and trying to compose yourself, you attempted steadily balance yourself up into a standing position on the slippery palm below. You still hadn't forgotten that view of inside Kyle's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking of a way to take advantage of Kyle's naivety, you started to formulate a plan. You were in desperate need to get off, and getting inside that mouth was the best way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-hey Kyle...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mm what?\" The boy's eyes were slightly glazed from the new feeling he was experiencing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we play another game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...how about ..cave adventurer...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How do we play?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well.. uh, we find a cave-like place for me to explore..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle still hadn't picked up on what you were suggesting as his eyes darted around the room for cave-like places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... um... how about.... your uh......mouth?\" You spoke meekly, hoping he wouldn't find it weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's eyes widened with realization. \"YEAAH!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had to cover your ears due to how loud he had just yelled. Still, you were relieved that he was just as excited as you were about the idea (Well... not QUITE as excited)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle lifted you close to his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S...so uh. Are you ready?\" The boy asked softly with a tone of eagerness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"uh... hold on, c-could you just close your eyes for a second?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" The boy asked curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just don't want my clothes to get any more wet...\" You lied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle gave you an oddly confused expression but closed his eyes anyways \"okay.. I guess\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began removing all of your damp clothes until only your boxers remained. You slowly slid them off, revealing your throbbing dick bobbing excitedly in mid-air. You let out a heated whimper of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready yet?\" Kyle spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, you can open it now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if they were curtains to a stage, Kyle's lips began to open widely in front of you. The familiar sweet scent of maple syrup still lingered from this morning's breakfast. Kyle had lined his palm up so that it was leveled closely with his bottom lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no more time, you slowly took your last step off the palm and onto the warm plushie surface of Kyle's bottom lip. His tongue had rested itself over his bottom teeth so that you could travel across safely. Finally steadying yourself on his tongue, you got your first good look around. The air inside the massive cavern was hot and humid. Each and every wall was coated with saliva which made everything shimmer from the outside light. Long stands of the thick liquid connected from the top of his mouth to the pulsating tongue under your feet. After walking further and further into the 'cave' your eyes eventually spotted Kyle's uvula; and below it was the dark pit of his throat. Feeling that you didn't have much time, you sat your nude body down on the wet tongue and began to masturbate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was starting to feel uncomfortable with how dry his mouth was becoming. He wanted to say something but it was impossible while you were inside. The boy tried to hold off the urge to close his mouth for as long as he could, but it simply became too much for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were half way through your 'private time' the inside of the mouth suddenly went pitch black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"w-wha-\" You weren't even able to calculate what was happening as the tongue underneath you quickly rose, pressing you into the pallet of the boy's mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wriggled desperately as Kyle attempted to re-lubricate the inside of his mouth. The friction against your cock was incredible. You let out a throaty moan of ecstasy as the movement nearly put you over the edge. You found it hard to breath as your mouth was starting to fill with Kyle's enzymes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally feeling satisfied, Kyle finally attempted to speak. \"SuuUrry abouuut daaaught\" He tried to sound as apologetic as possible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Kyle's tongue began to register the taste of your nude body. Having already licked you several times before, the boy noticed there was a significant increase in how tasty you were. Kyle started to wonder if it would be okay if he could suck on you a bit. Knowing that you wouldn't be able to understand him even if he attempted to ask, he instead decided to go through with it without your permission. Surely his big bro wouldn't mind, Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt the tongue jolt again. Once more, you were raised up to the pallet. Kyle's tongue rolled you from side to side, creating a suction-like force against the smooth curves of your tiny form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mmmmm\" Kyle's tongue vibrated as he savored your taste. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The boy started to feel that sensation again. Everything about what he was doing made his body tingle with an odd type of pleasure. Kyle was still too young to have properly learned how to control these feelings. Little did he realize that he was slowly losing himself to this new-found desire. Subconsciously he began to pull you further towards the back of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(\"Is this a dream? Am I really being sucked on like a candy by my little brother?\") <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation, The situation, it was all you needed to finally go over the edge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you were about to climax, Kyle had already completely lost himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uughh Uughh!\" Your whole body tensed as your cock unleashed it's white bliss....and then..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GUUUULP* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tongue underneath you shifted as your form was pulled over the dark abyss of Kyle's throat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pulsating walls of the boy's esophagus squeezed you as your climax continued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA part of you knew what had just happened, but you didn't really care. It was all far too intoxicating for you to even consider your well-being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Kyle's head had tilted. A small bulge could almost visibly be seen traveling down his neck into his young developing body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mmmmm\" Kyle hummed happily with his eyes closed as a huge saliva-dripping smile spread across his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before you reached the point of no return. The sphincter above Kyle's stomach opened for just a moment to allow your tiny form to pass, immediately closing again tightly as you splashed into the acidy soup of nutrient.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Had that phone not rang.... <br>\r\nYou try to push the thought out of your mind as you begin to stand up. <br>\r\n\"What do I do now?\" You think to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly, getting your brother's attention isn't an option anymore. At least while standing on the floor. <br>\r\nYou try to remember all the things that Kyle usually does during the day. <br>\r\nA lightbulb goes off as you remember how much he plays his Nintendo DS. There are times when he spends hours on that thing. <br>\r\nAs far as you can remember, he usually keeps it on a desk in his room. <br>\r\nYou stared long and hard at the massive door in front of you. The memory of nearly being stepped on still burning your mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do this.. I NEED to do this..\" You take a deep breath as you began to sprint towards the doorway.<br>\r\nIt took you around seven minutes to finally make it. It was mind numbing to imagine how it would normally only take you a few foot steps to leave your room. <br>\r\nYour jaw opened with awe as you entered the massive hallway. It would easily take over an hour for you to make it to the staircase. <br>\r\nLuckily Kyle's room was relatively close. <br>\r\nAbout five minutes later you began to hear the sound of Kyle's feet thumping up the stairs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou strategically decided to walk against the wall, knowing that something like this might occur. <br>\r\nSuddenly you had to cover your ears in pain. Kyle's foot steps were much louder than they were previously. As you watched him walking down the hall, you realized why.<br>\r\nKyle at some point must have taken off his socks,  his bare feet were now slapping across the hardwood floor. Each footstep was deafening. <br>\r\nKyle covered the distance between your two rooms in nearly three footsteps as he entered his room, closing the door behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't too worried, since you could easily fit under the door-frame. <br>\r\nUpon entering the giant room you notice Kyle on his bed playing his DS.<br>\r\nYou curse to yourself. Your plan was to be standing by it before he picked it up.<br>\r\n\"I'll just have to get his attention some other way....\" you think to yourself<br>\r\nYou start your trek across the messy floor of Kyle's room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually reach his bed. Next to you was one of Kyle's black, white, and red high-top sneakers. Luckily it's opening was too high up for you to smell anything.<br>\r\nYou began to look for a way to climb his bed as your eyes notice that a corner of his bed sheet was hanging off onto the floor. <br>\r\nYou quickly run up to it and begin your climb. It takes around seven minutes for you to reach the top of his bed. <br>\r\nUnfortunately, Kyle was sitting on the other side of the bed, meaning your journey was not yet finished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide that no matter where you walk will be dangerous so you end up taking the middle route. <br>\r\nIt isn't long before you're making your way past Kyle's massive feet. <br>\r\nThey were the very same that feet that nearly crushed you earlier, only this time they were sock-less. Every once in a while you'd notice his toes curl, likely having something to do with the game he was playing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving on, you reached his massive butt. He had changed into white shorts and a blue tee-shirt, probably when he got rid of his socks.<br>\r\nJust as you were walking around the side of him, you finally got a good look at his face. <br>\r\nHe seemed a little frustrated, probably trying to get the high score in something. <br>\r\nAs you were about to make your way to climb his shorts, he groaned loudly in frustration.<br>\r\n\"UGH!! I WAS SO CLOSE!\" he shouted as his left fist came down near your position. <br>\r\nThe impact sent you flying five inches up into the air. <br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAHHHHHH!\" You screamed as you fell through the air. The shock of it all caused you to pass-out mid flight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally waking up an unknown amount of time later, you start to pull yourself to your feet. <br>\r\nYou begin looking around, trying to figure out where you landed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were immediately confused. Wherever you were was dark. The surface below you was spongy and somewhat moist, but the thing that struck you as the oddest was the smell. It was like the smell of a sock you had passed during your travel across the room, only many times worse. You held your nose as you continued to look around. Behind you was what looked like a massive dark cavern. Above you was a stream of light. You could tell by the ceiling that you were still in Kyle's room. <br>\r\nUp against the large wall under the beaming light was faded lettering. You eventually got close enough to read it out.<br>\r\n'Nike' <br>\r\nEverything suddenly made sense. The smell. The darkness. <br>\r\nYou were sitting at the bottom of one of Kyle's high-tops. <br>\r\n\"KYYYYYYYYYLLLLLLLLLLLE!!\" You began to scream at the top of your lungs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no response. <br>\r\nYou then attempted to climb the sides of the shoe. Each attempt ended in failure as you simply slid down the smooth sides. <br>\r\n\"If only one of his laces had fallen in...\" you think to yourself despairingly.<br>\r\nSuddenly the creaking sound of Kyle's bed began to flood the inside of the sneaker. <br>\r\nYour eyes widened with hope as Kyle's head had now come into view.  He was rubbing his eyes, sliding his hands up his forehead and through his hair, now sitting off of the edge of his bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hear him groan as his arms stretched up over his head, closing his eyes while doing so; All followed by a loud sigh of relief. <br>\r\nYou began shouting again<br>\r\n\"KYYYYYYYLLLEEE!! DOWN HERE!!!!!!!!!!! IN YOUR SNEAKER!! KYLE!!!!!!!!\"<br>\r\nJust as you were starting to worry that he couldn't hear you, his eyes focused on the floor where the sneakers sat. A light smile quickly formed on his face.  <br>\r\n\"YESSSSS KYLE! I'M RIGHT HERE!!\" you wave your arms frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle began to lean down, reaching towards the floor. <br>\r\nYou can hear some sort of friction-like noise, followed by a thump. <br>\r\nYou suddenly start feeling suspicious as Kyle's eyes moved their focus on the opening of your sneaker. <br>\r\nKYLE!!!!  HEEY!!!!! KYYYYYYYYYLEEE!!!<br>\r\nKyle's expression doesn't seem to change, though he was clearly staring right where you were positioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the world goes dark. Your heart sinks as you notice that Kyle's face has been replaced by a massive tan fleshy surface.... <br>\r\nThe sole of his foot...<br>\r\nIt finally clicks, Kyle was putting on his sneakers!!<br>\r\nWith no other option, you began to run towards the dark cavern. Behind you, Kyle's toes started to enter the foot ware, pressing down into the spongy wet surface, exactly where you had just been standing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smell gets worse the farther you run, your eyes begin to water from both the smell and the fear. <br>\r\nFinally hitting the dead end, you turn around to see that Kyle's toes were now nearly an inch away from you. <br>\r\n\"KYYYYYYYYYYYYLLLLEEEE!!!\" You let out one last desperate scream as Kyle brought his heel down, filling the sneaker snuggly, and sending his toes right over you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile a few minutes ago~<br>\r\n\"MmMM!\" Kyle hummed as he stretched. <br>\r\n\"What should I do now...\" The boy thought to himself<br>\r\nHis eyes darted across his messy room until he spotted his skateboard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm, maybe I should go down to the corner store and pick up some chips for Brandon (wherever he is..)\" He decided to himself.<br>\r\nLooking down at the floor, Kyle spotted his high-top sneakers. <br>\r\n\"Oh good, It usually takes me forever to find where I leave them\" He thought to himself with a smile. <br>\r\nThe nine year old reached down and began enter his naked foot into the first high-top, popping his heel in with little effort. <br>\r\nHe then focused his attention on the second sneaker. Quickly doing the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his toes itch within the confines of the second sneaker, but simply decides to pass it off as nothing.<br>\r\nFeeling the itch again a few moments later, he began to get a little annoyed. <br>\r\nHe kicked his foot into the carpet a few times, attempting to satisfy the annoying itch. He smiled to himself as it ceased.<br>\r\nHe began to walk over to his skateboard, picking it up as he left the house.<br>\r\n----<br>\r\nYou were now struggling to survive as Kyle's colossal toes were now pressing down on you with each step.<br>\r\n\"KYYYYYYLE!!!\" You cried in vain as the inside of the shoe became hot and humid. <br>\r\nYou were hitting his toes as hard as you can until he started to stomp into the carpet. A few of your bones snapped each time the massive toes came down onto you, causing you to cry out in intense pain. <br>\r\nIt wasn't long before he continued walking. You were now drenched by the sweat coming off of Kyle's gargantuan foot.<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\nThe young boy placed his skateboard on the street and began pushing it.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nYou suddenly felt a massive force pulling you further under the giant's toes as Kyle slapped the cement with his foot. <br>\r\nYou continued to cry as you were pulled further and further under his foot. <br>\r\nYou didn't want your life to end this way. Not like this. <br>\r\nWith one final powerful kick, Kyle's foot rose up just enough so that your whole body slid directly under the balls of his feet. <br>\r\nKYYYY- <br>\r\nYou weren't even able to finish yelling his name as the kid's foot came slamming down.<br>\r\n----<br>\r\nFor a moment Kyle could have sworn he felt a crunch against his sole, but simply assumed that there had been an annoying bug in his sneaker all along. <br>\r\nThe nine year old was completely unaware that he had just crushed his once 'big' brother underneath his bare foot. All of your struggles went totally unknown.<br>\r\nKyle hadn't even noticed the red smear on his sole after taking off his shoes later that day. <br>\r\nHe simply propped his feet up on his bed as he continued playing video games. </span></div></div>",

He was only three or four at the time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mom had brought both of you to a park where you usually spent most of your summer days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the memories start to flood back little by little. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou remember that there was a sandbox your brother used to play in while you kicked around a soccer ball in the open grass a few feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, after wearing yourself out quite a bit, you decided to check on Kyle. He was sitting in the sand, watching a few ants pass over the side of the sandbox. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" you remember asking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watching the ants\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because they're nice to me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?

Only moments before you were almost two feet taller than your little brother, now Kyle was a living mountain. You had ran to him in the hopes of getting his attention, but you hadn't taken into consideration what you might look like to him in your present condition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's foot was only seconds away from coming down on top of you, but to you it seemed like an eternity. His socks, which were a little tight due to a growth spurt, were stretched and you could briefly see the outline of his toes a second before they were upon you. The thick rope woven fabric of his sock hit you first pushing you into the carpet fibers and holding you pron as the world went dark with a resounding <b>THUD</b>. The tremor of the mountain made of flesh and bone coming down vibrated through your body. There is a blast of foot Oder as  the air around you is displaced. The air is pushed out of your lungs from the weight above you and you mercifully black out, believing  that at least you'll be spared the pain of being crushed to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Imagine your astonishment to awaken, sore but remarkably still alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter checking yourself over (and checking to see if your underwear was still clean) you come to the conclusion that you must've ended up just behind your younger brothers toes, when he lifted his foot away and saw you weren't moving he figured you were dead and left. You couldn't believe your luck! Now all you had to do was get to the machine and.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Where is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGone! Damn it, Kyle must've took it when he left. Well, that's just great. The only chance to get back to normal size was in the hands of a now Giant 10 year old. Should've known better than to hope that this would be an easy fix. Making your way to your bedroom door, you look down the massive Hallway to your brother's room. It was a long walk. On top of that you'll have to go across the Hallway to get to his room which left you vulnerable if Kyle happened to come walking toward you. Well, no time like the present. </span></div></div>",

Kyle's room looked furnished by mega-structures, including a bed, a desk and chair, and a dresser.

You raised your hands to shield your vision while Kyle closed his eyes all together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light was so bright that your eyes had to recover for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you immediately noticed was that you felt almost paralyzed. For some reason you could no longer move your arms or legs. It isn't long before you realize that you can't use any of your muscles at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A... am I really paralyzed?\" You think to yourself how tragic this is. The idea of being bound to a wheel chair, drinking food from a tube. You were terrified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, you suddenly realized that something...... was off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, you're still able to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it just my eye muscles that work?\" You think to yourself as you scan the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... why am I on top of my machine.?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's difficult to get a good look without moving, but you're clearly seated on the large device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter thinking it over for a few seconds, you come to a horrifying revelation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't move my arms and legs because..... I don't have any...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The reason I'm on the machine...is.. is\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then notice the mirror across the room<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReflecting back at you, positioned on the exact platform that you were now on top of.....was the apple. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I TURNED INTO AN APPLE?!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"how can I even see?\" you ponder to yourself as you continue your attempts to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't even budge a centimeter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're suddenly filled with optimism.  You remember that in your calculations you deduced that the effects of the static pulse would revert the object's properties back it's original form as long as the subject remains under the radiation of the red bulb after a solid three minutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh to yourself, almost having lost all hope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I just need to play the waiting gam--\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thought process is interrupted when you notice your little brother burst out from the pillows on your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-KYLE?! What are you doing here!?!\" you attempted to shout, which was impossible without a mouth or respiratory system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could only watch as he got out of bed and looked around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He must not have realized what happened to me! boy.. is he going to be surprised when I turn ba-.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as you were finishing your thought, Your kid-brother's eyes made contact with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were shocked \"Could there be something that happened to the apple's appearance that allows him to realize it's me?\" You wonder as he steps closer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry Kyle, one more minute and I'll..-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were forced to stop again as you noticed your brother was now reaching for you<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...

DON'T TOUCH ME! I NEED TO STAY HERE! KYYLEEEE!! STOOOOP!\" you cried internally. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your your brother's fingers began to wrap around you, your mind was in turmoil. The moment he moves you, you'll never be able to revert back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYLLLLLLLLLE!!!\" you made one last final scream as Kyle carelessly pulls you out from the machine without a thought in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere you were, in the palm of your 10 year old brother's hand. An apple. You couldn't believe this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared up at his smiling face as he began to examine you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour whole being was filled with regret. You'd never be a human ever again. Your mind was so busy processing the anguish of your situation that hadn't noticed your brother was making an odd face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an expression  that made you uneasy. It was almost like a look of anticipation.....no...that's not the word. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sudden movement, Kyle lowered his arm and began to rub you against his shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what is he doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally understand as you hear a loud grumbling from behind the fabric.. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes look towards the clock. 1pm. Kyle's usual lunch time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was your job to make lunch for him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe must have saw the apple and thought it was for .......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes shift to Kyle just in time to see his tongue trace across the outside of his lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-...no.!..\" you can only watch with dread as he lifts you up to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now understood that the look in his eyes was hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou scream in terror as you're now faced with your brother's open mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYYYYLEEEE!!!!!

Completely unaware that if he had just waited another minute, his brother would have been able to return to his human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy walked out of the room happily with a full belly, licking the sweet apple juices off of his lips; Never knowing that he had just devoured his older brother's existence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The boy giggles softly as he reaches for the teddy, preparing it to toss it at you during your moment of grief.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis plan doesn't go completely according to plan as Kyle unveils himself a bit too early.

Before you even had time to retract your finger... *CLICK*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA huge wave of light emits from the machine just as the teddy makes impact with your face. The light is so bright that it forces Kyle to close his eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the light settles down, the room becomes eerily still. Pulling his hands away from his eyes, Kyle slowly looks around the room. The first thing he immediately notices is that you're no longer standing in front of the machine.  He wonders if you perhaps fell over onto the ground after being hit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha!

The boy is instantly hit with confusion when he notices that not only were you not chasing him, but you weren't on the floor either. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.....?\" Kyle comes to a complete stop in the hallway right outside your door. Poking his head back in, he looked suspiciously from left to right. You were nowhere to be seen. It's not like you could have been hiding under the bed either, since it was on a platform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----- <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"UGGHH.. what the heck happened..?\" You begin to speak, unable to clearly see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was startled by the unexpected sound of your voice. The boy's ears were telling them that the source was coming from down below, but all he saw was the teddy bear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly stepping forward, the sock-footed nine year old listened carefully for your voice again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is everything...seem so big..?\" You mutter as your vision starts to clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no mistaking it, the voice was without question coming from the stuffed animal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wait........B-brandon?\" Kyle knelt down next to the fluffy toy, slowly reaching out to poke it. </span></div></div>",

You feel yourself building up with anger as you realize that he was probably behind whatever had just occurred. You suddenly feel him poke against your back. For some reason you feel an oddly strong amount of force behind the poke as it caused your whole body to shift forward slightly. You might have normally questioned this, but right now you were far too angry to give it any thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly pulling yourself up off the floor, you turn yourself around to reach out and tackle the bratty kid. You've already send yourself flying towards the boy before you realize something was terribly.....TERRIBLY wrong. Time seemed to slow as you  travel through the air. Despite the fact that he was kneeling, you found that your once lil bro was now towering over you. I wasn't just that he was tall, he was HUGE. The closer you came to him, the more you realized how big he really was.  The look on the boy's face was of utter astonishment as you crashed into his lap with a soft thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...what did ... WHAT DID YOU DO?!\" You yelled angerly as you began to beat against his lap with....your....soft..........plushie.........arms???<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lifted your arms up to you face and noticed you no longer had hands, just furry brown arms. Continuing to look over yourself in horror, you notice that the rest of your body was covered with the exact same type of brown fur. \"no.... I'm.... I can't be..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight as you were in the middle of reflecting on this crisis, you suddenly felt a pair of enormous hands grab you from both of your sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wh!?!\" Slowly lifted up into the air against your will, you can only watch as you travel up the front of Kyle's shirt until you reach his massive boyish face. His expression could only be described as total wonderment. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I didn't say you could do that!!\" Kyle stopped the moment he picked up on the seriousness of your tone. He knew that you'd punish him pretty bad if he kept going. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Errr...sorry, I kinda got carried away\" Kyle spoke apologetically with a nervous smile. There was always a point that Kyle knew never to cross. Being a little brother, it was only common to be raised with that sense of sub-servitude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You realize I'm going to take your DS away because of this..\" You threatened<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww! Common Brandon! It was just a joke! I didn't mean for this to happen!\" The boy whined like child normally would after being told his/her punishment. Luckily, you've been using threats to manipulate the Kyle for years. You've practically become a master at getting him to do whatever you desired from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright alright, I'll let you go this time, but you need to do exactly what I say alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah! I promise!\" The boy was now totally eager to obey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, so I'm guessing that this had something to do with my device's mass-compound trilicitory bulb. I honestly never imagined that it had transformative properties. THANKFULLY, I should be able to turn back as long as I'm under direct contact with the bulb's radiation for a good twenty minutes. That should give the transpicative layers of trasforto enough time matter to reverse the process and return me to my original form. If I miss this recovery period, I'll probably need to wait an entire day for the machine to charge up again...still..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt some point during your scientific mumbo-jumbo Kyle's attention started to waver. He absentmindedly began to stroke the left side of your belly with his right thumb. A light affectionate blush forming across his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYLE!! Are you even listening?!\" You shout as you start to notice how distant his gaze was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-what?! Yeah ! I was listening!\" The boy came back to reality frantically. You let out a groan of annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, just because i'm a stuffed animal doesn't mean you can just ...*ramble...*ramble*....*ramble* <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's attention started to once again waver after you said \"I'm a stuffed animal\" .....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A part of you would do anything just to be able to reach over and choke the kid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LOOK. All you need to do is pick up the device, place it on that stool and pull it up to the side of the bed. Alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh! That's easy!\" the boy stood up, leaving you on the floor. Seeing him stand up at full height was kind of intimidating from your point of view. His long-human legs carried him all the way across the rooms in only a few steps. Doing as he was told, Kyle lifted the device and placed it on the chair, rolling it right up against the side of the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\" The boy asked as he leaned over to pick you up. The speed of being lifted so quickly made you dizzy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle couldn't help but feel a warm fuzzy feeling every time he held you. You were just so small and cute looking to him. He kept finding himself resisting the urge to pull you into a tight hug.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"s-so now what?\" Kyle muttered, trying to get his mind off of how cuddly your form looked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright place me down on the bed next to the chair and push these buttons in exact order, ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle placed you down in front of the machine, preparing himself to press a few of the multi-colored buttons on it's base. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Green, blue, Red, green, 1342872, Red, orange, blue, yellow\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle pressed the buttons in the exact order that you instructed. Almost immediately, the red bulb in front of you started to shine with an almost other-worldly aura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that should do\" You continue to sit there, basking in the bulb's warm radiation. All you needed to do now was sit there for another twenty minutes. Luckily you still had another two hours before you would have to wait an entire day before attempting to revert the transformation again. You shutter to yourself as you imagine being stuck in this form for a 24 hours. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what?\" Kyle spoke as he laid down on the bed two feet away from you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now we wait\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Twenty minutes\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"oh..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took five minutes for Kyle to become bored. He started to make weird noises with his mouth to pass the time. Three minutes later he had fallen asleep. You sighed in relief now that you no longer had to listen to any of his obnoxious noises. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime continued to flow buy until you only had five minutes to go. You started to imagine all the delicious pay-back you'd put Kyle through. Maybe you'd lock him in a dark closet for a few minutes or something. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you were contemplating your revenge, Kyle was deep into sleep. He'd occasionally whimper and fidget as he adventured through dream land. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm Bran...don.... teddy.. so..cuuute\" You weren't paying attention, but Kyle was likely dreaming about you as a teddy bear. Kyle continued to fidget as his arms twitched up and down in front of him. Accidentally making contact with your fuzzy form, the boy subconsciously began reaching for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-wha ! HEY!!\" You wriggle in surprise as you find yourself being pulled backwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-KYLE! What are you doing?!\" Kyle had always been a heavy sleeper, there were times when you had to spray him with water just to get him up. You continued to struggle as the nine year old pulled up into a tight embrace against his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm~ So .....soft~ Brandon....\" A smile formed across Kyle's mouth  as he rubbed his face into you affectionately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KYLE!! LET. GO. OF. ME. I NEED TO GET BACK TO THE BULB!!! KYLE!!!\" The boy rolled over to the other side of the bed, pinning you under him as held onto you tightly. Your muffled cries simply couldn't reach him. </span></div></div>",

Almost immediately, he started noticed the sound of muffled whimpers coming within his arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....huh?... Brandon?\" He loosened his hold on you, causing you to roll off of him. Though you weren't producing any tears, it was now clear to him that you were upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-..what's wrong?\" Kyle asked worryingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You idiot..... YOU STUPID IDIOT!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I do? W-what time is it?\" Kyle didn't realize that TIME was exactly the problem. By accidentally holding his brother captive, he caused him to miss the recovery period necessary to change back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'M GOING TO BE STUCK LIKE THIS ALL DAY NOW BECAUSE OF YOU!!!\" You yelled in rage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I I'm sorry! I didn't mean to!\" Kyle knew he was in big trouble now. There wasn't any way you were going to let him get away with this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-please don't take my DS away! I'll do anything!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe it. He was more concerned with his DS than with what he had just caused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU IDIOT! DON'T YOU GET IT?! YOU THINK THAT I CAN TAKE AWAY ANYTHING LIKE THIS?! I'M A FUCKING TEDDY BEAR!!\" You shouted totally unfiltered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour words had to process in Kyle's mind. Your message had reached him, but he was having trouble trying to understand why he wasn't going to get his DS taken away. The idea of NOT getting in trouble just seemed to be impossible for him to compute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when your last words finally registered to him. \"I'm a fucking teddy bear\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's eyes brightened with realization. Of course you couldn't punish him. How could you? You couldn't turn back now to punish him now. For the time being...you were a teddy bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough it took him a little while, Kyle was finally grasping the implications of your transformation. Kyle was now thinking outside of the boundaries of the norm. You had always punished him when he did something wrong. It had always been a standard rule in his life that if he messed with you, he'd pay the price. But now...<br>\r\nNow you couldn't do anything. You were a fuzzy little stuffed animal. Sure you could threaten him, but you no longer had the physical means to back it up. Though he was still worried, he couldn't help but feel a sense of relief knowing that you no longer had the power to discipline him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, during all of Kyle's inner thoughts, you were still raging. That was when you noticed that Kyle had a sense of relief on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT......WHY DO YOU LOOK SO HAPPY???\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Kyle to snap out of it. \"Oh...uh.. no reason...really..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ah man, I'm going to beat the crap out of you\" You whispered in blind anger. <br>\r\n...<br>\r\n..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...but...you can't though..\" Kyle muttered quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n\"What did you just say...?\" You glared at him intensely through your button eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not right now.. I mean....\" Kyle was trying his hardest to hide his inner smile. Something about pointing out the obvious truth of situation delighted him. He still felt bad about his brother, but it was the first time he could openly say that you were in no position to back up your threat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were so angry that you felt yourself trembling. Did this brat just down-talk you? Now, after everything his actions have caused you? Wasn't he even sorry?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost as if you didn't fully realize that you were charging at him until you were half way there. You jumped into his lap and started to violently pumble his abdomen with your plushie arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp above Kyle simply watched in fascination. He could tell that you were trying your hardest, but none of your blows were even close to being viewed as harmful. It simply felt he was being lightly tapped with teabags. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like the situation earlier, Kyle brought his hands around you and lifted you up to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GRRRGGHHH!!! LET. ME. FUCKING. GO!!\"<br>\r\n..<br>\r\n..<br>\r\n..<br>\r\n..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle stared at you intently as the gears in his brain slowly turned.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That you could keep me as your teddy bear?\" Brandon shook his foam-filled head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just a couple more days,\" he pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Brandon felt exasperated again. \"I can change back tonight when the device has re-charged. And that's that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle frowned and grabbed his brother off the table.

She needed to gather the items for the women's club bazaar that she had forgotten to select before leaving on her trip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed her purse on the kitchen table and then began to walk through her house, selecting items to donate to the bazaar and also getting rid of some of the clutter that naturally accumulates in any home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed into a cardboard box a set of canisters, a superfluous corkscrew, and the hideous set of drink coasters that her mother-in-law had gotten her at Christmas. She walked through the living room on her way upstairs and spied the bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrandon rejoiced when his mom slowed to a stop and actually noticed him. Had she somehow heard his desperate screams? He had been yelling wordlessly since she returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer son tried to communicate a plea one more time. \"Mom! Please, help me. Kyle screwed with my machine and I'm a teddy bear!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That looks like Brandon's old bear,\" she said and picked him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! It's me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's still in pretty good shape,\" she said. Brandon was far too old for stuffed animals, and he never ever showed any trace of sentiment. \"He will never know it's gone,\" she said and deposited the bear into the box with the other items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom!\" Brandon panicked when she put him in the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ignored him and went upstairs to search for more items. She returned with a wristwatch-style Fitbit and a package of bath oils and lotions. The items went into the box with the stuffed bear and other things she had collected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! Can't you hear me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking up the box, she looked at the clock on the wall. She had plenty of time to reach the community center in time for the sale.

He never realized that saying such a simple word could be so exciting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't put me down right no-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm??\" Kyle smiled as he brought you closer to his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't like this. Kyle was no longer showing you respect. Without the power to assert your authority, your command over him was dwindling. You wished that there was something you could say to trick him, but Kyle seems to has already evolved passed that point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? weren't you going to say something?\" The boy smirked. He knew that he was being kinda mean, but it wasn't any different from the way you used to do to him on a daily basis. Surely, he deserved a turn at being in charge. Besides, it's not like you would remain this way forever...or anything..........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious to experiment, Kyle starts to think for a moment. That's when he comes up with an idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting you down for a moment, Kyle reaches over and pulls off his left sock, tossing it across the room. You stare at him suspiciously, trying to figure out what he was planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Brandon, um... would you mind getting that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what? uh.. no?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"(hmm.. maybe I need to be a little meaner...)\" Kyle thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n He reaches over and grabs you by the arm, pulling you into the air. \"Go get my sock!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!! Let go!\" Kyle's heart skipped a beat for a moment after hearing your plea. For some reason, treating you this way was kinda fun. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaying his eyes on your machine, Kyle started to formulate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would happen if I 'accidentally' broke that red thing?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"w-what red th-.....\" You could feel your chest tighten as you realized he was talking about your device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no way. He had to be bluffing. Kyle knew very well that you needed that device to turn back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please...\" You mutter nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle started to reach over, preparing to flick the bulb with his index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"w...wait ....S-STOP!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle turns to you, giving you a boyish grin. (\"bingo\")<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-alright...\" You stand up and jump off the bed towards the corner of the room. As you make your way back you realize that the bed is too high for you to climb. You call Kyle's name. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, too high for the little teddy?\" Kyle was thoroughly enjoying himself. He was never allowed to be this mean before. The more he gave into it, the more enjoyable it became. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel yourself pulled back up onto the surface of the bed, Kyle's sock loosely held between your two plushie arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, good job Brandon. Now put it back on.\" He propped his foot up next to you. It was only a few inches shorter than you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFearing that Kyle might actually go through with his threat, you begin to pull the white fabric over his toes, bringing it down to his heel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle couldn't believe it, he was actually able to order you around! He couldn't describe it in words, but the new-found power he felt made him feel all tingly. Over the next day Kyle continued to make demands; each more humiliating than the last. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made you dance for him, he started calling you 'Toby' (which was the teddy's original name), he even sat on you until you begged. Though Kyle was only having some fun, he couldn't deny how excited it made him to treat you as if you were just any old stuffed animal. After a while, the way he was dehumanizing you was beginning to set in. That night, Kyle slept with you in bed like he had done before. Though the entire situation was unsettling, you couldn't deny the comforting warmth you received as you were smothered into the boy's chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was really nothing you could do but grit your non-existent teeth. You didn't want Kyle to act hasty and cause any irreversible damage to the machine. All you had to do was wait a little longer. Your parents would come home soon, which meant that Kyle's power-trip was limited. </span></div></div>",

Your parents would be home in an hour. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was tossing you up into the air over and over again, clearly deep in thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OKAY. ENOUGH!\" You shouted, causing the boy to snap out of his trance and drop you onto the bed next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom and dad are going to be home soon, we need to turn me back now!\" You shuffled your way towards the side of the bed where the device sat. As you were about half way there, you felt one of your arms being held back. Turning around, you faced Kyle who looked upset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle...I know. You had your fun, but now things need to go back now. Play time is over. What do you think mom would think if they found that I'm a talking teddy bear? Huh Kyle? What are they going to do when I tell them everything you just did to me? ... Look, I promise I won't take your DS away alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was no longer thinking about things like that anymore. He was more concerned with things going back to the way they were before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy's heart was racing. He knew all along that time was running short. The more time he spent with you as a teddy bear, the more he realized how much nicer things were then when you were normal. Once you changed back, he knew that you'd make him pay for all the humiliating things he made you do. Not only that, but he'd never be able to tell you what to do ever again. Kyle started to tremble, he was a scared kid; scared of becoming the 'little' brother again. He was thinking desperately for anything that could be done to keep things this way. ANYTHING.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"COME ON KYLE. LET. ME. GO!\" You continued your attempts to escape his firm grasp. You were completely unaware of the horrifyingly selfish thoughts starting to race through Kyle's mind. It had never occurred to you that he would ever consider putting his enjoyment before you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(\"M-maybe if I hid him in my toy trunk...\")(\"No.. they'd still be able to hear him..) <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe probably wasn't even considering how worried your parents would be. His only concern was ending his role as a little brother. It's very likely that Kyle didn't truly comprehend that what he was actually considering could be defined as kidnapping; Though, this shouldn't be too odd considering he's only 10 years old. It's not like boys that age rarely ever think things through to the end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter how many scenarios Kyle tried to formulate in his head, there was no way he could keep things this way . Kyle could easily convince his parents that your movements are a new type of technology or something, but your voice was really the only thing that made you different from any other teddy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..... If only you couldn't ...talk..\" Kyle whispered under his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute...\" Kyle spoke softly ...\"How .......are you talking?\"....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yourself have been wondering this as well, but you didn't give it any real though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's eyes widened \"WAIT A MINUTE\" The boy grabbed you, turning you around roughly. He had noticed a zipper on your back when he examined you earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-KYle! HEY!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nine year old eagerly began to tug at the metal tag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-HEY!! W-What are you DOING?!?\" You struggled against his grip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling your back open, Kyle started to prod the insides of your stuffing. The feeling of his fingers inside you was incredibly uncomfortable, almost as if he was violating you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle gasped when his fingers made contact with something. Nestled deep inside the cotton was a small plastic audio device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[GET YOUR HANDS OUT OF THERE!]\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was it, this was where your voice was coming from. With a twisted smirk on his face the boy reached in and started to tug on one of the tiny wires protruding from the device. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K- Y ... LE. .W....HA......D...ING??\" Your voice began to break up the tighter he pulled. Licking his lips with a child-like cruelty, he gave the wire one final tug, ripping it right out of the speaker. Loose ends of metallic wiring curled in loops, beyond repair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"......\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Teddy bears</i> aren't supposed to talk..\" Kyle grinned. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He'd successfully silenced you.

Finally realizing that Kyle was now dead-set on keeping you this way, your frantically attempted to stop him. All your efforts proved pointless against the giant boy. Pulling the bulb completely out, Kyle lowered it to the floor and placed a hard-cover book over it. Firmly pressing his socked-foot on the book's cover, he slowly added more and more of his weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was like watching a nightmare take place.

The crunching noise didn't just signal the destruction of the bulb, it signaled the end of your humanity. You looked up at the towering boy now standing over you, his shadow blocking out the light above. You could tell by the way he was looking at you right now. You weren't his big brother anymore. You were his possession. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if you could speak, there wasn't anything you could say. There was no anger, only impending fear as you tried to back away from Kyle's frighteningly massive form. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill grinning, Kyle reached for you, lifted you up, and pulled you into a tight hug. Pushing your head into his face, he gave you a nice long sniff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mmmmm~\" This was your scent now, the scent of a stuffed animal. HIS stuffed animal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis wish had come true. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This only continued to progress over the new next few days. Your parents hadn't even noticed you by the time you stopped moving all together. You figured it had something to do with how long you waited.  The transformation was finalizing, syncing you completely to the inanimate bear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n[Another week later]<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle had begun to feeling regretful. The boy admitted to himself that he probably went a bit too far. He couldn't help it though. The idea of keeping you this way was too tempting to resist at the time. Now he realized how lonely it was to not have a brother to talk to. It was only now that he understood that his punishment would have only been temporary, but now, you had to live the rest of your life as an inanimate stuffed animal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill a little naive to how his brother was probably really feeling, he tried to make it up to you by smothering the toy with affection. Not having heard your voice for so long had caused him to project his own feelings onto the bear, much the same way a child would normally do with a regular stuffed animal. Every night he'd take the you to sleep with him, absentmindedly covering you with his drool as he slept. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe initially called you by your real name 'Brandon', but as days went on, he forgettably began calling you \"Toby\" every once in a while, until 'Brandon' became sort of a forgotten term. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He began leaving you on one of his shelves and would tell you about his day when he remembered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day he had decided to bring a few friends over. Not wanting them to think he still played with stuffed animals, he quickly threw you into an old chest in the corner of the room. Weeks went by until he remembered having left you inside. Opening it up, he pulled the old looking bear from the darkness with a regretful look on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..uh...sorry..tob..uh..Brandon.......\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe he's not even aware anymore.\" The teen spoke out-loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle didn't want to compound his regret by knowing that he just left his brother in a dark chest for weeks while he was still fully aware. He instead convinced himself that right then and there that his brother's existence from the bear had faded a long time ago. The stuffed animal in his hands was simply that, a stuffed animal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those simple sentiments, Kyle lowered the bear back into the dark box, closing the lid and locking it tight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle eventually grew into an adult. Had a wife. Bought a house. Had his own family. The trunk in his room had eventually been moved up into the addict of his mother's house where it sat and collected dust. One day their mother opened it to find the stuffed animal. She gave it a good clean and sent it as a gift to one of Kyle's children. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n12r old Danny opened the gift to find the tattered old bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"uh, I'm a little old for teddy bears...\" The young teen laughed at his grandmother's present. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here Spike! New chew toy!\" He threw the bear at his Corgi who carried it back downstairs. Days went by as the dog chewed holes into the stuffed animal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle who was now in his 40's took notice when he found his dog humping away at the tattered stuffed animal.

The machine goes silent, and the only noise you hear is your slightly-heavier-than-normal breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lower your hand and then blink repeatedly, then rub your eyes, trying to regain your sight. Things slowly start to come back into focus, but as they do you begin to question if your eyes are actually working right. What you're seeing in front of you can't be real, can it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it is. In front of you, having crushed the platform it was sitting on and having knocked over the orb (thankfully without any damage, it appeared), was an eight-foot-tall juicy red apple, nearly reaching the ceiling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gasp. \"Th-that's not what was supposed to happen!\" you say out loud in astonishment. \"Did I miscalculate...?\" Your voice trails off as you look down at the console of your machine. Something seemed off; the dials and levers weren't in the same place that you left them. But that could only happen if...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kyle!\" you yell out in frustration. Of course your little brother had something to do with this. He'd been bothering you about the machine for what seemed like forever; he must've snuck into your room and screwed around with things while you were in the bathroom. Well, now he was going to pay. Turning towards the door, you storm off towards his room to find him. \"What did you do to my machine?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom his hiding place underneath your pillows, Kyle can barely hold in his excitement at all that he saw. No, it wasn't a robot like he had thought, but it was something better! Something that made things big! Ever since before he could remember, Kyle would always fantasize about being bigger than Brandon, bigger than his parents -- bigger than everyone! And now, here was a device that could make his fantasies come true!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe knew he didn't have a lot of time. As soon as he was sure you were out of the room, he rolled off the bed onto the floor and then jumped up to the machine. Everything seemed to be set the same as before. He moved around the console to ensure nothing else was closer to the orb than he was. Taking a deep breath, he pressed the green button, and the orb lit up brightly just as you walked back into the room, gasping at what you saw...</span></div></div>",

His wide eyes looked around the room in amazement, taking in ever detail of your room. \"Everything looks so small...\" he said in wonderment, bending over slightly, his large hands resting on his knees as he got a better look at your bed. His lips quirked up in the corners slightly, a mischievous thought running through his head. He stood back up to his full height, the crown of his head cracking a spot in the ceiling, plaster snowing down around him and turned around, sticking his butt out as he hovered over your bed. This act seemed to break into your paralyzing thought process, your legs moving as you yelled out, \"Kyle! Wait! Don't--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle landed backwards with reckless abandon, his shorts covered rear hitting the bed with enough force to snap the legs clean in half, a horrible screeching and scratching noise erupting around the room as the bed legs ripped into the carpet and scratched the hardwood underneath. The mattress folded in half on either side of the giant kid, his giggles loudly filling the air as he ruined your bed merely by sitting down on it. The sheets and covers tangled and pulled free from the corners of the mattress, pillows flying everywhere. Kyle eagerly grabbed them all up and dropped them on his lap, smugly looking over at you as you slowly approached. \"A few minutes ago these covered my whole body but now I'm too big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped slightly. Kyle was obviously intensely aware of the power he had and how much things had shifted from his recent growth spurt. He wasn't any stronger looking but proportionally he had gained a ton of weight and strength; it probably wouldn't be wise to annoy him. \"That's really cool and all Kyle but...play time is over, we need to get you down to normal size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle's smile disappeared so quickly it was like it had been slapped off. \"No way! I'm not going back to being a shrimp you can just push around! Talk about dumb, what kid would go back to that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't a game Kyle! You NEED to turn back and if you don't--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I don't, WHAT?\" Kyle thundered, jumping to his feet, the bare appendages landing with enough force to shake the entire room, the windows vibrating from the force of his immature but powerful voice. \"What are YOU going to do about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm...I'm going to make you!\" You said gamely, thrusting your chest out in what you hoped was a show of authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle chuckled darkly and put his hands on his hips. \"Okay! Go ahead and make me then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou huffed slightly and pushed your sleeves up. \"Alright, I will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stepped forward, planting a firm socked foot between your brother's bare ones, trying not to notice how huge they looked compared to your own, and planted your palms on your brother's warm stomach. It felt so warm and...solid! More like a wall then like a human body. Planting your other foot slightly behind you, you pushed, pushed with all your might! Now you weren't exactly a tall guy for your age, standing at the lower end of five feet, but surely a difference of only a few feet shouldn't have put you at THIS much of a disadvantage? No matter how hard you pushed, Kyle not only didn't step back, he didn't budge a single inch! After a few embarrassing minutes you gave up, wrapping your hands around your brother's thick right wrist, tugging fruitlessly at it for a few more minutes until he lifted his arm into the air, carrying you up with it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try \"big\" brother, but I don't think you can force me to do anything anymore.\" Kyle said with a grin, his lips curling over his teeth as he tried to suppress a giggle. \"You feel really light too...like a toy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could dwell on the indignity of being referred to as a toy, Kyle's thick arms wrapped around your body and pressed you tight against his own, your face smashed into his shirt, right above his heart. His suppressed giggles erupted out as he did this, his body shaking slightly, the beats of his heart and vibrations of his giggles rippling against you. Your nose was forced to inhale a combination of young male body and peanut butter, a smear of it still on his shirt from lunch. \"Little baby brother, with no Mom or Dad to look after you.\" He cooed gently, rubbing the back of your head with a BIT too much force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart sank as you realized just how far away Sunday seemed now. A whole weekend, completely alone, with your giant of a little brother...could things get worse?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As your now giant 10-year-old brother, Kyle, holds you close to his chest, your legs and feet dangle about two feet above the floor. Your feet just hang there in front of his legs, just above his knees. \u201cThis is SO humiliating. Thank goodness that nobody is here to see this.\u201d, you think to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get more annoyed at your brother. You yell at Kyle but your face is buried in his shirt and your mouth is muffled, \u201cKyle, put me down!\u201d Kyle pretends to not be able to understand what you\u2019re saying \u201cWhat was that, \u2018big\u2019 brother?\u201d and giggles at you some more, which only makes you more annoyed. \u201cKyle, I mean it! Put me down right now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Kyle is still standing at full height, you do your best to look down at the floor to see if dropping from this height would be safe. You can just see over his arms and you\u2019re able to determine that he stands just a little over eight feet tall as the crown of his head is grinding into the ceiling, which is 8 feet above the floor. He continues talking down to you as if you were a toy and treating you like a baby. Then, Kyle looks back down over at your machine and another mischievous idea crosses through his mind. About a foot-and-a-half above your head, another mischievous smile spreads on Kyle\u2019s face. \u201cThis is getting boring.\u201d, said Kyle, once again his voice caused the windows to vibrate and shook the entire room a little. \u201cI\u2019ve got a much BETTER idea!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Kyle lets go of you and you drop to the floor. You manage to land on your feet with a bit of thud. \u201cUgh!\u201d You\u2019re okay and you quickly regain your balance and stand up just as Kyle walks over to your machine again. You yell at Kyle again and order him to get away from the machine \u201cKyle, get away from my machine! We shouldn\u2019t use it until I adjust the settings and run some tests on it to make sure that it\u2019s adjusted to shrink you down to normal size again!\u201d Upon hearing you yell that at him, Kyle gets an annoyed look on his face. Then he gets angry at you again at yells \u201cI\u2019m not going to let you turn me into a shrimp again! You\u2019ll just make fun of me and bully me more!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow you\u2019re angry with your brother and worried about what he\u2019s going to do. \u201cKyle, you\u2019re too big! If you make yourself any larger, you\u2019ll wreck the house! There\u2019s no telling what a second blast will do to you or how large it will make you!\u201d You walk up to Kyle and tug on his shirt to try to distract him from using your machine, but he pushes you away with one hand and very little effort. You get knocked back four feet to the floor, the wind has been knocked out of you and your chest is slightly sore from the impact. Kyle stands at the controls of the machine, right near the orb, and just like he did the first time, he makes sure that no one and nothing else is closer to the machine than he is. As you sit up and catch your breath, you watch in horror as Kyle reaches for the activation button again. You yell \u201cKyle, no! Don\u2019t do it! I\u2019m sorry that I\u2026\u201d Kyle replies \u201cToo late, \u2018big\u2019 brother.\u201d, his voice shaking the entire room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, Kyle activates the machine. Just like the first time, as soon as Kyle pressed the button, a bright laser shot out from the orb directly towards him. The beam struck Kyle in the chest while filling your vision and the entire room with a blinding light blur for a moment. You quickly shield your eyes again with your hand, though you can still only see the bright white blur as you hear the machine make a familiar loud WHOOOSH followed by a sudden THOOM, and then... silence. The machine goes silent once again. This time, however, the entire house instantly begins to shake, the floor begins to creak, plaster powder and dust, and now large chunks of ceiling and wood start falling onto the floor. \u201cThis feels great!\u201d, Kyle says with a lot of enthusiasm. You notice that his voice is even louder and more amplified than before. Powder and dust start to coat the entire room and you. You cough a few times, \u201cOh yes, things could definitely get a LOT worse. Mom and dad are going to kill me.\u201d you think to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch helplessly in horror as Kyle quickly squats down in an attempt to avoid growing through the ceiling, but his efforts are instantly wasted as he continues to grow too big for the room. He grows to 10 feet tall in a matter of seconds. He continues growing so big that his proportionate size makes him too heavy for the second floor of the house to support his weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately start covering up and protecting the machine to prevent it from getting damaged. In your panic, you consider the very likely possibility that Kyle will indeed outgrow the house, which would damage or even destroy your machine. \u201cIf I don\u2019t get this thing out of the house, it will surely be destroyed. I\u2019ve got to keep my machine safe. It\u2019s the only way to return Kyle to his normal size and end this nightmare.\u201d, you think to yourself. You start taking your machine, your equipment and all of its components out of the house as fast as you can. Thankfully, you had thought ahead and designed and built the main array (the part with the orb and its controls) as a removeable chassis for easier assembly / disassembly and storage. Fortunately, this also came in quite handy in cases of emergencies, which is exactly what this situation was and is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carefully slide the main array out of its chassis and carefully carry it downstairs as fast yet as carefully as possible. It took both of your hands to hold it and it weighed about 90 pounds, but you managed to get it out of the house safely in a matter of minutes. You carried it as far away from the house as possible and set it down at the end of the driveway, but keeping it in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continue to evacuate the rest of your machine and its components from the house, Kyle\u2019s head grows right through the ceiling, \u201cUgh!\u201d, he exclaims. Then his shoulders, then his torso and the rest of his body follows, breaking through more of the ceiling and right through the attic until his head hits the roof. \u201cOw!\u201d \u201cUh-oh.\u201d, Kyle says out loud. \u201cUgh! Ow!\u201d His head pushes its way through the roof with the sound of cracking wood and shingles. He passes 12 feet tall and continues to grow at an alarming rate. You watch as Kyle completely outgrows the house and wrecks it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle grows to 14 feet tall and steps out of the holes and rubble that his body created and walks out in front of what\u2019s left of your house. Each step he takes is larger than the one before. He is now 15 feet tall and watches in awe and joy as everything in sight shrinks smaller and smaller before his very eyes, from his perspective, anyway. He loves every second of his growth spurt. Kyle yells \u201cYeah! This is AWESOME, Brandon! I feel great! It didn\u2019t do anything bad to me at all! Thank you, \u2018big\u2019 brother! I wasn\u2019t big enough before!\u201d in a louder, reverberating voice. \u201cYou don\u2019t THINK it did anything bad to you! Weren\u2019t big enough?!\u201d, you yell up to Kyle. Kyle sticks his giant tongue out at you and blows a raspberry at you (which you feel as it vibrates your body a little). \u201cWeren\u2019t big enough\u2026\u201d, you mutter to yourself. \u201cBut what do you know, you dummy? You\u2019re just my kid brother.\u201d, you think to yourself. You scream at Kyle \u201cLook what you did to the house, you little brat! You\u2019ve destroyed our house \u2013 our home! Mom and dad are going to be furious with both us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle has stopped growing and stands a little over 16 feet tall. You watch in both awe and horror as your younger brother gets an angry look on his face, looks down at you, gets on his hands and knees and brings his face down to you \u2013 right in your face. His mouth is now wider than you are tall. His breath wafts over you like a hot breeze that smells like peanut butter. He scolds you, raising his voice to deafening levels (the volume of his voice hurts your ears) \u201cI AM NOT LITTLE! And I\u2019m NOT a brat!\u201d, he emphasizes. You cover your ears as he continues to emphasize his point. \u201cYOU\u2019RE the LITTLE brother! I\u2019M the BIG brother NOW!\u201d, he yells at you. \u201cAnd don\u2019t you forget it.\u201d, he warns you. Then he pushes you with his index finger, knocking you down on your butt again. His voice shattered the front windows of your house, neighboring houses within a 20-yard radius and several windows of various parked vehicles along both sides of the street. Several car alarms were also set off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow am I going to explain all of this mom and dad?\u201d, you think to yourself. \u201cHow am I gonna to tell \u2018em that their youngest son was enlarged to be bigger than a two-story house?!\u201d, you think to yourself in a panic. \u201cYou\u2019ll ALWAYS be the little brother to me, Kyle!\u201d, you yell up to him. Kyle spots your machine and controls in the driveway and gets that mischievous idea again. \u201cOh yeah? Well maybe I haven\u2019t made myself BIG ENOUGH! Let\u2019s see how big I have to grow myself to MAKE you see that I\u2019M the big brother from now on.\u201d, Kyle retorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou notice him looking towards the driveway with a smile on his face and figure out what he\u2019s got in mind. \u201cOh no. Not again!\u201d, you think out loud. You start running as fast as you can towards your machine. Kyle starts walking toward it, reaching for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich one of you get there and reach your machine first?</span></div></div>",
