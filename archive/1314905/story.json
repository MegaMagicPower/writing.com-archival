He ruffled his own hair and continued his trek home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"What a day...\" Minoru sighed as he pulled off his shoes next to the door of his apartment, he needed a drink or better yet to go out on the town. His job for the past three years had been a desk job at a local shipping company. Today they had received   an order that was two crates short of what was marked on the invoice, thus Minoru spent the rest of his day dealing with irritable persons over the phone to sort the mess out. Yes, a night out was welcome in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n~<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter pulling together a casual outfit, Minoru set out for his usual haunt: a small bar where he used to get together with his college friends. He found his thoughts returning quite often to the boy he bumped into on the sidewalk. He was very attractive, even with his pale skin and seemingly frail body. Even once Minoru found himself thinking it would be nice to run into him at the bar, get to know him better maybe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Minoru got just such a chance as he walked out along the side of the street towards the bar when he saw the teen from before, clad in black leather shorts and a tight black top, entering an unmarked building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Upon closer inspection, Minoru found that it wasn't abandoned, in fact it seemed to be some sort of night club. He opened the door and stepped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   At first it seemed a bit of a shock, most of the people here seemed no older than 20, just as the mysterious young man Minoru was following. A staircase led to the dance floor, on one side of which were two large speakers that blared techno tunes. What must have been hundreds of people were moving along the floor, dancing in pairs, groups and by themselves as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The oddest thing of all though, was a large vat attached to the ceiling, filled with a dep red substance, hanging from it where hundreds of hoses, with small nozzles at the ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Some kind of bar maybe?\" Thought Minoru as he looked around the building, this solution seemed plausible, since he couldn't spot any other types of bars and there were a few people placing the nozzles to their mouths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Hey! What are you doing here?\" Came an irritable voice from behind Minoru, the 23 year old turned and found the voice belonged to the stranger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't belong here! Who'd you come with?!\" The boy demanded, crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Well...\" Minoru couldn't find anyway to explain himself that didn't make him out to be a stalker. \"I followed you?\" He finally said with an awkward grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Is there a problem Kan?\" Demanded a pudgy man, who had just climbed the steps. Minoru noticed that his clothing seemed to not fit him properly, as if he had been smaller when he put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...No, he's with me.\" Kan glared at Minoru as if trying to give him a cue. \"Isn't that right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Minoru.\" He stated his own name, and Kan grinned sweetly at the pudgy man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"We'll be off to go dancing now!\" Kan grabbed Minoru's wrist and led him down the stairs to the dance floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   The scene seemed to have changed a bit since he was gazing down at the crowd from above, out of the many dancers, both female and male, most of them seemed to have outgrown their clothing much like the pudgy man they had encountered at the entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You're lucky I saved you.\" Said Kan, golden eyes narrowing at Minoru, who felt his breath hitch a bit at the sight. \"Dance!\" He said, guiding Minoru's hands to his hips as he began to move to the sound of the music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Yeah, thanks for that.\" Minoru moved as well, pulling Kan close. \"You're very pretty you know.\" A flush rose to Kan's cheeks that Minoru was nearly positive had nothing to do with heat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The younger man smiled slightly. \"Really now? I don't hear many humans say that to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Humans? Aren't you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"A vampire?\" Offered Kan smirking now and revealing his fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Eyes wide with shock, Minoru coudln't find words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"I'm not going to bite you, if that's what you're worried about.\" Kan's voice was flat. \"Human blood is disgusting really, we've made our own alternative to it.\" He gestured to the vat above them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Minoru relaxed a bit, and followed Kan to one of the hoses. \"Don't stop dancing Minoru, or lug-head'll get suspicious and you'll be kicked out.\" Minoru nodded and pulled Kan close, resting his hands on his hips from behind. \"I want you to stick around.\" The vampire added before closing his mouth on the hose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  The desk worker felt a bit sick as he watched the blood-alternative flow through the tube to Kan's mouth, but a particular wiggle of the younger man's hips brought him back to earth. Kan had closed his eyes, and Minoru ran his hands up Kan's sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continued on for a bit, Minoru sneaking a glance at Kan's tight black outfit he could almost imagine it getting tighter...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Minoru blinked and examined this, it was getting tighter, Kan was growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr at least, he was expanding...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vampire no longer seemed skinny and frail, his cheeks had puffed out like chipmunks making his lips pucker forward on the nozzle. His arms had expanded as well, becoming thicker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinoru's eyes traveled down Kan's arms to his hands, which were raising to hold the tube. Kan's fingers were like thick breakfast sausages, clutching the tube tightly. Minoru's hands were forced outward as Kan's body seemed to almost inflate with fat, pushing outward and making the vampire's black shirt edge up his body, exposing his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKan's thighs had expanded to almost four times their original size, his tight shorts stretching to their limit as they struggled to hold in both his legs and his expanded rear-end. Minoru watched, transfixed as Kan's face expanded a bit more, earning the vampire another chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tight black shirt rolled up even more, fully exposing Kan's massive stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slow down Kan!\" Laughed a girl from next to them, she smiled through pudgy cheeks, and Minoru noticed a small gut poking out from under her halter top. \"you might rip your clothes!\" She walked off into the group, giving Minoru a clear view of the small circle of vampires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach one of them were expanding, growing pudgier with every moment they drank from the hose. None of them were even half as large as Kan had become, but they were noticibly different from before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKan removed the tube from his mouth, smacking his lips and turning to Minoru.  \"Much better, I'd been starving all day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Minoru gaped, but couldn't deny that Kan was still attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Let's dance over there.\" Kan pointed a pudgy finger to a group closer to the staircase, before grabbing Minoru's wrist in his pudgy hands and waddling across the dance floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  As they passed, a few other vampires eyed Kan with smiles. \"I see Kan's enjoying his night!\" One called and another added. \"His mother always said he was a big eater!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Kan waved a fat hand in acknowledgement, leading Minoru to the group and continuing his dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Minoru put his hands (considerably father apart then before) on Kan's hips and danced to the music, wondering how much weirder this night could become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will happen next?</span></div></div>",

He could feel the ground tremble with every step Kan made, the flesh under his hands jiggling with every movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kan grinned, pushing his chubby cheeks up his face, and turned to look at Minoru as a new song started. \"I love this song!\" Said the vampire gleefully. He moved a fat hand down to try and tug his shirt back down his massive mid-section as he started dancing to this new beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Minoru took the time the solo dance offered to glance around the club. Hundreds of vampires, all expanded from petite and skinny to large and overweight. None of them were anywhere near as large as Kan and most of them were only pudgy enough to make their clothing tight. One girl not too far away from them had a pudgy face, with a quadruple chin and a large gut poking out from under her shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n No one seemed bothered by this, and some were even making second runs to the tubes. These seemed skinnier than the others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n One girl who was rushing back to the tubes looked like the girl who'd spoken to Kan by the tubes, but she was skinnier now, her pudge was completely gone!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Kan...\"Said Minoru, shouting over the music to the teen. \"Want to head to my house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kan smiled before responding. \"Sure! Once this song is over!\" he moves got more erratic as the tempo increased. Minoru couldn't take his eyes off of him.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the song ended, both Kan and Minoru began to make their way off the dance floor when Kan placed a hand on Minoru's shoulder, signaling for him to stop. Minoru turned to look at him and noticed that Kan's eyes were fixed upon the tubes once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still a little hungry. Let me get a little more and then we can leave.\" Kan said, giving a sly grin to Minoru, his pudgy cheeks scrunching up his eyes until they were barely visible. Minoru nodded and watched as Kan waddled back towards the tubes, his bulk jiggling with every move. His eyes were inexplicably drawn towards Kan's rather large rear, watching as it too jiggled as he moved quickly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as Kan took one of the tubes in his mouth, his cheeks once more swelling and his began to expand once more. His stomach was the most noticeable change, growing and growing until it came out of his top and over his pants. Soon his clothes had small little tears in them and he had grown another chin. His chest looked like he had a pair of boobs as well that were being squished and confined by the obviously painfully constricting shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Kan, man, it's not like you're going to die or something man!\" one of the vampires joked from one of the tubes, a small gut forming underneath of his black ribbed shirt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKan finally released the tube with a smile and waved at the other vampire and began to waddle back towards Minoru who was now all hot and bothered by watching the vampire eat. Kan noticed how turned on Minoru was, and pressed his substantial body against Minoru, careful not to put any weight on him or else the human boy would fall down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were saying something about going to your apartment?' Kan asked breathlessly in his ear. Minoru shivered and nodded dumbly. \"Then lets go.\"</span></div></div>",

He began to remove his clothing to change into his bed clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"It's terribly tainted, all the medicine and supplements you all take could make anyone sick!\" Kan replied, making a face and shaking his head for effect. His golden eyes watched Minoru as he undressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Minoru finished dressing and turned to look at Kan's pudgy form. \"You're very cute you know.\" He mentioned once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Thanks.\" Said Kan with a grin, he moved closer to Minoru. \"You aren't so bad yourself you know.\" He grabbed onto the front of Minoru's shirt, and pulled the desk worker closer to his body. Minoru could feel the soft pudge that surrounded Kan's torso and felt a blush rise to his cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Kan caught this and grinned. \"Are you a chubby chaser? You've been staring at me ever since I ate.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Minoru first went to shake his head, and then sighed. \"I don't know, I just think you're cute no matter what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n This explanation seemed to satisfy Kan, who was glad to get a compliment no matter what.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n \"Extra weight used to be a sign of status for humans, maybe you were a poor man in a past life.\" Kan teased and moved away. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Minoru watched the vampire explore his apartment as he gathered his clothes to throw into the laundry. He began to wonder exactly what made Kan so attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The vampire had a very feminine face, and wonderful features no matter what his weight was. As Minoru watched the younger man explore, he could see him getting thinner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You're welcome to spend the night, but I need to get some sleep.\" Minoru said, and Kan paused his exploration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Do you? I suppose I'll come too, give me a moment!\" Kan said and went into another room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Minoru nodded and entered his bedroom, setting up pillows for both of them and pulling the blankets over himself. Kan hadn't come in for a while, so Minoru shut off his bed-side lamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The young man was just beginning to float off to sleep when he felt something climb onto him. He opened his eyes and fumbled in the dark to find his lamp. When at last light flooded the room, he found Kan straddling his waist with an assortment of treats in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Decided you were hungry?\" asked Minoru with a chuckle, but Kan simply smiled in reply. The vampire peeled the wrapper off of a small cake from a local bakery and brought it to Minoru's lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I'm not hungry.\" Said Minoru, but found the cake thrust into his mouth by Kan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I found these in your kitchen.\" Kan explained. \"If I'm going to date a human, they may as well have some appearance of high status.\" The vampire moved his knees to hold down Minoru's arms as he unwrapped another cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Against the onslaught of cakes, Minoru couldn't explain that size as status was a very old custom.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the night of gluttony, Minoru awoke early in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up out of bed, he walked into the bathroom and examined himself in the mirror.  Running a hand along his stomach, he could not see much a difference.  Sighing in relief, he walked back into the bedroom, pulling on a white t-shirt and a pair of jeans.  Having slipped on his belt, he proceeded into the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKan was there, nonchalantly leaning against the counter.  His now-svelte form was half-naked, and Minoru could not help but gaze over his physique before finally snapping to attention.  He crossed his arms, ready to complain about the previous night, when suddenly a glass was thrust into his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought you might be thirsty.\" Kan remarked cheerfully.  Minoru was still irritated, but he begrudginly admitted to himself that he did need a drink after that long night.  Raising up the glass, he downed the pinkish contents and then placed it on the table, sighing.  Kan eyed him expectanctly.  Minoru turned to face him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About-\" He began, before his stomach was suddenly seized by a potent pang, causing him to involuntarily groan and place his hands on it.  Kan quickly slid behind him, massaging his abdomen, causing the feeling to become more and more intense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-stop!\" Minoru whined, before gritting his teeth, bending over to restrain the mounting sensation.  The pressure continued to build, and he found himself powerless to resist.  Finally, he let go of the breath, allowing his stomach to sink out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it did not stop.  Even after he had stopped breathing in, his stomach continued to expand outwards.  His sudden growth forced through his t-shirt, forcing the fabric upwards to make room for his surging gut.  Minoru moaned as the fat deposits continued to build, his flat chest sagging out as his pectorals became heavy and round.  His gut continued to expand, pushing his t-shirt up completely and exerting enormous pressure on the struggling belt.  Kan leaned forward and unclipped his belt, allowing Minoru's growth to spill forward unheeded.  The sheer weight of his belly forced down the zip, causing his jeans to slip to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any pants, the rest of the growth became clear.  Minoru's thighs thickened with fat, the fleshy columns expanding out.  Kan ran a hand along them, sending a cold shiver down Minoru's spine, who watched helplessly as his once-thin body became a distant memory.  Minoru's rear pushed out against his underwear, the sudden growth becoming obvious against the tight white pair.  His widening buttocks lay heavily against Kan's groin, causing the latter to sigh in ectsasy, pressing himself against Minoru's blubber.  The combined effect of his growing ass and widening thighs caused Minoru's underwear to pull uncomfortably tight, unable to accomodate his growth.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meanwhile, his face had rounded and become cherubic, minor flesh deposits forming on his cheeks and neck.  The fat on his chest consolidated and gathered, while his arms surged out and inflated, tearing the fabric of his sleeves.  His belly now hung over the edge of his underwear, supple and soft.  Minoru sighed as the growth began to slow down, before finally it ceased altogether.  He breathed heavily, his massive bulk expanding and contracting with every breath.  An incredible heaviness hang over him, while his distended stomach felt bloated, as if he had just consumed an entire feast all by himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKan slung a leg around Minoru's waist, moving a hand across the smoothness of his belly, kneading the flab with his nimble fingers.  Despite himself, Minoru leaned his head back and groaned, his arousal obvious against the skin-tight fabric of his underwear.  He felt a similar pressure on his behind and, for a moment, sexual lust overcame rationality.  One of Kan's hand stroked his quivering bulk, while the other slowly slid down to his crotch, tenderly rubbing his hardness.  Minoru moaned involuntarily, before snapping out of this state, swatting Kan's hands away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What have you done to me?!\" He exclaimed, awkwardly trying to waddle around to face the vampire, his new bulk leaving him unsteady and immobile.  Kan seized his fleshy arms, locking them behind Minoru, keeping him in position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is merely the liquid from the club,\" He explained, nuzzling the nape of Minoru's now-thick neck, pressing himself against the warmth of his impressive girth.  \"It will wear off, eventually.  Which is why we need to get in as much fun as possible.\"  He removed one of his hands, seizing the nozzle of a hose and bringing up next to Minoru's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want something more permanent,\" He said, his other hand seizing a mound of Minoru's wide love-handles, shaking it vigorously.  \"If size is status, than you are going to be the king around here.\"  Minoru followed the length of the hose, finding it connected to some bizarre apparatus in the corner.  Knowing what was about to happen, he...</span></div></div>",
