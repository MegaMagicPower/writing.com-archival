It was a dreamless one, until he suddenly found himself floating and a few minutes later, stand on top of something. His feet felt odd, they curled around the object and he only felt four toes, three in front and one at his heel? His legs also felt stiff, his knees not bending anymore. Quickly checking his arms, they felt stuck alongside his body, only able to flap up and down, with quite a lot of things stuck onto them. Heck, he couldn't even feel his fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis neck also felt kind of odd, being able to tilt his head in the most obscure ways. His upper body felt odd as well, more rounded out, like a barrel. Moving on to his head, it also felt oddly shaped his eyebrows feeling heavier than he remembered. His mouth feeling like it was further away from his face, as well as his nose. Suddenly a cold breeze passed him and in surprise he opened his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the...\" He said, seeing it was still night and was actually in a tree, on top of a branch.

Upon seeing this, the lugias face lit up and it jumped over to him, landing lightly and gracefully. It then held out both of its wings and stared at Damon anxiously. Damon looked at what the two wings contained, in one there was a small pool of yellow, glowing liquid. In the other there was a small pool of blue,glowing liqiud. He looked at the lugia with confusion. The lugia let out a sigh and its eyes showed slight hints of impatience. It the closed its eyes and concentrated. A small boys voice penetrated Damons mind. -Drink.- Damon looked at it in surprise, the lugia was just a child. He looked at the two puddles of liquid and made his choice, cupping his hands beneath the blue liquid. The lugia lets out an excited, melodious giggle and poured the liquid ito Damons hands who then took an exploritory sip. It tasted sweet yet minty and he drinks the rest.

As the spittal infiltrates his body it causes a tingling sensation to start at the cut and spread rapidly from there. Damon exclaimed in disgust as the lugia freed his arm and he fell backward. Damon got up and began to run but after only three steps, he exclaimed and fell as a severe bout of dizziness hit him like a wall. As he looked up with blurred vision, he saw a familliar white beaked face grinning cheerfully at him. -Sorry might be a bit... not nice- the lugia said with a slightly sheepish expression. The tingling around the cut gave way to a sort of tight feeling and he looked to see white flesh spreading from the cut like an infection. A sudden wave of agony went through him as his spine began to rapidly extend and new vertibrae struggled to keep up. He gasped as a long white tail pushed its way from his lower back forming two spikes close to the end as it went. His neck also extended and his face rapidly distorted to form a beak and three spikes. The previously skinny boy now began to fatten and as this occurred most of his cloths were destroyed. He was moaning at the feeling of the layers of fat expanding by the time his torso had become rounded and the proccess stopped as suddenly as it had started. He then yowled with pain as his feet rapidly grew and the bones fused to form three large toes. Damon could feel the lugias saliva being pumped roud his body and gaining strength as the transformation continued. Suddenly another uncomfortable feeling hit him and the tops of five sets of his ribs disconnected and rose to the surface to form ten blue flaps. His arms extended and his fingers became very thin as his thumb tucked itself beneath the others before they all grew substantially. He suddenly gave a loud moan as his phallus erected quickly, it then became red and raw, its shape became more pointed and it grew  around three times its original length and his testicles became the size of footballs and decsended about a foot before they were sucked back into his body and his penis receded into a new sheath. Damon gave a last grunt as most of his internal organs shifted.</span></div></div>",

It was difficult to resist the pleasure as the lugia massaged the head of his penis with his tongue. \"No, stop!\" he cried as he felt his whole body tense up \"I'm going to lose myself!\".

After following her for about 5 minutes, the two mews had finally arrived at a small, remote cave where Damon assumed was where Mew lived. \"Here we are, this is my home.\" Mew cheerfully said, as she invited Damon to her house. It was surprisingly spacious, it was nearly as big as Damon's old home. There was a small dining room near to the caves entrance with a seemingly natural wooden table and chairs. Beyond the dining room was a living room with an old couch and loads of random artefacts. To the right of the dining room was a large fireplace which Damon thought was the kitchen. Beyond the living room there was a large flat rock which Mew used for a bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So make yourself at home until you are your usual self.\" Mew told Damon. \"I'm sure that you will recover from your amnesia soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when it hit Damon.

After hearing the story Mew was still deciding on wether or not to believe his story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Mew asked \"So were you really a pokemon trainer about to start your journey?\" \"Yes, it's all true, I was a human before the explosion. Please, can you believe me?\" Damon asked. \"Well Damon, I must admit that although the story doesn't completely seem to be true, it <i>does</i> explain why you were acting so wierd before.\" \"So do you <i>really</i> believe me then?\" Damon repeated his question. \"Yes.\" Mew replied. \"I believe your story Damon.\" Mew started to look at the look at the ground slightly as if she felt sorry for Damon. \"You never got your first pokemon and started your adventure and yet your world has already turned upside down.\" . After seeing how sad Mew was, Damon tried to cheer her up. Aww don't worry Mew, It's not so bad. I can still have a pokemon battle occasionally, and I kinda like it being a mew.\" Mew started feeling better, wiping a tear from her eyes. \"I mean, who wouldn't dream of being a legendary pokemon, especially a powerful and cute one like you.\" Mew happily looked at Damon. \" Really, you think I'm cute?\" Damon nodded. \"You're so sweet Damon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Damon remembered about his story. \"So Mew, you said you saw me in the nearby forest.\" \"Yeah, and this is is Veridian forest by the way\" Mew added. Damon had never been to Veridian forest, but he knew about it very well. His aunt Jade and uncle Kevin lived in Veridian city. They sent him postcards until shortly after uncle Kevin went missing after an accident at bill's lab and was never seen again. \"Whatever, do you know anything about what happened to me or about the incident?\" Mew pondered for a second \"Well...</span></div></div>",

Damon couldn't shake the feeling that he had seen him before, but he just couldn't remember where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Damon sifted through the magazines again, he found his answer.

Did you come here to revive a fossil too?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"  Bill cleared his throat.  \"Actually, I came here to show someone a new invention of mine.  You see, when I invented the box system, it was a huge success.  Naturally, I wanted to try and repeat it, so I tried to make a similar system to help teleport humans over longer distances then the teleporters currently made by the Sliph co.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I head about that.\"  Damon said.  \"So you made it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes... and no, at the same time.\"  Bill admitted.  \"You see, when I made the system it didn't work as planned, and it turned me into a Clefairy for quite a while, until I met a trainer who was willing to help me reverse the process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You turned into a Clefairy?\"  Damon giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"  Bill sighed.  \"But after the trainer helped me work the telporter again, I changed back to normal.  But I realized that while my machine didn't make a good teleporter, it could bring something to revolutionize how we study and interact with Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued.  \"Imagine, being able to live as a Pokemon to understand how these creatures live more closely than we ever have before.  That's why I came here.  I figured I might find someone who would be willing to spend a moth or two as a Pokemon to study them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\"  Damon said in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say...\" Bill rubbed his chin in thought, \"Would you like to give it a try?  I'd need both you and your parents permission, but If you agree, for the month you spend as a Pokemon I'll keep you on my ranch, designed to keep Pokemon of every type health and happy, with all the food, water, and shelter you'll need.  Plus I'll pay both you and your parents a hefty sum after it's all over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just to sweeten the deal, if you make friends with one of the Pokemon on my ranch I'll let you keep him or her for your Pokemon journey once you're human again.\"  He inhaled before finishing.  \"So, what do you say?\"</span></div></div>",

Help protect me please Ummm...\" \"Names Daniel.\" \"Help me Daniel protect me from David!\" Mean while on the other side of th island something popped into Davids head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it I'm so stupid she dived and swam to the island! How did I not see that at first?\" He then swam around the giant island of Patricia while going around as he couldn't dive... Damona soon hears David swimming nearby \"Oh no he is close to finding me! I can hear him.\" \"I got an idea, but you might not like it...\" \"Im almost willing to take any chance to avoid him...\" \"You sure?\" \"Yes I'll do anything!\" \"Ok I warned you but it's the quickest thing I can think of... GO POK\u00c9BALL!\" As Damona is soon caught Daniel picks up the Pok\u00e9ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter putting it in the holdster with his Altaria, Raichu and Gardevoir he pulls out another berry knowing this Lapras named David would show up he also pulls out his Raichu also and has it in hand. And as if on cue David pulls up onto land and waits as Daniel gives him the berry. \"Have you seen a pink female Shellos named Damona?\" \"Hmmm... I see a lot of eater and ice types, but no Shellos thos are cute but rare!\" \"Thanks what's in the pokeball?\" \"Huh? Oh it's my Raichu I'm planning on training with it!\" \"Well thanks anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On the floor near the entrance, written in letters of the Unown, was the phrase: \"Those who wish to change nothing will never find the true purpose of this room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering what that was supposed to mean, Damon walked further in.  He remembered seeing a documentary of how the archeologists who unearthed this place discovered hidden rooms under each statue by radar.  However, due their inability to move the statues, or break through the floor, nobody could reach them.  Eventually, years passed, and the exploration team gave up hope of advancing any further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon let out his starter Pokemon, his Turtwig, Buddy, to walk alongside him.  Buddy was quite happy to be with Damon, and seemed very curious about the room.  He hesitantly touched a Ponyta statue.  Both he and Damon were quite shocked when the room rumbled as the statue pulled back, revealing a hole in the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah!\"  Damon shouted.  \"Buddy...\"  He said more calmly.  \"I think we've just come closer to solving an ancient mystery than any grown ups have ever tried.\"  He carefully approached the hole in the floor.  But as he did, a strange force seemed to start pulling him and Buddy into it.  Damon desperately grabbed hold of the ledge, trying to fight the pull.  Buddy started falling down the hole, but quickly bite onto Damon's leg in a desperate attempt to climb out.  But he only succeeded in dragging Damon down with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey fell for what felt like hours, before landing softly on the ground.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are we?\"  Buddy asked.  Damon gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buddy?  Did you just talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!  I did, didn't I?\"  Buddy said in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is nothing unusual about that.  In this place, there are no true forms or languages.\"  A female voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who said that?\"  Damon shuddered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ghost Pokemon that seemed to be wear a witch's hat, a Mismagius appeared before them.  \"I did.\"  She stated.  \"I must say, it's been a long time since we've had a Pokemon Trainer come down here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is 'here?'\" Buddy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This,\"  The Mismagius said, \"is where, in the days of old, humans and Pokemon would trade skins, and learn to see the world through a new pair of eyes.  I was called Madame Metamorphosis, once, but I prefer the name May.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what do you mean by switching skins?\"  Buddy asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could, if you wish, change you both.\"  May said with a grin.  \"You, Turtwig, could become a human, or any other Pokemon, if you wished, while you, young human could live as long as you liked as a Pokemon.  And any time you came back here, either of you could change your species again, or go back to the way you were before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, I could see what it's like to be human, then come back and be a Turtwig again?\"  Buddy asked?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed.\"  May said.  \"In fact you and your trainer agree, you could be the trainer, and he the Pokemon for a time, if you like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds kinda fun!\"  Damon said excitedly.  \"Let's try it, Buddy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do it!\"  Buddy nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then...\" May grinned, \"what species do you wish to be human?  At the moment, we are in the Ponyta room, so that is what you would be if cast the spell now.  Is that to your liking, or should we resurface, and use a different statue's room?\"</span></div></div>",

Incantation, Focus, Rune, and Flow, are four common types. Incantation relies on a specific phrase to cast a spell, Though since you are pokemon I wouldn't suggest trying this. Focus is much more common, wands are a kind of focus, To use focus you need to channel all your will to magical spot or object then it casts the spell, This would be most beneficial for you Lisa, Your third eye is a perfect medium for focus, though don't try casting spells with just yet. Rune, relies on images that invoke the hidden magic of the universe that is ever present, This tends to have a downfall of having time to set it up usualy, Damona this style would be best suited to you because of your illusions. And lastly Flow, tapping directly into the magic in the universe and using body motion and will to channel and direct it, This would be best for you Erica.\" The magician Explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dispel is easy, and very useful, It simply dispels magical energy. I'll levitate those three rocks over there, you try to cast dispel to get them to fall, It is very useful if a spell starts to get out of control, though it does have limits to what it can do.

I've choosen you so I can hide from the humans that are chasing me right now\" said Prisca.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if I want you hiding my body\" said Damona. \"I'm afraid you got no choice. Forgive me Damona. But I must hide. You'll have your body back once the danger is over\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrisca then leaves the Mew's body and morph's into a ball of energy and hit's Damona. A black aura surrounds Damona as she tries to fight it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was no use. Prisca had full control of her body as Damona's eyes change to look like Prisca's. Prisca then wakes up and examines herself in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look very cute as a Zorua. I do apologize Damona. You will have your body back soon\" Prisca said to herself.</span></div></div>",

His dick and balls shrink until they become a female vagina. As this happens the magian says \"And now behold as I have turned a normal boy into a Latias!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he removes the box Damon stands there staring at the crowd as the gasp at the Latias who was a boy.

Well the young boy is now a young girl...\" He snaps his fingets and Damon then is turned intro a human state through Latias's special shap shifting ability.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere Damon or should we call her Damona stands there in female clothes and almost falls over do the the large F-cup breast causing a change in weight so he is a little top heavy. \"Lets give a round of applause for the young trainer!\" The crowd gives a loud clapping applause. The magician walks over and says \"Take a bow for the crowd.\" As told with his free will she takes a bow before standing back up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you tommorow will be my last show until we go to the next city!\" Damona is given her own room which is bigger than the others for some reason. As the Magician comes in and talks to the young lady still as a human. \"I'm going to tell you a secret. Ready?\" \"Yes, What is it?\" Surprized by his new female voice he looks into the mirror to see his natural colored hair in a wavy sort of fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The trick to turning between human and pok\u00e9mon is... All you have to do is think about it your very pretty you know.\" \"I admit I am pretty as a female trainer. Can't I be a latios instead?\" \"Sorry this is permenant. Didn't think about that.\" Damona sighs as she resigns herself to her fate. The magician speaks up and says \"But I got a surprize for you.\" \"What kind of surprise?\" \"You will see tomorrow! Have a good rest of the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that note the magician walks out to check on his other crew members leaving Damona by herself. Oddly she felt lonely then she remembered Latias always looked for a Latios! He then decides to try something out he thinks and becomes a pok\u00e9mon Latias and tries again and becomes a female trainer again but has no pok\u00e9balls as he is merely a stage performer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning she gets dressed and walks out as the crowd is amazed at her body she was in one of those bras that makes your chest look bigger. As she then goes back stage she hears the magician say \"I would like another volunteer please ah you my young lady.\" As Damon realizes he is doing the trick again he peeks and it's his best friend!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall now turn this young lady into a Strong Latios!\" As a box appears she steps in not thinking it would work. As a white mist is entering the box he taps the box and says a few words and then a flash the box is removed and there floating is you best friend a Strong Latios! \"Give a round of applause for the young lady!\" Like before the crowd claps and he snaps his finger as she becomes a pretty charming Male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamona is getting slightly turned on by the sight of her best friend Dianna. Now Dan is sent back stage to his own room. The magician brings Dan into Damona's room and says \"Here's my suprize! A big Strong Latios for my lovely Latias.

In a few minuets. Dan finishes and shoots his load into his new mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamona moans one last time as the two lays there a bit. Dan removes himself slowly and licks off any cum on Damona's pussy. \"That was great Dan\" said Damona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed. Thanks for letting me mate with you\" said Dan. \"Thank you for the best sex\" said Damona. It was then getting late.

The master should know your pregnant. You won't be able to perform for a while. Still it would have been interesting to have you perform with us\" said Meg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that?\" Damona ask. \"The master has plans for a big show with all the grass type pokemon. But my mate left before we could do it. But with you. We can now perform the trick. As soon as you give birth\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeg then tells the Magician about Damona. \"She's pregnant huh? Well there's nothing we can do about that. She won't be performing for a while. Our biggest trick will have to wait\" said the Magician. </span></div></div>",

Prince Damon tried to calm his descendant. \"This is powerful magic Damon. We don't want to interrupt it or something terrible could happen to us.\" That is when the changes began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, it seemed as if each other the Damons were becoming some kind of Pokemon. Their hands started to grow claws. Puff of fur began to grow in many places along their bodies. Their bodies themselves began to get bigger. Then something shocking started. The ancestor and the descendant were drawn closer to each other. When their skin touched, they instantly began to merge. All the while, their bodies were loosing their human features, becoming pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, a sudden surge of energy came from the amulet. The changes began to reverse. Prince Damon and Damon began to shrink back to their normal size. Their claws receded into fingernails. At last, all of their Pokemon changes returned to normal and the glow from the amulet stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlind and disoriented, both Damond tripped and fell backwards. They tumbled down the small hill and into a dark, murky, but shallow lake. Like drowning fish, they flailed in the water, trying to figure out which direction was up and down.

Each took large gasps of air, and coughed out the small amount of water they had inhaled. \"Well, that was fun.\" Prince Damon joked between coughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, real fun.\" Damon smiled. Both young men sat up so their heads stuck out of the water. Everything else was hidden underneath the muddy and dark waters. \"Well, that was weird. I didn't know that my amulet was magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew that my amulet had magic. You can sense that kind of stuff when your a pok\u00e9mage.\" Prince Damon finished with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your a mage, like with real magic.\" Damon asked excitedly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes of course. Our family line is very magical. I'm a fire-type mage... well an apprentice mage to be exact. I'm still in training.\" Prince Damon kindly replied. Then his thoughts returned back to the amulet. \"It is curious about the amulet though. Transformation spells, like what our amulets were charmed with, usually only work with one individual. Complications arise if there are more people.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Complications? What kind of complications?\" Worry was obvious in Damon's voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry; it looks like nothing wrong happened to us. The transformation reversed itself; we're human and not some kind of pok\u00e9mon-human hybrid.\" Prince Damon reassured his descendant. But then a sudden realization hit him. His body. He could not feel all of his body. Half of it felt like it was missing. He couldn't see it through the murky water, so he hadn't realized it until now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same thoughts were running through Damon's mind. Including the fact that their heads were awfully close to on another. Both Damons looked at each other, scared. Damon brought his right hand to the right half of his chest, just underneath his neck. The clothes he felt were foreign. It wasn't the same shirt he had been wearing a few minutes ago. He slowly slide his hand across his chest until he passed what should have been the center of his chest. Feeling abruptly ended as he passed the direct middle, and Prince Damon shuddered. \"You can feel my hand...?\" Prince Damon just nodded in response. \"I think there was a complication?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if to answer that question. The murky water cleared as the dirt settled back down. It was obvious that the two Damons now shared a single body bellow their necks. Their clothes were an odd blend of the clothing they had been wearing previously. Hanging directly in front of their joined chests was a single amulet. There was no crack or any indication that the amulet had ever been in two pieces. \"Yes...\" Prince Damon replied, stunned that his voice was still steady. \"...there was defiantly a complication.\"</span></div></div>",

But they were having a hard time. \"Moving in a single body is hard\" said Damon. \"Yeah I have to agree on that\" said the prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapidash then came to them and was surprise to see her master having two heads. The prince pet's his Rapidash. \"Everything will be fine Rapidash\" said the prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's one royal Rapidash\" said Damon. \"I've been friends with Rapidash when it was still Ponyta. I keep her in the stables with the other Rapidash. We need to get back to the castle. The royal wizard might help us\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a little trouble. The two Damon's got onto the Rapidash. \"I don't think we thought this through\" said Damon. \"Why is that?\" The prince ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think people will find it weird that their prince had two heads that look the same\" said Damon. \"I'll think of something.

The prince tells about himself and it seems the two were getting along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they make it back to the castle without being notice and put Rapidash back in her stable. The prince gives her a treat. \"She's very beautiful\" said Damon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take good care of her\" said the prince. The two enters the castle with some trouble. They manage of avoiding the castle servents and his brothers Brendan and Aaron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they get to the wizards chambers. \"My prince it is good to see you. But your magic lesson doesn't start in another hour. Unless you want to do it early\" said the wizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually wizard. I need your help\" said the prince. The wizard didn't see the prince when he enter. He then turns around and was shock to see a two headed human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My prince. What happen to you? I didn't teach you to make two heads of you yet\" said the wizard. \"My name is Damon. I came from the future. I was teleported here by some sort of spell\" said Damon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From the future? You don't say\" said the wizard. \"Yeah and this is the proof\" They then show the full amulet. \"The amulet is complete again. Tell me young man. Where did you get it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My grandma gave it before she pass away. I treasure this the most\" said Damon. \"Wizard can you\" But before the prince finish. The amulet begins to glow and changing their body's before they change back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What just happen?\" Damon ask. \"Oh dear. I was afraid of this. My prince and your decendent. The two of you must separate yourself's and the amulet before it's too late\" said the wizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before what's too late?\" The prince ask. \"If the two of you don't separate. Then the amulet will keep changing you and change you back. When it's done changing you. The two of you will become the strongest and dangerous pokemon ever\" said the wizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happens if we can't get it off?\" The prince ask. \"Then I'm afraid the two of you will stay as a pokemon forever. We don't got much time\" said the wizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know what pokemon we'll turn into?\" Damon ask. \"No and I don't want to know.

We can't let him see us like this.\" Scared out of their minds, any sort of coordination the two had developed in their short time bound together was quickly lost. Prince Damon frantically tried direct them to hide underneath the table cloth while Damon tried to hide behind the curtains of the window. Their body leaned back and forth as the two sides each Damon controlled battled to pull the other. Inevitably, the Damons tripped on each other and collapsed face-first into the hard stone floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard stifled a laugh. \"Just stand and look natural you two.\" he said while helping them back to their feet. Damon heard him whisper a phrase under his breathe. It was strange, like a very old english or something. What was even weirder was that he could understand some of the words he whispered in this old language. The Wizard finished the last words of his spell, and his bright blue eyes glowed faintly. And not a moment too soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King rudely pushed the door to the Wizard's chamber wide open. \"Wizard, why did you not speak when I called?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sire, I was busy entertaining the young prince.\" The wizard calmly replied. Both Damons stared at the wizard in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry son. I did not see you there.\" The king smiled toward the Damons before turning back to the Wizard. \"At least I know where one of my sons are now. Anyways, I am in need of your assistance Wizard. Can you prepare a strong sleeping draft? The queen and I both have had trouble these past few nights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, your highness. I will brew it, and have it delivered to your chambers before nightfall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe King, looking pleased, turned on his heal and left down the corridor. His boots echoing through the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Damons turned to the wizard and spoke at once, \"What did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe responded with a smile. \"Just a simple spell to hide your... attachment issue. When people look at you, they will only see one of you. This will allow you to go out and not fear being seen. But, be careful when speaking. The spell does not hide sound.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon looked towards his counterpart. \"Well, I guess that's one less thing we have to worry about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wizard, do you have any idea where we should begin to figure out how to separate ourselves?\" the Prince asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might. What if we traveled back to the future. The book I was reading must have some answers about this.\" Damon answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not.\" The wizard stated. \"It is far too dangerous, especially in your condition. You, Damon, were lucky to not be destroyed instantly when you cast that spell. Time-travel is dangerous, and no one knows how time works exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Both Damons asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time is... complicated. Prince Damon, if you had read the book I gave you for your studies, then you would know. But, I will briefly explain. There are three theories to how time-travel works. First, time travel is impossible, but we already know that to be false. Second, time-travel will change nothing. You coming back to this time was supposed to happen; the future and past are interconnected. One supports the other. This however is pish-posh in my opinion. I believe that time travel works more closely to the third theory. This is where time-travel is possible, and time is changeable. So therefore, you coming back has changed the future, so the future you cam from, Damon, no longer exists. This is now a alternate time-line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean, I messed things up by coming back here. I destroyed the time I came from?\" Damon was not pleased to hear that. He felt terrible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you didn't destroy it. Your original time still does exist, but it is now impossible for you to return. Think of it as a worm tunneling through the dirt. You came back to an earlier part of the tunnel, and now you are going up a different path, a new path. But anyways, we can argue theories of time later. You two have far more important things to worry about now. To answer your early question, Prince Damon; I would suggest going to the court library. I would go with you to help, but I have to start on this sleeping draft if I am to keep my position as Court Wizard.\" With that, the wizard turned and started collecting supplies from his potions cupboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Damons, slowly and carefully walked out of the Wizard's chambers and into the hallway. Their merged body was still so new to them, walking and many other efforts would take much time to re-learn. Hopefully, they wouldn't need to though. \"Alright\" the prince turned to his other half. \"Do you think we should take a trip to the Library?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon giggled a bit at the mention of going to the library. The prince looked at him funny, so he explained. \"Its just that this all started because I took a trip to the library. Now this part of the adventure might end back in the library. Its ironic.\" Then a thought occurred to Damon, \"Did the court wizard really mean to teach you how to grow a second head later?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prince smiled, \"No, he was just joking, and understandably shocked by our appearance. But maybe when this is all done, we can learn magic from the wizard together. I really do want to know what type of magic you have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think I have magic?\" Damon asked confused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, all members of the royal family have some affinity to magic. Even my dad, the king does. But he is terrible at it; hence why we have a court wizard. But, it should be obvious that you have magic. How else were you able to come back here and end up stuck to me.\" The prince smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon smiled back. \"Well, I never thought of it that way. Maybe I do have magic. Now I am curious about what type I am too.\" Reality of their situation sunk back in though. \"Though, we need to fix our current predicament first. Why don't you lead the way. I will follow wherever you think we should go, not that I have much choice in the matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prince lightly padded the spot where their necks joined the same shoulders. \"Well hopefully, you will have a choice in the matter soon.\" Suddenly, their form shifted again between a two-headed pokemon and back to their human form. \"That is our cue to get back on track to solving this.\" The boys then headed off down the corridor, hugging the walls for balance.</span></div></div>",

Your looking for a way to become king\" said the prince.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what makes you think that?\" Aaron said to his brother. \"Because I know you. Ever since we were kids.

I found our amulet\" said Damon. \"That's great. But what pokemon is that?\" The prince ask. \"Hmm let me read it. Acording to this. The pokemon seal in the amulet is a two headed Zoroark\" said Damon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've learn about Zoroark's from the wizard. But I never heard, or seen, a two headed one\" said the prince. \"Well it say's here the Zoroark use to be a one headed Zoroark before merging with it's brother\" said Damon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there brother's huh?\" said the prince. \"The two headed Zoroark brothers wanted to become stronger.

No, this page is thicker than the rest, and the writing abruptly ends. There is more about our amulet here, I know it.\" Damon flipped the page back and forth, trying to see if more pages were stuck. \"Help me with this will you?\" Damon asked, a little irritated with only having one arm to work with. Prince Damon reach over and tried helping his counterpart see if the pages were stuck together. They weren't. \"Man, I thought for sure that had to be something more here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait\" the prince said, a little louder than he had intended. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is everything alright my lord...\" the librarian asked as he appeared between two shelves. \"I thought I heard you talking with someone.\" The man's eyes scanned the area Damon and the prince were in. The wizards spell was still holding, despite their quick transformation earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, sorry I disturbed you. I was just speaking aloud, trying to figure... actually, I could use your help.\" the Prince finally said. Damon gave him a shocked look; the prince stared him back. He tried telling him, through his eyes, not to worry and follow along. The prince turned back to the librarian, \"I need help with this book. It seems that there is a hidden page, but I can't get to it.\" The prince tried to pick up the book, but it was too heavy and awkward to move by just himself. He looked at Damon's hand, just resting on the table, and then he looked to Damon. Seeming to get the message, Damon grabbed ahold of the other side of the book, and helped the prince hand the book to the librarian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe librarian took a few moments to look at the pages, turning them back and forth, and scanning through them. \"Doing some light reading for your magic studies?\" the librarian asked to which the prince just nodded. \"Well, many of the books written in this time do have hidden passages in them. Like here, you can see that the author has an unfinished thoughts about these Zoroak brothers.\" He waved one of his hands over the book, saying a few lines in the old language. The pages of the book glowed faintly, and the book seemed to then get thicker. \"There, I have... unlocked the pages you wanted.\" The librarian handed the book back to them, and noticed the medallion. He face suddenly became fearful, before he masked it with an obvious fake smile. \"If that is all my lord, I have books to reorganize.\" He gave a quick bow, and disappeared through the shelves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon and the prince shared a confused glance. \"That was weird.\" The prince pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not worry about that now. Here are the missing pages we needed.\" Damon responded. He and the prince positioned their body over the book so they could both read together. Their four eyes bounced across the pages, reading each word carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey found that the book indeed had more information to offer. It went deeper into the history, explaining why this all occured. Long ago, the medallions jewelry owned by two twin princes. They had charmed their medallions with the power to transform them into Zoroaks. The crown princess, their elder sister, despised the brothers. She was afraid that they had the eye on her throne, which she was correct in assuming. The brothers had tried to murder her in her sleep as the Zoroaks they could become. As an accomplished witch, the princess used her powers to banish the brothers through time. By accident, her spell misfired. She accidentally sent them 80 years into the future, with no way to return. In addition, her spell accidentally cursed the brothers to remain in their pokemon forms. The Zoroak brothers decided to take their revenge on the grandchildren of their sister, the current king and his family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Damons were astonished at how evil sounding these brothers were. As they continued reading, they finally got to the part about the medallions. If they were ever brought back together, the books explained that the wearer would be instantly destroyed and replaced with the powerful two-headed Zoroak twins. \"Wait... \" Damon interrupted their reading. \"Why weren't we instantly destroyed by the twins' return?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prince was quick to answer; his face loosing color. \"Its because there were two of us. The medallions were only meant to be worn by one person... not two. Because we both wore them...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we both wore them what? What does it mean?\" Damon said, pressing him for an answer. If could feel Prince Damon's fear running through their body and into him. His veins felt cold as ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means that it gave us a fighting chance to figure out a way to stop them from returning... but it also means... it also means that we probably won't have separate bodies again.\" The prince Damon said. \"The wearer was 'instantly destroyed'... or in our case, part of each of us <i>was </i>destroyed. The body we now share... is all we have left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon felt like he had been punched in the stomach. Or, at least half of his stomach. Damon swallowed hard. He was frightened about what the prince had concluded, but... \"We can't worry about that now.\" Damon said, surprised that his voice stayed steady. \"We need to stop the twins from returning. We need to save your kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its not my kingdom!\" the prince yelled. \"Aaron is the crown prince. It will be his a soon as our father dies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon debated telling the prince what he knew. Finally, he said, \"Prince... Damon... you will rule the kingdom. I read it in the book that brought me here. You, Damon, become king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah\" The prince glared at Damon, \"and what you read is meaningless now. You changed things by coming here. Your future is gone now... remember what the wizard said. Time is not set on the pages of a book. You changed things. And I helped.\" The prince looked defeated as he slammed his head on the table in font of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon forced them to sit straight back up, to try and have a normal conversation. \"What do you mean? I'm sorry if I changed things. But we can try to change them back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you don't understand.\" the prince insisted. \"Didn't you ever wonder how one simple magical phrase could bring you back here. You may have magic, but you have no practice with it. On your own... that would be impossible. I helped you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long minute of silence between them. \"I have a gift.\" The prince finally admitted. \"I have a gift in divination, seeing possible futures. I knew that in all of the possible futures I wouldn't become king, and I could see my brother ruining everything. So, I decided to make a drastic change. I... I wrote the book you read with my brother Brendan's help. I wrote the spell you read into it.\" He looked at Damon apologetically. \"You read half of the spell needed to go through time. I used the other half to make a bridge, to change things drastically. For a long time, no one ever came through the bridge. So, I decided to channel my spell through the medallion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon looked at the prince. He could sense what he did. \"The medallions strengthened the bridge because they were linked despite the distance of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\" the prince answered. \"I swear I didn't know anything else about the medallions besides that. I would never put you or the kingdom in jeopardy. I'm sorry. I caused this to happen. I caused us to be joined like we are. I didn't realize it until now.... I'm so sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon wasn't angry with the prince, enough though he thought that he should be. He grabbed his other half by his shoulder, trying to comfort him. \"Look, you don't have sole blame for this. I read that spell, even if I didn't know what I was doing. I wanted to learn about my past. Being joined... not exactly how I wanted to learn about my ancestors, but at least I have a front row seat. And that wasn't your fault anyway. You couldn't have know that the medallions house evil twins looking for revenge.\" Damon smiled, trying to loosen the situation. \"We will fix this. You wanted to make a better future, well I will try and help. I was an orphan in the future. I had not future there, but maybe in the past I do. Even if we remain attached... we'll find a way to deal with it. Look at the bright side, there are two of us in one... we can get double the girls.\" The joke finally brought a smile to his other half's face. \"But first... we need to stop the twins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prince, feeling more confident, answered strongly, \"You're right. Thank you for helping me. We need to stop the twins.\" An aura of confidence surrounded him. \"We need to destroy the medallion. Destroying them will destroy the twins.\"</span></div></div>",

Currently, they were in the transformation classroom.

You don't look much older than I am?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been here for about three years now. This school takes students as early as 10 years old, but I enrolled when I was 12.\" Magninus replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are as old as I am... but you have already been here for three years.\" Damon was a little upset. He was way behind this student in terms of skill and knowledge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about discovering you powers late. Everyone finds there powers at different times, and here, you will learn quickly from the professors. Though, I am interested what house you will be sorted into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? What do you mean?\" Damon was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I thought you knew already. There are 6 houses, each is compressed of three different types of mages. \" Magninus said matter-of-factly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Types of mages? Like Pokemon types?\" Damon scratched an itch on his chin. \"I thought mages could do all sorts of magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can, but there are limits. Every mage falls into a type, like Pokemon. Some mages, like myself and some Pokemon, fall into two types. And also just like Pokemon, each type of mage has strengths, weakness, and unique abilities.\" Magninus tried to explain it as simply as possible. \"Um, for example grass type mages can control plant life and turn into grass type pokemon. Grass type mages have a disadvantage when fighting fire type mages, but an advantage against water type mages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just like the respective Pokemon do. Okay, I understand better. So, a lot of the same rules apply.\" Damon smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\" Magninus smiled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what type of mage are you? And who is your Pokemon partner?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a... you know what. I will let you find out when I learn what type of mage you are during the sorting ceremony tonight.\" Magninus looked at his watch, and panic washed over his face. \"Which is going to start soon. Quick, I'll take you to the main dinning hall!\" With that, Magninus rushed off down the corridor with Damon hot on his heel. </span></div></div>",

There were other trainers waiting to be sorted as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm nervous\" said Damon. \"Don't be. You'll do fine. You'll be fine. I'll see you later Damon\" Magninus then goes sit down at a table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe students were then sorted out one by one. Damon could see they were nervous like him. All the students were sorted into different houses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it was Damon's turn to be sorted into a house. It only took a few minuets. But he was sorted into a house. He was going to be a grass type mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamon felt excited. Grass type pokemon was one of his favorite type of pokemon. After being sorted Damon sat at the table with the other grass type mages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the ceremony was over and eating dinner. Damon and everyone left the dinning room. Magninus then goes up to Damon feeling happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damon congratulations. Your a grass mage\" said Magninus. \"Thanks grass type pokemon is one of my favorite types\" said Damon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so happy for you\" said Magninus. \"So what kind of mage are you?\" Damon ask. \"I'm a fire mage\" said Magninus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that means you have the type advantage against me\" said Damon. \"True but that doesn't mean we can be friends right?\" Magninus ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not. I want to be your friend\" said Damon. \"I'm glad to hear that. There going to take you to your house now. I'll see you later\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagninus then left with the other fire mages. Damon follow's the grass mages and couldn't wait to start becoming a grass mage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day. Damon wakes up and meets with Magninus. \"Morning Damon. Ready to start?\" Magninus ask. \"Yeah but I could use your help getting to my class's\" said Damon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave it to me. I'll help you out any which way\" Magninus then helps Damon with his first day at school</span></div></div>",

How have you been doing Magninus?\" one of the students ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of my way. I have to take Damon to the coronation ceremony so he can join our school\" said Magninus. \"Not a chance. We have enough students here already\" said the second student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know these students?\" Damon ask. \"Yes their a bunch of bullies who always pick on me and change me most of the time. There bug mages\" said Magninus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly and the two of you should be bug types. Hmm let's start with the new kid first. I bet he would like to be a little bug\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they could say anything. Damon was hit by one of the mages spells and shrunk into his clothes. \"Damon! Your not going to get away with this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagninus try to cast a spell. But he was too late as he too got hit, by a spell, and shrinks into his clothes. \"That takes care of them. Let's head to the dinning hall\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bug mages then left. A Caterpie came out of Damon's clothes and a Weedle came out of Magninus clothes. \"I didn't expect to be change into a bug pokemon on my first day\" said Damon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They won't get away with this. This is the third time they change me into a Weedle. We need to tell one of the teachers about this. Come on we have to the grand hall\" said Magninus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they change us into the weakest of bug types and were slow as well\" said Damon. \"Don't worry. I know a quick way to get there. After being change into a Weedle. I've discover many places a bug type pokemon can get too. I found the quickest way to the grand hall. Just follow me and we'll get to your coronation ceremony\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMagninus then leads Damon to the grand hall</span></div></div>",
