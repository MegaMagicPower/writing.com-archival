If only I can have some respect.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Butters spotted the rock. The boy was speechless for its beauty and decided to pick it up. Finally, he came to his senses as he inspected the rock. \"What is it?\" he asked still staring at until he realized how cold the outside world was. \"I sure could use a coat.\" he said to himself when he felt something on his chest. he looked at it and saw there was a black coat on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nButters looked around him to find anyone else and found no one. He looked at coat then at the stone he held.\"Oh hamburgers!

It doesn't come out the way you want it to but the way you 'say' it. So being specific is a must.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly for the young Scotch he made a very bad wish. You see unlike superman and other comic book hero's people in real life need large and dense muscles to be strong. Body builder's are at least twice the size of an ordinary adult man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat meant Butter's being real and not a comic charecter would grow strong like a normal person. By gaining large muscles. Not just large but the largest and densest muscles in the world to surpass the strength of the worlds strongest man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe key word being 'man'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButter's. A formally scrawny 9 year old boy was now more muscular than a fully grown adult bodybuilder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly the wish did not adjust his skeletel structure. His giant muscles were so closly packed that they pushed against each other. Stopping movement all together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nButters tried to move.

Live on the undersides of stones and as our hapless hero held the stone above his head he got a shower of creepy crawlies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis of course sent Butters into something of a stampede and soon there was a path of devastation all the way through a section of South Park's local forest.

If something didn't change he'd become the \"Obvious nutter\" that the cops arrested when some random drifter/criminal did something awful and they failed to find anyone else to blame.

I need everyone to exit out of the building in a orderly fashion m'kay? No running cause it's against school rules and it's bad m'kay?\" But no one paid him any mind as any remaining students and teachers ran for the nearest exit door meanwhile Wendy continued to grow like crazy and despite being a normally calm and cool headed person she was seriously freaking out <br>\r\n\"AHHHHHHH I...I\"M STILL GROWING SOMEBODY HELP ME!!\" She screamed out as her body was literally growing out of control she was also nearly naked save for her bra and underwear luckily the three boys managed to get out of the side-door in the gym just as Wendy's head  burst though the school ceiling and Stan,Kyle and Eric's mouths were dropped to the ground <br>\r\n\"Wha th-\" <br>\r\n\"Ahhhh cool!\" Eric exclaimed <br>\r\n\"It's not cool Cartman you moron!

Did you not hear me say my power's almost gone? It took  a bunch of magic just to make her grow I need a whole load of it to shrink her back and besides I'm not really feeling up to changing her back she was mean to me but  I think I got something else in mind....\" And with another swipe of his hand POOF! Kyle was transformed into a chicken! <br>\r\n\"Hahahaha you're a chicken Kyle! See what I did to Kyle Stan? Pretty sweet huh?\" <br>\r\n\"Cartman stop screwing around and turn Wendy back to normal.\" Stan protested watching the Chicken that was his best friend start clucking and pecking at the ground <br>\r\n\"Nope can't Stan just used up the rest of my power on Kyle here I'm all wiped out.\" <br>\r\n\"WHAT??\" Stan screamed but as he went to throttle Cartman Butters came rushing up to them <br>\r\n\"Fellows did you see what just happened to Wendy? It's all over town!\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah we know Butters it was Cartman he got or had some sort of magical powers he turned Wendy into this giant.\" Stan said grabbing hold of Kyle the chicken as he sought to fly away <br>\r\n\"Wow really Eric? Neato!\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah it was pretty sweet Butters! But now my powers are gone too bad I had a bunch of things I wanted to do with them.\" Eric bragged <br>\r\n\"Cartman you know when Wendy looks down and sees us you're going to be the first person she's going to try and grab.\" <br>\r\n\"Yeah whatever guys! I'm not that concerned about Wendy she wasn't much of a threat before and there's no reason to believe she's a threat now.\" <br>\r\n\"Keep telling yourself that Cartman but I would be more afraid for what she might do to you if she caches you.\" Stan said <br>\r\n\"Shouldn't we be more concerned to what she might do to the town rather than just Eric?\" Butters asked curiously glancing up at the giant girl as she was still in dire shock at her now  tiny surroundings <br>\r\n\"To tell the truth Butters I seriously doubt Wendy would have the heart to want to hurt or cause injury to anyone she's always been so compassionate about others.\" Stan pointed out Cartman rolled his eyes <br>\r\n\"Proves to what you know Stan.\" <br>\r\n\"Shut Up Cartman!\" Just then Wendy finally stared down at the three of them with her eyes wide she.....</span></div></div>",

Murderous was more like it. \"Ah, nuts.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, you little fatso-\"<br>\r\n\"BIG-BONED !\" <br>\r\n\"-you have ten seconds to get me back to my normal size !\" demanded Wendy, her sugary breath almost blowing Cartman's cap away.<br>\r\n\"Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm... nah.\" shrugged Cartman. <br>\r\n\"<b>WHAT ?!</b>\" thundered Wendy, squeezing the boy harder.<br>\r\n\"Air...

Kyle told me. It was when...\" Stan reminisced of a certain substitute teacher, Wendy's green-eyed reaction, and her retaliation. At that last part, Stan became horrified. \"Dude ! I have to get up there, or she's seriously going to kill Cartman !\"<br>\r\n\"And... that's bad. Right ?\" asked Butters, honestly not sure.<br>\r\n\"Yeah ! I mean, Cartman sucks and all, but Wendy's gonna have to live with murder on her conscience ! Um, another one !\"<br>\r\n\"But didn't she already crush people in our school ?\"<br>\r\n\"We don't know their names, dude, they'll be back before you know it.\" rationalised Stan.<br>\r\n\"Oh, that makes sense ! I guess...\"<br>\r\n\"I'm coming Wendy !\" shouted Stan, unheard by the 50 foot girl, as she kept on threatening Cartman, while the fat boy kept alternating between bargaining, pleading, and insulting her further out of habit. Stan saw the challenge ahead of him : climbing the body of his ginormous underwear-clad girlfriend. Difficult, but also a really, really awkward for future discussions. \"Ah geez, why does every day has to be so weird around here ?\"<br>\r\nStan began his climbing, first up her foot, then her leg, and then he came to the underwear blockade. Deciding this was just that little bit too awkward, Stan jumped from her body to her long black hair, and pursued his ascent. He'd pause to, um, admire the beautiful, dazzling, peach-skinned scenery, and was really grateful he didn't throw up anymore. A couple minutes later, he reached Wendy's shoulder.<br>\r\n\"...SAY IT ! SAY YOU'RE A FAT LITTLE CANCER ! SAY IT !!!\" Wendy pratically foamed at the mouth.<br>\r\n\"Hate you... so much...\" wheezed Cartman, his face getting to a lovely shade of purple.<br>\r\n\"WENDY !\" Stan shouted as loud as he could. Wendy was able to hear him, and spotted her tiny boyfriend. The mere sight of him made her pause in her wrath.<br>\r\n\"S...Stan ?\" she asked softly, almost woozily.<br>\r\n\"Wendy, I know Cartman's a moron, and it's all his fault. And he deserves more than a kick in the nuts for what he did to you.\"<br>\r\n\"<i>Haaate... So muuuuch...\"</i><br>\r\n\"But he isn't worth killing ! Not by you. I know you're better than that.\"<br>\r\n\"But just look at me ! He made me a freak ! And half-naked for all the town to see ! And what I did to the school, I... I...\" she hyperventilated, all of her cool demanor gone. Now her voice was torn between shameful embarassement, and unbridled rage for the boy in her hand.<br>\r\n\"It's gonna be alright, Wendy. We fixed WAY weirder shit before, and we can do it again. I bet even Kenny will help !\"<br>\r\n\"But he's dead !\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he does that.\" Stan shrugged casually. Wendy's stance began to waver, her pressure on Cartman starting to ease up. Stan knew it was time to go for the kill, putting a hand on her neck.\" Please, Wendy ? I trust you.\"<br>\r\n\"I...\" began Wendy. \"I...\"</span></div></div>",

Well fortunatly I know the cure for what you have. I wish we were both at the dinner table.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shimmer they were both seated at opposite ends of Kyles family dinner table.

Every single dish was filled to almost overflow and had more food one even the tea plates dotted about it than he thought even Cartman could eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Kosher of course, the spell was made so Kyle would eat it after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dig in fatass.\" Cartman said malevolently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle was about to give him the bird when he felt his body moving on it's own, reaching foward in almost a lunge to reach the food.

The next one doubled that to 372. Finally this one doubled that yet again bringing him up to a whooping 744 pounds. That was enough to rendder a full grown man immobile, on an 8 year old.....well the description wa best left for another chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy your dinner Kyle?\" Cartman said sweatly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....\" Kyle was to dazed to say anything, his stomach however was not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*GGGRRROOOWWWLLL*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cartmans eyes genuinly showed confusion and amazment. \"Wow that 'always' hungry part of teh wish really work's.\" Cartmans face grew twisted again. \"And since your hungry again, you know what that means?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyles eyes squinted as even without Cartman wishing for it the table filled up once more with food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wished that this table had enough food to fill you when you were hungry Kyle, when ever your hungry. And since I wished that your always hungry....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyles squinting eyes widened as best they could in horror as the food began once more to float towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...It means Kyle, youll never stop eating for the rest of your life.

It was then Bebe came to only one logical, completely realistic conclusion<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a wishing rock\" Bebe would have said if Mr Mackey and the police hadn't found her first and forced her back to the school, into the principal's office.

A beam of light shoots out of the gun and baths Kenny making him glow and then she begins to inflate like a helium balloon very rapidly.

While all the adults aged down to varying degrees, most of the 4th graders in South Park at least now found their parents (mostly) to be of the same age as them now.  Not knowing what to do about the change, everyone stayed home, school canceled for the time being since all the teachers and faculty were children now too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n. . .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 10 year old Randy was sitting on the couch in his underwear, just staring at the ever static tv (no one was operating the TV bandwidth/signals in South Park anymore).  \"Ha ha, very funny\" Randy commented.  It did not occur to him that the static was not part of that Terrance and Philip Show Stan and his friends watch.  Meanwhile Sharon was in the kitchen attempting to cook, now that she had been regressed back into a 10 year old girl she had to rely on a stool to see over the counter and do anything - she had to get a ladder however to actually get the cooking tools and ingredients.  She was cooking a pot of Kraft Mac and Cheese - and that's about it, she got tired of the limitations her regressed body presented when it came to cooking so she simply decided to make the easiest thing she had available.  She was not all too happy about being 10 again either.  Shelly was picking on Stan more often, venting out her frustrations at having a mom and dad who were younger than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile at the Brofloski houshold, Shiela found it more difficult to take care of Ike, having to have to interrupt Kyle from whatever it was he would be doing to help out.  Gerald on the other hand was busy turning to drinking - soda this is - and gambling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMrs Cartman still gave Eric Cartman a bunch of fattening desserts, acting as though nothing had changed - other than that she was hitting on children now that she was a kid herself<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenny's parents simply watched the static tv along with their children, having not occurred to them either that the static was not part of some joke.  Kenny, bored out of his mind, shot himself to death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, Kenny killed himself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"that bastard\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden a taxi came and went near the town.  Curious, as there had not been any contact with the outside world for a long time, the townschildren swarmed outside.  In the distance they saw a figure, a figure who was coming closer - a figure who looked all too familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I quit the presidency and moving back here\" said the voice of Mr Garrison.  My Garrison then realized that everyone before him were a bunch of children.  \"shouldn't you creeps be at school?  Where the heck are your parents?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan sighed nerviously.  \"uhhh Mr garrison...  our parents are present here....\" he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh very funny, now seriously go back to school you little sickos\", Mr Garrison replied, pointing at a random child - only to his horror the child before him looked too familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The school is closed due to the recent circumstances, Mkay\" the young Mr Mackey said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once it processed in Mr Garrison's head that this was no prank, the entire town was now a population of children.  With that, he simply cut through the crowds of children, heading off to his old abandoned home, and shut the door behind him.  It did not take long for him to come out however, only this time he brought a little familiar face with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geeze, you might as well have stayed at the White house\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure should have Mr Hat\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what?</span></div></div>",

Cartman had just beat Kenny 5 times in a row in \"Immotral Combat: Lethal Affiliation\" (Please don't sue. &gt;:D) and the boys where becoming restless about what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Stan.\" Cartman began. \"I officially declare this ass whupping of the big loooooser Kenny to be over. Now can we do something else? Beating a guys head in then ripping hsi spine out gets kinda boring after you've done it 39 times.\" Stan thinks for a moment then says. \"How about we go to the lake and throw rocks in the water.\" Cartman looks at him with contempt then says. \"Ok whatever. Anything's better than whupping you guys at video games.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys put the controllers down, Stan switches the machine and the TV off and they head towards the door. Kyle turns to Cartman and says. \"You know Cartman. Most of us don't actually get to own all those games. Some of us have to rent them then take them back you know.\" Cartman responds. \"What's your point jewboy?\" Kyle replies. \"Well that's probably why you beat Kenny because he had no chance to practice on Immortal Combat.\" Cartman just groans and says. \"Shut up jew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boys head out the front door closing in behind them then go to the nearby lake shore and begin throwing stones into the water. After a few minutes Cartman gets bored with this then as he picks up a stone her notices an old lady walking along the pavement rather slowly with some grocery bags. He laughs and says. \"Sweet.\" as he throws the stone at the old woman hitting her in the ribs and winding her. She falls to the ground then the other boys notice what Cartman did. After just staring for a couple of seconds Stan begins complaining about Cartman's action. \"Cartman! What the f*8k is wrong with you!\" he says. \"Yeah why'd you just attack that old lady? You jerkwad!\" Kyle asks. Cartman just shrugs and says. \"I was bored. Besides. Old people suck. If she didn't want to be violeently attacked she should have driven to the store and back like everyone else. These old fossils should be in old people's homes doped up so we don't have to look at their depressing bodies...\" Cartman continues to rant about how old people suck and should be locked up as the old woman on the nearby side walk gets to her feet. Squints through her glasses at Cartman and his friends then says. \"Hmmmph. Well it's that Eric Cartman kid again. It's bad enough he's a fat obnoxious religiously intolerant asshat but now he thinks him and his tearaway friends can just attack the elderly in broad daylight. Well I'll show that little punk and his friends when I get home and warm up the old cauldron..\" The witch picks up her bags and heads home while the boys end up at Cartman's house by the time she gets home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch is mad and decides to curse the boys to transform but does she curse just Cartman the one who attacked her or all of them or perhaps Cartman and just one other?</div></span></div></div>",

I think we all know what needs to be done here. Everyone follow me.\" Cartman goes up to the front gate which of course unsecured and pushes it open before walking inside. They other three guys follow him and notice the gargoyles and gothic architecture.(Ok it looks like that bloody Amityvillie house. There. I said it. You happy? Good on with the story.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan decides to speak up for common sense. \"Um..guys are you sure this is really a good idea. I mean it does look like some kind of weird house of horrors so why are we going inside again?\" Cartman rolls his eyes. \"Well well well what a surprise. We haven't even gone inside and already Stan Marsh is wetting his *panties* in fear. Look. I'm bored. I'm gonna go do something cool.*he points at the house* If you wusses want to go play hopscotch and Barbie dolls that's fine with me but I'm telling you there'll be some cool stuff in that house.\" The boys look uncertain and Kyle speaks up. \"Look fatass. There's no reason to think there will be anything interesting or cool in there. It's a run down house. I bet no one even lives there anymore. It's probably just full of rats, cockroaches and rotten floorboards.\" Cartman folds his arms and then speaks. \"Ok fine be a d*8k. But if you guys don't go in here with me I'll tell everyone at school what a bunch of fa*8#ts you are.\" Cartman now turns around opens the door and heads into the house. The rest of the boys look at each other and then follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God. He's such a d*8k.\" Stan says as they enter the entrance hall of the house. The ceiling is fairly high and there are a couple of staircases as well as a couple of doors on the ground floor that lead to other rooms.
