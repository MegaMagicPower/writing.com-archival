However now something strange was about to happen.<br>\r\n What started as a secret became a ground breaking experience, there was a new world being discovered. The news recently reported how archaeologists discovered a portal or warp hole that took them to an alternate universe.<br>\r\n There were always speculations of such, but now it was real. As we dig deeper, past the debates and arguments, we meet a guy named Randy.

Alone and unarmed he knew that if anyone found him, it would be over.However he wasn't the type to scare easily.<br>\r\n However his current situation was what mattered now. He managed to find trouble. There were five anti bronies. One was looked like a stereo typical anti, he was strong and had an anti-brony brother hood shirt. His name was Tim. On top of that he spoke down to Randy as he threw him on the ground.<br>\r\n He said,\"Well well well,what do we have here?\"<br>\r\n Randy looked at him. He had four other friends. Dressed just like Tim, but he wasn't worried about them. The reason being was that Randy was trained in martial arts and beat them up in a fight. Tim wasn't there but he knew that they told him about it. He knew that there wasn't going to be an easy escape.<br>\r\n Randy responded, \"You know me.\" He stood up and looked Tim straight in the eye.<br>\r\n Tim saw Randy's 20% cooler shirt and was infuriated but he knew who he was up against. He normally would have just straight up attacked a guy but held back against Randy because of what his friends told him. He responded, \"Well let's be quick then.\"<br>\r\nRandy responded, \"Well what do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
