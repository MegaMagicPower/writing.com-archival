He rubbed his eyes and in a machine like manner donned his uniform.<br>\r\nWith a trademark sigh he made his bed and looked at his katana.<br>\r\nIt was the blade of a legendary witch hunter who lived in Japan. It was known only as the blade of Asura.<br>\r\nWhen Ryan used it alongside his willpower he could preform supernatural feats, such as teleportation and cutting iron in half.<br>\r\n{<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://wallpoper.com/wallpaper/katana-blade-382503\" target=\"_blank\">http://wallpoper.com/wallpaper/katana-bl...</a>} to show what it looks like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was quite bare, only his bed and a table with a radio was there.<br>\r\nHe shook his head and muttered \"Why could I not have a normal teenage life? I never asked for any of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pressed his forehead to the window and let out a breath on it. The glass was fogged as Ryan tried to clear the cobwebs<br>\r\nof sleep out of his mind. He felt alone, not that he minded. He was used to being alone, growing up he would run laps on the field by<br>\r\nhimself or read a book under a tree. But people still liked him, they would often ask him for advice. His Mother instilled a noble soul into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if he complains he would always do the right thing. Why? Becasue it's just how he is.<br>\r\nHis eyes fell to a picture taken of him and Jenny<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://wallpapersus.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/flyable-heart-anime-bed-blush-boy-brown-eyes-brown-hair-cute-girl-inaba-yui-katsuragi-syo-love-ribbons-sexy-short-hair-skirt-thighhighs.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://wallpapersus.com/wp-content/uploa...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then he heard a knock on his door.

He decided to return the hug and say. \"I know Jenny. But I guess this means we can start over or something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey looked into the other's eyes. Jenny noted the darkness in Ryan's eyes and how they felt injured. As if there were two large scars ingrained into his pupils.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan could see the regret in Jenny's, her leaveing was not her fault. Ryan knew that from the start. \"Heh maybe that wise old man was right about love being a bird in the cage.\" he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair of them kissed in the first time since they had no idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

For a start he was raised as a top secret project.<br>\r\nThe aim was to make a male able to use magic from birth.<br>\r\nIt worked to a certain extent, however light killer turned mad from the testing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night he killed his witch guards and fled the lab.<br>\r\nHe lived as a vagnabond, he was defeated by Ryan who then aided him in getting rid of <br>\r\nlight killer's past. To thank him he joined Ryan's school and moved into his dorm to act<br>\r\nas his bodyguard. His scared body was hidden by his uniform and his blonde hair was scruffy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon was born in a quiet and hard to find village in China. His parents died when he was two.<br>\r\nHis older Brother was the one who cared for him. Unkown to Chon until his tenth birthday he found out<br>\r\nhis 20 year old Brother was an infamous witch hunter. Just then a group of witches that Chung, Chon's Brother<br>\r\nhad jailed broke into thier house. Chung locked Chon in a broom closet and fought the witches. <br>\r\nAlas he was slayed. The witches flew off laughing to themselves. Chon smashed the door to find his Brother's<br>\r\ndead body in front of him. He screamed in terror and ripped out his own eyes. The next day he was found by Mr Tanaka<br>\r\nwho took him into the academy. Chon accepted and planned his revenge, it was the only thing that kept him going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he and Ryan met the two of them had hit it off with no problems. Even if Ryan does not condone Chon's revenge he still<br>\r\nviews him as a close pal. Ryan even remarked with \"We'd take a bullet for the other one.\"<br>\r\nChon rubbed his red blindfold with a sigh. Ryan had never seen under it, and to tell the truth he did not want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny met Ryan with a smile and walked with Amy. She was one of Ryan's dormates.<br>\r\nHer Father and Brother were witch hunters who often had to leave Amy with a babysitter.<br>\r\nDue to her Father not being around, this warped her view of the opposite gender.<br>\r\nNow she holds a distrust of guys in general, only Ryan is the exception.<br>\r\nShe did her normal huff with folded arms. She shot a venomous look at Chon who met it with a grin.<br>\r\nThe two were in the same dorm yet they hated each others guts. Despite that many people viewed them as a couple.<br>\r\nRyan and Jenny could sense some love there. They just could not see it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the rest of the class ready Mr Tanaka greeted them. Despite being 58 he was one of<br>\r\nthe toughest witch hunters in history. The only witch who could defeat him was his wife.<br>\r\nThe two of them founded Starmage and promote gender equalty around the world.<br>\r\nRyan had a deep respect for him and often asked him for advice. He even viewed him as something of a Father figure.<br>\r\n\"Okay class we are going to be doing laps around the field. After a short rest we will work on obstacle courses.\"<br>\r\nhe said as everyone got ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan turned to light killer and joked with \"Don't run on all fours like you used to do okay?\"<br>\r\nLight killer gave a rare smile and the running got underway.</span></div></div>",

It was boring but he knew it was to get him ready for the main part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Tanaka pressed a switch and many obstacles appeared on the wide open grass.<br>\r\n\"Okay class today we will do timed runs for each student. You must push the large block, then climb it to <br>\r\nthe zipline. After doing that you must land on the medium sized yellow ring or have a 5 second time penalty.<br>\r\nThen you must run up the pyramid blocks and ring the bell. Any questions?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone said no and Mr Tanaka said \"Okay Mr Doe will you go first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan tapped John on the shoulder and said \"Remember no running on all fours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight killer muttered \"Farest thing from my mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis run was quite good overall. After a small while it was Ryan's turn.<br>\r\n\"Ready Ryan? 3, 2, 1, GO!\" Mr Tanaka yelled as he blew on a whistle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan pushed the large block with his left arm. He wanted to save his right arm's power for the pyramid blocks.<br>\r\nHe climbed up the block, rolling as he did so. He then latched on to the zipline and sped down it.<br>\r\nHe could see the yellow ring just near him. After using his monk training he backflipped off the zipline and landed feet first on the ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that was left was the pyramid blocks. He used his right arm to support his weight as he climbed up them. To be honest it made him <br>\r\nthink of the time when he walked to the monk temple in Tibet in the dark, snowy night. What made it different was these blocks were not covered in ice. Also he was not falling on his back and making the block he landed on covered in a red, copper smelling liqud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could hear Jenny cheering him on. At last he rang the bell and sat down with a sigh.<br>\r\nThe whole run made him think of his life, going over one thing after another. Sometimes he felt like his mind and body were two different <br>\r\npeople. In his mind the wound of Jenny leaveing was like a scar on him. Yet with his body he mows down every hurdle in front of him, when he acts it comes naturally almost super human to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now he was content to just ask \"Did I make it in time?\"</span></div></div>",

She swore that she would never wear one ever. I bet if I get her dinner then she would.\" the 17 year old thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly he climbed down as the next of his class got started.<br>\r\nAfter he walked towards Jenny light killer greeted him with a small grin.<br>\r\n\"You did well Ryan.

Both of you go to other sides of the field.\" Mr Tanaka said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two did so and Mr Tanaka rubbed his balding head and said \"Ryan can you and your team keep an eye on the class? I need to go and discuss this matter with both of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan sighed, \"Why is it that people always think that I'm a problem solver?\" he said with a shake of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny put a hand on Ryan's back to reassure him. \"That's becasue you are one Ryan.

Everyone okay with that?\" Ryan made a mental note to not talk about this ever to anyone just like he would normally do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the class nodded. The reason was that to the class who were mostly made up of 14-15 year olds Ryan was something of a role model to them. He always had time to listen to other people, even if he was gruff about it he would always say \"What's up?\"<br>\r\nTo that end a lot of people would ask him for advice to thier current problem or thier life. Somehow Ryan would come up with the right thing to say or do. Even though Ryan acted like a loner who only wanted to be by himself he had something about him that made everyone so drawn to him. The 17 year old never gave a thought about it, he just chalked it up to fate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Tanaka had left Ryan his watch and whistle. Although people came close they just could not beat Ryan's record.<br>\r\n\"My legs must have gotten longer.\" he mused to himself. He felt rather comfortable in this sort of capacity, maybe it was because Jenny and light killer were helping him all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last the sun had set and class was over.

One of my hands found itself trailing down to her underwear, our bodies held close together on the fluffy carpet. Now people might wonder, why in the living room when we live with other people? The danger, adds to it. Trying to keep our moans to a minimum so as not to disturb the others. Chon might know, he has enhanced senses after all. But he wouldn't give two shits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...ryan...hmmm.\" Jenny muttered out to me, grabbing my face and planting her lips onto mine. She began to grind her body onto mine, her legs wrapping around mine. I gave a grunt as I scooped her into my arms, standing up with her. She moaned out as my body grinded against hers, alternating it between a small moan and a cat like mewling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swiftly carried my little kitten to my room, flinging her onto my bed. I then quickly delivered a kick to my door, slamming it in place. Jenny meanwhile had gotten herself comfortable, stripping, or rather just plain ripping off her remaining clothing. The only thing left were the laced panties covering her fanny, I snickered as I saw what they looked like. Light pink with fluffy bunny patterns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny must have realised what I was laughing at and she stuttered out with \"whh...they're comfy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let out a grin and pounced onto Jenny, tackling her to the bed. Pinning her arms to the covers, she playfully wriggled about in my grasp. But I soon moved down to her underwear, wrapping my arms around her silky smooth thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny quietly moaned and mewed, her hands gently running through my hair. I smirked and then removed her underwear, it was moist to the touch. Soaked with her natural juices, the wonderful smell reaching my nostrils. I quickly yanked them away from Jenny's body, flinging them near the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this I took a brief moment to admire the body of Jenny, her brown hair splayed about the covers. The morning sun creeping into the window, lighting her body. Her breasts, still budding yet rather well grown. Her slim body with her curves, her silky legs and dainty feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny seemed to have noticed my hesitation and grabbed my hands, throwing me down atop her. I buried my head into the valley between her breasts, licking the bare skin in the gap between her lovely mounds. Jenny meanwhile was unbuttoning my trousers, I then got up and did it myself. Yanking off my shirt soon after it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pounced atop her once more, having a burning and passionate kiss with her. Her legs wrapping around me, I move from her lips to her neck. My right hand fondling her breast, making her nipple hard and firm. I swiftly move to latch my mouth onto it, playing with her nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haa....ooooo.\" Jenny's pleasured moans giving me confidence to go on. I was moving from her breast to her moist womanhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no hesitation on my part, I moved my mouth close to it. Gently licking around her folds, with Jenny sharply yelling out. I paused and waited for her to calm down, before resuming my gentle mouth fondling of her entrance. I continued this, with Jenny grabbing hold of the covers to hold onto something. Then she moved her hands to my head, eagerly wanting me to continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I carried on with this, her moans got more and more louder. Before she let out a \"Nyeahhhhhhhhh!\" as her juices leaked out, I moved my face from it and laid on the bed next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.....\" I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah....whew.....\" my cat girlfriend muttered out, it'd been a real good time since we had sex. We didn't have missionary or any proper sex, had phone sex a couple of times. And some soft touching here and there, but that was quite alright. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You eat something? That entrance's sweet Jenny.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy lovely kitten smirked and moved to kiss me on the cheek \"I need to repay you back....\" she muttered.<br>\r\nThen Jenny's hand moved to my erect member, gently rubbing it up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then.\" I muttered out, kissing her neck as she began to massage my hard pal.</span></div></div>",

I then replied back with \"Where would you want to be, with me right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny put a hand to her chin and said \"I think maybe Milan, and next to our room is a sun kissed balcony.

Good thing we don't have class today, I think we should do something fun. Maybe just the two of us, what do you think Jenny?\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's get dressed first.\" the kitty said as she got out the bed, grabbing her clothing. I made to do the same but I took the chance to gaze at Jenny's rear. A cutie with a booty, no doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough we sauntered out into the main living room, Chon was already munching on corn flakes without milk.

I spent a year there before coming back to attend Starmage Academy, in Asia I learned various martial arts. And obtained the katana which was now held in my left hand, it'd only been a few months since I came back to the UK. And suddenly we're now going to China?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hong Kong, you recall I sent my daughters there yes?\" Chon spoke to me. Let me just be clear, they're not his daughters in blood. They're not Chinese like Chon is, they're American. He adopted them following the time me and my group travelled to some hi tech island, their real Mother was a rogue witch who controlled her daughters with mind control collars. When we took her into custody Chon took her daughters into his custody, Viva and Vogue. It was something that nobody expected, Chon despised witches and magic. With a passion, but he told me in private about why he did what he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their age.....When I lost my Brother I was that young. Magic is a terrible thing, I didn't want them to be corrupted by the wrongful use of it.\" those were the words I recall him saying. Chon didn't speak much of his past, but I knew he used to have an older Brother that he lost to the hands of witches. And this stunted his view on magic, in fact to rogue witches Chon was known as a wanted enemy who's head should be on a pike. In short if you can't get the rogue witch hunters to track down an evil witch, you want Chon to do it. He knows just how to fight them, he does it with stealth and targeting the people close to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is there another reason why your dragging me to China, when you can just teleport there with the school's transporter alone?\" I say. It was a good thing that I had breakfast bars in my uniform coat, just as a precaution. I rip one open and stuff it in my mouth. Knowing the stuff that Chon gets up to I doubt I'll have the time to sit down and have a proper breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon sighs and nods as we make our way to the teleporter. \"Yeah there is another reason, it's.....\"</span></div></div>",

Devon was not obese, just unbelievably muscular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tremble not at my presence.\" in a booming voice, Devon said. \"You have no need to fear me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are here regarding Eliza hunting down the last remaining pieces of the Pharaoh's rings.\" serious, Chon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes... the rings said to return a witch her powers or to grant a male powers of a witch.\" darkly, Devon said. \"It was those rings who made what John Light Killer is today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know more about that?\" curious, Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevon took a breath. \"The Pharaoh's rings are like a puzzle.\" serious, he began. \"They have to be placed in a specific order on the fingers for them to grant any power. The rogue council experimented on John, placing the rings onto his fingers in various orders in hopes of unlocking their secrets.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rogue council?\" startled, Jenny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Mafia of the witching world.\" serious, Devon replied. \"We mad scientists have our own version, are known as the shadow tribunal.\" he sighed. \"John managed to escape and destroy the place he was held in, the rest you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They won't do that to me again...\" trembling with fury, John muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy, bro.\" firmly but kindly, Ryan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you find Eliza first, she is all yours.\" looking John in the eye, Devon said. \"Your orders are to secure the rings, we don't care what happens to Eliza, she was warned of the consequences of going after those rings.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I made a reservation for two days.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what was the name please?\" the man at the desk asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr Nero Tobias.\" Ryan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah yes we have a nice room set up for you sir. Here's your key Mr Nero. If you need anything at your room feel free to call room service.\" the receptionist said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Ryan said as he took his key and ran up to his room. It was important that Eliza did not see Ryan at all until they took her down. If she for one second thought something was up, then that was it the game would be a bogey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Ryan locked his room door he checked his watch, he then turned the dials and a face popped up on the screen.<br>\r\n\"Come in Alexander.

That's my main worry right now.\" Ryan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't see it Ryan. But I think Eliza has the trigger on her. If I were her then I'd put in the place where the blast would be the biggest.\" Alexander repiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it. John come in what's your status?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a toilet. What do you need?\" Light said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I've got an idea on where the bomb is. When you're done wiping your ass check the top floors near the roof for any sign of the bomb. You remember how to defuse it right?\" Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I do.\" Light said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Chon where are you?\" Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just got my uniform on. Any sign of Eliza the bitch?\" Chon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah Alexander's got a location. Listen I need you to distract Eliza for me while I take her down.\" Ryan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you want me to do it?\" Chon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First make sure she does not see your full face. Wear a hat and sunglasses to cover yourself up. I'm gonna jump across from the balcony next to her place and then we double team her. We question her and relay the bomb location to Light.

Ah you three will need new ones.\" Mr Tanaka said as he handed Charlie and his Sisters History books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce everyone had taken out or gotten a pencil Mr Tanaka stepped out the class to find the History teacher Ms. White.<br>\r\nRyan could sense something bad. He turned his head to spot Rose and Carla looking right at Charlie with malice in thier eyes.<br>\r\nHe could hear Charlie whimper like an injured dog. He glared with anger at the two of them and muttered<br>\r\n\"You ever go near him and I can't promise you will live.\" he had no signs of actually lying about what he just said<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of Ryan's team were looking right at them.

Ms. White was a magic History teacher from the US.<br>\r\nHer hair was long and brown, in a ponytail like that of Jenny's. Her face also had kind light blue eyes. She was what Ryan would say as a reasonable authority figure. She would talk to both parties and reach a middle point with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class got under way with Ms. White talking about the 'Neko' race that Jenny was actually a part of.<br>\r\n\"The witches of the round tree wanted to be like their feline companions.

He moved his arm backwards and caught a sharp pencil inbetween his fingers.<br>\r\nHe knew it was aimed right at Charlie. The 17 year old did not even bother to look at the two girls. He snapped the pencil in half for some stress relief. Jenny muttered to Ryan \"Suddenly when Ms. White said 'forbidden magic.' Charlie's Sisters got all interested.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan shook his head and sighed. First he had to take a kid into his care and now he would most likely get wrapped up in a crackpot B hero movie. Still he could not bring himself to hate Charlie. The poor kid started life with a crap hand and Ryan felt like he should turn it into a royal flush. \"I need to stop getting all poetic.\" he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class ended not too long after that.<br>\r\nRyan made sure Charlie was with him at all costs.<br>\r\nJust then Jenny went up to him and muttered into his ear \"Should we tell Ms. White?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan thought about it. She was someone that you could confide in about anything. But still she could end up a victim in the future at the hands of two power hungry witches. At last he said.....</span></div></div>",

Jeez he's now only looking a few years older than me, perhaps this is karma. My quest for redemption is rewarded with my Brother being brought back to this world, had I continued I surely would have met a worse fate. I can't help but feel the pang of regret in my chest at what I did in revenge of his demise. We walk to a balcony on the roof, Chang gazes out at the dorm huts across the grounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you live here now?\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod \"Yep, we're a co gender dorm. Its on a person to person system, that's why we have kids living with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChang nods, there's a pause in the air. I can understand why. Chang is about to speak but then stops. I nod for him to go on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I......watched over you.....\" Chang said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down I feel the wave of shame. \"Yes, you know what I've done. I'm so sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Brother places a hand on my shoulder in reassurance. Followed with \"I know Chon, as I said I watched over you and saw your change and progress. You did a great thing taking those girls in. You even managed to find Huanle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this I then realise something came to mind for me. \"Speaking of Huanle, elder Brother I must ask........Did you know of her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChang sighs deeply before saying \".....Yes. I found out about her a few months before I passed. As you know our homeland frowned on having large families. Our parents found that Huanle had magical talent and left with her, thinking likely they could profit from it more than I could make with my career. When I wasn't helping you and my fellows I tried to track her down, our parents have passed. Huanle was at a witch school, I planned to try and get to her but then those rogue witches came.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod and reply with \"I know and with how I acted the witch council hid the knowledge from me, I found out after me and the team sneaked into the witch council headquarters in Edinburgh. Once we saved Jenny I found her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Brother nods and smiles \"It all turned out okay Chon, we did the best we could at the time and had no clue what could happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wish Huanle was found earlier, Chang didn't leave any notes about her. How was I to have known? I could easily have shown a compliant about it, but we're only people. I was driven by grief and nearly fell to madness for it, I was punished for it by Huanle being kept a secret from me. When I redeemed myself it was rewarded with those I thought lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should see to Elvira and whatever she asks. Ironic that the one who they despise is alongside her.\" Chang says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smirk as we walk off \"Indeed, but they know its because of how effective I am. And now we are......\" I mutter</span></div></div>",

That world was......of a different gravity.\" he mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat makes sense, after all he passed from this world years ago. \"Are you sure you don't want to take a rest for a bit? I mean you did just come back here.\" I say putting my hand on his shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChang pats it and says \"I'll be fine Chon, I've kept up my daily regiment. I'm not gonna buckle under pressure at all.\" getting back off the wall to assure me of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh and say \"Very well, but just remember to take a break if you need to.\" he nods, probably a tad surprised at how much I've grown. My suspicions are proven true when he says \"You've sure learned to pick up after people eh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a slight chuckle I said \"I learned from the best. Now let's see what Elvira wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnocking on the door she calls for us to enter, striding in Elvira asks us to take a seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting back she says \"I take it Chang is getting accustomed to his new surroundings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its been a bit of a hard going but I'm gonna be fine, what can we do to help out?\" Chang says, straight to the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well as you know the rogue witches are amongst us, Chon as your are known and feared by them Chang will also be associated with you. Jenny and Huanle have already made some great strides in picking out some suspects. I want you both to pay them a little visit. At night.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At night? I take it the prefects won't approve.\" I say, they can be very much like templars when it comes to enforcing the no walking at night rule. Not that I pay them any heed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes they won't, but you won't be caught because I know you sneaked into the witch council HQ back in Edinburgh so I know your not gonna be found by some teen prefects.\" Elvira says, I smirk at that knowing I one upped them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's the target, do we have enough proof that they are tied to rogue witches?\" Chang says, I notice our contrasts. I don't really care for being formal towards Elvira, but Chang is all business. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira then stands up and walks towards the window with a sigh. \"This 'Student' is someone who.......</span></div></div>",

I was heavily blamed for the birth of the first pseudo witch but, because my grandson stood up for me in witch court, I was never charged with the 'crime' and retained my title of head witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there are other pseudo witches like John Harrison?\" Curious, Chang asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira shook her head. \"John Harrison is the only one.\" Firmly, she said. \"However, his success inspired literally millions of witch boys to discover talents of their own. That is why we have 'Mad' Scientists, Roughnecks, Ironclads... witch hunters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We get the point.\" Politely, I said. \"Does this 'daughter' of your late son have a name or any notable magic power?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She claims her name is Rhea Al Strange.\" Shaking her head, Elvira replied. \"She has exhibited average magical power but claims to have a laboratory to enhance it through pseudo magic.\" Her voice turned dark. \"Mixing of the two magics is highly dangerous. Not even my grandson, John dares to attempt it unless absolutely necessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you suspect her claim is completely bogus.\" Serious, Chang said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira nodded, though she looked sad. \"I suspect her claim is false but...\" She sighed. \"I had not been in contact with Jack for twenty years before he resurfaced with his pseudo magic and passed it on to my grandson.

Just goes to show nepotism works, but I don't care. I note that I can't sense any chi energy inside, likely John has either departed this place or he's put up some ward to mask that. Likely its science. The thing with my chi energy is it works better with magic ironically enough, mad science lacks life inside of it. Technology is cold and sterile and so I can't manipulate it or sense it very well. But regardless I feel John is certain to be here, no doubt preparing for Elvira's request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was meaning to say Chon, I'm impressed by how you compensate for your lack of eye sight. Being able to read auras of life isn't an easy ability to learn with the chi arts.\" Chang says, patting me on the shoulder before we go in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm momentarily taken aback by this, but I smile. I'm gonna have to get used to this, same with Huanle. We knock on the door, only to hear a loud scuffling noise. We waste no time, Chang quickly delivers a one inch blow to the door. Applying the pressure needed in the middle of the frame, a split second later it bursts into several splinters. It seemingly deactivated the wards John used, because I could then quickly sense the auras of.....two beings....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn was on the ground, being accosted by Rhea. Her ruby red evil aura starkly contrasting the noble blue of John, she currently had him locked into a very clear MMA hold. She quickly detects us and yells \"You will not interfere! Don't worry John I'll save you from all of them!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not even going to think about that, I instantly leap into the air with a loud \"ATTTTTAAAAA!\" aiming a flying kick right at Rhea's head. But in an instant there is a loud crackling noise, followed by me landing on the floor with a thud. Rhea has vanished taking John with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Curses.....\" I mutter out, pounding the floor in annoyance. Rhea has revealed her hand, likely planning this far before I was involved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steady on Chon, John may have left us a clue as to where he was taken.\" Chang says as he walks into the room. We promptly get ready to look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat girl. What she said......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chon, we must not bring her lethal harm. If she is wise enough to one up John we must turn her to good.\" Chang says before we start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..........I know........\" I mutter back, if I can be redeemed so I can she.....</span></div></div>",

I'm also pretty surprised at how easily John was taken down there, that guy can put one over on me and Ryan. Though I think over it, if she really is a Harrison it makes sense. The only one that can beat one is another one of them sometimes. Chang spends no time standing still though, he is digging through the nearby drawers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chon, I'm gonna check around here. See if you chi senses can detect any clues.\" Chang says, I doubt it will work considering the inclinations towards technology here. But it's worth a try. I stay crouched where I am, opening my senses as wide as possible in order to see what I can come up with. I can't feel Rhea or John's chi signatures anywhere, she likely is near the outskirts of the school at least. Likely taking John away to somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts then that I shift my head upwards, suddenly clear as day there's writing on the wall. Its written in....blood? Or something similar to it, because I can sense the life energy emerging from it. It reads.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom and Sisters are the password, she is included. Good luck if you see this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think I get the idea. I stand up and say to Chang \"Check the computer, try using John's mother's name and his Sisters. Include Rhea in there too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChang quickly boots it up, we try their first names all together. No dice, so we use the first letter of each. Bingo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're in, how'd you figure that out?\" Chang said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John left us a bit of advice in case this happened. Hopefully that's not all.\" I say as I lean close to my Brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of this we strike gold. \"Yeah he's left other stuff. Turns out he's already worked on his own investigation, even managed to leave some coordinates to where Rhea kept a second base. Bet you she's there.\" Chang says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, maybe John let himself be captured on purpose?\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChang shrugs and says \"Hard to say, okay I got it on our phones. Let's tell Elvira and make our way there. Hopefully John is alright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we head out the room I say \"I'm sure of it, Rhea is the one that warrants our caution though.

I'm sending Huanle to accompany you for extra aid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frown, its not that I don't think Huanle is capable. Far from it, back at Witchbloom she had top marks. When your an orphan for years you likely focus on your studies, I would know after all. But Elvira is keen on this, I think she just wants a magic element involved because of her kind. I won't object though, no use in arguing with a head witch I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long Huanle joins us \"I'm briefed on what's happened, let's go guys. The Kay siblings shall save the Harrisons.\" she says with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChang chuckles at that and I actually find myself grinning too. So this is what it feels like, something tells me I should get used to it. But then I realise Rhea likely doesn't have this. But regardless we have to stop her. With that we are on our way, leaping off the dorm roof and into the tall forest trees behind us.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nParkour is something that I've learned since childhood so I can leap across both trees and rooftops with ease, either to hunt a foe or to flee the scene. Chang obviously still maintained his prowess in that world he was in, Huanle.....Well okay she's still new to it but her ballet practise and use of magic lets her keep up with us to some extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How far till we get there?\" Huanle says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChang is leading us with his device and points north before saying \"Just ahead of us, its underground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI extend my chi senses, this place is filled with such life that I can have issues discerning certain things unless I focus really hard. But I can sense movements ahead but underground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is it, but where's the entrance?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue we hear a loud roaring noise, we stagger back as out of the ground comes this massive entrance. It resembles a bunker gateway with a door, I quickly move into and channel some chi energy into my hand. Blasting it right in the middle to force the door open. Instantly the smell down the stairs is of copper and soot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's down here?\" Huanle asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod, Chang says \"We don't know how much she has down here, be careful......\" with that we head in.....</span></div></div>",

Neither were my siblings, we stared danger down and dared it to try something. It was what we did, I felt the heat on my bare arms as we moved deeper and deeper underground. Biting my lower lip Chang would say \"Let's stay sharp, we don't know how long Rhea has had to set traps.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah that's true, maybe the prefects had done anything about this we wouldn't be here. Then again the forests around Starmage can be very expansive, it does fall under their jurisdiction though. Carlson and I were planning to join before this went down, now we certainly will. We arrive down the stairs to a door, Chang shuffle the doorknob briefly. With only a brief cracking noise to give away our position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe quietly enter, the heat is still present. But this room feels cooler, AC units and all that. It's also a tad dark, my chi senses give me these details to a much greater degree than Chang or Huanle. There are rows of shelves that adorn the walls, Chang looks to one nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dolls?\" he mutters, before carrying on with \"That's odd, Rhea seems more like a tomboy than anything else. Why would she have these lying about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly though he then says \"My God, guys these dolls. They look like the Harrison Sisters!\" I and Huanle take a closer look. I gingerly take one in my hand, cautious for magic use. Feeling it with my thumb I can tell its a doll of Mel. Why though?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that Rhea's voice was heard over a scratchy loudspeaker \"Ah, if it isn't the Kay siblings! Welcome to my lair! I hope you liked my welcoming gift. See those girls abuse John, just like their Mother abused my Father. Apple doesn't fall far from the tree after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI drop the doll and say \"Just come out, we can talk this over. They'd miss you just as much as John Rhea.\" assuming her claim is even true......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhea responds with \"Shut up. I made those dolls for one reason, to trap their minds.

Perhaps that is my mind just playing tricks on me, surely I'd have known that Jack had a child. Then again he was silent for so long.....not even I with my resources could track him down. I suppose I did teach him the best lessons about avoiding magic it seemed, perhaps that was the one good thing about my zealotry in letting my daughters use magic on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh, I should tell them. They have a right to know just in case, I doubt Rhea's claim is legit. But should the worst come to pass and the truth is so, we must be prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a short while I set up a conference call spell, talking to Natalie and Catherine via crystal balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Elvira, is everything okay?\" Natalie says, Catherine is silent as she waits my response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cough, in the way one does to prepare for a speech. \"My daughters, I'm afraid the past could be coming back to haunt us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine frowns before saying \"How so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There has been an individual causing disruption at Starmage Academy, a girl called Rhea. She claims to be a direct heir to Jack.\" I say, looking down after it. I couldn't help that last bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie gasps, there is a tense-ish silence in the air.  Finally after a few seconds Natalie says \"What? I thought Jack he.....had no children. That was why he passed his teachings to John.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look in the file again, just to remind myself of it and say \"Yes, that we know of. Remember its been years since he was last sighted, there could be plenty of time for him to father a child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine was silent, before adding in \"Yeah, given how we......treated him I doubt he would feel compelled to tell us about it. Probably thought we and our kids would treat them just as bad as we did.......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod and then say \"As I say we have no concrete proof at the moment, I doubt were Jack to have a child he'd have allowed her to be so......troubled.\" I want to believe that, even after what happened with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is being done about this? I've not heard from John, is he okay?\" Natalie asks, a hint of concern on her features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile and respond with \"He should be with Rhea, I believe he's likely let himself be captured so he can get close to her. I've also dispatched Chon Kay and his Sister Huanle, it also turns out his Brother Chang had survived his attack those years ago. Relax dears, its in good hands. We shall find out the truth one way or another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that we bid our farewells, I look away from the crystal ball and gaze out the window. If there is one regret I have in my magic life it was how I treated Jack, I pray this is indeed not retribution for that........</span></div></div>",

Not so with the Banes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeems about right, still though. I wouldn't want to wish that fate on someone, Imagine being chained to someone who hates and abuses you.

Making our way back to the dorm Chang says to me \"Chon, we must try and help this person. No one deserves a fate such as one that the sick and twisted minds of the Banes can produce.\" I nod in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly as we near the dorm I sense someone following us, call it a hunch. Call it me using my enhanced chi senses. I stop walking, Chang does too. We don't turn around but we perk our ears up. \"Whoever is there come on out.\" I say. We hear a gasp, clearly female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough the woman steps out, she's about 18 I think. Bares many of the features of the Bane family, her chi is a subdued grey. Enough to convince me she's not in line with them, at least right now. Cassie and her Mother have chi as red as blood, steeped as they are in evil. Still I'm a bit wary. I fold my arms as we look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you Chon Kay?\" she says, in a subdued and almost fearful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod, she then looks at Chang. After eyeing him for a second she says \"Chang Kay? I heard you were killed by Cassie's Mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap, Chang quickly folds his arms and said \"They didn't aim for the head.\" nice way to justify your missing state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you want to speak to us?\" I say, I know why I feel but........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks forward and says \"My name is Bil....I mean Lilian Bane, I'm......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then say \"Your wanting our help aren't you? We heard about you, you were put through the wedding test by Cassie and her Mother weren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then she suddenly bursts into tears and cups her head into her hands, I wasn't expecting that. Chang moves forward and puts a hand on her shoulder. \"Please forgive my Brother, he can lack empathy. We mean you no harm, we can help you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit, I bite my lower lip. I forget not all from a rogue witch clan are evil. The V girls exemplify this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs and says \"O-Okay. Yes I was placed in.....an abusive marriage by those....bitches. I fled after being able to pick up a magic book, but I can barely get the thing to work. I forged my entrance documents, anything I had to do just to get away from it all.......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk forward and say \"I take it you heard about us then? That I put Cassie's Mother into a coma after destroying one of her lungs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding Lilian says to me \"They spoke of you like some kind of boogeyman, all rogue witches I'm told are to kill you on sight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They assume correctly, well listen. Come with us then, if you are intent on seeking sanctuary the people at my dorm can help as well.\" I state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelinda walks and nods, between me and Chang. We arrive at the dorm and are greeted by Huanle sitting at the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys, is this her?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Lilian Bane. We're going to protect her here, least until we can sort out what Cassie's plan is.\" Chang says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilian gasps and says \"Is she here?! Oh shit, what if she summons my abusive husband?! That damn wedding test means I'm stuck with him for the rest of my life!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuanle bites her lower lip, she probably knows more about it than I do. I didn't really care for the ways of witches unless it was to my benefit, which bit me when it came to teaching the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well don't worry, we're here to help you.\" Huanle says, motioning for Lilian to take a seat.</span></div></div>",

Usually a relative of a rogue witch I'd lump in the same boat with them, but this has shown me that even they can be treated just as horribly as their prey.

Your family may yet seek you out, also can you tell us about the man you were taken by?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuanle coughs as if to say I shouldn't ask but I say \"It might give us a clue about their intentions, a motive besides pure evil.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLilian wipes her eyes with her sleeve and says \"Well......he was rich, like mega rich. Like I could have a new car if I.......\" she trails off and I understand what she means.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, did you ever get any contact from your family?\" Chang says, deciding to add his two cents. Though his voice is softer than my own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, though he was on the phone a lot.

It pained me greatly, realizing that not all those in a rogue family actually went rogue. For that reason, I was more repentive than ever. After a search through some records, I found that Lilian's partner was a character named Georg Bedlam of the super rich technology and research empire. From what I read, he lacked in intelligence so would be of little use to the company unless he could bring more power and influence to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That little weaseling worm...\" Angry, I muttered. \"He must have recognized the family when he stumbled upon their wedding test and saw an opportunity.\" I growled. \"He crashed the party and stole the bride. The only reason the Bane family did not stop it was because they were trying to get rid of her anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was seething with anger at the injustice of it all. The only reason Georg took her was to keep his family name and a piece of the massive inheritance by marrying into a powerful witch family. Lilian was his meal ticket and he did all he could to keep her under his thumb. \"It's time to inform this Georg git the jig is up.\" Angry, I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sensed Chang nearby who said, \"I'm going with you. We were assigned to the mission as a pair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and the two of us headed out to Georg's small mansion just on the far side of the neighboring town. His security, though high tech, was a joke and his security guards were not much more of a challenge. Still, this was normal science and Chang and I had fought against mad science which was far superior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was security inside the mansion as well but it was just as laughable and we disabled it easily before reaching Georg's bed chambers.

He screamed in agony, dropping his swords then screamed again as both Chang and I broke both his wrists and every finger in his hands with one powerful twist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will never lift a sword or gun again in either hand.\" Serious, Chang said. \"Nor will you ever be able to strike a blow with any sizeable force.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the punishment for your years of abuse on an innocent woman.\" Serious, I added. \"If you come looking for her, you will get worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My family is beyond wealthy!\" Furious, George screamed. \"I will have you both suffer endless torment for this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frowned as I removed my blindfold, revealing my Chi eyes. Georg's face turned pale as he finally recognized who i was. \"The blind vengeance...\" Whispering, he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"No... blind justice.\" Softly, I countered. \"You have your inheritance, leave the girl in peace or face the wrath of her new family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her new family...?\" Confused, Georg asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChang and I released Georg and walked out, leaving him guessing. Once we were away from the mansion, Chang asked. \"which family were you referring to? Or was that a bluff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a bluff.\" Serious, I replied. \"Lilian has more friends than she realizes. I found a footnote in her report from Elvira that she was childhood friends with...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now she would be hiding around the corner, watching Ryan's reaction with inscrutable eyes. There were things he liked to keep private, other things that needed to be kept hidden, and at times, Ryan suspected that Amy Don was reaching for ways to draw him away from those items, those secrets -- that this was no mere girl's foolish, flirtatious play. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, she would often smile at him over a book, or nudge him during a lesson, and wasn't it all in flirtatiousness? Weren't those eyes perfect pools of sincerity?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow he seemed to hear her feet scuffing the flagstones, and so peered further out, intent on catching her looking, when again a nudge, and she appeared from the opposite side instead, smiling brightly, with those painful pools of sincerity glistening. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were eyes she often used to great effect, though they had always had less of an impact on Ryan than she'd privately hoped. He was an odd bird, this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, his eyes were rankling. \"Well?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They say you're a fast one,\" she intoned, raising a clenched fist. \"But that you hide it from your own and bestest roommate.\" She smiled. \"That if I held a handful of fireflies, and let them suddenly seek their own way, you could catch the whole in a handful of your own, and return them to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan sighed at the theatrics. \"Well?\" he said again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pools glimmered. \"Well, I have such a handful, see?. And I will bet you one kiss that you cannot catch them all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I might not like the prize.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will,\" she threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her hand, and the bugs, rendered sterile and almost invisible by the daylight, streamed out. Ryan moved into the corridor, shutting the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well?\" she demanded triumphantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan sighed again, then held his right hand, which was clenched into a fist, close to Amy's ear. The buzzing of the maddened, though unharmed, insects was quite audible. Quite, he thought, yes, quite. Her sincere eyes narrowed to hardened points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/30600000/Yozora-Mikazuki-boku-wa-tomodachi-ga-sukunai-30624161-720-405.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/3...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess there's just the matter of my reward now,\" he sighed tiredly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe snorted. \"Says you. I bet you a kiss that you couldn't catch them all. But you DID catch them all. So.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you get nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she swished the tail of her skirt haughtily behind and went jauntily on her way with her handful of bugs (though not without another backward, inscrutable glance at Ryan's suddenly infuriated face).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Semantics!\" he yelled. \"Is that the game you play now?!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And she was here?  His heart raced nearly leaping out of his chest.  How he longed to be holding her in his arms feeling her heart beat beneath his chest in rythm with his own.  He was enamoryed in her love for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought, to check the bed dropping acoin on it.  It flipped.  He got it right, he knew he did.  Peeking out the window to see the ponde to see where the wild lilies grew he wanted to have one of them for her.  It was an exotic flower as she was she in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe did not care, if he would not amke it to his classes on time. He wanted to be with Jeny now.  This instance. However he wanted the flower first to show how he felt about her.  He longed to see her and she was here.  Here!  Why did she not show herself to him. He tore off get to the pond.  He did not care as to how he had to get back or anything else.  How he wanted that flower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was grwoing behind a maze and walls of reeds that concealed it.  He did not wish to get his clotehs dirty, so,he drew them offas he slithered through the growing plants that rose their like sentinels.  He heard three voices at h=firts he thought he was hearing the birds in the pond.  Then as he got closer to the water, the voices grew in distinguiction.  One was a girls, if he was correct,her voice was attached to a elderly girl named Sandra, her hair was red it fell in shimmering waves to her shoulders, sher bosom was full, and she was adorned with freckles,  The two other voices were male. One was an olive skinned boy whom he though was Bastesst, he was brawny fast moving, quick witted as a rat with curly black hair, and the other was Denys who was blonde as the ari=hare us white, huge musclar broad shouldered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, whose going to know!\" Bastesst asked, ashe was drawing closer to the wall through which Ryan now hid. <br>\r\n\"I am too, close.  I have to slip away!  FRom here, but how?' Ryan pondered, he saw a stone, maybe.  Just, maybe i willl draw up that stone and thrwo it in another direction, that will grant me, the time, I will need to get away from here before being caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis foot slipped.  He fell, crashing throughj the bullrushes before him.  The wall still hid him, but it would do him no good.  His hand reached out and grabbed a stalk of a bull rush.  Only it felt warm and siney. Not hard like a bullrush should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are in trouble now!\" Sandra shreiked.as she pulled her hand out of what ever had just grasped her wrist from behind, which was where Bastesst was looking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, we were being watched.\" Denys warned, He peered past Sandra's naked form to see Ryan's face looking into his own.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have you been there?\"Bastesst demanded as he advanced further towards the hand that toppled into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just got here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I will go about my business and you go about yours.\"Ryan said as he tried to think his way oof this mess.  SAndra's globes for her rear began to turn as she peeked over her shoulder, to se him.  Ryan saw the nipple that was erect and full and pink.  Sandra dove into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDenys looked a little more than a listle shocked to be caught here, by this scruff a boy.   The magic that was going to be this momment was gone as was the setting sun.   His huge man hood shrunk to its usual size.  RyaN SMIRKED<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am going too..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan!\" SAndra said,  behind Ryan, as she drew up his clothes and ran towards him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you do not seem to  be able to dictate terms to us, do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was dressed, but with each step put her hands onher wide hips , and with her opposing hand she undid a button at a time so as that her breasts were totally exposed  she kissed him,by drawing his heda up to hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan did not like the size of her breasts, they were huge.  Her nipples were huge.  They were unlike Jenny's which would fill a champange glass.  But his nose was now restingon one of her nipples  He drewhis mouth about it.  How he woudl ahve loved to have been able to do this with Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Hell it wasn't even breakfast yet, what was I here for again?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yeah getting a flower for Jenny, but it had to be the ones by the lake. They had magic about them, they lasted longer than most known flowers. I figured she could slot it in her hair on a nice summer day, flower power and all that shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then I realised my situation at this point, and my eyes went wide. A girl was forcing herself upon me, one that wasn't Jenny. I knew this was wrong, and I wasn't going to stand for it! With a grunt I forcibly shoved the woman off of me, reaching for my school uniform. Since she had been kind enough to bring it to me at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck off....\" I muttered out, I felt angry. Angry at myself and angry at this woman, if I was a prefect I'd have all three of them nicked. But I remained calm as best I could, and without a word I stood up now dressed once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra and co I kinda knew, they were students here at Starmage Academy. No doubt planning to test some magic on themselves, I heard tales of magic being used for erotic situations. I'd need to talk to Jenny about that, perhaps sex in mid air or something like that. Yeah that was pretty darn appealing right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there it was, white as snow was a lily perched by the pond. I made to grab it by the stalk, and yanked it out. Now I just needed to get it cleaned up and presentable for Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All that just for a flower?\" Bastesst asked, a hint of annoyance in his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glared at him, before giving a small smirk \"At least I ain't trying to have a three way in a public place, the prefects would have a field day against you. Just do it in the bedroom, that's what me and my girl get up to.\" I replied. That was a half lie, sure we had....touched each other but not the main event. That was for a very good occasion, who knows if I play my cards right I might get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bring the flower up to my nose, breathing the beautiful smell. Ah just a perfect gift for one's lover. I then turned to Sandra, who had her hands on her hips. \"Don't worry, we won't tell if you don't. We'd all lose.\" she said to me, well good to know this wasn't blackmail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might want to cover up, chilly day. Anyway I need to get going, let's all do ourselves a favour and not tell anyone. Or be seen together as well, okay?\" I asked and got answers that stated a mutual agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd without another word I left them there, to do whatever it was they were doing. I think I handled myself quite alright there, doing all that training gave me immense self-discipline. Now to get the lily ready, what's the best way to give it to my darling kitten?</span></div></div>",

Rips in the fabric of space/time were much like rip currents in the ocean, anyone caught too close to them will be pulled 'out to sea'. The prefects were running in to assist but they were not fast enough as Chon, Jenny, Charlie, and I were ripped off our feet and cast into the rip only seconds before it sealed itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe found ourselves in a torn up living room somewhere, facing two stunned young boys. The first, who looked no older than seven, was skinny with dark brown hair and gem green eyes. The other, who looked to be about twelve years old had jet black hair and fiery hazel eyes. They both had their hands open with a white hot globe of energy rotating over the palm as it sparked with electricity.  I could only guess it was some form of offensive posture and took a defensive stand with Chon following my lead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, the two boys stared at us before the youngest boy angrily turned to who I believed was his older brother. \"You paradoxical, obstinate, irksome, tempestuous, adolescent nincompoop!\" Furious, he rambled.

Mattie.\" Grinning, Nathan said. \"Consider yourself lucky I did not make the change permanent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he turned with incredible speed and hurled the second vial at Tex. Only he was ready for it and used some type of mental shield to deflect it. \"I will not allow myself to be subject to change, father!\" Annoyed, he said. \"Choose a different punishment!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vial flew back across the room, directly at me! Normally, I would have been able to dodge such an object with ease but I knew that if I did, it would hit one of my friends. I heard Jenny cry out a warning but it was too late. The vial slammed against my chest and I was instantly covered in a green colored ooze that seemed to seep into every pour of my being. Asura did not react so I had to assume whatever was being done to me was neither life threatening or permanent. Once the ooze fell off and dissipated into nothing, Jenny looked at me surprised. \"What did that stuff do to me?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny blushed brightly then began to giggle. \"Not bad, Ryan.\" Barely controlling her giggles, she said. \"You make a very cute...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryan's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck did you call me?\" I muttered out, I kinda felt groggy after that vial hit me. Like I'd been punched or something, but that was no strange feeling to me. After all I got kicked in the head several times by Chon and lived so yeah, used to it. But I still felt....off, like something was there that there shouldn't be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down, no breasts there. There wouldn't be anyway, British people are supposed to be immune to it. Something to do with a great war that happened long time ago, British people eventually just became immune to it due to constant exposure to it. I remember when some witch students in the US tried to use a genderswap spell on me, I just folded my arms and laughed at them. Was there any other sort of magic they used? Jenny was a pro at healing magic, even better with her cat blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon wasn't British, but he was immune as well. His older Brother was killed by witches, in turn this left Chon with a seething hatred for anything magic related. Like a sort of rage barrier if you would. There was one time when a young witch tried to perform a transgender spell on Chon. He would have broken her arm in three places if me and Jenny didn't intervene, and don't get me started on what he wanted to do with Charlie's older twin sisters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut back to my current situation, I felt strange. I quickly blocked everything out, the two odd boys arguing, Jenny laughing. My hearing felt\u2026.odd, like it was more sensitive. Something else felt odd, I felt there was something on my body. Like a\u2026tail?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes went wide, I turned to try and catch a glimpse of this limb. But then I realize that I\u2019d not get it that way, so I reached a hand behind me. And sure enough I felt a tail there, I was as composed as best I could. Since becoming involved with the supernatural I had learned to be as composed as possible, even more so considering I had become the unofficial head of the dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe FUCK?!\u201d I found myself yelling out, I could hear Jenny laughing. Charlie was confused, Chon was on guard and looking at the apparent Father of the two boys who were responsible for bringing us here. Amy was just looking stunned, I really wish Light was here. Having a big guy like him meant everyone usually had the kid gloves on.<br>\r\nI then turned my attention to the boy who had deflected the vial at me, I think his name was Tex or something? He was giving me an odd sort of look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA male Neko?\u201d he said aloud. So that\u2019s what I was? I always heard it was females who were that, but I could be wrong of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly my body was on auto pilot, I dropped Asura. Who had been oddly quiet, usually he was barking about danger being near. With both my hands free I grabbed the Tex boy by his collar, and lifted him up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough!\u201d the Father bellowed, I heard him. I was tempted, it\u2019d feel good to be sure. But I knew I needed to be reasonable, after all we were in their place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry! Thought you lot were attacking, Asura!\u201d I said, in an instant the blade flew into my left hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI apologize, you were brought here by accident. My children can be a tad hard to deal with as you can see, they are good hearted though I assure you.\u201d Their Father said to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPssh, that\u2019s what they all say.\u201d Chon said, I couldn\u2019t blame him. I turned to look at Tex, he looked a bit shaken. Probably because I was grabbing him without using any magic or stuff like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s just calm down, I\u2019ll find out where you came from and discuss with your school. I can tell from your uniforms, why don\u2019t you sit down and have some tea?\u201d the Father said, he was trying to be the peacemaker here. I could tell, I\u2019ve said stuff like that before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. \u201c I simply muttered, I\u2019ve been attacked once. I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll be like this, I may have just ended up creating history. Bloody great, the man gestured to a nearby table with a pair of couches. My team and I took a seat, my tail now sticking between my legs. Jenny looked like she was about to burst into laughter, but my stare got rid of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSexier than you.\u201d I muttered to her, a pout on her face in reply.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Smiling, she asked. \"I mean, you did come out looking cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gentle stoking was sending waves of pleasure down my spine and I began to purr. I snapped out of it though and gripped Jenny's hand. \"Play time later.\" With a half smile, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny grinned as I released her then turned to Nathan. \"Where I come from, we are supposed to be immune to magical transformations.\" Serious, I said. \"How was I changed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The laws of physics and genetics do not work the same in this world as they do in yours so your immunity does not have as much power here.\" Serious, Nathan replied. \"Our worlds are compatible enough to allow a safe change.\" He again grinned. \"However, your immunity did come into play as the serum was designed to change a person's gender as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank goodness for small favors.\" Sighing, you said. \"My sword normally moves on its own to defend me against threats...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your life was never in any danger.\" Simply, Nathan said. \"Your sword must have sensed that and not acted as there was no need to reveal its power to strangers like ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good point.\" Thoughtful, I said. \"What will be done with your son who caused this change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your transformation was completely accidental.\" Annoyed, Tex blurted out. \"It is not my fault or concern that you can not dodge a low velocity glass projectile.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan shook his head. \"It is your fault and concern that you can not redirect said projectile away from innocent bystanders.\" Sternly, Nathan countered. \"Therefore, as your punishment, you will return to our visitors' world when the rift is open. There, you will spend three weeks to a month as a transfer student until; your power gains enough resistance to send you back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex turned pale. \"That is can't be legal!\" Startled, he protested. \"There must be some law forbidding such a practice!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan let out a maniacal laugh that even made me shudder slightly. \"It is forbidden to <i>permanently</i> transfer a person into a parallel world.\" Amused, he explained. \"However, a temporary transfer is perfectly legal.\" He then turned to me. \"All I require is the permission of a party from the other world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He will return here on his own in three weeks to a month?\" Confirming Nathan's words, I asked. \"We will not have to open a rift for him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan shook his head. \"It is not necessary.\" Bemused, he said. \"If you all were to stay here, you would automatically return to your own worlds in the same amount of time as the rip was not lock sealed when it closed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lock sealed?\" Confused, Charlie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its like bricking up a door.\" Simply, Chon explained. \"Once sealed, its hard to open again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan nodded. \"Exactly.\" He then turned his attention onto Chon. \"I see someone attempted to make you a male witch.\" Chon sighed then silently nodded. Nathan shook his head. \"You are close to being just that; a powerful one in fact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon raised a single eyebrow but remained silent. I knew that he was not very comfortable with the subject and I was about to speak when Charlie chimed in. \"What are you saying, Mr Moray?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNathan smiled, keeping his eyes on Chon. \"With your permission, young man, I can take you across the threshold. Our mad science is <i>centuries</i> beyond magic; I could enhance your power so you can work magic as a male the likes witches could only <i>dream</i> about.\" He paused, allowing his words to sink in before more softly adding, \"However, as you are guest to this reality, I am required to first gain your permission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon remained silent then finally replied...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chon\u2019s POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard the man offer to teach me magic, did I hear that correctly? Magic, the very thing that killed my older Brother. He was offering to teach me it? I don\u2019t think he was lying when he said that, but what to do? Witches had killed my older Brother, and in turn I hunted them to the ends of the Earth and brought violent death upon them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack when I was starting at this school I viewed it as a blight, something unstable and a ticking time bomb. It was far from my use of martial arts and chi energy, what good was magic when a blade was close to your eyes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then I heard a voice in my head scream out with \u201cLearn it! Use the very tool that took that which was dear to you! You could wreak your revenge, and crush any who opposed you!\u201d it was soon followed by images of me tearing my foes limb from limb. Fireballs shooting out of my left hand, and I grabbed a witch with the other and set her alight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut another voice chimed in with \u201cThat tool cannot be trusted, it took away your Brother. And what were to happen if you turned to evil? Power corrupts, absolute power will corrupt absolutely. Your hands are already powerful, and stained with blood. Just how long would it take for you to trip over the blood that you have spilled onto the floor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a fair point, what if I turned evil because of it? Would Ryan strike me down? Would my adopted children fall into evil also? Or would they strike me down? It was quite a somber thought to be sure, could I be trusted with such a thing? If I was here before I took in those twin girls, I might have accepted and gone after those who killed my Brother with even more reckless abandon. Until I was either in a body bag or they all were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn\u2019t care back then, when the odds were bad I threw myself into the chaos. Perhaps it was out of some misguided belief that if I died I\u2019d be with my Brother once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now I was different, I had things to cling onto. Things worth fighting for, and I wasn\u2019t going to give it away just so I could learn how to transform into a cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, thank you. I don\u2019t trust it, in my belief and experience magic in general is a blight. Something that can\u2019t be fully controlled, I will not use it. For I would most likely succumb to the darkness around it.\u201d I said, turning around.<br>\r\nI thought I could hear Ryan, with my enhanced senses I thought he was giving a minor smirk. No doubt impressed by my self-control. I remained silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan\u2019s POV<br>\r\n\u201cWell you have improved Chon, I thought you have taken that in a heartbeat to gain more power. But you would probably be corrupted, and it wouldn\u2019t be pretty for any of us.\u201d I thought to myself. I was ready to go, and I was thinking about my form right now. A catboy, and considering what Jenny just did to me at least I knew how to please her in the sack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI recalled a time when me and Jenny had left starmage thanks to the October holiday, and a neighbor had seen Jenny\u2019s cat ears and tail. However she seemed to think that Jenny was visiting me for some uh\u2026.fetish sex. Thankfully she didn\u2019t freak out or anything like that, otherwise there would have been an incident for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then my gaze turned to the guy who was protesting, Tex or something was his name. I don\u2019t know why, it must have been my cat genes. But I was starting to get a bit annoyed, so I said something that would put him in his place for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne of our dorm mates is a former cannibal, and I stress former. But I doubt your brain would sate his hunger anyway.\u201d I could tell we were going to get along just fine, and sure enough he was about to come up with something to say back to me. However he got cut off by his Father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnough, I understand your reason for not wanting to learn magic. I shall respect your decision, Tex you will come along with our guests and explain the situation. And no buts. Are we clear?\u201d he barked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw Text open his mouth as if to say something, but then he sighed and said \u201cYes Father, lead the way.\u201d Looking at me.<br>\r\nI merely nodded and motioned for the rest of my team to come with me. In truth I wasn\u2019t exactly happy with this, but at least it wasn\u2019t some giant thing with more teeth than the Osborn family trying to make a lunch out of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOne last thing, while you are in that state do not attempt to mate with your girlfriend. The results could be unpredictable, I can tell you that at least.\u201d I turned to look at the man with wide eyes, I could see that happening. And then me and Jenny would end up creating what could be a male Neko. Better to just let nature run its course, if we do have a kid then\u2026..Nah better not think on it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Father opened a portal in front of us, I grabbed my katana and Jenny\u2019s hand. Doing a motion with my head for Tex to come with us, without a word we entered the portal to travel back to Starmage.</span></div></div>",

Would you like to see the world your mother came from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica smiled. \"I'll get packed!\" Excited, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a dull flash and Jessica was holding two pieces of luggage. Tex grunted before a second flash revealed luggage of his own. \"How long will we be staying with them?\" Curious, Jessica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About three weeks.\" Honestly, Nathan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica nodded then took note of my new form. \"I take it Tex had some fun with you?\" Bemused, she asked. \"I'll help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waved her hand at me and I instantly found myself back to normal to Jenny's smile. \"You made a cute Neko boy.\" Teasing, she said. \"It's a pity I can't change you into one back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a witch.\" Flatly, Chon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a genius.\" Unphased, Jessica countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His brother was killed by rogue witches.\" Wincing, I explained. \"They also... did things to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica frowned. \"My mother was killed by a rogue Chi master.\" Softly, she said. \"However, revenge is fool's game.\" She turned to Chon. \"There is good and evil in all of us. If you seek evil, that is all you will ever find.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small grin touched the corners of Chon's mouth. \"That's what Jenny said to me when we first met.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see you are all going to get along just fine.\" Grinning, Nathan said. He opened the rift then pushed Jessica and Tex forward. \"I will see you two in a few weeks.\" Oh, and Ryan...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Nathan. \"Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No special treatment.\" Expressing a deep seriousness, Nathan commanded. \"They are to be treated like any other temporary transfer student. No better and no worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I followed the others into the rift and it closed behind us. We were back where we started with two new students to watch over. \"I wonder why Mr Moray demanded no special treatment.\" Curious, Jenny said. \"What makes them so special?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica sighed. \"My grandfather is the head mad scientist, the leader of our secret world.\" Gravely, she said. \"He is the equivalent to your head witch, the leader of your secret world. My father is next in line to take the throne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just great.\" Sarcastically, Charlie said. \"We have to babysit royal brats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica giggled, seeing Charlie's humor.

Too bad it was late as usual, I learned not to really rely on them. Too busy helping other people, that's why I ain't inclined to be one. If I was told to be one I'd just shrug and do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight walked over to me and said \"What happened boss?\" noticing our new arrivals. Oh how I wished I'd been able to bring him with me, if you have a choice between taking me or Light. Your going to take the big guy into a fight, the guy could walk into a nuclear explosion and be just fine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long story.\" I said, I then turned to Jenny and Chon and said \"You guys stay here, bring everyone up to speed.\" moving down the hallway I motioned to Tex and Jessica and said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two come with me, the Dean will want to have words with you. And do me a favour, don't speak to anyone yet. The last thing we need is an inter-universe war.\" I said, the truth couldn't have been further based off my personal history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure lead the way.\" Jessica said to me, Tex was silent. As if he was reserving judgement till we met the one in charge, well that was fine by me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI moved out the dorm, a couple of prefects came up to me. But before they could speak I just said \"Taking them to the Dean, everything's fine now move.\" both prefects who were girls were silent. But they moved aside, knowing I wasn't one to be argued with right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter giving another motion for the two guests to follow me, we walked up to the main building. I had blocked everything out, I was just focused on this. A short elevator ride later and we went down a grand hallway, whereupon a pair of red and fancy doors stood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knocked on it a couple of times, I heard a female voice say \"Enter.\" and did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Carlson, what brings you here?\" Elvira said, she had been reading a large and thick tome and set it down upon seeing me. She frowned when she saw the two people I was bringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you've come back from that rift travel, who are these people?\" Elvira said as she stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh Jessica and Tex Moray, they are from the rift we went through. Their Father wants them to be here for about a month or so.\" I said rubbing the back of my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira was glaring with intent at Tex, it was the sort of look that could make a normal person start sweating with fear. I could tell. But oddly enough Tex seemed unfazed, Jessica was lightly biting her lower lip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You, Tex Moray is it? \"You are just as cocky and impulsive as your grandfather, Devlin Moray. I can tell that much by the look in your eyes.\" Elvira said folding her arms and looking at him with a look of minor annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex smiled. \"Why thank you.\" I inwardly groaned, that was the last thing you should have said idiot. Not even Light is that thick, and he's still learning to read and write cause he spent most his life as a test subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"That was not a compliment.\" Sternly, Elvira said. She then whispered, \"Damn mad scientists...\" She turned to me. \"Devlin Moray is the head mad scientist in his world.\" she explained to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay now I groaned aloud, I felt a headache coming on. I had enough of mad science in this world, and now something from another? All this was really getting to me, I think I need to visit a shrink. That would be nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it we will have to treat Tex carefully then I take it? You know with the kid gloves.\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Elvira smiled. \"Treat him like any regular visiting student.\" Firmly but kindly, she said. \"Tex's father left strict instructions not to allow Tex any special privileges. He is not to be treated better or worse than any 'troubled' student.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that was a relief, at least I could kick his arse if he got out of control. \"What about the chick?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Jessica.\" she chimed back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are to be treated the same also, now if there's anything else Carlson please take them back to your dorm. They start school first thing in the morning.\" Elvira said, she was about to sit back down and start reading when I realised I did have something to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is something actually Dean, how did you know their Father?\" I asked, I was curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira sighed and took a deep breath, oh boy here came a big explanation. But it's what I asked for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"200 years ago, a gigantic rift had opened over the lands of this world. It enveloped several witch boys and girls into another universe, one that mirrors our own. But instead it was the boys who were the ones that could use what we over here refer to as magic. But instead they called it mad science, a term that was later used for what boys now use over here to combat magic. I'm on personal speaking terms with their Father, only those who have attained true power in their fields can talk between worlds.\" Elvira said as she walked around the room. Ending it by looking out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took in a deep breath myself, trying to wrap my head around this. Multiple worlds exist, different types of magic exist.<br>\r\n\"So there could be an alternate universe, where I never went to this school then?\" I asked aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira gave a grim nod \"And trust me when I say that is not a universe you wish to go to, let's just say that without you Carlson your dorm mates would have never been okay.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blocked the morbid thoughts out, that was all I could do. Jessica put a hand on my back and said \"Don't worry about it, just do what you can here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that I gave a smirk \"Sounds like something my girlfriend would say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that I bid farewell to the headmaster of the academy, and left with my two new dorm mates.</span></div></div>",

This was unusual and had unnatural written all over it. One did not have to be a genius to know trouble was about to brew. \"Asura!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn open window allowed my sword to fly to my hand. Just as I sheathed her at my side, one lightning bolt struck through the same open window at an unnatural angle. It flew passed me harmlessly, striking the floor between the Ren sisters and the two visitors. There was a flash before a tall, dark elderly man appeared where the odd lightning had struck. He sported an eighteenth century gentleman's suit with unusually long coat tails that moved about as if they had a mind of their own. He wore knee high riding boots, a top hat covering his raven black hair, and carried a silver tipped cane with a large diamond. His eyes hid behind round shining glasses while he held a toothy, almost sinister grin. It was the head mad scientist of the alien world; Jessica and Tex's grandfather, Devlin Moray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I simply must remember to tone down that teleporter.\" Waving at a the stunned Ren twins, he muttered. \"It's so dramatic.\" He chuckled madly. \"I do apologize if I caused you a fright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then turned away from them to face Jessica and Tex. \"What, what are you doing her, grandpa?\" Worried, Jessica asked. \"Is there a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sweet wildflower, you worry too much.\" Grinning, Devlin said. \"Relax and enjoy the wonders and discoveries that await you in your mother's home world.\" He then turned to Tex, still grinning.<br>\r\n\"Greetings, my insane grandson. You have a rare opportunity to reap your harvest of alien knowledge. Experiment, explore, and expand your visions to the next horizon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex smiled proudly. \"With honor, grandfather.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I watched this exchange, I found myself feeling greatly outgunned against this head mad scientist. I could feel his power literally radiating off of him. The Ren twins, I noticed, also could sense his power and wisely hurried away so not to provoke him. I stiffened slightly as he turned my way and offered a sinister grin. He surprised me by removing his hat and bowing deeply in a proper England greeting. \"Greetings and salutations, Ryan Carlson.\" Standing, he said. \"Your heroic exploits are legend even in my world. You have my deepest respect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... Thank you, Mr Moray.\" Taken back, I said. \"Please state your business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevlin placed his hat back onto his head and motioned to the dean's office with his cane. \"I have an important meeting with dean Tanaka.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I fear Mr Tanaka has retired from the position of dean at this school, Mr Moray.\" Serious, I said. \"The new dean is Mrs Elvira Smith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevlin chuckled. However, this was a kind chuckle that showed his true gentle nature. \"You have the correct definition but the wrong usage.\" Firmly, he said. \"Mr Tanaka is also your world's ambassador. He is the one who negotiated a lasting peace agreement between yours and several other realities, including my own. We code named him 'The Dean'. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Just when you thought you knew everything about someone...\"</i> Bemused, I thought. Then I said, \"As a school prefect, I must insist that you enter the school by more normal means in the future. Your entrance could have sparked a panic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevlin smiled, holding back a laugh. \"Of course.\" Amused, he said. \"How uncouth of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then summoned a door from nowhere and walled through it. The door vanished, leaving me standing in the hall, wondering what he was up to. A knock startled me and I turned to find the door behind me. Someone was knocking. Curious, I opened the door to find Devlin standing on the other side, grinning madly at me. \"I request permission to enter your school.\" Clearly amused, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex laughed hysterically. \"Impressive come back, grandfather!\" Grinning, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica shook her head. \"Grandpa, really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI merely shook my head, bemused. Devlin Moray was indeed insane; just as dean Elvira warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I wonder how Mr Tanaka puts up with these characters.\"</i> I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was morbidly curious and lead Devlin to my dorm room where he took out a device, scanning the room with various harmless lasers. When he was satisfied, he returned the device to his coat pocket and sat down on a chair. \"We face two unique situations of which requires your assistance.\" Serious, he began. \"The first involves a witch test on Jessica Moray. The witch council insists upon testing her magical power as she has chaotic energy in her blood.

Jessica must finds the power within herself to return home and, if she fails, she will remain in this world until I can retrieve her in one year time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a rather cruel test.\" Annoyed, I said. \"You can't expect me to do nothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be too busy with the second situation, Mr Carlson.\" Evenly, Devlin said. \"We have found the rogue witches and psychotic mad scientists responsible for John the light killer's plight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rose to my feet, my anger fuming. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a dark pact between your rogues and our psychos.\" Darkly, Devlin explained. \"The rogues wanted a male witch and the psychos wanted a female mad scientist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat back down, my face turning pale. \"Tell me what you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevlin took in a breath. \"To create a male witch, the rogues needed magic from a world where it worked for males.\" Beginning his story, he said. \"They stole a sample of blood from my son, Nathan Moray and used their magic to infuse male magic into John. However, as you know, two magics can never mix; you can not predict the outcome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's how they did it.\" Sighing, I said. \"Why can't John work magic then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it is not magic.\" Raising a single brow, Devlin replied. \"It's mad science; it works slightly differently and what we call real magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are these rogues and... psychos?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are awaiting trial in the void between your world and ours.\" Simply, Devlin said. \"Still, there is another twist to this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Rolling my eyes, I said. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nathan Moray found out about this history and is declaring your friend, John his pseudo son.\" Serious, Devlin said. \"That <i>unintentional</i> incident is actually Nathan's mad plan to send Tex to persuade John to willingly join his family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John will never agree to that.\" Shaking my head, I warned. \"He has a family with us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is why I am telling you this, Mr Ryan Carlson.\" Darkly, Devlin said. \"I am required to inform those in authority that John can not be forced into this. It must be of his own free will or we risk destroying the delicate peace we now enjoy between witches and mad scientists.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I tell John?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell him what you feel he must know.\" Standing up, Devlin said. \"I must speak with Dean Tanaka so we may decide what to do with those who broke the highest law of mad scientists and witches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The highest law?\" Confused, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevlin nodded. \"Rule number one of mad scientists and witches alike. \"Never...

It's not magic you are wielding as you thought, it's mad science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex was being serious here, his usually cheerful looks dropping into a look that Ryan would shoot me when he meant business.

Project Dark Bringer was to create a female mad scientist.\" He then turned to Ryan. \"According to Devlin Moray's report, there is another you in Tex's world who has been trying to rescue the girl, Joan.\" Looking him in the eye, he said. \"You only know her as Dark Ryan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan's eyes grew wide as saucers. \"What!?!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seeing my expression, John nodded, a bemused look forming on his face. \"The reality you had visited is parallel to our own only everyone is of the opposite gender.\" Ruefully, he said. \"Devlin Moray is the male version of Elvira Strange only instead of being calm and serious, he is sarcastic and mad as a hatter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Slightly unnerved, I said. \"What of Tex and his family?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn chuckled, turning to Light. \"Tex is the male version of my twin sister, Melanie.\" Smiling, he said. \"Only instead of becoming fearful when physically confronted, he becomes happy and excited. When you attacked him, he thought you were trying to bond with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh that's just perfect!\" Throwing his arms in the air, Light exclaimed. \"I have a maniac who thinks getting physically attacked is a good thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wisely hid my smile and turned to John. \"What can you tell me about the people holding this Joan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are the male versions of Light's tormentors.\" His smile vanishing, John explained. \"Tex is hell bent upon destroying them for murdering his mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So their visit here has multiple hidden agendas.\" Shaking my head, I said. \"Lovely...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn sighed. \"Witches have many agendas in their ways as well.\" Flatly, he said. \"The only edge we have right now is that we know they will be coming here. We can prepare for their arrival.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knowing that this Tex character is like Mel, only a guy, I think I can better handle him.\" Smirking, Light said. \"As for this Joan, I will help Ryan free her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just not sure I want her with Dark Ryan.\" Worried, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One step at a time, Ryan.\" Serious, John cautioned. \"We may only get one shot at this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"Agreed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I walked back to my dorm, I wondered what to do. \"I wanted to warn Tex not to push Light but, knowing he was like Mel, he'd likely be a stubborn one.

Jenny and Charlie were in stunned silence while Chon let out a low sigh. The V twins looked confused, Light seemed trapped between horror and fury. Amy was clearly unnerved by it all while Lunar seemed to be still taking it all in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay... Let me get this straight.\" Darkly, Chon said. \"The world this Tex and Jessica came from is a gender bent version of our own. Tex' father believes that because Light has some of his DNA, he is his son and wants to adopt him. The female version of Light is called Joan, still under the control of her tormentors and is expected to come here to kidnap Light for their own ends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That pretty much sums it up.\" Flatly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't let anyone take you away... will you, Jon?\" Finding his voice, Charlie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight smiled slightly. Charlie was not what one would call a fighter but he had a goo heart. \"I'm not going anywhere, kid.\" Quietly, he replied. \"Don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If they try to take him, they're in for a fight.\" Stepping up, Jenny said. \"Jon is our family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight tried to hide the hint of a blush. His friends had indeed become his family and their loyalty to him was unquestionable. \"I can deal with Tex, now having a better idea of what he is like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tex is not the issue.\" Serious, I said. \"It's this Dark Bringer, Joan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a powerful voice stated, \"Indeed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone turned to see Devlin Moray enter the room. He removed his hat then removed his glasses. They revealed glowing eyes that resembled Chon's only they could see his pupils. He turned to Light with a heavy sigh. \"Tex told me of your decision to remain in this world.\" Calmly, he said. \"I respect that decision and the subject will not be brought up again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight nodded. \"Thank you.\" Softly, he said. \"Just answer me this, why would your family want to adopt me anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We mad scientists have a very strict code of conduct.\" Darkly, Devlin replied. \"We are all held accountable for every mistake; regardless of how insignificant they may seem. They all could rise into something quite catastrophic.\" He paused, allowing his words to sink in. \"My son, Nathan, allowed the criminal element to steal a sample of his blood, that is a serious offense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Losing a little blood is a serious offense?\" Confused, Jenny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevlin nodded, his eyes locked onto Light. \"That blood sample gave them the DNA needed to spark a form of magic into you, Jon Doe.\" Serious, he said. \"It was that minor lapse in judgment that threw a little boy from another world into the seventh level of hell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was he punished?\" Wincing, Light asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His punishment was to offer you a place into our family or suffer your plight from the beginning to present time.\" Darkly, Devlin replied. \"As you can see, he chose wisely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight turned pale. \"That is inhumane!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, dear boy.\" Serious, Devlin replied. \"That is chaotic law.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would not wish what I suffered on anyone.\" Almost whispering, Light muttered. \"Well, save maybe two people I know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevlin smiled slightly, putting his glasses on. \"I leave you with a simple gift, Jon Doe.\" Kindly, he said. He tapped the floor with his cane, causing Light to shiver slightly. \"Use or not use your powers as you wish, just use them wisely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he vanished as if he were never there. I turned to Light who still seemed slightly stunned. \"What did he do to you?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight opened his hand and a small glowing, sparkling globe appeared over his palm. It rotated slowly, giving off sparks of energy. \"I-I think he just gave me... magic.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We need your help immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a dull flash and everyone turned to see Juan and Christina standing in the room. Juan immediately took notice of  the globe spinning over John's hand. \"It is called a spark, John.\" Firmly but kindly, he said. \"Close your hand and it will vanish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn did so and the spark was gone. \"Devlin Moray said it was a gift for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuan sighed. \"Tell me everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI brought Juan up to date on what had happened in the passed several hours. Juan listened intently, occasionally grunting or nodding. When I had finished, Juan turned to John. \"The power that resides within you is a magic that works for boys.\" Darkly, he explained. \"Those on the other side of the rift call it chaotic energy.\" He grinned slightly. \"Witch or mad scientist, a rose by any other name...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn sighed but silently nodded. \"How does this effect me?\" Patiently, he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, you are considered a male witch.\" Serious, Juan said. \"Since your spark has been ignited, those tattoos that had restricted your power have no further hold upon you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he's at full strength.\" Catching on, Charlie said. \"That's a good thing, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuan shook his head. \"No, it's not.\" Serious. he said. \"John, thus far, your power had been controlled for you through your tattoos. Now, you need to learn how to control that power on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does this mean I have to go to that annoying school for mad scientists?\" Irritated, John asked. \"I'd be throttling those idiots the first day!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fortunately, no.\" Smiling, I said. \"Juan Smith is fully certified to teach mad science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will be both training you.\" Chiming in, Christina said. \"Your power is technically magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When do we start?\" Sighing, John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Immediately.\" Serious, Juan replied. \"However, we can do this in one of three ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is....\" Curious, John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, hearing the three options....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can be trained 'normally', taking a month of rigorous physical and mental lessons and lectures.\" Serious, Christina said. \"Instant training where we magically and 'chaotically' place all the training into your permanent memory, costing you a migraine that can last a few days, or two weeks in the field with us, learning how to control your power through constant use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you two working on?\" Darkly curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two rogue factions of witches and mad scientists are trying to rekindle the old war in the States.\" Shaking his head, Juan said. \"Our job is to capture the two leaders while keeping their fight away from the public eye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes. \"Wonderful!\" Sarcastically, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich option does John Doe pick?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Although they were still there, so I'm guessing they were still important. It's just with my new stuff it was a sort of loophole, and who knew what could happen next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was probably best that I get this training done right now, a headache didn't sound too bad. After all I've been slashed, stabbed, shot, burned, frozen, shocked, poisoned, and have more bones broken than I have in my body. I'm able to recover from even the gravest of injuries, I chalked it up to these magical ink patterns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make this quick, I don't care about the headache.\" I said bluntly, sitting down to brace myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuan sighed while Chris said nothing, the pair then waved their hands in front of me. And in an instant I fell out of my chair, groaning as I cradled my head with both hands. Information had just flown into my head, it was like flashes of ideas and books. Things that I knew were important, but I just couldn't make sense of them. It also felt like a steel pipe was shoved into my head, with it melting soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan had gone over to me, helping me up by putting my arm over his shoulder. \"Okay Light, tell you what. I'm gonna take you to your bed, and you can rest.\" he said to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't pay attention to anything else, I trusted Ryan and helped open the door to my room. Without even bothering to change my clothes I tossed my bed covers and slotted myself into bed, closing my eyes as I heard the door shutting thanks to Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't recall how long I slept, but it must have been midnight or so now. There was no sounds outside other than birds and the odd footstep here and there, darkness was near the shut blinds....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to go back to sleep, my head was still pounding. Though no where near as bad as it was earlier, I let out a sigh. I planned to turn back to sleep when suddenly I heard a couple of light raps on my door, I groaned aloud. I then dug down deep and got out of bed. I stormed over to the door and tossed it open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Light?\" I heard a female voice say to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lunar? What's wrong?\" I said, the petite robot girl stood in front of me. Her hands in front of her, a look of sadness on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I please come in? I wish to say something in private to you.\" she muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rub my head, the ringing in my head still occurring. Although thanks to my healing factor it wasn't as bad, still wouldn't want to do any heavy stuff right now though. I wanted nothing more than to sleep, till I felt better. But Ryan said I should always lend a ear to those who want it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, take a seat on the bed.\" I mutter, Lunar without a word moves into my room. I shut the door behind me. I sit next to the pink haired girl. She was created to fight alongside me, by those who made me. She found me one day after tracking my footprints through the nearby forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's wrong?\" I say to her, I've not really done this stuff. Lunar was the one who asked questions about simple stuff, stuff that I knew and vice versa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunar sighed, and she looked kinda sad. The first time I ever saw her like that, she was usually calm, polite and happy.<br>\r\n\"I....I've been thinking, about you. And us....\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stayed silent, waiting for her to go on. The robot girl went on with \"Light, I've learned that what was done to you was wrong. Horrible, something that no one should have gone through. Except perhaps Charlie's older Sisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that I gave a smirk, but it went away as Lunar carried on with \"Light...I'm so so sorry....I was created to serve those who were evil, all without knowing....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lunar....\" I muttered, my headache was being ignored right now. And then I noticed, Lunar was crying. But how? Wasn't she a robot?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could entertain this trial of thought anymore Lunar continued with \"Light, I was created to be used as a weapon. To aid you in missions of evil. But I don't want that! You and everyone else have opened me up to things I never knew of, I've felt happy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink haired robot girl then turned around, embracing me with enough force to tackle me down onto the bed.<br>\r\n\"Light, I was made to fight alongside you. But I don't want it to be for evil! I want to fight alongside you because I care for you, I love you!\" Lunar then seemed to break down, not in the machine sense but rather she was crying into my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI instinctively embraced her, burying my nose into her hair. I said nothing to her tears, allowing her to get it out of her system as I was taught to do years ago.</span></div></div>",

Instead, I found two large steel doors where the night before there was my bookshelf. \"What the bloody hell!?\" Confused, Lunar asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay behind me.\" Quickly, I ordered. \"I don't like the looks of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, to my surprise, the bookshelf that was there last night slid out from behind the wall, moving to hide the two steel doors. I leaped forward, grabbing the two halves of the bookcase and forced them back open to inspect the steel doors. Only, as I moved to force them open, they came open on their own with a dull clang and I found Juan standing inside a huge laboratory on the other side!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You better have one hell of an explanation!\" Annoyed, I muttered. \"You nearly gave us both a heart attack with all of your banging around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do deeply apologize.\" Genuinely, Juan said. \"However, it is mandatory for every mad scientist to have a laboratory at their disposal. This one is yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked passed Juan into the laboratory he had apparently built for me. All I could see were horrific memories of my past life before Ryan rescued me. \"Fuck... The damn place is full of ghosts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is not required for a mad scientist to use their laboratory.\" Serious, Juan stated. \"It is completely up to you how to use or not use it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunar looked inside the laboratory and shook her head. \"How can this even be here?\" Curious, she asked. \"There is another dorm room just on the other side of this wall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuan grinned. \"That is one of the advantages of mad science.\" Cryptically, he said. \"We can put our laboratories literally anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned red with impatience. \"Well you can put this laboratory up your...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Mr. Light.\" Interrupting, a robotic voice stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked passed Juan again to find a hologram of a tall, elderly man standing in the middle of the entryway of the lab. \"I am Gyro, your holographic lab assistant and butler.\" A cup of steaming tea appeared on a table to my right. \"Would you car for a spot of tea to take the morning edge off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small grin touched the corners of my mouth. \"Scratch what I just said.\" Walking to the tea, I muttered. \"This might not be so bad after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuan nodded. \"I'm off then.

Light's creators might be intent on trying to reclaim their former test subject now that's it's known he's here. But I believe the odds are quite stacked in our favour, nobody has managed to get the better of us or this school yet. And also the rouge witch hunters are just a teleport spell away, although they have been known to despise Chon. Mostly because of his reputation in the witch community in general, but to be honest neither he nor I give a shit about that. I know him better than anyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight's practising his new found powers, it's hard to believe the sort of things he's got. When I first met him in the forest outside school grounds I thought he was just a raving lunatic. But there's more to him than that, okay well his fighting style is that of a lunatic. Seriously the guy just tosses out powerful moves, and then there was the one time he played Ganondorf in Smash Bros. And then Light attempted to replicate the warlock punch, slitting his wrist and letting the magic blood trickle down his hand. What resulted was a destroyed wall and he got his ear chewed off by the Dean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, perhaps he's actually going to learn for once.\" I muttered to myself. And then the next thing I here is this big thudding noise. Followed by Lunar screaming, fuck. I spoke too soon it seems. Without even pausing to wonder what the hell that noise was I grab my katana, containing the soul of Azura within. That noise was large and heavy, could it be that Light's makers have attacked now?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kick open the door, Lunar is at the nearby wall. Light's close to her, they catch sight of me and Light says \"Ryan! Look at this shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former test subject pointed in the middle of the room, and my mouth went slightly agape. There was a huge chunk of ice, like something you'd find from the artic. But that didn't concern me, what concerned me was the fact that there was a person inside of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.fightersgeneration.com/nz4/char/undernight/akatsuki-victory-art.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.fightersgeneration.com/nz4/ch...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lunar what the hell happened?!\" I shout, I can hear the footsteps of my companions rushing behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Carlson, Light was practising the powers of his mad science lineage. When suddenly there was a tremendous influx of power when he tried to create his first event. I believe it might have been due to his power limiting tattoos, but regardless the fact is that for some reason as of now still unknown to me. This frozen man has been summoned here.\" Gyro said in his calm robot tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's the one thing I don't really like about those mad scientist guys, they have these sort of robot butlers. But I'll tolerate it for now at least, we have bigger concerns. Lunar looks closely at the man and says \"I detect life signs within him, let's free him as quick as possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so we set about that, Chon and I begin chipping away at the ice block. The blind man using a pair of Chinese jian blades and I'm using Azura, Lunar pitches in by using her jet leg boosters to help melt the ice. Jenny's handling Charlie and the V girls right now, Amy's keeping watch just in case anything happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ice then melted, and the man was freed. I look him over, he seemed to be maybe 20 or so. And clearly Japanese too. He groans and holds his head with both hands, he then seems to realise where he is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doko? Koko wa doko?\" he muttered. And it's Japanese, I should know. I spent a year in Asia before going to Starmage Academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kneel down to his level and say \"Anata wa k\u014dri no burokku ni arimashita. Anata no namae wa nanidesu ka?\" I'm not sure if this guy speaks English. Best we try to find out who he is and then go from there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's shivering, but he makes an effort to look at me and says \"S-Shomei Akatsuki......Watashi wa Nihon kara kimashita.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uso tsuke.\" I mutter under my breath. It's then that Azura starts to glow, usually to get my attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lord, I feel as if this man should be important to us......I think he may be related to me.\" he speaks within my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! How?\" I think, if this guy is then he could be an ally for us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly.......</span></div></div>",

Shomei, his outfit isn't like anything I've seen before. It looks like a formal uniform, military most likely. If that's true then he should be an officer, someone of high rank. But I've not seen that outfit in any military, add to the fact that he seems to only speak Japanese. Perhaps he's from the past, frozen in time or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing I know is Azura's sprit leaves the katana, a blue wisp stands in front of me and Shomei. The wisp then takes the form of a man, I know this to be the soul that inhabits my sword. He's not taken this form in ages, not since I recovered the weapon underneath that temple in Japan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShomei looks at the spirt, his eyes widen and he exclaims <span class=\"clred\">\"A-Akuma! Akuma!\"</span> pointing at Azura's location. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzura's sprit then exclaims <b>\"Watashi wa anata o shitte imasu Akatuski Shomei. Anata wa watashi no shisondearimasu.\"<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\nLight then chimes in and says \"Ryan what the hell are they saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mutter \"Azura believes that the guy you summoned is a descendant of him, if so that could help us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decide to ask some questions of this man, to see what he knows.<br>\r\n\"Anata wa kori no burokku de owarundeshita ka?\" maybe he can tell us how he ended up in a big slab of ice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShomei pauses, taking all of our words in. He then says <span class=\"clred\">\"Watashi wa Hokkyoku ni hakoba remashita, Kaizoku wa watashi no fune o haijakku.\"<br>\r\n</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh, so he was hijacked my pirates who took his ship to the artic. That makes sense, now that we are talking to him Shomei seems more focused now. A result of military training perhaps. He stares at Azura's sprit and then starts talking.<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"G\u014dsuto wa, anata ga watashi wa anata ni kanren shite imasu to nobete imasu. Anata wa dono y\u014d ni tsutaeru koto ga dekimasu ka?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzura pauses, I too am curious. How is Shomei related to the sprit in my blade? <br>\r\nThe ghost pauses and then says <b>\"Kage Yurei, Anata wa watashi no ichizoku no chikara o motte imasu. Kanban ga arimasu.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nPowers? Wait what? \"Explain Azura.\" I state. Now that I think on it, I have no real knowledge of what he was before I obtained the blade. Other than the fact that he was supposed to be a demon slayer from the Sengoku era.<br>\r\n<b><br>\r\n\"My lord the Kage Yurei were a line of warriors who had the ability to use secret techniques, they were passed down from Father to son. They granted us the power to transform into ghosts, to allow us to combat the evil sprits that plagued Japan. I had obtained such skill in this power that I was able to transfer my soul into the blade that you wield. This man is related to me as he bears the mark of the clan.\"</b> the soul spoke to us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShomei was listening to us, but it was clear from his reactions that he didn't know as much English as I'd like. Still though it meant he could understand a bit of what we said, the guy then said <span class=\"clred\">\"Watashi wa t\u014dketsu shita mae ni....Watashi wa kimy\u014dna kanji. Watashi wa k\u014dri no samu-sa o kanjiru koto ga dekimasendeshita, osoraku sonogo....Watashi wa anata ga hanasu watashi no chikara ni tappu......Kore wa nan'nendesu ka?\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"2015.\" I say to him, Shomei must have understood that. As suddenly his eyes went wide and he bit his lower lip, kneeling down and pounding a fist on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"Watashi no saigo no shimei wa, j\u016bnenmae ni,\u200b\u200b sukoshi maedeshita.\"</span> he mutters. Decades ago?! How old is this guy?! We need more answers, and everyone will need to know about this.</span></div></div>",

Curious, I watched him quickly move from station to station as if he knew exactly what he was doing. Within moments, he emerged from the lab with what looked like a strange ear piece in his hand. \"This will translate his language into our own through him and our language into his through the device.\" Serious, he declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then held the device up to Shomei and pointed to his ear. Shomei threw him a confused look but accepted the device and placed it into his ear. I guessed it was more out of morbid curiosity but he nearly jumped as Light then stated, \"You should understand us now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you accomplish this?\" Stunned, Shomei asked.

But that's about it, the birds in are chirping. That must be a sign that it's around morning, all the time spent living in forests and the wild has taught me that. My headache has for the most part subsided, which is good. My senses turn to my surroundings, I'm still in my bed. Sometimes I wake up on the floor after trashing about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel a loose arm draped over my bare chest, it must be Lunar. I slowly open my eyes and she is there, she's lightly breathing with her eyes closed. I look down and find that she is actually stark naked, her breasts have actual nipples and a shaved womanhood. She might not be an actual human, but Lunar was created to be the closest thing to one. Her breasts are larger than I actually thought, the dress she usually wore outside of class actually had left stuff to the imagination it seems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing my right arm I move it close to her cotton candy coloured hair and gently twirl a strand of it, Lunar.....she's beautiful. She was built to be with me, to be the perfect girl for me. It's taken this to make me realise that, it was the only good thing to have come from the project that created me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I twirl the hair Lunar's eyes open, her gaze fixes on me and she smiles before saying \"Good morning Light, did you sleep well? After observing Carlson and Jenny I feel that the best way to have a good night's sleep is to be in the presence of someone you care for deeply.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe used a lot of words, but I got the gist of what she was saying. I can't help but look down at her body once again, every inch of it has been perfectly made to please. \"Is there a reason why your naked though?\" I mutter with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I believe the term is intimacy. Does my frame please you Light? I can adjust it to fit any sort of body if given enough materials.\" Lunar says as she proceeds to sit up and give a stretch, which really shows off her naked skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it does Lunar, your...beautiful.\" I mutter as I too sit up and embrace her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robot girl smiles and buries her head in my highly toned chest. \"Thank you Light, I'm learning....about what means to be a human. Love is a part of that......\"</span></div></div>",

No, this is someone from our world and I have a feeling he or she is new.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Otherwise, they wouldn't dare do anything to our Charlie.\" Boasting Viva chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Agreed Vogue. \"We'd tear that jerk apart!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie blushed. \"Is there anything I can do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI paused, thinking. \"Keep an eye on our two guests.

Rose and Carla probably won't say anything useful even if we roughed them up.\" I said leaning on the doorframe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that's what I thought too.\" Chon said in agreement to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then it's settled, Chon you come with me. We'll ask Ms Elvira and Mr Tanaka if we can have a look at those files, they know how grave this situation could become. Light and Lunar I want you guys to keep a close eye out for anything out of the ordinary. Besides Charlie's Sisters acting all nice.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then went on with \"Amy see if you can find anything about magical familiars, anything that might prove useful. Jenny, Viva, Vogue stay with Charlie as much as you can. I don't anyone would attempt an open kidnap attempt on him, considering the risks involved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone gave their agreements and we made our way out the dorm, I walked up to the main school alongside Chon.<br>\r\n\"What do you think of this?\" I mutter to the blind man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's certainly not good, the kid's got a huge target on his back now. But if what's been said is true, that kid could perhaps become something powerful.\" Chon said, I knew he was being honest and upfront about this. I chose not to bring up the fact that Charlie had both of his adopted daughters going out with him, and then I realised something....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie would be able to enhance Viva and Vogue's magic power, in theory at least. Still something that we might need to take into consideration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that we were both silent as we neared the Dean's office, I could hear two voices inside. I knocked politely, and heard one of the voices say for us to enter. Me and Chon did so. Mr Tanaka was talking with Ms Elvira Strange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Tanaka was a man in his late 40's to early 50's, half Japanese and half native American. He was the former head of this school, although he had taken the chance to retire and travel the world with his wife. I've never seen him fight, but it's said he can call upon the might of his ancestors and other stuff like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah we figured you'd arrive today.\" Elvira said, even making a gesture of her tapping her wristwatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon lightly coughed and said \"Then you probably know why we're here then Dean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira nodded to us and then to Mr Tanaka, one of the things that I admired about her was how she got straight to business. And sure enough she said \"So tell us has anything happened to Charlie so far?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have bad news I'm afraid Dean, the information has been leaked somehow. This morning I saw Charlie's Sisters acting nice to him, unusual as they have often treated him with disdain and abuse. Not long after that I got the text message from Mr Tanaka and deleted it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this Elvira let out a sigh, taking a seat and rubbed her forehead. \"This is serious Carlson, Charlie could be used by rouge witches to gain immense power.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, and after going it over with my friends I believe that the best thing to do is see if there's any new students that may seem unusual. Trying to ask the Ren twins would be pointless, and don't want to wait around and shadow Charlie. It may get out of hand quick.\" I said moving forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Tanaka nodded and said \"Sharp as always, just like your Mother. Elvira let us take a look at the records with Ryan and Chon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon then interrupted and said \"I can't read it unless it's in braille.\" I rolled my eyes at that. Everyone could tell you'd need to Chon, aside from being a good fighter you are also good at stating the obvious. But I brush those thoughts out my mind as Elvira goes up to a large filing drawer, bringing out a small book listed \"New arrivals. 2014-2015\"</span></div></div>",

To the outside world, it was a private boarding school with very strict guidelines and outrageous entry fees. Obviously, it was set up that way to ensure normal people did not gain entry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Counting our temporary students, Jenny and Tex Moray, we only have about a hundred new students attending classes this year.\" Frowning at the list, I said. \"We can weed out Tex and Jenny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That narrows it down.\" Grinning slightly, Chon said. He then turned serious. \"We should focus on those who may profit from selling information on students.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That and those who either do not know of Charlie's allies or don't care.\" Serious, Light said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked through the brief profiles and came across three possible suspects. \"The only three that stand out are Dex Bedlam, Francis Young, and Thomas Morgana.\" I frowned deeply, looking at the names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know these blokes?\" Curious, Chon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Francis Young was once known as Phobos, the living machine.\" Darkly, I said. \"He was a young mad scientist who foolishly fashioned his laboratory into a robot and then placed himself into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The robot took over, trapping its former master inside of it.\" Shaking his head, Tanaka said. \"It took the power of Christaun to take him down, separating the boy from the machine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chistaun?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanaka frowned. \"Sorry, that information is classified.\" Serious, he said. \"Needless to say, the boy came out completely insane. It was thought that this school would straighten him out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed then turned to the other names. \"Thomas Morgana is the only son of Eva Morgana, a known rogue witch who has caused a lot of damage in the past.\" Shaking my head, I said. \"He is a complete jerk but has been a useful informant against the rogue element.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps he's decided to work both sides of the street.\" Adjusting his blindfold, Chon said. \"It's not the first time an informant fell onto old habits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's possible.\" Sighing, I said. \"However, this third suspect has me curious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon looked over your shoulder. \"How so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dex Bedlam has absolutely no talent in magic or mad science.\" Frowning, I replied. \"He is a child genius and the son of the technology tycoon, Don Bedlam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The kid <i>bought</i> his way into the school.\" Frowning, Elvira said. \"We could not turn him away as he met all the requirements we set up for the outside world. The only reason we did not try to detour him was that his family is aware of both magic and mad science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then he knows the consequences of exposing us to the outside world.\" Darkly, I said. \"The question is, does this git even care. According to his file, he has a reputation of stirring up trouble with his servants cleaning up after him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any one of these characters could be our mole.\" Sighing, Light said. \"What's your plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We split up.\" After a pause, I said. \"John, you keep an eye on Francis Young. The kid had been through hell so you can relate.\" I frowned. \"If he is our mole...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight nodded. \"I'll pound in the fact he made a big mistake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chon, I need you to drill Thomas for answers.\" Serious, I said. \"Even if he is not our mole, he may have heard something useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon nodded. \"If he knows anything, I'll get him to spill it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will go talk with this Dex Bedlam.\" Sighing, I said. \"Hopefully, he's smart enough to cooperate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be on your guard when you speak with him, Ryan.\" Serious, Tanaka warned. \"He father specialized in technology used to fight magic and mad science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"Of course...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was going to be a long day for everyone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I made it a matter of principle to know the family members of all the major rouges, it made them easier to fight. Why target the witch when I can break their allies and have them alone? Something told me that Thomas knew who I was as well, most likely a spook story told by his Mother to keep him in line. Don't really care to be honest, but he might know something. So I need to have a little word with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll handle him, that Thomas guy.\" I muttered, Ryan nodded to me. You might think I don't see that, but I can tell from the chi signature he gives off. With that I leave the room, if I know the type of Thomas like I think I do. He'll be in the nearby forest, no doubt with other troublemakers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it's with purpose that I'm walking out the building, to the dorms. Past them and into the forest, and sure enough I start to pick up the notes of some music. It's Iron Maiden, I'm a bit of a fan of any rock music. My gut reaction tells me that's where Thomas is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sure enough once I'm down the path he's there with a bunch of students, there is boys and girls. But I'm not here to party, I'm here to get information. Thomas has clocked me, that red chi of his makes me pissed to be honest. I'm walking up to him, moving past other \"Partygoers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas is smoking, I walk up to him with my arms folded. He gives a smug grin and says \"Hey blind guy, you lost or something?\" laughing with the two girls next to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not going to take that lying down, I swiftly move my right hand and grab the cigarette out of his mouth and fling it away. The music has stopped, and I can feel that everyone's gaze is on me. \"You got a good reason for interrupting my fun time you prick?\" Thomas says to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snarl, and let some of my chi energy flow around my hands. I then say \"I got questions, you answer. If I like what you say then I'll leave you be, tell your people to stand down. Cause I don't mind busting heads.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas paused and then made a gesture with his fingers, rubbing them together. \"Well....how's about giving me some incentive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know what he's wanting, but I'm not gonna budge. \"Are you suggesting that I break your fingers?\" I mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThomas pauses, and then says.......</span></div></div>",

With that I rose out my chair and turned to Elvira and said \"I need things like his timetable, where he stays, anything you can give me on him I need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira nodded and said \"Way ahead of you, I've been told he often sits at the main building's rooftop at night. Perhaps you should meet him then.\" as she produced his timetable and picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded back to her and Mr Tanaka said to me \"Again Ryan have caution, Dex has no magic or science ability. However it's because of that his Father was often underestimated, and many rouge witches and scientists alike were defeated by him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave another nod, I didn't have any science or magic ability myself. It was my enhanced body and living weapon that got me by, and not to mention with the company I kept I knew quite a lot about both fields.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that my group and I said our goodbyes to Elvira and Mr Tanaka, and Light and Chon went different ways from me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on I had dinner with my friends, and told the group of what I was doing.<br>\r\n\"Your going to meet him on the roof alone?!\" Jenny said to me in an incredulous tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a small roof Jenny, if anyone else was to come with me it'd hamper my chances of being unseen.\" I said to her, she sighed. As she knew I had a good point, but was still worried. I don't blame her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look it'll be alright, you know me Jenny. I can handle this chump no problem.\" I said, putting a hand to cup her cheek. My girlfriend nodded and then gave me a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that I left the dorm, night had fallen and if Elvira's intel was right then Dex should be on the roof in about half an hour. Should be enough time for me to find a good hiding spot, it feels silent and creepy. I clench my katana in my hand, Azura glows in response to me. It helps me feel reassured, not that I needed it but there you go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip to the rooftop is quiet, and uneventful thankfully. Soon I make it to the roof.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/350/a/0/yes_or_no____by_anime_quotes-d6y6kmw.png\" target=\"_blank\">http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2013/3...</a> (Just at night.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look around, and spot a great blindside near the entrance, a small pillar. Which is tall enough to cover my body, I instantly take the chance to do. Using my training to silently bleed into the shadows, my breathing hidden under the cold wind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot long after that I hear footsteps, someone is coming and I know who it is. Dex steps out, a pair of custom made swords held in his school uniform jacket tied around his waist. He silently looks up at the moon, a smirk on his lips before....</span></div></div>",

You would be easily able to hack the school's databases, looking for something. Anything worth selling, and you found that Charlie was a human familiar. A walking beacon of magic power, something that's never been seen in ages. You sold it to his Sisters.\" I said in a accusing tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDex frowned, but his smile returned \"Oh your good, shit your like Sherlock. What else are you going to come up with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do it?\" I asked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this Dex instantly started laughing at me, a crazy look in his eyes as he ran a hand through his blood red hair. \"Simple....I just felt like it, and now your here Carlson....\" he muttered, he then took a few steps back. His hands on his swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant I drew my blade and settled into my stance, Dex drew both his swords and pointed them at me. \"I'm making a name for myself! Charlie was just the start, and now I'm going to kill you Carlson. And then I'll be the new big man here!\" he then started laughing. This guy was nuts, the hair on the back of my neck stood on end.

But I can sense power from him!\" the voice of my katana said in my mind. I do not respond, now is the time for action not words. And Dex seems to know that, for he's already on the attack. In a near second he moves towards me, swords ready to slash down in an X at my chest. I quickly backstep out the way, his blades cutting nothing but air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will be at a disadvantage in this battle, as I cannot kill this guy. If I were to do so it would complicate matters further, Dex however has seemingly no hesitation on his part. He intends to kill me, but I will not grant him the chance. He has no idea of what he is dealing with, I only need one chance to win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly thrust my blade forward with a stab, only for Dex to harmlessly and rather gracefully tilt his body to the side. I click my tongue in my mouth as he brings his left sword towards my neck, I duck under the swing however and thrust the butt of my hilt into his gut. He winces and staggers a little, I use the chance to get some distance by jumping to the right hand side and then back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDex merely grins at me however, it's like he enjoys this. I don't want to think about it though, all I know is a whackjob is trying to kill me on the rooftop of my own school. And I won't allow that to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI focus my willpower into my katana, Azura's blade glows a light blue in response to this. I then move the blade around in the air, the blue aura trailing behind the sword. Just to let my opponent know he is dealing with someone with a better blade. \"Against anyone else you would be a lethal threat, but to me you will merely be a good workout.\" I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDex kept his grin on \"Ah that's a nice sword, I'll enjoy cutting your arm off with it still holding onto it.\" he said. Licking his lips after it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he said that I began to attack, using my swords blue aura as a projectile. The blade shaped energy wave zoomed towards Dex, who again tilted his body to avoid the attack. But I was on him as I went to swing my katana to his abdomen, but he responded by locking both swords against my own one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Struggle with all your might, that will make the kill so much better....\" Dex muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI said nothing, keeping my focus on the swords in front of me. Only for Dex to suddenly bring his leg up, kicking me below the belt. I could swear my nuts just pushed up into my body, my face contorts into a wince and I'm forced downwards. But not before driving my fist into Dex's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy grunts out, moving back and away from me. I take the chance to roll away from him, trying my best to block the numbing pain of my balls. Although my face certainly shows it, and Dex smiles gleefully at me. Oh that fucker, if I didn't need him alive I swear he'd be in for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Needing to fight dirty? Pussy.\" I state, if he wants to play mind game I ought to return the favour. If only just to give him one spiteful little comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDex just keeps smiling though, and proceeds forward while dragging his swords along the ground. I sheath my blade and get myself ready, Dex brings his blades up for a large jumping uppercut intended to slice me up. Only I have teleported out the way, using my willpower combined with Azura's abilities. In a second I'm behind him, and he knows it as soon as he lands on the ground. In an instant he turns to face me, but I draw my blade and dash forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow we stand back to back, and I sheathe my blade once more. A thin blue line travels past Dex, and blood gushed out from his side. Followed by a yelp of pain, I turned to see Dex on his knees. One of his swords dropped as his hand moved over his wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-You bastard, my Father will hear about this!\" he spits out as he turns to face me, his face no longer has it's grin. I say nothing, I merely bash him on the head with the butt of my sword. There's a \"Dink!\" noise and Dex flops over out for the count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then proceed to patch his wound up, using a piece of my shirt as a bandage. I then slung him over my shoulder and left the rooftop, making sure to bang his head on the wall. \"Prick....\" I mutter.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryan's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day I'm now in front of the Dean's desk, sitting in a chair. I left Dex in the hands of the night prefects, saying I had been attacked and claimed self defence. Detailing a report with the Dean Elvira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he drew a pair of swords and attacked you?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod, and then lean back in my chair with a smile. \"I take it he's indisposed now?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira nods with a smile \"Yes his Father was irate on what he's done, I think that Dex Bedlam will be in for some family bonding now. He may have money, but this won't save him. Starmage handles things differently than most, for all of our students are different in one manner or another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then lean in and say \"I think that's something that should be saved for the filers Dean Elvira, there's another pressing matter to attend to.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira sensed that I was now getting down to business, and got serious as well. \"Yes Charlie, it has been leaked out that he is a magic familiar. Hence why his Sisters have been acting nicely to him, as opposed to how they usually are.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI respond with \"Dex had hacked into our school's database, getting the information. He then must have sold it to Charlie's Sisters, but there's also the concern that it may have leaked beyond them. If that's the case then rogue or not, virtually every witch is going to want him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes that thought has crossed my mind, Charlie's raw magic would be enough to overpower any witch. Rouges would no doubt use him as a pawn in their efforts to take over the world, but I have an idea if you'll hear me out Carlson.\" Elvira says as she opens a drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm all ears.\" I reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira hands me a document holder and says \"Tell me does Charlie have any girls who have an interest in him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this I smile and say \"Chon's daughters Viva and Vogue, the pair of them swoon over the guy. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira gives a sigh of relief and says \"There is a way to protect Charlie, it's called a bonding ceremony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lift an eyebrow and say \"Do go on Dean Elvira.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The bonding ceremony binds a boy and girl together, it acts as a form of protection. It acts as a warning that the pair are destined to be with each other, and attempting to break that will break the full anger of their family. In which case you and your friends would be that.\" Elvira says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open the document holder and glance through the contents, I keep my eyebrow lifted. \"You said boy and girl, I assume he will be bound to both of them yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I know that both Viva and Vogue were the daughters of the rouge witch Eva. This can protect them just as much as Charlie, we must ensure this happens successfully Carlson. Failure will mean this will cover all of your permanent record young man. Every precaution will be taken, no doubt all hell can and may break loose. But what matters is that Charlie gets the ceremony done with the V twins. This will happen in the next couple of days, Carlson please go and tell your friends.\" Elvira says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a deep breath, taking in what she said to me. I then stand up and say \"You got it Dean, will we see you at the ceremony then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that Elvira laughs and says to me \"I'll be reading the vows, you didn't think I'd let the chance to be a part of something like this slip by? Charlie is a very rare beacon of magic power, rest assured by the time this week is done history will be made. I'll inform you of the location later tonight.\" with that I nod and leave.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryan's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the day went by okay, rather quiet. Although something told me that this was gonna be the last one I'd have in a good long while, I had been reading the documents that Elvira gave to me. It detailed things like where the chapel was, in a town not too far from Starmage that we called Wandill. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt also had stores where we were to get everything for it, confetti, suits, even limos to hire. And Elvira has also noted that this will be all paid for, I don't know how but that's good. I'm just 17, I ain't got much cash. Something tells me that she wants to make this an epic occasion, but I can't help but disagree with that. Something this grand is gonna attract a lot of eyes, but maybe it's all gonna be saved for after everything is said and done. I'm all for some fun, but wait till everything gets settled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now after the day's done I have assembled my crew in our dining room, taking our usual seats.<br>\r\n\"So before we begin I'd just like to say, the mole has been dealt with. And he won't be any problem anymore.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww, really?\" Viva said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad, we'd have loved to have had a nice chat about what we'd do to those who attack our Charlie.\" Vogue said folding her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile and look at Chon, who in turn lifts an eyebrow above his blindfold. I don't know how he's going to take this, but head witch's orders are clear. \"Actually I was chatting with the Dean, and she's come up with an interesting idea. It's a bonding ceremony.\" I say to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy entire group shares various looks of curiosity, and I take this as the chance to go on with \"A bonding ceremony would allow Charlie to be protected, and at the same time serve as a warning for witches to back off or face our wrath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone perks up at hearing that, of course it would. But now I'm going to deliver the punchline here.<br>\r\n\"The witches bonded to Charlie would be Viva and Vogue.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then instantly I'm cut off by Chon yelling \"WHAT?!\" while standing up. The V girls meanwhile are looking at each other and having ear to ear grins, yeah this was about the reaction I had believed would occur. And Chon's shooting daggers at me behind his blindfold, I can tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simmer down Chon.\" I say, leaning forth and putting my hands on my chin. He's silent but relents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then go through the process of the ceremony, and how it would help protect Charlie. I made sure to say that A. Elvira herself had ordered this, and that B. As Charlie could grant his magic to both of his daughters they would be immensely powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon lightly bites his lower lip, I'm making a very persuasive argument. But Viva and Vogue tug at his shirt. \"Come on please...\" Viva says to him, doing her best puppy dog eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVogue is doing the same thing \"We want this, nothing bad can come of this. Right?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blind man sighs and says \"Fine then.\" with both the V girls jumping with glee in the air. They then proceed to leap at Charlie and glomp him with a hug from both the back and front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy girls, there will be plenty of time for celebrations later.\" Jenny said as she goes over to break it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile and say \"Yeah, we're getting clothes for it. Food, limos, a chapel. All being paid for and taken care of, we just need to pick out the stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight meanwhile was sitting there, he didn't really understand what was going on so I leaned in and said \"Your role is to make sure no gets to Charlie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former test subject certainly understands that, he nods and says \"No one with evil intentions will get to him in one piece.\" Lunar nods alongside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy has been quiet the whole time, although I mutter to her \"You enjoy Chon giving into his daughters don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goth girl snickers at me, folding her arms and replying with \"He's so bumbling.\" on that we can agree on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh and then stand up, taking Jenny into my arms. \"Are we going to have this thing?\" Jenny mutters to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrug and say \"I'd prefer a straight up wedding, but you never know.\" kissing her on the forehead.</span></div></div>",

Our plan is to visit this tailor shop and get a suit for Charlie, or at least that's the plan. I'm hoping that no one will notice Charlie and realise he's a magic familiar, I try to block out the thoughts of him being kidnapped. The kid's had enough shit happen to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ride is a mostly silent affair, Charlie is watching the windows and seeing everything zoom past us. Jenny is silent too, as she and I look around to make sure no one's looking at the kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe then get off the bus in a town called Wandill, it's a quaint little village place. I've only been a couple of times to this town, too busy with either school work or other things. But a lot of students like to spend time here, but I'm not here to kickback and relax. No I'm here to get things for a bonding ceremony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay close to us kiddo.\" I mutter to Charlie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid nods and grabs Jenny's hand, who smiles and grabs my own. I share the smile and nod to both of them, thankfully luck is on our side. As the tailor's just down the street from the bus stop. and we quickly make our way over there. On the shop window there's various suits, a white morning suit, one with a red tie, hell even a rainbow suit. Charlie eyeballs it and say \"No...just no...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rolls his eyes and we enter, a bell above the door ringing. We are then greeted by a woman in her 60's, with greying black hair and a purple apron on. She's wearing a pair of glasses and her hair is neatly placed in a bun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello young people, what do you require today?\" she said with a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh we need a suit made for the kid here.\" I say motioning at Charlie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman adjusts her glasses and looked down at the kid, smiling before saying \"Ah you must be the child the head witch was talking about, come let's get your suit made. It's on the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Charlie let's go.\" Jenny said as she gently leads the kid to a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Right.\" the kid says to her. The shop owner is telling him to raise his arms up and have them measured, I'm blocking it out. I look around and see things like other suits and dresses, boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I see a pair of people, and they look familiar. I squint my eyes, and then I see it's those two people from the other world. Tex and Jessica, and they look like they're shopping here. Tex is picking out a suit and Jessica a dress, did they? Better find out....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk up behind them, each step I take is quiet and subdued on the floor. Before I'm behind them and then cough to get their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ!\" Tex says, taken aback by my sudden appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Jessica says equally surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smirk, all that training in Asia paid off. The looks on their faces are priceless. But then I go down to business by saying \"So what you doing here?\" in a casual tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting clothes for a ceremony.\" Jessica says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that I frown, it seemed like they knew didn't they? I needed to know more, but I figured I might as well be honest with them. \"Your not invited to Charlie's bonding ceremony.\" I say to them while folding my arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex smiles upon hearing that, okay not what I expected. But then he says \"We're not going to that anyway, we're attending another ceremony here in town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica then chimes in with \"It's an anniversary celebrating the rift's opening. Your former headmaster Mr Tanaka is going to be knighted by our Grandfather, as he was vital in keeping the peace following the end of the magic and science war. Your to attend as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that I frown even more. \"Why me?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In case you haven't noticed you have performed several deeds of note, such as saving the former test subject known as Light Killer. Not to mention your the school's best prefect.\" Tex says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not smiling, how the fuck did they know about Light? Aside from Tanaka and my friends nobody knew who he really way, unless Mr Tanaka told them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When is this?\" I ask, something tells me I won't like the answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noon on the dot in 3 days why?\" Jessica tells me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah I really didn't like that answer, and now I feel a headache coming on. That's a sign of something bad coming.<br>\r\n\"Charlie's bonding ceremony is at 4PM in 3 days, your serious about bringing me along for this?\" I mutter, looking to see Charlie still getting his suit made with Jenny and the shop owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, your going to be Knighted as well alongside Mr Tanaka. To not show up would result in your school losing face, I think your former headmaster would agree that you need to attend.\" Tex says to me with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck, fuck fuck fuck. I didn't like this at all. I needed to be in two places. I needed to do something.<br>\r\n\"I'll go, but on one condition.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair are silent and I say \"As soon as the knighting thing is done I'm gone, and I want transport picked out for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex nods to me and replies with \"Sounds reasonable, we'll make sure to arrange it for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI give a nod back, and Jenny says to me \"Ryan come on, we might as well get a suit done for you as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure coming.\" I say as I walk back to Charlie and Jenny, I'm gonna need to discuss this with my dormmates and come up with a plan.</span></div></div>",

I spent the entire day just doing schoolwork, and there was a lot of it. One of the things that me and my friend end up doing is missing out on a good deal of work, and then we have to cram it all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie hadn't gotten much of an education, and the tailor was surprised at how stick thin the kid was. But it made sense considering how his Mother had raised him, that is to say not well at all. But the kid was taking to his subjects with vigour, top of his class already in maths and English. I was teaching him Japanese when we had time off, Chon meanwhile was teaching the V girls Mandarin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third day had arrived, it was time for Charlie's bonding ceremony. Everything had been planned out, I was to go with Mr Tanaka alone to get knighted by people from another world. Once that was done I'd be arriving quickly to make sure Charlie was safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe and my crew were outside the dorm, I could see Chon practically herding his daughters into a limo. The pair were wearing identical wedding dresses, I can only imagine when Chon went to go get those dressed with them. They show them to him, only for him to lightly cough and point at his blindfold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile I'm dressed in formal attire, I had this custom made. Elvira said all expenses were being paid for, so I figured I might as well use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.fightersgeneration.com/np2/char1/xtra/bb-jin-kisaragi.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.fightersgeneration.com/np2/ch...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to go Carlson?\" my former Dean Tanaka said to me. He was dressed in clothes befitting that of a native American, with a feathered headdress that reached down to the floor. At his sides were a pair of tomahawks which he wielded in battle. A proud look on the face of the old man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, let me just say goodbye to Jenny first.\" I say, before Jenny gets into the limo with Amy and Lunar she wraps her arms around me for a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you soon, don't be long.\" my love mutters to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Promise.\" I respond, kissing her on the forehead before leaving. Elvira's driving the car, I nod to Chon who gets in the other limo with Light and Charlie. The kid doesn't say anything to me, no doubt knowing I'll be there soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go.\" I say to Mr Tanaka. He nods and we get in a red sports car, driving off past the limos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So sir you never told me about the rift.\" I say over the roar of the engine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There wasn't much point at the time Carlson, peace has been around for over decades. Least till fate came about.\" the native American says to me as he turns the car around a series of narrow streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod and stay quiet for the rest of the drive, and sure enough we arrive at a tall building. And there are already people outside heading into the ceremony. Me and Mr Tanaka get out after he parks it on the driveway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point I then noticed a guy who looked familiar, yeah I knew him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey John!\" I say walking up towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn Harrison is one of the most notable figures of our supernatural world, he's from the Harrison family known for their witches. With him is Megan, his girlfriend. I learned more about the witch world from John, as back in my old high school he was my penpal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan! How are things? We heard about a bonding ceremony for a human familiar.\" John said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frown slightly but nod \"Yeah Charlie, he's getting bound to two witch girls. Viva and Vogue Kay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan smiles and says \"Listen we'd all be up for chatting but we should head inside, we know your busy Carlson.\" on that point I can agree.

Tanaka gripped my shoulder and bowed back with me quickly following before entering the building. The inside looked much like a medieval castle with a modern twist. The entry way was huge with banners of various family seals being proudly displayed from the ceiling. One that caught my eye was a skull with crossed swords and a moray eel slithering out through the skull's mouth. It was indeed a dark image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the crest of the Moray family.\" Sighing, Tanaka said. \"Don't let the image deceive you; their motto is, 'Through death is rebirth'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the main hall further in, I saw a number of seats facing a single huge throne carved out of a single piece of pure crystal. I took note of several guards, dressed and armed in a similar manner to the sentry outside. John, taking notice of this as well sighed. \"They are there to protect the king of their secret world, the head mad scientist.\" Whispering carefully, he said. \"The head witch, Elvira Strange has similar heavy protection. Hers is merely more discrete.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are not accustomed to their ways, Ryan so you need to keep two things in mind.\" Darkly, Tanaka whispered. \"One, do not speak unless directly spoken to once the ceremony begins. Two, mad scientists make swift, wild motions. Do not take them as aggressive actions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded but did not respond as we were instructed to stand in front of the throne. A male guard gave us a few brief instructions. \"Stand at attention and keep your eyes on those of the head mad scientist when he appears.\" Firmly but kindly, he said. \"He demands full attention of everyone in his presence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTanaka and I nodded and the guard left just as Devlin Moray appeared, walking in from a slight distortion in the air. He was dressed in what appeared to be a suit of armor straight out of a science fiction fantasy movie. \"To all those who are witness to this ceremony, these two have committed acts of epic courage and valor worthy of song and legend!\" Strongly, he announced. \"Tanaka, brought lasting peace to our worlds with patience and persistence worthy of any mad scientist! Ryan Carlson freed the lost soul from our world and breathed new life into him before he could be broken!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCheers rose from the crowds as Devlin Moray then turned to me. \"In our belief, every drop of blood is a piece of our soul.\" Serious, he explained. \"A vial of blood was stolen from my son and taken to your world where our forces are not permitted to travel to maintain the peace. It was used to create who you know as John Doe, the Light Killer. This was reported but we believe the message was intercepted.\" He sighed. \" We will talk of this in length in due time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the ceremony began with Devlin Moray knighting Tanaka and myself. As the Native American warned, Devlin used wild, swift motions when performing the task but we were only lightly tapped on the shoulder. He then presented us each with a ring with the Moray family seal embedded on the crown. They were each hung from a gold necklace. \"With this ring, you are under the protection of the royal family.\" Serious, Devlin said. \"Live in peace and prosper.\" He then motioned us to face the crowd as he announced, \"I present to you, Sir Tanaka and Sir Ryan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered as Tanaka and I bowed to the witnesses of the ceremony. Just as we rose, I jumped finding myself inside the back of a moving limousine. I turned to find Tanaka smiling at me. \"Well, they did promise you swift transport to the other ceremony.\" Grinning, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bloody hell!\" Startled, Charlie yelled. \"Where did you two come from!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch your language!\" Scolding Tanaka and I said in unison.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryan's POV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing teleported was an odd feeling, it felt like you were going somewhere but didn't know. Granted I did know where I was going, but....ah it's an odd feeling to describe. Better not dwell on it, after all I have pressing issues to attend to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are the V girls in the church then?\" I say, I need to know about the current situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah they arrived in there 5 minutes ago, we took another route to avoid too much heat on everyone.\" Chon said, that's a relief. Now all we need to do is get Charlie in there, get him bound to Viva and Vogue and hey presto! Problem solved for the time being. Although something tells me it won't be for long, but then I'm just being pessimistic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie seems a bit nervous about everything, I can understand that. He's pretty much being shotgun wedded, granted it's with girls he really likes. But still, add to that he still doesn't actually know how to harness his power yet. Looking back this sort of thing may have occurred with John and Megan, I didn't bother to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glance to Light, and he looks really not at home. He's never worn a suit before, when I first met him in that forest he wore nothing but a pair of white trousers from his test lab. Even then when he wore the school uniform he was always shirtless as much as he could be, something told me he just wasn't used to the stuff. I then look at his white shirt, and see his black tattoos glowing slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon meanwhile just looks like he just wants to get this over with, I can tell he's still not too chuffed with what his adopted kids are doing. But they asked for it, and besides I can just tell him how powerful they'd become thanks to Charlie buffing them with magic power. Then he'll change his tune no doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're here.\" said the driver in front of us, I didn't get a look at the guy. But right now we needed to get in that church.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as soon as we step out....what a scene. There's various girls, aged 12 to 16. Who are all wearing wedding dresses, and upon seeing Charlie nervously exit the limo they are all screaming at the top of their lungs. I groan, should have known it'd been linked. I ever see that Dex Bedlam git again I'm gonna chop his nuts off and stick them on a frying pan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THERE HE IS!!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY MAGIC BOY!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH SO CUTE!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were shouting various other things to him, flirting comments and the like. I shook my head and walked in front, thankfully the prefects were keeping them away from the line. I eyeballed a few of the rouge witch hunters, from what I remembered they were the elite of the elites. Elvira was coming through, I honestly felt like things might be okay if we have experience security forces like them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon and Light are walking on Charlie's sides, the kid keeps his eyes front and centre. Meanwhile the girls are throwing things like roses, gift wrapped boxes, kiss stained tissues and the likes. Chon and Light swat away any hands that manage to slip through the guards, they were given orders not to go any further than that. Even though Light would have no qualms about breaking them, but we need to stay focused. Mr Tanaka is behind us, I'm feeling glad that he's here. Even though by all rights he's retired and could be on a boat with his wife sailing the world, he's still pitching in when we need it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI manage to make my way to the front of the church, with my fellows. I turn to look at Charlie and say \"Ready kiddo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie manages a nod \"Y-Yeah, I'll be glad to just be with Viva and Vogue.\" he says to me. He's smiling after it, that's good. I can tell that he really wants this, those girls will treat him right I'm sure. And with that I proceed to open the door to let us all in.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryan's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors to the church open with a loud and heavy creaking noise, it's all I try to focus on as I block the noises of the female mob outside. No use in paying attention to them now, after all the prefects and the rouge witch hunters can handle them. I make a mental note to thank Elvira later, having elite law enforcement like them around certainly makes me feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so we walk forth into the church, and I'm amazed at the sight of the interior.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.stpaulschurchog.com/files/wedding_08.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.stpaulschurchog.com/files/wed...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere has been no expense spared, even though it's just a minor ceremony from what I'm told. But of course Charlie is a rare thing, and so something like that demands protocol. Which reminds me, I quickly turn around and adjust the kid's tie. It looks a bit ajar, Charlie just looks at me with a funny look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that's done I see Jenny to my right, and instantly embrace her. She licks my left ear and mutters \"What kept you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scientists and their stuff, nothing to worry about now though. It's done, let's get this done.\" I mutter in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then take a look at the V girls, the pair are wearing identical dresses. Pearl white with \"Beloved.\" written in Mandarin at the hip of their dresses, no doubt something that Chon put in. Speaking of which he's gone over to them, kneeling down and checking their outfits. He's griping about how they haven't got it right or something like that, I shake my head and take a seat in one of the front rows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny moves to me, and takes a seat to my left. Amy is sitting behind me, with Light and Lunar. Chon is at the other front row, with Mr Tanaka. Elvira arrives in a room to the left, dressed in an elegant black dress and a book held in her hands. I assume that's the vows she's going to say to Charlie and the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got here safe then Carlson?\" she asks me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile and nod \"No trouble at all Dean, what about the girls?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira sighs and said \"You no doubt saw the mob of girls outside trying to seek Charlie's affection yes?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod and the Dean goes on with \"As we brought Viva and Vogue into the church there was a large group of boys doing the same thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that was odd, I can understand Charlie considering it has been leaked out that he's now a walking beacon of pure magical power. But why the girls? The only thing they had was that they had been daughters to a rouge witch called Eva, but they disowned their Mother after Chon adopted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Tanaka then sheds light on this for us by saying \"Viva and Vogue's biological mother is rich, from her years of criminal activity. As she is in witch prison for life due to several charges, that wealth is automatically passed on to her daughters. Whoever marries them will gain that vast wealth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this Chon gives a heavy sigh and replies by saying \"Another piece of information that bastard, Dex hacked and sold?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I'm afraid, our school really needs to improve it's security. I hope you haven't become lax in this Elvira?\" Tanaka says with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that Elvria grins and says \"Technology these days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as we are about to begin though, Chon suddenly raises his head and says \"Someone's coming!\" and no sooner does he say that do two people I hoped wouldn't be here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Charlie!!\" the voice is that of Rose Ren, one of Charlie's older twin Sisters. I groan aloud and drop my head into my waiting hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose and Carla have somehow entered the church, I forgot all about them. To be honest I was hoping they'd have no idea this was even happening. They're wearing dresses for the occasion and look really happy, funny considering up till now they've treated the poor kid like shit. Only after hearing about what he really is do they finally act nice to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piss off.\" Light bluntly stated, glaring daggers at the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that Carla pouts and says \"Come on we need to be here, Charlie is still family. Therefore we're required to be here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah he's still our Brother! And also we're all people from Starmage are we not?\" Rose chimes in, they're faking it. A beast doesn't change it's ways just because it doesn't bear it's fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Tanaka looks at Elvira silently, who gives a nod. The native American man sighs and says \"You may attend this ceremony, but any trouble on your part will cost you dearly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose and Carla simply nod and sit at the far right row, way at the very back. With that Charlie is already at the altar with the V girls, as some music that I picked out begins to play.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNGNcsKgwY\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVNGNcsK...</a></span></div></div>",

Tanaka merely shook his head and fingered something in his vest pocket. I threw him a curious glance to which he gave me a knowledgeable grin. Just like old times, he always had something ready for any occasion. I nodded then turned back to face the front as Elvira continued. \"Do you, Viva and Vogue Kay, take Charlie Ren to be your boyfriend, to honor and defend, to love and to hold to cherish for as long as you do not break up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva and Vogue giggled then replied, \"We do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira nodded, holding back a giggle of her own before turning to Charlie. \"Do you, Charlie Ren, take Viva and Vogue Kay to be your girlfriends, to honor and defend, to love and to hold to cherish for as long as you do not break up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie blushed deeply. I could not blame the kid. He was promising to be the boyfriend for two girls; it was going to be an interesting relationship to say the least. I was proud of him when he smiled and clearly replied, \"I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira smiled. \"Then by the power vested in my by the witch council, I pronounce thee boyfriend and girlfriends. You may now kiss.\" She giggled, seeing both Charlie and the V twins blush. \"Don't be shy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva and Vogue walked up to either side of Charlie and moved to kiss him on either cheek when Rose and Carla suddenly jumped to their feet, their faces showing a complete change in mood. Instead of happiness, they showed some form of desperation as they both charged the alter. I moaned aloud, knowing they would try something to ruin the ceremony. Only, as I began to rise, Tanaka pulled out two vials of a familiar looking liquid from his vest pocket. they were the same vials Nathan Moray used on his children!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rose to his feet with the vials ready just as Rose and Carla...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That's a rare sight, but it's not one to be viewed as pretty. Hell Light covered in blood is nicer looking, and speaking of which....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former test subject has stood up, and so has Chon. Rose and Carla have stood up and are going up to the doors. They're yelling about how Charlie is their Brother and they don't want him married to the daughters of a dangerous rouge witch, hypocritical coming from them I may add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as it looks like Chon and Light are about to weigh in on the girls and start Mr Tanaka stands up, and he's become a big presence. Something tells me that his ancestors aren't taking this lightly, more so as a church is holy ground. And suddenly he walks forth down the aisle, up to Rose and Carla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I WARNED YOU!!!\" he yells out, nearly spitting his words out. Suddenly I see him produce two vials out from his vest, and tosses it at both of Charlie's Sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey don't seem worried, at least till it hits them. For then all of a sudden a large black cloud engulfs them, and now I'm worried. I stand up, sword at the ready. Only I see Rose fall out of the cloud, with her upper body. And what I see next is enough to make me lower my blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck is this?!!\" Rose yelled out as she saw that her lower body had somehow been altered, now it looked long and green like that of a snake. Carla wasn't doing much better, she had a skunk tail as she ran out the cloud in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all of a sudden Charlie fell to his knees, and clutched his head with both hands. I noticed a light blue aura around him, eyes closed in concentration. And right after that he moved his hands to Viva and Vogue, who in turn had the same aura. But then it grew even more intense, their eyes turned yellow. They were even now floating just above the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon moves forth to make sure they're okay, only to be stopped by Elvira. \"EVERYONE GET TO THE SIDES!!!!\" Charlie yelled out. We wasted no time, as Viva and Vogue suddenly shot their hands forth. And projected a large force of magic energy, it flew right down the middle. And plowed straight into Rose and Carla, the two had no idea of how to really move their lower halves. And thus weren't as nimble as our blind marital artist and robot girl, who speaking of which had just opened the church doors. Rose and Carla flew right into the street, making loud noises all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunar and Chon then swiftly close the doors with a mighty creak, and the blind man leans on them looking down. <br>\r\n\"Are you okay Chon?\" Lunar says going over to inspect him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon's smiling, it's an evil grin. \"That felt good!\" he shouted out at the top of his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were wanting to do that for a long time weren't you?\" I find myself saying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only the Mother was there as well.\" Chon mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe V girls have stopped the whole \"Aura of power\" thing now. Charlie is holding his forehead and groaning slightly, and Viva and Vogue are wasting no time in fussing over him. \"I'm f-fine, just didn't expect that. There was just so much magic energy about I...tapped into it I guess, need to learn how to do that properly.\" he says to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis new girlfriends smile and hold him by the hands, confetti falls from the roof. Ave Maria begins to play now.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dok4wJ4pqo0\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dok4wJ4p...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone is clapping at newly bonded couple, er trio I mean. With that Charlie and the V girls are already leaving, eager to go and get dinner with all of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way sir, what was that you tossed at the Ren twins?\" I mutter to Mr Tanaka.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe native American laughs and says \"Do you recall when you gained cat ears?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frown and then nod, Mr Tanaka laughs and says \"The head of the mad science community gave me them, he slipped them into my vest when no one was looking. Just in case.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile, it seems they are prepared for everything. Like me. \"Should we go check on Rose and Carla?\" Jenny asks me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shake my head \"Fuck that, I want sushi.\" I reply with a mutter as all of us go to the cars waiting outside.</span></div></div>",

Ryan, Viva, Vogue. I owe so much to them, I've been given a happier home. My Mother....no I don't consider her my Mother anymore, the same with my Sisters. They are just people I didn't really know when I grew up, they were never there when I needed them. They never cared for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at this now it feels like a sort of karmic justice, I have a power that they would love to have had. I have sheer raw magic power within me, that I can transfer to witches and give them immense power. I'm told that it's rare, super rare even. And that bad people would want my power, like Rose and Carla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've woken up, holiday's over. I'm bonded now with Chon's daughters, and it's a beautiful day. I don't know how good a boyfriend I'll be to them, but I'll give it my best shot. They will too, with that I start to get changed. Before coming to starmage I was stick thin, let's just say eating was whatever I could get my hands on before meeting Ryan. Now though I'm eating healthily, and it's showing. I feel as great as I've ever felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get my uniform on, comb my hair and head into the kitchen. And instantly Viva and Vogue sit with me in between. And link arms with me, pecking me on both cheeks at the same time. I feel a large blush on my cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning love!\" they say in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile and give a sigh, I feel so happy. \"Hi girls, we ready for school?\" I ask them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both nod and we begin eating, Ryan and Chon join us. \"So girls remember we still have martial arts after your lessons.\" Chon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then get an idea \"Chon I was wondering, can you teach me how to fight as well?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blind man turns to me and lifts an eyebrow in curiosity, he's not expecting me to say something like that. He turns to Ryan, who gives a shrug and a nod. Chon then says \"Very well, I suppose it would help you bond with my daughters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yay!\" Viva says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's awesome, thanks elder Brother!\" Vogue exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon might have been curious, but I wanted it. I didn't want to be defenceless, even if I may not be able to use my power to enhance myself. With that we make plans for me to join Chon and his daughters once our classes our done, I feel better in knowing that. Chon will show me the way, plus it would be good to do something like that with my new girlfriends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast me and my dorm mates go to our classes, Viva and Vogue are in the same class as me. The Dean made sure of that, something tells me that just because me and they are now bonded together still won't deter people. And speaking of which a guy our age walks up to Viva as we go down the hallway, with a letter with her name in elegant handwriting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva paused for a second and then said \"Do you take me for a fool? This has magic in it, if it's a love letter then go and get bent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy opens his mouth to speak, but it's cut off when he sees me. He glares daggers at me, but I don't shrink away. He doesn't hold a candle to the woman who gave birth to me. And sure enough he leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay Sis?\" Vogue asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva nodded and said to me \"Stay watchful Charlie, witch girls are most likely going to try as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI give a reassuring smile and say \"Well don't worry, we'll get past it all together. I remember Ryan once said that loving someone means being their ally no matter what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat resonated with my girlfriends, who hold my hands as we walk into class. And everyone's paying attention, I try not to think about that though. As I sit at the back with Viva and Vogue sitting at my sides, we exchange happy smiles at each other. I can feel it, my new life begins.</span></div></div>",

He was a few inches shorter than me with almost doll like features, jet black hair, and ocean blue eyes. On top of his head, I noticed a pair of wolf like ears. He was a male Neko-wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Class, we have a new student today.\" Kindly, Miss Rosecliff said. \"He is here on a summer student exchange program with the other side of the rift. Please give a warm welcome to Mr Matt Moray.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes turned to Matt who blushed deeply, his pointed ears wiggling slightly. \"Um... Hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, he's adorable!\" Gushing, one girl exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's so cute!\" Giggling, another shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, puppy boy!\" Grinning, a third girl said. \"You can sit next to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt Moray is the youngest grandson of the head mad scientist, Devlin Moray.\" Whispering carefully, I told Viva and Vogue. \"Ryan told us all about that just the other day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only what is he doing here?\" Curious, Viva asked. \"Aren't his older brother and sister already visiting this side of the rift?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I'm 'an adorable distraction'.\"</i> Irritable, Matt's voice replied in my head. <i>\"I'm to give the girls something else to look at until you can learn to control your gifts.\"</i> I looked up at him, curious. to see him pouting slightly.

There was no way we could get near him during and between classes. Many of the girls his age and older were all fussing over how cute he was. Remembering Matt mentally stating he was to be an adorable distraction, I put two and two together and realized that his father must have done something to him that attracts young girls. Upon seeing the frustrated look on his face, I knew he was not exactly thrilled with the job given to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long day?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" Sourly, Matt snapped. \"I've had gross icky girls following me around all day!\" He shuddered. \"I'm going to catch cooties yet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes as Viva and Vogue giggled. \"Do you think we have cooties?\" Amused, Viva asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All girls have cooties.\" Pouting, Matt replied. \"Fortunately, boys here are immune.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, I chuckled. \"You're afraid of changing.\" Smiling, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tease!\" Tearing up, Matt wailed. \"There is more magic in me than science! Put yourself in my shoes and see how brave you feel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy smile vanished in an instant. \"Matt, I didn't mean...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt would not hear anything more. He ran off, sobbing. I turned to Viva and Vogue who seemed just as surprised then sighed seeing Jessica and Tex. They sadly shook their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not your fault, kid.\" Gently, Jessica said. \"Matt is very sensitive. It doesn't take much to send him into tears. We will talk to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is his story?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our mother attempted to permanently transform our dear youngest brother into the female gender when he was still in his toddler stage.\" Evenly, Tex said. \"Regardless of the reasons, her legal attempts failed but it instilled a phobia of girls and magic into Matt.\" he frowned. \"That was not the intention but it was the result.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That has a familiar ring to it.\"</i> Frowning, Charlie thought. <i>\"Poor kid...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom died at the hands of a rogue witch, trying to take Matt for herself.\" Sadly, Jessica added. \"Dad thought that serving as an <i>adorable distraction</i> might show her that girls have their good side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us help.\" Offering, Vogue said. \"We all kind of know what its like to have it rough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your assistance is accepted.\" Nodding, Tex said. \"Please accompany us to our dorm. That is where he has most likely retreated to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching Tex and Jessica's dorm, we found the door ajar and heard crying from inside. I felt a twinge of guilt, even though I really did not mean any harm. As I opened the door, I found the kid lying on his bed, crying into his pillow. I wondered what would Ryan do in this situation?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Although I block them out, now's not the time to be entertaining it. He needed my help, Ryan would console me and be there for me. But he couldn't do that all the time, and taught me how to stand on my own two feet. Something my Mother never taught me, I need to remind myself not to call her that anymore. But I don't know what else to call her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems that his Mother must have done something bad to him, but he just had one incident from what I know. But it left him traumatised, I guess I was just so used to it. Till Ryan opened my eyes to the truth, and I begun to change. I don't know what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva and Vogue lightly hold my hands, I feel it and give a smile to them. I then sigh and look at the door.<br>\r\n\"I'll go alone.\" I say to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls are about to talk, no doubt voicing their objections to this. But I quickly cut them off by saying \"If you go in he might not listen, he seems to not like girls all that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sigh, they know that I'm right. Even if they don't like it. With a deep breath I silently walk forth and open the door, moving to shut it behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt turns to look at me. \"What do you want now?\" he hissed out at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I would have stood quivering like he was, but I'm different now. I'm done being the person who couldn't do a thing, I need to talk to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came to apologize for my actions towards you.\" I get the ball rolling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt merely turned away and said \"Fine, now get out of here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm not having that, I know about his Mother. I need to tell him something.<br>\r\n\"I heard...about your Mother.\" I mutter, walking past his bed to look out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She didn't care.\" he mutters bluntly to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI move my eyes to look at him, but I don't turn my head. \"I think she did.\" I respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell do you know?\" Matt snaps at me, sitting up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I turn to face him, a look of determination on my features. I respond with \"Because she died to protect you! My Mother would never have done that for me, she was a rouge after all. My Sisters....Rose and Carla learned from her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But your immune to being a girl. You don't know what it's like.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might be true. That didn't mean they didn't use their magic on me though.\" I then take off my shirt, exposing scars over my chest. There's also burn marks and other things, I was stick thin before coming to Starmage. If I wasn't being hurt I was being starved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So?\" he says to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh and respond with \"You may have more magic than science in you, but that doesn't mean you need to resign yourself to it. Both our Mothers did cruel things to us both, I know what it's like a lot more than you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's silent, he turns around to lie on his pillow again. But he mutters \"If...Can I talk to you again sometime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put my shirt back on and mutter \"Of course, I'll leave you now. Think on what I said.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that I leave the room, although I can tell my words had an effect on him. After leaving the room I nod at the girls.<br>\r\n\"How did it go?\" Viva asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well enough I guess, let's go.\" I nod at Tex and Jessica, leaving with my girlfriends soon after.</span></div></div>",

They were back to their normal forms, looking annoyed. Only they both gave me a sickly sweet smile as they eyed me. \"Hey there, little brother.\" Gushing, Rose said. \"I'm glad to see you finally got some backbone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that blast was impressive.\" Forcing a smile, Carla added. \"We didn't know you had it in you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you two have something to say?\" Taking one of my arms, Viva asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If not, we would like to go back to our dorm to study.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Study the art of love, no doubt.\" Smirking, Rose said. \"I wonder who goes first and who has to wait and watch the other have some fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva, Vogue, and I gave the same reaction, \"Ew!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if sensing our discomfort, Matt stepped forward. \"Cease and desist your crude inquisition of my associates' intimate activities.\" Serious, he demanded. \"Your vexatious vocal communication is causing an acute strain on our audio receptors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy sisters turned to Matt and giggled before eying him meanly. \"Aw, a young mad scientist.\" Amused, Carla gushed. She grinned. \"Why don't you go back to playing with your chemistry set.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps you can make a cute tail to go with your manufactured wolf ears.\" Grinning, Rose suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt scoffed. \"I already have a tail, thank you.\" Smugly, he said. \"I was born with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy sisters' grins instantly vanished as they looked at Matt more closely. \"You were... <i>born</i> with them?\" Surprised, Rose asked. \"Did I hear that right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I was born with them.\" Defiant, Matt replied. \"I am a true Neko wolf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose and Carla turned to each other, stunned for a moment then turned back to Matt with grins I all too well recognized. They were evil, greedy smiles they would throw at me before they tortured me with spells or worse. Viva and Vogue knew those smiles as well and we began to worry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tex, Jessica!\" Urgently, I called. \"Get your brother out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose and Carla pushed me aside and rushed Matt. They grinned at him, forgetting that his older brother and sister were watching them. \"We know a lot of young Neko girls who would love to meet you, young man.\" Eagerly, Rose said. \"True Neko boys are very rare in this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us introduce you to their mothers.\" Grinning, Carla added. \"They would just eat you up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no interest in becoming a tool for Neko procreation.\" Taking a step back, Matt protested. \"Your eagerness stresses the point you would gain from this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Smiling, Rose replied. \"Witches would pay a fortune for a boy like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she grabbed Matt's wrist. Her grip was like a vice, causing Matt to cry out in pain. In the next breath, Matt was inside a tight metal cage! Rose and Carla grinned as they easily lifted it and began to run off with him. I immediately panicked, seeing Matt forced to sit on all fours as I was when they had tortured me. Only, in this case, my sisters' move was a grave mistake. A powerful electrical blast threw Rose away from Matt and through a door on the far end of the hall. Carla, unable to hold the cage alone, dropped it to the floor. She turned around, annoyed, to find Tex staring her down with a large sparkling sphere hovering and rotating over his open hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Release my little brother or suffer the consequences!\" Enraged, he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose appeared a second later, looking just as furious. \"You dare attack us?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica summoned a powerful flame to her hand, a death glare in her eyes. \"You have three seconds to release our brother or fight for your life.\" Ice in her voice, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose and Carla both summoned flames to their hands, knowing that a fight was inevitable. I shuddered at the sight. True Neko boys were very rare and very valuable. Only I did not believe Rose and Carla would be so bold or foolish as to attempt to take him in front of his older siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is serious.\" Pulling me back, Viva said. \"If a duel happens here...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It could destroy the peace.\" Shuddering, I whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one option in our minds. \"I screamed out at the top of my lugs as Viva and Vogue followed... <b> \"Ryan!

After I shove a couple of spoonfuls into my mouth my enhanced senses detect something abnormal, something that gave me cause for concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI block out the noises around me, and focus. It's my daughters, I can sense their blue chi flames from above here. Charlie is next to them, and then I recognise the two red ones. Charlie's older Sisters, that's not good at all. It never is with them, damm bitches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then I'm focusing on the chi signatures of my adopted daughters, and I'm feeling fear and panic. I don't know what's going on, but it's clear that the Ren twins are causing distress to my girls. And I'm not going to fucking have that, no fucking way. Time to get over there and stop whatever's going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI drop my food and quickly run forward, and I jump right off the roof of the school. Everyone there shouting at what I'm doing, they think I'm committing suicide. But I'm not, I'm taking a shortcut. This is quicker than rushing down the floors inside, and besides if I've got my calculations right then I'm going to drop right on top of Rose and Carla. Death from above, the fuckers won't see it coming. Hell I'm even laughing as I do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm using my chi energy to steady my fall, spreading my body out to keep my descent at a steady pace. I was like a ninja, my kung fu is strong. And with that in mind I'm slowly but surely nearing the dorm where my daughters are at, and I punch through the ceiling. My fist enhanced by my powerful chi energy, a near deafening bang was heard as I entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI landed right on top of Rose, I could sense her surprise. Although my fists were now driving into her face, my left one might have sent a tooth flying out. And then my right connects with her cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen all of a sudden I sense Ryan entering, and he's leaping through a nearby window. Glass shattering as he rolls into the room, wasting no time he tackles Carla to the ground. Grabbing both of her hands and pinning them in place so she can't ready her magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile I pound on Rose's face a little bit more, just cause it feels good. I know I've not killed anymore and I've turned around, but truth be told I still like to hit evil witches. It just feels so cathartic, even more so when it's one of Charlie's Sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us go at once!\" Carla shouted, oh I wished Ryan would shut her up. But he's looking at the cage that's near us, and I registered that a kid was in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grab Rose by the collar and shout \"The hell have you done?!\" although she's not talking. Cause she's knocked out, I then turn my blindfold covered gaze at Carla.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We-we were just playing a little prank, we heard about how their Brother was a Neko wolf and just wanted to tease him.\" Carla said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah right Sis, you were just talking about how you wanted him sold to other witches.\" Charlie says, Carla only glares at him before trying to give a smile to him. Still trying to keep up with the sickly sweet act eh? No one is buying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the kid, Matt I think his name was is just shivering in his cage. I look to Jessica and Tex and say \"Do you mind getting him out? Girls take Charlie and go back to the dorm, tell everyone what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy daughters grunt to say yes and quickly walk off with Charlie between them, I stand up and hoist Rose over my shoulder. Ryan keeps his hold on Carla and says \"C'mon let's go.\" with that we leave with Carla continuing to claim innocence. Rose would too, but I just knocked her out. Speaking of which I make sure to swing her body to the side, banging her head in the doorframe for good measure.</span></div></div>",

Moments later, a tall man entered in a police uniform. He nodded in greeting then turned to Rose and Carla. \"You will come with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis voice had a strange echo to it; one that seemed almost hypnotic. Then I realized that it must have been as the two girls followed him out without a word. Once they were gone, Elvira turned to Chon and I. \"That little weasel who leaked information has been seen sneaking around.\" Serious, she stated. \"Some form of cloaking device.\" She sighed. \"Your orders on this matter are simple; if you see him, he is to be treated as a hostile intruder.

The hole in the roof that Chon made has already been fixed it seems, probably by Jessica while they waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough once they see me enter the dorm they waste no time in getting close to me, I inwardly groan and prepare myself for the ensuing bullshit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did those bitches get what they deserve?!\" Tex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly, you prefects need to do a better job.\" Jessica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex at this point has his arms on my shoulders, I frown at Jessica's choice of words and swat away Tex's arms. I need to placate them somehow, otherwise this could lead to another incident. \"Rose and Carla are going to your world for a couple of weeks, I don't know what will happen but I bet it won't be pleasant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex stops, sighs and then grins at me before saying \"I wonder how they might like it if they become walking lab rats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't show it but I give an inward shudder, after seeing what happened to the Ren twins at Charlie's bonding ceremony that might have just been a taste of what was in store for them. But moving on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that Dex Bedlam is still at large within the grounds of the academy, we would like your help in locating him and bringing him to justice.\" I state while placing the bottom of my katana's scabbard on the floor while holding the top of the handle with both hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica walks past me while saying \"Say no more, let's go look for him.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe keep up at this for the rest of the day, Matt is still in his room. No doubt huddling under some covers after what Carla and Rose did to him, they probably did that to Charlie now that I think on it. I don't want to think that though. I only want to think about how good it will feel when I find that punk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we exit the dorm however Lunar appears before us, hovering ever so slightly above the ground while using her wings.<br>\r\n\"Ryan! I believe I have received confirmation that the suspect known as Dex Bedlam is in the forest near the Starmage grounds. What's the call?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know what to say right away \"Where exactly Lunar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Near the abandoned church, shall I go and alert the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do that Lunar, Jessica and Tex come with me.\" I quickly rush past Lunar and rush to the forest with my guests in tow. It's payback time, Dex is going to wish that he never set foot on the ground of this school.</span></div></div>",

And I know where it is, Lunar is warning the rest of Starmage Academy that Dex Bedlam has been located. And now it's time to bring him in, the guy's done enough harm. He nearly endangered Charlie's wellbeing, and that's something I just can't fucking allow. That kid has gone through enough crap as it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're nearly there.\" I mutter to the two people with me. They don't reply, they are focused on getting payback for what happened to their sibling. Rose and Carla have been dealt with for now, perhaps for good depending on what happens to them. But they are just small time, compared to some of the other players around the world. Chon can speak for that, considering that all rouge witches have been ordered to kill him if they ever encounter him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe church comes into view, time has not been kind to it. This was the place where I found Light Killer, sleeping inside. I had gone there as a prefect on accounts of a madman being spotted there, and the rest was history. Only I'm not here for nostalgia's sake, I'm here to track down a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sure enough Dex is there, standing on top of the cross that's on the building. The sun is setting, the orange light basking behind him and nearly concealing his blood red hair. On his hips are the two swords he used before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got no where to run now Dex, it's over!\" Tex said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are outnumbered 3 to 1 scumbag!\" Jessica said as she produced the trademark witch flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI flick the hilt of my katana, pushing the blade ever so slightly out the scabbard. \"Turn yourself in.\" I say bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDex doesn't respond, based on his dossier I expected him to start being a brat towards us. Only he's silent, gusts of wind going near him. The jacket tied around his waist flutters with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next is a blur, in an instant Dex is gone. Vanished from the top of the small church building, and the next thing I know. The man is in in mid air, striking a pose with his weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/asRnWX0c1vo/maxresdefault.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://i.ytimg.com/vi/asRnWX0c1vo/maxres...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what I see is his eyes, they aren't like Dex's. They weren't chaotic and wild, no these were cold and calculating. Almost as if this was a completely different person than him, and that's when I notice something else. A light blue aura is emerging from his body, he's not said a word and a chill goes down the base of my spine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzura inwardly warns me of danger, and on instinct I follow his direction. I quickly leap back, Dex vanishes again in the air. Tex and Jessica shot out a double blast, using their science and magic abilities together. But they fired at where he had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tex! Jessica get back!\" I yell out, only it's too late. Dex appears behind them, his swords aimed high. And then slowly lowered, and suddenly the two people clutch their chests. And blood spurts forth from them, this guy is totally different from when I fought him before. But I see that the attacks weren't lethal, it looks like Tex injected himself with a serum of some kind. Science of course, but Jessica wasn't so lucky. She was still alive, but I don't know how bad the wound is from his angle as she has her back to me. They didn't even have time to realise what hit them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the fuck are you?!\" I spit out, getting settled into my stance. I'm worried about my two companions, but Tex might be fine so he can probably see to Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDex settles into his stance, his cold eyes no doubt pondering how to deal with me. He then says \"I am Bedlam, the other self of Dex. The boy created me as a means to eliminate those who crossed him.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what? Your some kind of alternate personality then?\" I ask, that did kinda make sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I intend to protect the boy. That is my only purpose, not that it matters to you. For you are soon to be removed from this world Carlson, I posses powers unlike that of Dex. As you have just witnessed, I have sliced into your allies. You are like ants that move together to live, weak the lot of you.\" he mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis isn't good, Bedlam is serious. I think this is trouble right here, not only is he clearly stronger than Dex. But he's taken out both of my allies here, I'll need to handle the fight. At least until either A. Tex and Jessica are able to recover. Or B. Lunar and the rest of the group arrive. But I'm prepared to fight anyway, this guy is intent on killing me. In that case no mercy will be showed against him.</span></div></div>",

I turned to Tex and Jessica; it was not them. They were both using their individual powers to heal themselves. A deafening clap of thunder was heard and the sky instantly grew dark with threatening clouds that swirled around like a miniature hurricane. The winds went from a light breeze to a literal gale in seconds as the clouds changed shape to that of a massive face which showed great anger. It was the face of Tex and Jessica's father, Nathan Moray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"YOU INSIGNIFICANT WORM!\"</b> Furious, Nathan thundered. <b>\"YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TRUE POWER IS!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI inwardly cringed, seeing dean Elvira's fears of a war coming to light because of this Dex bastard always string up fucking trouble!

Also, he is a criminal of this world. We must leave it to the powers that govern it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud growl echoed from the massive face of Tex's father. \"Very well....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a bright flash and then...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This guy is very dangerous, way more than Dex is. So it's some kind of protective alter ego, with some sort of teleporting power. But we don't know what else he has, I thought that he seriously injured Tex and Jessica there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then it seemed that their old man had other plans, a large light engulfed my view. I lifted my blade and arms to prevent blindness from happening to me. If Bedlam moved from this then I would be a dead man, but....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn't the case, when the light disappeared so had he. I quickly look around, my blade ready to strike. Had Bedlam teleported? I couldn't be sure. But then Tex begins to stand up, his shirt covered in his blood. He looked a bit pale but no worse for wear. \"He's gone Ryan you can relax.\" Jessica was silent. Her wounds still hurt, something told me that her healing magic wasn't as good as Tex's healing nanites or whatever they called it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fuck just happened?\" I muttered as I put Azura away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our Dad just plucked Bedlam away from us, thank God. That guy creeped me out, that blood red hair. The x scar, just ugh. I feel like I need a bath.\" Jessica said, without missing a beat she walked away and back to the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI said nothing and followed suit with Tex behind me, as we head through the forest Lunar nears us. Saying \"Ryan, Elvira needs to see you in her office at once! It's in regards to Bedlam!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just nod and say \"Tell the others to stand down.\" no point in all of us getting riled up after all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be in our dorm Ryan.\" Tex mutters to me. Again I only nod, I'm not really in a talking mood considering my life was nearly snuffed out by a crazy guy. And now I need to meet the Dean, fucking brilliant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I enter the hallway where her office is I already hear her shouting, I groan slightly. Everything had been going so great for now, better deal with the fallout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knock on the door, there's silence before I announced that it was me. Elvira storms up to the door and opens it, she has one hand with a phone close to her ear. And motions for me to enter, I do so and shut the door behind me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moray why did you place perform that action?! He has attempted murder not once but twice now! He needs to be detained and face justice!\" Elvira said. There was silence as Nathan responded, I leaned on the door waiting for the response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira groaned out and then said \"Look Carlson is here, I will inform him. Next time if you pull a stunt like that then you must inform me, the balance of the worlds is shaky as it is. Right then, good bye.\" with that she hung up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what'd he say?\" I ask, now no longer leaning on the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dean turns to me, pausing for a moment. As if trying to find what she should say, eventually Elvira says.......</span></div></div>",

With that I went back to my dorm, everyone looked like they were about to say something to me. I just waved a hand at them and went into my room, lying down on it without bothering to change my clothes. I'm out like a light, and the next thing I know it's morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny knocks on my door and I grunt to say that she can enter, she does and says \"Are you okay Ryan?\" shutting the door behind her. I sigh, but I always feel better when she's around. I sit at the front of my covered bed, one of these days I'm gonna need to make sure I do nothing. As in just lie about, if any shit happens I'll just let Light deal with it. The big idiot can't die, so just put him into the burner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duty calls, I'll need to speak with Tex and Jessica.\" I say as I get up. However Jenny stops me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You might want to change your clothes, you've been in them for an entire day. I've put some new clothes for you in the shower.\" Jenny mutters to me. I sigh happily, taking her into my arms for a hug. I'd love to stay, but I've got things that needed to be done here. At least it's the weekend now, no work or essays are due in. Once I get this shit done then I can maybe do something fun for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick shower and change later I'm out the dorm with toast in my mouth, the order of business is to placate the guests. And sure enough I see them, and Tex and Jessica look pissed off. Behind them is a recent addition to our dorm, it's Shomei Akatsuki. I'm pretty sure that our guests have no clue who Sho really is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo put it simple he's an ex Japanese SDF officer, back when it was first founded in the 50's. The sprit in my blade is his direct ancestor, they were a clan of demon hunters from Japan. And that's allowed Shomei to live after being frozen in the Artic North, right now he's here as a sort of foreign exchange student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carlson! The gaijins refuse to listen to me, perhaps you can appease them!\" Shomei says to me in his thick Japanese accent. Old habits die hard, gaijin = foreigner. Shomei's not actually Japanese anymore, the last mission he did failed and he was wiped from the records of Japan's SDF.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know don't worry, stand down Sho.\" I say to him. He salutes me and marches off, his officer background on display. I shake my head and look at Tex and Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you got that fucker yet?\" Tex says to me, walking right up to me. Jessica's behind him, trying to make sure he's not too confrontational. That's not gonna work on me, I fold my arms. Not showing any signs that I'm going to cave in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simmer down, Dex's been dealt with and so are the Ren twins. The way I see it you've got nothing to complain about.\" I mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex is about to say something, only I do a talk to the hand gesture. He's silent and I carry on with \"How about you do something normal for a while? Maybe go and spend some quality time with Mat, Charlie can only do so much. Your his family, so go and be it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems that's what Jessica wanted me to say, she tugs at the sleeve of Tex. Tex says nothing, but merely nods and leaves. I feel like I've made a victory here, speaking of normal I should probably try and do something like that. But if I've forgotten how then I'll need to learn that. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>Ryan's POV</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had just reached the recreation room of the school, hoping to hit the gym. However, those hopes faded when I saw Rose and Carla Ren slowly entering from the other side. I shook my head, expecting another round of trouble. What surprised me was that the two girls were walking much more slowly and with far less confidence than I had ever seen them. The two seemed to have been jumping at the slightest movement. What concerned me was that they then sat down at the most isolated booth when they normally enjoyed being the center of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would seem their visit to the other side left them rather rattled.\" Frowning, I muttered. \"I suppose I should speak with them.\" I sighed. \"Duty calls again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked up to the table to find the Ren twins more than just shaken. They were cut, bruised, burned... they looked like Charlie did after they were done toying with him. \"What happened to you two?\" Softly, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Carla and Rose jumped with a slight scream, turning to me, looking terrified. After a few ragged breaths, they blushed slightly. \"We- We are not as powerful as we first thought.\" Timidly, Rose said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Well, duh.\"</i> Sighing, I thought. Then, I asked, \"Care to tell me how you got so badly banged up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla sniffled, fighting tears. \"We were curious about a mad scientist's laboratory so we... sneaked in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"Let me guess, you encountered the automatic defense systems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose and Carla sadly nodded before Rose stated, \"That was not the worst of it. Their father punished us by showing us what happens to intruders to a mad scientist's laboratory.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raised a single eyebrow. \"What happened?\" Morbidly curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Rose and Carla began to sob, hugging each other. Having a pen pal who was a sort of mad scientist, I realized that they must have been experimented on. Part of me felt they deserved what they got while another felt pity for them. \"Report to the infirmary.\" Evenly, I ordered. \"You look like hell. I will inform dean Elvira what you had told me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Rose and Carla left the room with a number of prefect officers while I continued to walk to the gym to try to relax.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryan's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as I disliked the Ren girls, part of me did feel for them. But hey, perhaps this might be the kicker that they need to change their ways. Their Mother was a powerful rouge witch, and had passed on her power to her daughters. But there's far, far worse things out there. It's funny how they believed Charlie to be of no use apart from a magical punching bag, and yet the kid was all along a walking deposit of tremendous magic power. Maybe if they had been nicer to the kid they wouldn't be in the situation they'd been in, their decisions brought them to that place. Although it would also be their decisions that could bring them to a better path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was then in the gym, dressed in nothing but a pair of black jogging bottoms and red sneakers. I commence some light stretching, and then moving onto pushups. Thankfully there's no one around and I'm on a mat, I begin to practise my martial arts. I'm not adept in the art of chi like Chon is, but I have figured out some things at least. He's teaching it to his kids as well, Charlie's gonna learn martial arts too. More so than usual, seeing as how it's gotten out that he's the aforementioned magic familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm kinda miffed that there's no one about, I'd have loved to fight against Shomei. He was personally trained by the Japanese SDF back when it first was made, although why he still looks like a young man is a story for another day. But the fact is he's someone you wouldn't want to cross, the powers he has......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continue for a bit longer, it's been too long since I neglected my fists. I usually use my blade, the fact that I'm an instant master of the sword is because of the blade I use. There's the soul of a demon slayer in it, who wielded the blade back in the Sengoku era. So his memories of swordplay have melded with my own, so that it comes near naturally to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on I'm dressed back in my uniform after a quick shower, it felt good to just cut loose and work out. Felt like good stress relief, but little did I know that I was going to need it. As I head back to the dorms I noticed a crowd of people gathered around the dorm where our guests are staying, that set off alarm bells right away for me. Had Tex picked on the Ren girls in their weak state?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out the way, move it.\" I say as I brush past the crowd and get into the dorm. Tex is in the hallway, looking irate. Shomei is in the hall trying to make sure he stays there. Chon's there too leaning on the door so that Tex can't get in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell's going on?\" I say, this whole thing doesn't look good one bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carlson! Jessica is ill! And nothing is being done on this, tell this blind idiot to move aside!\" Tex yelled pointing at Chon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know the Chinese man won't take that lying down, Chon's eyebrows go under his blindfold. \"You can't, Jessica is ill and we don't know if it can spread. The best in Starmage and Wandill's medical industry is in there, so why don't you sit down and be quiet.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chon-san speaks the truth Gaijin, restraint is needed above all else at this moment.\" Shomei states with his arms folded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I feel a tap on my shoulder and I turn around to see John Harrison, maybe he can tell me what's going on. \"Did you just get here?\" I say to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn nods and says \"Jessica complained of stomach cramps a short while ago, only she collapsed not too long ago. And she's become quite pale, the best medical witches are in there right now. Carlson I take it you can get to the bottom of this, my hands are tied along with the Dean. Tex and Jessica's Dad will go berserk if this gets out of hand, make sure all the members of your dorm get these jags. They should prevent you from catching the illness from the spell cast on her.\" the guy then hands me a case full of needles with green liquid. I never did like getting my flu jab, but it keeps the Doctor away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do, Chon Shomei let's go. John will remain here with Tex, God helps us all.\" I say. The Japanese and Chinese men follow me closely, this isn't going to be good. But I need to figure out who's done it and why.</span></div></div>",

Chon nodded. \"The visitor, Tex was hit with a fast acting curse, increasing his irritability until he snaps into a blind rage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes him a threat as the curse can move to other people through physical contact just like a contagious disease.\" Holding up a small vile, Carla said. \"This potion will cure that 'disease' but you must act fast before it spreads to the entire school.\" She turned to Chon. \"You are immune to these curses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon cracked a slight smile. \"I'll make certain Tex takes his medicine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he rushed off, I shook my head slightly. <i>\"He's been itching to shut that kid up since they first met.\"</i> I then turned to the Ren twins and asked, \"What about this slow acting curse you mentioned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was used on Jessica.\" Serious, Rose replied. \"This curse will cause a magical flu.\" She sighed. \"Normally, this only effects untrained witches but this curse makes it happen to even the most seasoned witch, increasing the risks behind it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When an untrained witch catches the flu, it causes her magic to shoot off at random and at random targets until the flu is cured.\" Worried, I said. \"If a trained witch falls under these conditions...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be like detonating a bomb in the heart of the school.\" Pale faced, Carla said. \"Right now, the curse is eating away at Jessica's natural defenses. Once the curse worms through those, the magical flu will strike and chaos will ensue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you two know who cast these curses?\" Alarmed, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose and Carla nodded. \"Her name is Chrystin Bane.\" Showing distaste, Rose replied. \"She and our mother were 'partners in crime' before she lost her powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is this Chrystin Bane attacking Tex and Jessica?\" Serious, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chrystin had two children who were sent to the other side of the rift to ensure she would never have claim to them again.\" Darkly, Carla replied. \"By cursing Tex and Jessica, they become quarantined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned pale, hearing this. \"She wants them as replacements to the children she lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not them.\" To my horror, Rose said. \"Their youngest brother, Matt Moray. With both older siblings preoccupied, she could snatch the boy up with little fuss as use him to get her children back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What would taking Matt do to make any deals?\" Morbidly curious, Shomei asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose and Carla's response caused even Shomei to hesitate. \"We learned this from the children's father... Matt Moray is destined to become the next head mad scientist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow knowing that we had a serious situation on our hands, I ran for the dorms with Shomei right behind me as I turned to my radio. \"Amy, Jenny! Jessica has been hit with a 'magical flu' curse! Start the needed treatment immediately!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's bad!\" Alarmed, Jenny responded. \"We'll administer the counter curse right away!

And we don't know where they are, fuck, fuck, fuck. We know the name, that's all. And I'm kinda surprised that Rose and Carla have pitched in to help, perhaps they are considering changing. That or they're just afraid of what will happen if this bitch gets her way, but she won't. She might be good, but she is in the hornets nest. And it's been kicked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly kick the door open, earning a loud yelp inside. And there's Charlie and Chon's girls, I breathe a sigh of relief. Charlie speaks up with \"What's going on Ryan? Everybody's bustling about outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't beat around the bush, I quickly enter the room and say \"Listen a rogue witch has snuck into the campus, and there's a curse going about. It affects witches and makes them go into a blind rage more or less, the cure is being put to use as we speak.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva and Vogue go wide eyed with fear in their faces, but it goes to relief when I talked about a cure. However I continue with \"That's not the reason she's here though, Matt.....your the reason.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! Why?!\" he exclaims.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's because of your family, you would be used as a bargaining chip. Listen you can't stay in this room, we will move into your Brother's. That way if she chooses to attack it will force her to reveal herself, Shomei stay here with them. I must find Elvira.\" I say as I proceed to move out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShomei salutes me and says \"Understood Carlson-san, so long as I draw breath the boy will not be harmed.\" he's a guy I can trust. He was taught by the Japanese SDF to put the mission above his own life, and Akatsuki proceed to shepherd the children into the other room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm sprinting through the school grounds, I need to find the dean and talk with her. I'm rushing past students and teachers alike, only when I get to the door of the room I hear a noise. Helicopter blades?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI burst into the room, Elvira has opened the wall to her right using her magic. A helicopter is waiting for her to enter like a carriage, I lift a hand to cover my view from the stuff in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dean Elvira? What are you doing?!\" I yell out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira responds with \"Carlson! I trust you know of the disease that Chrystin Bane is planning to spread on the school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Jenny is making sure the cure is getting mass made, what the hell are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira sighs, I don't hear it over the helicopter. \"As a precaution I have to remove myself from the location, it makes magic uncontrollable. If I were to be infected there's no telling what destruction could occur, here catch!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dean tosses an earpiece to me, I catch it and instantly stick it in my ear. But I don't switch it on, not yet anyway.<br>\r\n\"Chrystin Bane will be hiding amongst you, search the records in my desk. I believe she will attempt contact with her children. They are in the school, find them! I will advise you as best I can from an undisclosed location, Godspeed Carlson!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Elvira gets into the chopper, and it flies away once the door shuts. I make my way over to her desk, finding that she must have used magic so that it didn't go flying. I see a drawer that's slightly open, almost as if it's a hint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open it, there's a folder there. And just that, knowing that it must be important I pick it up and find two names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYin and Yang Granger<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdopted, of course. Both have long blond hair and blue eyes with doll like features and lithe bodies. A girl and a guy. That's all I need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI mutter something under my breath as I head out.<br>\r\n\"No one comes onto my school, and does this crap.

They were all good children at heart though they all suffered plight in their innocent years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not a surprise to me that Matt was destined to become a leader. I could sense his power and it was strong. However, his mind was unfocused and this body was out of balance. He had a lot to learn and experience before he would be ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie's power was strong as well only his heart was pure, despite his hardships. He had potential to become a fine leader if only he could find the character to make difficult decisions. Viva and Vogue were both powerful in their own right but they were still little girls. I had praised Chon for releasing them from their fates of becoming one with the dark side of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy thoughts were interrupted by the crickets suddenly becoming silent. I had placed ten crickets, each in a small wicker cage every ten feet in both directions. I had placed them where they would not be immediately seen but still heard. It was an ancient early warning device; when the crickets were silent it meant someone was approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith my hand upon the hilt of my Hinoken, I watched the closed door and waited for our visitor to make his or her move. The Hinoken, or fire sword, was forged out of an unearthly metal found in a meteorite. This metal, although cold to the touch, it hot as lava if struck with sufficient force. Nothing can withstand its blow for very long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door was hit by a force on the outside, sending it crashing to the floor. I drew my Hinoken and faced the intruder.

He stood in an offensive stance with one hand holding a glowing, spinning orb of energy. The other was tugging on a collar like device around his neck which I immediately recognized as a control collar!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spinning globe was a mad scientist's 'spark' or energy signature showing their strength to an opponent. Tex was clearly very powerful for his age. The control collar was a witch's device used to basically force others to do their bidding against their will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tex, what are you doing!?\" Annoyed, Matt blurted out. \"You scared us....\" He then saw the control collar and gasped. \"You paradoxical, obstinate, irksome, tempestuous, adolescent nincompoop! You let a witch get the best of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frowned, focusing my thoughts. For a witch to get the best of a mad scientist was a source of great embarrassment. That said, I knew that this boy would be hellbent upon revenge once released from the control collar. I would have to move quickly and decisively to stop the boy from being a puppet of death and a fool marching into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to the strange technology I was sent to obtain during my last mission in Japan's SDF the tech merged with my flesh when I activated my lineage's powers.  The technology was to create limitless electricity; it served as a force shield to keep me alive while also frozen solid. With this technology now fused with my flesh, I can generate limitless electricity with my own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalk was not an option as the control collar, or rather, the one controlling it, was making all the decisions for Tex. I sheathed my Hinoken and waited for him to make the first move. Fortunately, Tex attacked me physically, which made the task all too easy. I dodged his blow and took hold of the control collar. With a simple twist and a powerful jolt, the collar shorted out and shut down. Now it was just a matter of ripping the metal ring off Tex's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon doing so, Tex was back to his old self. However, as I feared, he was blindly furious. This was a rage I had rarely seen in any human. However, I also saw a hint of betrayal in his eyes. He knew the one who had forced the collar onto him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe eyes softened slightly as he turned towards me. \"thanks.\" Through gritted teeth, he said. \"Now stand witness as Chrystin Bane, the murderer of my mother, faces my full wrath!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood silent as Tex turned away from me. The moment he did, however, I spoke. \"Your anger is strong but it is wild, unfocused.\" Calmly, I said. \"Allow one who can focus his anger to exact your revenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I sent Tex unconscious to the floor with a quick but powerful chop to the neck. He fell in a heap, breathing heavily but evenly. I pulled him to a chair and unceremoniously plopped him into it. Matt looked at me, stunned to which I gave him a kind smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your brother has much to learn.\" Calmly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt gave a half smirk. \"I could have told you that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe V twins giggled and waved their hands, instantly repairing the door. \"What now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"We wait.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I sighed, irritated. <i>\"It's too early in the morning for this!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I heard a child's giggle. At first, I thought it was Viva and Vogue trying to be cute. As I stepped out of my closet, however, I found Matt Moray, the young Neko boy smiling at me. I immediately knew that the mischievous young mad scientist was trying to get a rise out of me. I decided not to give him the satisfaction as I knew that alone would drive him crazy. \"Whatever.\" With a half grin, I muttered. \"I need to get to class. You better move along; the professors do not tolerate tardiness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then walked through the door I knew was the hall and stepped out of my dorm. Matt quickly followed me with a perplexed look on his face. \"That was not much of a reaction.\" Surprised, he said. \"Interesting.\" He quickly jotted down some notes. \"Such maturity, a true warrior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stopped, hearing that and turned to him, curious. \"Why this game, kid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt huffed as if he had just been insulted. \"This is serious research, thank you!\" He stuck his tongue out at me in a childish manner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could only roll my eyes even though I felt like laughing. <i>\"College level one minute and childish the next.\"</i> Then, I asked. \"Why are you conducting this research?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt smiled slightly. \"I'm searching for a sensei.\" Calmly, he replied. \"I know several forms of martial arts in my world and I wish to see if there are new forms of martial arts to learn here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckled at that. \"Only you want a serious teacher, one with a lot of patience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt nodded. \"That is the reason for my research.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What a unique way to find a sensei.\"</i> Slightly amused, I thought. I then stated, \"Go talk to Chon. Maybe he has room for another student.\" I then rose a finger of warning. \"Talk to him, do not test him. He will test you in return.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt nodded. \"Thank you, Mr. Carlson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then bowed respectfully and ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was looking forward to starting a few more lessons with Chon over the weekend. Only a firm but polite knock on my door interrupted my chain of thoughts. <i>\"Who could that be?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI answered the door to find Matt Moray standing in the hall, looking rather uncomfortable. \"I realize that this is an inconvenient time but I am in need of your advice.\" Softly, he said. \"I request permission to enter your dormitory for a brief conversation on a personal matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, rolling my eyes and stepped aside to allow Matt to enter. Viva and Vogue both gave Matt and I questioning looks to which I merely shrugged. \"He's here seeking advice.\" Shrugging, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of advice?\" Curious, Viva asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt cringed slightly. \"I need advice concerning Chon.\" Worry in his voice, he said. \"I am not certain how to approach this individual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Firmly but kindly, Vogue inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Matt, Chon was in the other room, listening in. He had stopped by to check up on his two daughters, Viva and Vogue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt sighed. \"He is blind and yet he can see. He has been through so much anguish and yet he is calm and serine.\" He gulped. \"Still waters run deep. I do not wish to 'hit the wrong button' when talking to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva and Vogue were silent for a moment before they erupted into giggles. I could not help smile myself. \"Just be polite and respectful.\" Simply, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BB doesn't bite.\" Amused, Viva added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, big brother is the best!\" Happily, Vogue chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt moaned, still looking uncomfortable. \"I'm hoping he has room for another student so I can learn this world's martial arts.\" Nervous, he said. \"I am simply at a loss as to how to ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then just ask me directly.\" Stepping into the room, Chon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt gasped then bowed awkwardly. It was not the perfect greeting bow but at least he was making an attempt. \"I apologize, master Chon.\" Tearing up, he said. \"I did not sense your presence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was because I did not want you to sense me.\" Grinning, Chon said. \"At least not right away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I assume you heard my request?\" Timidly, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, shaking my head. \"For one who has supposedly mastered many martial arts, you seriously lack confidence, Matt.\" Calmly, I pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This lack of confidence is due to a nightmare curse he has suffered from since he was only two years old, Charlie.\" Serious, Chon said. \"When you told me about him, I did some research into the matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt has been suffering from a nightmare curse for five years?\" Disturbed, Vogue asked. \"That- That's unforgivable!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon nodded. \"It is one of the reasons nightmare curses are forbidden in this world.\" Darkly, he said. \"However, it is not forbidden in his.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did his mother forget to put in a cancellation phrase into the curse?\" Worried, Viva asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon shook his head. \"His mother was murdered by a rogue witch before she had the chance to remove the curse.\" Sadly, he said. \"Since she was the only one who knew the cancellation phrase...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no way to break the curse.\" Shocked, Vogue said. \"Oh, Matt, we are so sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was crying at this point. \"I- I have learned to- to deal with them.\" Barely controlling himself, he said. \"I am hoping I could learn enough discipline to break the curse without the cancellation phrase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon was silent for a moment then turned to me. \"Charlie, I do not have any room for another student but you may be just the help he needs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon turned very serious, adjusting his blindfold. \"You had suffered physically for a long time.\" Patiently, he said. \"Matt's suffering is all mental. Still, the scars it leaves are the same only his you can not see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mental and psychological can affect one physically.\" Remembering one of Ryan's lectures, you muttered. \"Matt has suffered just as much as I had.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon nodded. \"Perhaps even more so due to him being a rare Neko boy.\" Softly, Chon stated. \"I need you to mentor Matt as Ryan and I had mentored you.\" He then bowed to him. \"I have every confidence in yours, Viva and Vogue's skills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then left the room, leaving me wondering where to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Albeit reluctantly, due to his fear of girls in general, he complied. I motioned to the candle that was burning in the center of the table. \"Please look into the flame of the candle.\" Calmly, I said. \"Notice how it dances upon the wick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva and Vogue smiled kindly, knowing I was using the same technique Chon used on them and myself to talk about our own pasts when we were reluctant. Matt looked into the flame and watched it move with the slightest breeze within the room. \"See how every wisp of wind changes the dance slightly?\" Evenly, I inquired. \"Do you see how graceful it moves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt nodded but did not respond. His eyes were slowly beginning to glass over; he was falling into a trance. After talking to Matt about the candle flame for a few more seconds, he was completely into a trance like state; I knew I could begin. \"Why don't you tell us about your nightmares.\" Slowly, I suggested. \"What is it about them that makes you feel afraid?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt immediately teared up but remained in a trance. \"I wake up feeling strange.\" Tearfully, he said. \"I find myself in the body of a girl wearing a pink nightgown. Mom is there, smiling at me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he talked, Viva and Vogue magically produced an image over the candle flame, showing one of Matt's nightmares as it took shape....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Mattie.\" Gleefully, mom said. \"I see you already noticed my morning surprise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why- Why am I a girl?\" panicked, Matt demanded. \"Change me back! I'm a boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom responded by viciously slapping Matt in the face, sending his head rearing before snapping back to face her, terrified. \"Mom...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have enough worthless, science thumping boys in this family!\" Angrily, mom snapped. \"Be thankful I have chosen you to embrace the wonders of womanhood and magic!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom, this is not like you.\" Shaking, Matt squeaked. \"Are you ill or under a curse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother vicious slap threw Matt out of the bed, landing hard onto the floor before he, or rather, she was picked up by the collar of her pink nightgown. \"A young lady does not talk back to her mother!\" Enraged, she screamed. \"You will learn to respect and be eternally grateful you are now a girl and a witch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt became angry. \"You are not my mother!\" Blurting out, she screamed. \"My mother loves me as a boy, Matt Moray!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Matt found himself being slammed into the wall, the floor, the ceiling like some rag doll in the hands of an infant having a tantrum. She screamed in pain as she was thrown into a lamp, a window, breaking the glass, a closet door, the door knob gouging into his left eye... Mom sneered at her screams. \"If I have to beat this lesson into you, so be it!\" Hysterically angry, she screamed. \"You are a girl now and forever, <b>UNDERSTAND!?</b>.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough!\" Softly, I commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt cried freely, though he was still in a trance. I turned to Viva and Vogue who were pale after seeing a magic projection of one of his nightmares. \"These images have a sickeningly familiar ring to them.\" Shaken, Viva whispered. \"A mother gone mad, trying to force magic onto her son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the most mild nightmare, closest to the surface.\" Darkly, I said. \"I am certain there are more horrifying nightmares deeper within his mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you suggesting we dig deeper?\" Worried, Vogue asked. \"These nightmares traumatized him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, a dead look forming onto my eyes. The images of Matt's nightmare did indeed have an all too familiar ring to it. Only his nightmares were continuous, every night for five years. I was surprised he had not gone completely mad yet.

But I know this can work, and besides......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we were there, but didn't you recall what happened to them? I think maybe we can finally put an end to them troubling us. They're probably already rattled from being sent over to Matt's world, so it's surely going to be in our favour.\" I make sure to say that, Rose and Carla quite recently came back from the rift. And from what I'm told they're not the same as before, no doubt seeing what mad scientists could do when they could get away with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt pipes up with \"Okay, I can do it. I want to put an end to my troubles, and besides. I want payback on them....\" he has that look in his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva and Vogue sigh, \"No point in arguing with two stubborn boys.\" Viva mutters. I simply roll my eyes in response, I don't think this can go wrong. If the worst should come to pass, it would be mere minutes and then Ryan or another member of the gang would show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that we silently make our way to the dorm room where I know Rose and Carla are staying, it's as far away from my dorm room as possible. Just in case of course, as we near the room we hear talking. It seems odd though, chirpy and upbeat. I was told that my Sisters went through some rather harsh experiments, like they literally went without a spine for a day. Somehow, the thought could make me shiver if I wasn't jaded from the abuse I've gone through in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's get this show on the road.\" Matt muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll stay and make sure no one else interferes, you need to do this by yourself.

All that matters is we get Matt with Rose and Carla, anyone else will be dealt with by me and the V girls. Since I arrived at Starmage Ryan's been teaching me boxing, I've learned that years of abuse has led to me having pent up anger. Which equates to a perfect right hook. And Viva and Vogue, all that needs to be said is that they managed to learn martial arts from Chon. I'm told the art he uses is employed by the Chinese military, so it must be brutal to undergo how to learn it. Let alone master it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd if the worst comes to pass the rest of the team are around, Chon burst through the roof to save us one time. So yeah, all in all I'm pretty confident that things will be alright. It's just time for the leap of faith, I rap on the door twice. A solid pair, whoever's in the room is bound to have heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough the voices in the room die down, and I hear footsteps approaching. But the door doesn't open, rather we hear a female voice from it. It's Rose, she always like to add some British flair to her words.<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" she asks, she's not going to open? Shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Charlie......\" I mutter, a hint of anger in the back of my neck. Viva senses it and takes a step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wish to discuss your actions regarding one of our guests known as Matt, he's here and open for discussion in meeting other Neko girls.\" she states. Nice one girl, play to their greed. It's one of the biggest flaws. Matt shivers quietly behind us, but he knows what we're doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on......\" I hear sounds of a lock. \"It's open!\" Rose shouts, why not open the door and try to grab Matt?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI give a sigh, might as well. I'm pretty sure Chon is watching over us anyway, anytime it seems like Viva or Vogue are in danger he's instantly there to rip someone's head off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grab the door by it's handle and open it, and instantly I am shocked by what I witness. And I'm fairly sure that my girls and Matt are too, my Sisters are there. With three other girls, but they look really....well.....different.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/prettycure/images/c/ca/Smile_pose.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20120317094741\" target=\"_blank\">http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/pret...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose has pink hair, and Carla is dyed blue. What the hell are they wearing? And who are the girls next to them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually wait I think I know them, they're quasi rogues just like Rose and Carla. The one with the green hair is Lisa Montaron, she's known for drawing pictures of boys dressed as girls and pasting them on their backs. The blonde is Eliza McTon, a bitchy cheerleader in the Starmage cheerleading squad. And the orange girl is Erin Godda, a rather hotheaded woman with a penchant for picking fights with guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Charlie!\" Carla shouts with a really gleeful wave, all of this just seems so....surreal. The hair, the outfits and the beaming smiles they're giving us. Suddenly Rose is leaning down and....giving me a hug?! It feels....oddly friendly too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI freeze up, and in an instant Viva and Vogue are right at Rose. Just as it looks like all hell is going to break loose Rose backs away, with her hands up to signal peace. \"Woah woah, no harm meant girls!\" Rose says with concern in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe V girls cling to my arms and glare daggers at Rose, to be honest I would say that Matt was the only reason they've not started to beat the shit out of my Sisters. Viva then says \"What's with the hair and outfits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla smiles and says \"Well you recall that incident with Matt, and how we were punished for it yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could we forget, I actually cheered. But I merely just nod my head, this prompts Rose to go on with \"To put it simply, we were experimented on. And it wasn't very nice, at all. It's amazing a human can survive without a spine eh Sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy other Sister nods and says \"It was sort of like a wakeup call, all that torture and we realise something. We put you through that, but for much longer. And we know that our Mother is to blame for that, but in the end our actions are also to considered our own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose then chimes in \"We wanted to make things right, and so we've set about finding other women in our school. Who you could say were teetering on the brink towards evil, we shared what happened to us and explained what we had in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nList speaks with \"We've decided to renounce our ways, and try to set about fixing our mistakes and helping those in need! So from now on we're the....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princesses.....\" Erin says, with practised bravado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of.........\" Eliza<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justice!~~\" Rose and Carla says at the same time, the group then get close to each other and smile and make poses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've got this dumpfounded look on my face, Viva and Vogue have incredulous looks. And Matt is frowning, but smirks as he considered the harsh punishments. Although Lisa then walks forward and takes a picture out of her dress pocket. \"Viva and Vogue yeah? Could you give this to Chon please? Tell em I'm thinking of him please~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe picture isn't crude, it looks really good actually. There's a couple of small x's on the right corner, I don't know what to think but Viva takes the picture and says \"Sure, but there's a reason we were here.....\"</span></div></div>",

She made a dramatic pose with the others following. \"Go in peace and rid yourself of that curse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we all left my sister's dorm, Matt shook his head, looking perplexed. \"Your sisters are weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, still dumbfounded by my sisters new looks and attitude. \"We better report to Dean Elvira.\" Softly, I said. \"If this cure all potion will rid you of the curse, it is worth looking into.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinutes later, after speaking with Dean Elvira, she sighed. \"Yes, the cure all potion would rid you of that curse, young man.\" Gravely, she said. \"However, there is one problem.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryan's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am currently sitting in my dorm room, typing up on an essay due by the end of this week. Things have been so hectic thus far, that there is cause for concern when it comes to my studies. The important folk in the little supernatural world we live in seems to be fond of getting me and my friend's to do favours for them, to the point where they disregard the fact that we are still students. The subject I'm doing here is magical history, but that is something me and my team excel at. Mostly Jenny and Chon, Jenny has been intrigued by the origins of her race. The Neko's, witches that are half human and half cat. How they were made has been lost to the ages, but my girl is still hoping to find leads. So she's writing about them and their biology in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon meanwhile is writing about the dangers of magic, something that he is very familiar with. To say that Chon dislikes magic is an understatement, he outright hates it. We're talking burn the witch levels, he doesn't talk about it much. He lost a family member due to it, that much I do know. But he is my friend, and so I trust him. Since taking Viva and Vogue in though he seems to be less spiteful about it, to the point where he admitted that it can be useful from time to time. But still it was very dangerous in his eyes, or lack thereof. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe it's the war in the 90's, my Father seemingly died during it. So perhaps in doing this I might learn about him, Mom didn't speak of him all that much. Or about magic and her role in the war in general, she was keeping something from me. I could tell from how she acted, a sombre tone and hesitance. I love her though, and I know that she has her reasons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalfway through it though the VA system shouts out loudly with \"Ryan Carlson and John Doe, please proceed to the infirmary ASAP!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the Dean's voice, what did she want now? She wanted Light there too, the general populace saw Light as a student with no recollection of who he was. Better that way. It must have been important if Elvira was calling us rather than using the secretary. Light poked his head into my room and silently looked at me, I curse under my breath and save my work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any idea want the chick wants?\" Light mutters to me as we make our way to the infirmary, he's just as clueless as me right now. This better not be long, I want to continue my essay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No clue, let's get it over with.\" I respond, we moved quickly. Didn't want Jenny to be worried now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough we head to the infirmary, and it's quite bustling. It usually is, concerning the sorts of magical mishaps and other things. One time Charlie's Sisters were sent here after Chon beat the pair of them up, to the point where they may have had to move to a bigger hospital. But that was then and this was now, we spot Elvira and she motions for us to join her. We walk towards her and says \"Light, Ryan. Please prepare yourselves for a shock......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe say nothing and she carries on with \"Light you know of the alternate world yes? That exists from the other side of the rift. We found your equal from there, less than an hour ago she was saved from her testing facility. And currently she is being treated urgently, that said please take a look at her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat?! Okay I know of the world beyond the rift, it's just like ours but with science being the superpower rather than magic. Chon would love that place to be sure, are you seriously telling me though there is a version of Light that is female? I'm guessing she uses science or something, but I simply state \"Very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight is unusually quiet right now, this must be a shock to him. Still he's not showing it, which is good because that might be needed. He nods to Elvira and she takes us to a quiet door and we peer through a window at a woman on an operating table, she's beautiful! Her height is at least 6 foot but still shorter than Light, she has elegant blonde hair that could easily rival that of the Harrison Sisters. Her breasts are at least D cup, bigger than Jenny's at least. She is covered in bandages though, and the doctors are already proceeding to continue working on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had to operate on her quickly, somehow she doesn't seem to be able to regen from wounds the same way you can Light. Perhaps your creators were more brutal in creating you.....We decided to call her Jane Doe.\" Elvira mutters softly as we stand and watch as this woman is being healed, the plot thickens</span></div></div>",

I could imagine how the two top students of Eligere Sententia could rain hell on any facility with their mad scientific might. Still, they brought the girl in heavily damaged and I could not help wonder if any reckless actions on their part caused that result.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From the report I got from Juan, her captors were torturing her.\" Frowning, Elvira said. \"She was a mess when they breached their defenses. Tex went completely berserk and rained hell upon her captors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight and I exchanged concerned looks then turned to Elvira who slowly nodded. \"There is no one left alive in that facility to question.\" Annoyed, she said. \"Here I thought Chon was a loose cannon with his bloody history...\" She shook her head. \"I want you two to keep Tex away from that girl, am I clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight nodded but remained silent. Only I had to ask, \"Why? What has he done?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The facility jumped into our world when they attacked!\" Fiercely, Elvira snapped. \"It was clearly in our jurisdiction! He is meddling in our affairs and I will not have it!\" She sighed. \"Don't get me wrong, gentlemen; Tex Moray has fine qualities but he does not understand or care to understand the meaning of off limits. He is going to eventually do something he can not undo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must run in the family.\" Muttering, Light spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira nodded. \"I must agree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of your son, Juan?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira shook her head. \"He will be busy cleaning the school toilets for the next few weeks for taking on a dangerous mission without my knowledge or consent.\" Serious, she said. \"I could have lost him and I will be making that clear to him in this punishment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Tex walks?\" Annoyed, Light inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira cracked a grin. \"I allowed his twin sister to deal with 'her'.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight cracked a grin as did I. Knowing Jessica, Tex would find 'herself' going back to primary school for the next semester. Elvira then gave us a pass to see Jane Doe and excused us. We walked to recovery and found Jane already slowly waking up. She looked around, startled, then locked eyes upon Light who was returning her gaze. Both seemed rather in a trance until Jane finally spoke. her voice was soft, melodious, like that of a morning bird's song.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are- Are you my brother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight had the hint of a blush on his cheeks but shook it off before it was really noticed. He replied in a soft but clear voice. \"Well... yeah, close enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane looked down at the sheets covering her bandaged body. \"The calm boy and the wild boy told me that I had a brother but I found it hard to believe.\" Tearfully, she said. \"Why did such a brother not come to rescue me when I was having needles jabbed into me... when I was being beaten until my bones showed through my flesh....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I went through the same nightmare.\" Firmly, Light replied. \"Only in a different place, a different world all together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane turned to Light, horrified. Tears streamed down her face though it was clear she was struggling to hold them back. Light nodded, seeing her emotions. \"Ryan rescued me from that hell; we are like brothers, family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One Juan Smith and his insane friend rescued me.\" Sadly, Jane said. \"Only Juan said he will have no one follow him because he does not deserve it.\" She gave a hiccup like laugh. \"The crazy one... who would want to follow that lunatic?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight and I chuckled with Jane soon following. At least we all had one thing in common, we agreed Tex was a lunatic. Only I suspected his female form was more stable. I remembered John Harrison telling me in one of his letters that witch boys who have a twin sometimes become mentally unstable due to the gender war within them. I had a feeling this was the case with Tex Moray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can follow us.\" Suddenly, Light offered. \"I know what you went through; I know we can help you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane nodded, tears now falling freely. \"I vow myself to you... twin brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jon.\" Smirking, Light said. \"Just call me Jon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Light sat down with me doing the same. We still needed to question her. \"What can you tell us about your captors?\" Firmly but politely, light asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you tell us how Juan and Tex helped you escape?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane sighed then spoke...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's just I've not had the chance to eat some proper food for a while....\" Jane muttered, she moved one of her bandaged hands to rub her bare navel. She then nibbles on her lower lip, I frown a bit. She's dodging the question, it seems that unlike Light she knows a bit of subtlety. That said though her belly does produce the noise one knows is a signal of hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you wanting?\" Light says, he's not understood she's not answering the question. Despite his name he can be pretty damn dim-witted at times, it's fine though right now. At least Jane isn't tearing things apart or anything like that, pretty sure even Light would have a hard time keeping her down if she did that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something hot please, nurse can I have a couple of burgers?\" Jane said, I notice her eyes light up as she says that. She must not have gotten proper food or anything like that when she was growing up, the nurse nods and says \"We'll have some in the microwave for you. Gentleman would you like some?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've eaten thanks.\" I say, the sooner this is done the quicker I can get back to my report. And then tell my dorm mates about this, no doubt Jane will end up moving in with us. Light shakes his head and the nurse proceeds to ready a couple of those rustler burgers, the ones that are stick in and wait then eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take the time to speak more, I smirk before muttering to Light \"Your twin's pretty stacked.\" I make sure not to actually take advantage of the fact that Jane's breasts are only concealed by some bandages. Damn, I wonder if Jenny can have ones that are bigger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I need to focus! There's gonna be plenty of time for magically enhanced/hormonally induced sexy stuff later. The nurse comes back with both burgers on a plate, Jane promptly wolfs it down. Light didn't really understand my innuendo, as I said he's kinda dumb. But he smiles and says \"You eat as fast as I do Jane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman doesn't speak, it's clear she's fixated on her burgers. Something tells me that Jane wasn't fed properly, then how did she become so damn tall and well...formed? Probably a lot of syringes and drugs and shit. Jane is done in quick order, and licks her fingers before sighing happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I'm ready for questions!\" Jane says in a very upbeat tone, she's turned around now. Perhaps after having this food which to her is a treasure has made her more susceptible to our requests. Good for us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the people that created you, they're the same that made me right?\" Light begins, smooth pal. No gently wading in at all, I resist the urge to facepalm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane winces, but she thinks on it. And eventually says \"I think so, when the people who made me were close to my door. And I pretended to be sleeping, they would talk about something that failed. It was hushed whispers, like it didn't go very well for them. I know now they talked about you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell we're somewhere now. \"So at the very least it's gotta be some of the people that made Light also had a hand in what happened to you.\" I mutter with folded arms, Light must have killed a few of them on his way out the base. But still he didn't get everyone, all he focused on was escaping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was there any mention of anyone in charge? Someone calling the shots?\" Light said, he's on the right track. If we can narrow this down somehow.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They.....spoke of a couple of people.\" Jane states, some fear in her voice. She swallows it though and says \"They mentioned the names Elena Kurse and someone called Zed. I think there was the mention of someone called Samantha too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat alerts me. Samantha Forrester?! She's related to the Harrisons isn't she? She's supposed to be a borderline rogue witch, and a prime target for Chon's anger. Has she gone turncoat? No probably not, she's got nothing to gain from it. Elena Kurse and Zed we already know, but Elena has been declared dead for over a year and Zed is nowhere near England as far as we're aware. Still we've got leads now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, we know those people. It's worth checking at least.\" I mutter with a nod to Jane. I get an idea, Lunar might have been created by that pair. Perhaps she can do some internal search or something like that, or perhaps we should adopt a wait and see approach. See if those who made Jane come for their prize, either way Jane will probably end up staying in our dorm for protection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seeing this caused me to frown only Juan shrugged it off. \"Mom told me to wash every last rest room in Starmage.\" Calmly, he said. \"She did not limit my resources as to how to accomplish this.\" He sighed. \"Besides, I must keep an eye on Tessie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raised a single eyebrow. \"Who is Tessie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tex's female persona.\" Frowning, Juan replied. \"Tex is becoming alarmingly unstable. His actions at the facility proves that without any doubt. His female persona is far more stable.\" He sighed. \"However...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His grandfather?\" Guessing correctly, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuan nodded. \"He has forbidden anyone to permanently change his gender until he can look into the matter himself.\" Frustrated, Juan said. \"I fear that the gender war within him has begun. If neither gender wins, he will fall into complete insanity...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, knowing that Juan and Tex were like brothers. \"I'll see if I can learn anything from dean Elvira.\" Serious, I said. \"Perhaps former dean Tanaka knows something as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I left Juan to his duties and reported to the dean's office. Once inside, I saw that she was not alone; she was having a meeting with former dean Tanaka and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I was surprised that she was not sulking or worse fuming at her new situation. In fact, she seemed rather pleased. I turned to Elvira with a raised eyebrow to which she sighed while Mr Tanaka merely nodded respectfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Carlson, this is Tex Moray's true form.\" Calmly, Elvira explained. \"Her father wanted more sons than he had daughters so she was made a he.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, the transformation was unstable.\" Serious, Tanaka said. \"This is what led to his violent  psychotic episode at the facility. Had we not intervened, Tex would have gone rogue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis confused me. \"They why was her mother trying to change Matt's gender?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt is going to change the instant puberty strikes, nothing will prevent that.\" Sadly, Elvira replied. \"With that said, they tried to return Tex to his original form but, as it was unstable...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They needed an other world power to do the job.\" Frowning, Tanaka finished. He shook his head, sighing. \"Even mad scientist must live and learn...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira motioned to the short and slender raven haired girl standing next to her. \"Tex is no more.\" Softly, she said. \"Please say hello to Tessie Moray; Tess for short.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a pleasure to meet you, sir.\" Politely, Tess said. \"I do apologize for my male form's ill-behavior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTessie's voice was soft and sweet, like that of a small child. However, I could feel power behind it, she was a formidable witch like her twin sister. I merely nodded at her in response then conveyed the information I managed to get out of Jane Doe to Elvira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not good.\" Frowning, Elvira said. \"Elaina Kruse and Zed Brawl are notorious criminals on both sides of the spectrum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We suspected they were the master minds behind the Light Killer project.\" Darkly, Tanaka said. \"Now we have confirmation they are the leaders of both projects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will inform Elvira Strange.\" Grabbing the telephone, Elvira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will contact Devlin Moray.\" retrieving a strange cellphone from his jacket, Tanaka stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Elvira waited for the head witch to answer, she motioned me to take Tessie out of the room. I complied and led Tessie back to her dorm to meet her sister, Jessica. On the way, I met up with Jenny who smiled upon seeing me. Upon seeing Tessie, she threw me a questioning look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryan's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI entered the Dean's office, and I waste no time in frowning at the third person in the room. Samantha Forester, the bitch is here of all places! Mr Tanaka is there, with his trademark native American facepaint and stern expression. The guy's in his 50's, but he's knotted with muscle and carries himself with authority. Rumours state that he has power from his ancestors, and can speak with them to gain advice and insight into situations. Hopefully that might come in handy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira's there, no surprise. She looks at me and states \"Ah Carlson, we were expecting you. Please come in.\" I only nod and close the door behind me, all the while staring at Samantha. I know about this woman, and I do not trust her. Not for a single second, the shit's she's done. Doesn't bare thinking about, Chon would kill her if he could get the chance. In fact he spoke about one time where he nearly managed to actually do that. And I'm pretty sure that the feeling is mutual there, I make my displeasure known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Samantha Forester, Jane spoke of you.\" I muttered with my arms folded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe simply smirks at me. \"Why hello there Carlson, Elvira speaks highly of you. And Chon too, how is that angry little fool?\" she states, damn Carla and Rose would really get along with this broad. The fact that she's here in the Dean's office is the only reason I'm not trying to pick a fight with her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peace both of you. Samantha is here to assist us in our investigation into the creators of Jane and John Doe.\" Elvira says, pff yeah right. She's just here to cover her ass, something like this could finally put this bitch behind bars. And maybe get with her old pals again in the shower too.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her blood was taken from her by force, Samantha claims that she was attacked and pinned down in the middle of the night.\" Tanaka states while looking at her. Is his ancestors giving him any chance of checking to see if the woman's lying or not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true Carlson, the only way they could have invaded my house like that is they knew me well enough. Case in point Elena Kurse, she's the only one that we know is in charge of the magic side of things. And she knows me the most out of all the noteworthy rogues, if I had to bet anything I'd wager she's behind constructing Light.\" Samantha says, she doesn't look like she's lying. But I know her and so does Chon, she's only in this to save her own neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zed is probably the one who bred Light with the resources from Elena and vice versa when it comes to Jane, he's probably gone into hiding since that botch though. He might turn on Elena for fear she'll do the same. Samantha your blood was probably used to augment Light's power.\" Elvira says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now?\" I ask. I'm getting tired of debating, we need action. Or at least a plan to put things into action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No doubt Elena and Zed are feeling desperate, they may just attempt a direct attack on this school. Playing to the fact that there are children present. The school is going to be on lockdown, and the majority of students will be evacuated to another school. Once we get word of this event of course.\" Elvira says as she makes her way to the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will consult my ancestors, their sprits can patrol the grounds and alert me to attacks. Carlson once Jane is medically cleared she will be moving into your dorm, that's the safest place for her at this moment in time.\" Tanaka says as he promptly begins applying paint to his face and wrists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod and merely glare at Samantha, I still don't trust her. If she is a turncoat I'll kill her in a heartbeat if Chon doesn't get there first. But for now I have bigger concerns, namely making sure Jane got enough room in our dorm. She was a big girl after all, she'd tower over Jenny and the others. Hell she's taller than me!</span></div></div>",

This was at least the size of Light, she was going to need it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod and stick it under my arm and said \"Anything else that we need to discuss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira shakes her head and replies with \"Not at present, I doubt the enemy will attack so soon after losing. They'll probably wait and gather their forces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain I simply nod, and I walk towards the infirmary. Jane's still there thank God, I was kinda worried she'd make a runner after all of that. She tilts her head at my approach and notices the clothing under my arm and responds with \"I've never seen an outfit like that before, I take it that's the required clothing for women in this school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You catch on quick, stick this on and join me outside. Your going to be staying at your Brother's dorm, we're uni gender you see.\" I say as I put the clothing on the bed, Jane proceeds to stand up. I make sure to look away, she's got a really really good figure. Not to mention the only things covering her body is some bandages, with those bouncing breasts barely restrained by them.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane wordlessly starts to change, and I wait outside. Light's Sister then steps out in her uniform, she's wearing brown shoes with black socks that go up to the ankle. With a red and yellow tartan skirt, she's wearing the black with red stripes uniform coat. A white shirt and red tie, she looks pretty messy though. Something tells me that Jane's not had the chance to dress well in her experimentations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready to go.......\" Jane mutters. I say nothing, merely nod and motion for her to follow me. After a short walk we reach our dorm and open the door, I let her in first. Chon sees her and then raises an eyebrow at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get everyone ready. We need to have a talk.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blind man nods and does so, we're all in the main room. Taking seats, once the silence is present I take a deep breath and then motion to Jane next to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone this is Jane, she'll be moving in with us. She's a Sister of Light so to say, the same people who made him made her later.\" I say, everyone knows what happened to Light anyway. Best to get this over and done with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane nods and then politely bows, I realise that Jane's not wearing a bra there. Elvira didn't include one with those clothes, we're going to need to sort that later. \"Hello, I hope to not be a burden with all of you. Though that may end up happening, no doubt those that made me will come. Intent on trying to reclaim their property.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that happens we'll be fine, your forgetting that this academy is home to several powerful people. They won't have it easy at the very least.\" Chon says, he's rather calming about this too. Usually he can be rather abrasive with people before he warms up to them, maybe it's because of Jane's relation to Light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunar is oddly silent though, she's looking at Jane. And then suddenly says \"If it's any consolation everyone I have detailed records of our creators, so I will be able to tell you their weaknesses when battle is upon us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all smile and laugh at that, Jane smiles a little before saying \"Shall I retire for the evening?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want, tomorrow we'll make sure you get some proper clothes. Your going to need them.\" I say as I lean on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day.........</span></div></div>",

To help uncover more about his origins I believe, a magical familiar is something I would abhor. But I will admit having something that powerful in my team is a wise thing, moreso considering he could buff my daughters in terms of magical power. They are already very proficient, they would be even better and their safety is all secured thanks to that magical bonding ceremony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am about to partake in some noodles, one of those add hot water and stir sort of things. When Jane walks towards me, I have to crane my neck up high to look at her. How did this woman get so damn tall? Must have been the genetics or something, she does look a lot better though. Her uniform is neatly done now, Jenny fussed over it this morning and Jane just stood there and let her do it. Although I'm a bit concerned that she's walking alone though, given what's happened recently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chon?\" Jane asks, titling her head to the side like a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" I respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those who made me had spoken of you, the blind vengeance. They feared you and what you do, I feel assured that I'm in the same dorm as you. I feel safer.\" She says and then gives a small bow to me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lift an eyebrow and smile a little \"Oh? Well thanks, as long as you sleep soundly.\" I say in reassurance. Girl's been through a lot, least I can do is make her feel better mentally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough this quiet little conversation is cut short by a group of people arriving, it's some chi signatures that I know quite well. The Ren twins and their new little group, I can tell how people look based on their chi. And those outfits and the hair, oh god I have never seen anything so gaudy in my life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/fandomofprettycure/images/4/43/Princess-form.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140517083706\" target=\"_blank\">http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/fand...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose has the pink hair fittingly, Carla is the blue one. They really went overboard with this. The other girls I know of, I keep it a matter of principle to keep track of every borderline rogue witch in Starmage just in case. Eliza is the blonde one, she's a cheerleader of some controversy. I once heard she sleeps with jocks and then dresses them in girl clothing while they sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErin is the orange one, the pair of us have come to scrapes in the past. She talks a big game but that's about it, I gave her a good few hits and she crumpled. I don't like her, that's the nicest thing I can say about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the last one is Lisa with the green hair, she's supposed to be some sort of artist. But all she's done is try to stick lewd pictures that are animated with magic on the backs of boys and girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great.....\" I mutter. Quickly eating my noodles and wiping my mouth after it. Jane stays where she is, an eyebrow lifted in confusion. It seems that the girls were interested in Jane in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there Chon!\" Rose says in a very chipper tone, I say nothing but merely nod with my arms folded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be the new student! Jane right?\" Carla says with her hands under her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane looks at me perplexed then to Carla, and looks all the colourful girls up and down. Before saying \"Um yes that's me....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose smiles at Jane and then says \"Let us introduce ourselves, we're the princesses of justice! Dedicated to setting things right where they went wrong!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bite my lower lip lightly, to avoid breaking into laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We heard about what happened with you, your John's Sister right?\" Carla says, fuck did they find out already? Word really, really travels fast. Jane's makers might already know where she is right now.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane's eyes go wide, but she nods. Rose walks close, and the height difference is apparent. Rose is about 5'5 odd I think, Jane's well over 6 foot. \"Well we'd like to say welcome to Starmage! My name's Rose and the blue girl is Carla, and our friends here are Lisa, Eliza and Lisa.\" she says pointing to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm silent here, I don't like this. But I wait. Jane pauses and then says \"Didn't you treat Charlie like my makers did? He warned me about you.......\" she then leans forward, making Rose seem even smaller than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose then sighs and has a sad look on her face \"Yes we did, but after suffering like he did we learned what it felt like. So me and my Sis found these other girls and we swore to make up for our misdeeds!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls then form up behind her and assume what can only be described as a power rangers pose, complete with magic that is being used to make them look more dramatic on purpose. I can sense it. Carla then says \"Don't worry Jane. We! The princesses of justice vow to aid in making sure you are safe and secure, we can draw on our knowledge of rogue witches to take them down if need be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah right, those girls can't magic themselves out of a paper bag. Rose and Carla are self taught by their Mother, whereas Hayley and Mel at least went to a magic school. I'm neutral through this, Jane tilts her head in thought. Before cheerfully smiling and saying \"Okay! Well if you want to help that's great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose then smiles and says \"You can count on us! Let's give a huh girls.\" and the five of them crowd around Jane and hug her. But given her impressive height she's still showing, it's like the santa elves hugging Mrs Claus!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter this Lisa then walks up to me with her hands behind her back, I size her up and down as she bites her lower lip. \"Well?\" I ask her simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa then stammers out with \"I-I made a drawing of you Mr Chon, I w-was wondering if you'd accept it please. I was thinking of you....\" she then shows what she was holding. I can tell what it is, a drawing of me. She's done it while taking into account my enhanced senses, I can feel the attention to detail she's done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy fingers also detect the two little x's she's put at the edge of the picture. I give a small smile and say \"Thank you, this is very well done.\" Lisa simply bows, and I can swear there's a blush on her cheeks. But I don't comment on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater......</span></div></div>",

The dean turned, surprised while everyone jumped to their feet to see the two girls drag out Helena Young! The vile rogue witch was Viva and Vogue's biological mother! How the hell did she escape witch prison?! She was armed with two black magic control collars which she had used to control her daughters in the past. Viva and Vogue turned pale, seeing them only to relax as Rose and Carla expertly pried them from Helena's grasp, tossing them into a garbage can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unhand me, you ungrateful turncoats!\" Furious, Eva screamed. \"They are my daughters! I will not allow them to abandon their family name!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is you who abandoned them!\" Face planting Helena to the floor, Rose countered. \"You lost them forever a long time ago!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once they are bonded, you will lose all of your ill gotten wealth as well!\" Producing a glowing rope, Carla hissed. \"They are not your daughters, you have no right to be here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelena fought ferociously with everything she had. Being stripped of her magic power, she turned to a set of daggers of which she used to badly cut both girls before finally being subdued. The two battered girls firmly held the rogue witch between them, forcing her to see her former daughters standing at the alter. \"Kiss him already!\" Annoyed, Rose demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That way you will be protected by <i>both</i> our families!\" Gruffly, Carla chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva and Vogue, although stunned, kissed Charlie on each cheek. It had been done, the three were magically bonded. Helena screamed in outrage as Rose and Carla dragged her to the front doors of the church where Chon and Light opened the doors. There, the rogue hunters took Helena from their hands before the church doors were closed again, silencing Helena's cursing screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was a twist.\" Stunned, I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Predators are known to defend their hunting ground.\" Darkly, Tanaka pointed out. \"Rose and Carla know that once bonded to Viva and Vogue, Charlie will possess vast wealth as well as great power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frowned deeply at that as it was a valid point. With his power and his girlfriends' wealth, he has become an even greater prize for his two sisters. However, as much as it pained me, I could not jump to conclusions. For now, Rose and Carla actually did the right thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon turned to the two quasi rogue students and bowed respectively towards them. \"You have just taken your first small step towards regaining your honor.\" Solemnly, he stated. He rose, giving thew girls a look of warning. \"It is a long road... do try not to stumble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is a longer road to regain Charlie's trust.\" With a dramatic bow, Rose replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A road that is all up hill.\" Mirroring the bow, Carla added. \"Still, it is a journey worth taking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls then left quietly. Once the doors were closed again, Charlie shook his head. \"Give them the academy award  for worst acting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone snickered; the ceremony ended on a good note.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Rubbing it with my hand I say \"Sis, we really messed up didn't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response Carla looks down at the floor and pauses before replying with \"I've been feeling that for a while. Since Dex told us about that info.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, that guy was a shit head. I think meeting him was a wakeup call. If even we didn't like him.\" I say, grabbing some water from our mini fridge and take a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving a nod to me Carla says \"I also saw how that Ryan guy treats Charlie, way better than we ever did. I don't know why but he just seems so happy now, like happier than he ever was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know why, it was because of us. We could just blame Mom for it all. But we could have done something different, not be like her.\" I say, rubbing my forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla gives me a hug, I accept it. I always do, I can count on her to lean on if I need it. But then it hits me like a stack of bricks. Charlie, we never hugged him. I can't recall it even once. I shiver as the realisation goes through me. I mutter this to Carla. She tightens her hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We didn't. He didn't deserve a thing we did and found comfort from those he knew far less than us, they did a far better job we ever did.\" she mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's so true, Carla lets go and says \"But today. We did the right thing, I know they probably just think we did it for the sake of being closer to a power source. But I've felt this for a while. Maybe we can get a second chance Sis, we're able to take it and be our own people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's right. We can. \"But how?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting our hands to our chins we think, can we do it? \"We need to make amends, sit down with them. Do things to prove our words.\" Carla says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get an idea, we saw Chon give the V girls a DVD of Sailor Moon one time. I'm familiar with it, magical girls that fight evil. I thought it was stupid, we use magic but we don't go around in those outfits......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's become heroes.\" I say. Carla looks at me and I say \"Use our powers for good, look the part. Prove we're willing to change not just our actions but our attires.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts an idea. Carla snaps her fingers and states \"We could probably do with some help on this. There's other problem students in this school, maybe we can reach out to them too.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile, properly. \"It sounds like we've got a plan, its late now. We should probably go to bed, tomorrow we'll start to make amends for real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla nods and goes to leave, but she pauses and says \"What if Charlie doesn't accept us? Even after all we do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm silent. But I say \"All we can do is try. I'll be fine with just that if it means we no longer upset him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day.....</span></div></div>",

I wake up and there's Viva and Vogue, with beaming smiles. Viva is holding a tray with plates of food, they are already dressed for the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning love!\" Viva said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We made you breakfast! You just lay right there, and enjoy.\" Vogue said. Wow, I didn't expect them to do something like that. There's no school on today, weekend. And I don't recall any work needs to be done, but if there is then it can wait. Right now I'm in bed, with my two new girlfriends having just made food for me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile and look at what they made, it's mostly Chinese stuff. Noodles and all that, no doubt stuff Chon taught them. You might not think that a blind guy can be so good at cooking, but Chon says that it's because of stuff like that he is so adept at cooking. I guess that kinda makes sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take the tray of food off of Viva's hands, and set it on my lap. \"Thanks a lot girls, this means a lot to me.\" I say with a warm smile. I mean it too. Never had anything like this happen to me before, a blush is on my cheeks. I can tell from their reactions, they both slightly giggle. Waking up, and knowing that they will be one of the first things that I shall see makes me feel so at ease. I feel blessed. Both of our Mothers were rouge witches who didn't care for us, and we found comfort and solace in Chon and Ryan. Two people that I owe my life too, and Viva and Vogue. Two girls that care for me deeply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly as I move to start eating Viva says \"Charlie wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look up, did I do something wrong? Just as I'm about to speak Viva grabs some chopstick and wraps some noodles around it, and brings it close to my mouth. \"Say ah.\" Viva said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs she serious?! I blink a few times and start blushing even more. \"Sister I want to feed him! Give me those chopsticks!\" Vogue said as she went in to move and intercept Viva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Sis I'm first! Say ah Charlie, you might want to blow on it first though cause we just made it.\" Viva said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Viva!\" Vogue said, the pair are looking at each and glaring daggers at one another. Oh this is not good, I can see a thunderbolt go from one eye to the next. I better do something to calm them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly take the chopsticks and eat the food on it, and yep it's hot. I quickly swallow it and say \"It's great! I'm so happy that the pair of you made this, just for me!\" if I praise both of them then they'll redirect their focus onto me. And hopefully my room won't be torn apart by Chon's daughters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh why thank you dear.\" Viva said putting cupping her head with both hands and tilting her head to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love was an ingredient!\" Vogue said as she leaned on the bedframe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat worked, and sure enough they are both focusing on me. That's good, and I need to start talking.<br>\r\n\"So we doing anything for today?\" I ask before I start eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we could start looking into your power Charlie, there should be some books that we could take out the library.\" Viva said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVogue chimed in by saying \"You could also join us later for when we do training with Chon, I hear Ryan's got a couple of gifts for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile, everything is on the up. Who knows my Sisters might even be trying to really turn over a new leaf. I still remember the big party we had, where Viva kissed me with cake on her lips. Followed right after with Vogue wiping it off of me with a napkin, ah the best times are still ahead though!</span></div></div>",

I'm done being useless, the tagalong kid that was only there because he had been taken in. Now I was going to be useful, I wanted to help and I could at last do something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI should learn more about my new powers as a familiar, but I want to be something else other than just supporting my girlfriends. I want to fight too, I don't want to be a spineless little kid anymore. My Sisters....I'm still not sure, just because they did one good thing doesn't mean I can just up and forgive them for all the abuse I had over the years at their hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think in the future I might become a spokesperson for witch boys, some might have even had it worse than me. The thought makes a chill go down my spine, Chon had a point when he lambasted magic in general. Although he made exceptions to that, like his daughters and Jenny for example.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I'm wearing a blindfold now, with Viva and Vouge guiding me by my hands. I trust them though, they wouldn't lead me astray. I hear birds chirping nearby, that must mean we are outside. And then we stop and my blindfold comes off, and we are at a place I've never seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://images.travelpod.com/users/tcellucci/1.1278192908.gladiator-training-grounds.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://images.travelpod.com/users/tcellu...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is where we train Charlie.\" Viva said, I then saw what they were wearing. It was dark red monk robes, Viva had no sleeve on her left and Vogue had one on her right. I was wearing my Starmage PE outfit, jogging bottoms and all that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan was there with Chon, both had smiles on their faces. \"Alright kiddo I got something for you, check em out!\" Ryan said as he handed me a pair of wooden swords. Ryan and Chon were both wearing red hakamas and were both shirtless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://cdn3.volusion.com/z93az.6qog9/v/vspfiles/photos/SET35\" target=\"_blank\">http://cdn3.volusion.com/z93az.6qog9/v/v...</a>[2]-2.jpg?1421704691<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow thanks Ryan!\" I say as I look them over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then say \"These kinda look like the sword you use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are called Bokkens Charlie, think of them as wooden katana. These ones were made from wood of trees near Mt Fuji, tailormade to fit you. Look at the tips of the blades.\" Chon says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do so, and I see things written on the left tip of the left blade and the right tip on the right blade. \"What does it mean?\" I ask, it's written in something I don't understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Mandarin.\" Viva says as she goes near me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They read Love Viva and Love Vogue.\" Vogue then leans in to peck me on the cheek, I can tell I'm blushing based off of everyone's reactions to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Charlie. I'm gonna be teaching you how to use those things properly. Anyone can swing a blade, but actually hitting it and using it with skill takes proper practise. Let's go.\" Ryan said as he made a motion to have me follow him to another part of the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod and grab the wooden blades in my hands, but before I leave Viva kisses my other cheek and then sticks her tongue out at her Sister. Chon is oddly silent the entire time, perhaps he's quietly assessing me. But regardless it's time for me to start training.</span></div></div>",

With right hand on top due to my right hand being the dominant one, Charlie nods and does the same. Looking me up and down as he does so, he is watching intently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, feel free to keep your limbs loose right now. So you don't cramp up, now with your blade the important thing to know is where your strike will go and where it concludes. Think of it as an extension of your body.\" I state, as I do this I do some light slashes through the air to show this. Charlie is matching my example, he's a quick learner. Perhaps to make up for the lack of education he had from his Mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing this I teach him how to apply the right amount of pressure in a strike, enough to hit the enemy but not enough to damage the blade. After all what's the point of using the blade if it will end up being useless, Asura never breaks. It's got the sprit of a Japanese demon slayer inside of it, when I use the blade the memories of him using the blade flows into my mind. So I can say I'm pretty much an instant expert, but it comes in handy in teaching a kid to use a weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing a few damaged training dummies and some light marks on each other I sit with Charlie as Chon's daughters fight. When I hit Charlie in sparring he didn't even flinch, I thought he'd have panicked. But the kid soldiered on, and perhaps used those mental issues of his to his advantage to fuel his strikes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've done great kiddo. Time goes on you'll learn more things, you'll need to defend yourself.\" I say to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie is quiet, but then he responds with \"Next time can we try a staff?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonder why he wants that, but I smile and say \"Sure thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the training is wrapped up I've had a shower and gotten into my usual Starmage uniform, Jenny walks into my room and says \"Ryan, the Dean wants to have a word with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frown, that's never good. Okay well that bonding ceremony was fun, but still one good apple in the bad bunch.........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she say what it was about?\" I asked, and the answer is....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It concerned another school, not of this world. That was all she said.\" Jenny replies, and that is the answer I expected. I nod and tell her I won't be too long with any luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a brisk walk I make it to Elvira's office, there's talking going on in there. But I knock, there's a silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enter!\" Elvira shouts. I open the door and walk in, it looks as it usually does. That's good, no blasted walls or anything like that. But what concerned me is the person who is in the room with the good Dean, I can't say I've ever seen this person before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/e/e1/Ozpin_ProfilePic.png/revision/latest?cb=20151116164836\" target=\"_blank\">http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah he has arrived, this must be the prodigal student you have told me of Elvira. My name is Ozpin, a pleasure to meet you young man.\" he says as he walks towards me for a handshake. I hesitate a second before I accept it, after a firm shake he nods to me and turns to Elvira.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carlson Mr Ozpin here is a headmaster at a special school.....\" Elvira says with a wry smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lift an eyebrow, this guy looks like a mad scientist. But something about him doesn't match the usual MO, I actually feel intrigued and I show it. \"What school is this?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin smirks and pushes his glasses up the bridge of his nose before saying \"Have you ever heard.....of Beacon Academy?.....\"</span></div></div>",

Your familiar with the fact that there are other worlds beyond your own correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod, Ozpin continues on with \"As you don't know this Academy is from another world, a world that we from it call Remnant. You could say it's a troubled world, there are four kingdoms each in the four directions of a compass. Monsters plague the land, we call them Grimm. Creatures without mercy who kill whatever they can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at Elvira and then to Ozpin before stating \"This sounds bad. How do you handle this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin smirks and continues with \"The world is protected by hunters and huntresses, they posses special powers that enable them to combat various monsters and dangers that present themselves. Beacon Academy is a place where they train and learn to harness their powers better, so that they can become the sword and shield we need.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrm, that sounds akin to our own school here. I mean with regards to protecting others.\" I say, I'll admit I'm interested in this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ozpin is a recent guest here. A group of his students uncovered a portal of sorts from their world it seems, and they entered and arrived not too far from Starmage. Our prefects intercepted them and their headmaster quickly arrived, we've been parleying for quite some time. Mr Ozpin your world looks like it could do with aid, we'd be more than happy to give it.\" Elvira says with a smile as she walks up to us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm? Is the group of students here?\" I inquire. I don't know why but I'm actually feeling pretty excited. I mean I'm mostly used to the supernatural, but this sounds interesting<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin nods and says \"Yes, in fact you might have passed them without knowing it on your way to this room. Let's bring them in shall we Ms Elvira?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dean nods, and Ozpin turns his head to the door and says \"You may enter Team RWBY.\"</span></div></div>",

The one in front catches me eye right away, she's a bit shorter than the other girls. But it's the outfit and her silver eyes. A black blouse, a cincher with red lace and a skirt with red trim. Topped off with a red cloak, she's wide eyed and sees me and gives a big wave. \"Hi there, my name's Ruby. Pleased to meet ya!\" she says. Ruby? But that Ozpin guy just said.....ah nevermind. That's probably confusing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to her is a girl that is also very eye catching, she's a bit older by I'd say about two years. That long white hair, the bolero and skirt and boots all a mixture of white and blue and red. It's all very, very elegant. I've not seen a woman with dress style like that, something tells me she's grown up doing that. The way she's done her hair disrupts the symmetrical style of her clothing though, she gives a polite wave and states \"Are you Ryan Carlson? I'm Weiss Schnee.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod in response and reply \"I see, you and your friends have me at a disadvantage here. Nevertheless a pleasure to meet you.\" Mom gave me lessons to be polite to new people. Weiss smiles slightly in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next girl I make eye contact with, she has amber coloured eyes that seem to pierce through things. Wavy black hair, a black buttoned vest with coattails. A white shirt under it reveals her midriff, black shorts and a scarf. Low heeled boots and stockings, and a black bow on her head. She nods to me and says \"Hello, I'm Blake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI give a polite nod, but I focus on her bow. I could swear that thing just moved. But I don't comment on it, Blake probably caught on but now's not the time for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly there's a girl with some very beautiful blonde hair, probably better than that of the Harrison Sisters I'd say. That's not easy. She's got a tan vest over a yellow crop top with some black ink on the left of it. A brown belt with black shorts under it. There's an orange scarf around her neck, tan boots and yellow wristbands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo, the name's Yang. Your in this school right? You a wizard?\" Yang gives me a grin, I lift an eyebrow in response and give a small chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pleasure.\" I state simply. So this is team RWBY huh? Well they certainly look eye catching, I give a smile to them. And then say to Ozpin \"Mr Ozpin what will happen next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin smiles and says \"Well I've talked it over at length with Ms Elvira here, we'd like to help ensure good relations between our schools and to a greater extent our worlds. As you know of our current state any support would be much welcomed, but we'd like to do a trial run of sorts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby chimes in with \"What do you mean sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe head of Beacon Academy pushes his glasses up and then says \"Girls your still students, as it happens so is Ryan here. Do you see what I'm getting at here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, exchange students?\" Yang says with intrigue in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct. And we've decided that for one week each we will have students from Beacon Academy attend Starmage and vice versa. Team RWBY, Carlson you and your friends will have the tremendous honour of ensuring positive relations with our world and Remnant. As for who attends first, well Ryan what do you think?\" Elvira says as she drums her fingers on the desk, moving her hand to a stack of papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a lot to take in, it's said that those who create history often don't realise they're doing it when it occurs. That's a crock of shit I think, I know that this could be crucial. Elvira never lies or jokes about stuff like this, she might have another motive just like Ozpin.

Weiss looks at Ruby, and the red girl smiles and claps her hands before saying \"You know that sounds good! I'm game for it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss smirks and puts a hand to her chin \"Well I'll admit I'm curious, I wouldn't mind being able to make history by being a student from another world too.\" she states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we're gonna be like what?

Our guests will be staying at your dorm, you'll find that there's been a new room for them.\" Elvira says all without missing a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod to the Dean and Ozpin, he smiles at me and states \"My thanks for taking this burden young man, you can be sure to trust us. This will lead to peace in our time and in future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile back and say \"It's no trouble, if I can help make worlds better then I will. Besides, being in the centre of important events is an odd tendency of mine.\" with that I exit the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you lot in a bit.\" I say as I walk past Ruby and her friends with a small wave, oh boy this is going to be quickly explained to the rest of the gang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was not chuckling madly to himself as he often did. In fact, he seemed down right depressed. I had only known the git for a short while but it did not take a psychic to know something major was on his mind. \"What has you all worked up, Tex Moray?\" Firmly but kindly, I demanded. \"Is it something the prefects need to know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex turned to me, his face holding a dark seriousness. \"My grandfather, Devlin Moray has ordered me to protect a small group arriving from Beacon Academy.\" Softly, he said. \"Many rogue witches and psychotic  scientists alike have attempted to steal magical and technological artifacts from their world during the great secret war.\" He gulped. \"This is a great responsibility that may reap rich benefits for my family...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How did his world find out about this?</i>  I slowly nodded remembering Tex's sister, Jessica telling me his greatest fear was failure. \"You will not be protecting this group alone, Mr. Moray.\" Calmly, I said. \"I and my team will be looking out for them during their stay as well.\" I cracked a small grin. \"Besides, I have a feeling they are more than capable of defending themselves against most threats if witches and mad scientists from our worlds were so very interested in possessing their toys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" Softly, Tex replied. \"However, I have never worked in a diplomatic effort before I and I fear I failed this first attempt miserably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tear fell from his eye and his lip quivered slightly. I could not believe it! The lunatic mad scientist was on the verge of shedding a river of tears over his mistakes during his visit at Starmage! Grant you, he did not make the greatest first impression but I had seen worse failures. Also, he had proven he can be serious when he had to be. \"Everyone makes mistakes, Tex.\" Trying to be comforting, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In my world, we are accountable for every tiny mistake we make as the simplest of error can cascade into a complete disaster.\" Tears falling, Tex said. \"I try to make my family, my world proud of me but in my overzealous drive to do so, I stumble... I can't fail again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed then paused as a voice rang out, \"Cut the drama, you failure phobic buffoon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to find...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Must have been the odd glasses and white hair, now he was talking like one too. Didn't strike me as one to talk like that however, then again I've only known him for a few minutes. And the fact that there's more than another world that's right next to us, with superpowered monster hunters. Damn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex is silent as Ozpin continues with \"Beacon Academy. I know that the danger of being a hunter is something that weighs on their minds. Grimm stalk the lands of Remnant. And I have to help breed and nurture the next generation of protectors. They train years to become warriors, knowing that they may die in doing so or when they have arrived at that point. You, like them when they first arrive assume that knowledge will make you powerful. But that will only take you so far, it will be up to all of us to make that first step to our desired futures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm silent as the head of Beacon Academy gives his speech, it's stuff I mostly know already. But Tex seems to be taking in what the man's saying, paying close attention to his words. Tex then silently nods and says \"I can see what you mean, your land sounds far, far more dangerous than anything we have. I imagine there have been good people lost in your battle against the Grimm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin quietly nods and murmurs \"Failure can lead to one's demise in Remnant, we hunters live with that every single day. But we take our losses, and learn from them. So that we may at least aid those who seek the knowledge they had, and aid them in taking up the torch. Now if you'll excuse me I must attend to team RWBY's travel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he departs, I look at Tex and nod and say \"I'm going to go and get everyone prepared for their arrival, do whatever your here to do.\" I'm off to the dorm now, Jenny might end up having kittens if this all goes to shit. And the worlds might never be the same, on the other hand Remnant sounds like it could use the help. And maybe our world could be peaceful for team RWBY, though with the various people in our academy I doubt they'd relax.</span></div></div>",

But the teachers will be notified of our new students, there going to be moving in shortly with us. And I've explained the whole situation to everyone in the dorm, the kids included. The responses were all various to say the least. Charlie and the V twins expressed amazement at the prospect of another world. Chon as usual was wary, but I can't say I don't blame him. He's the kind to offer one hand, but keep the other armed just in case. Years of hating magic has done that to him, but it comes in handy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunar was intrigued, in her mind there was all sorts of things that she could learn. Her robot mind would learn whatever she could, even if it was simple things like carnival games or the like. Light wanted to know more about the Grimm that infest Remnant, wanted to know if they were strong or not. The guy was created to be a magical WMD, couldn't blame him for wanting to indulge in some fighting. Moreso if it's monsters, he'd do some good. Amy had gotten a look at this team RWBY, and was wondering what they used if they didn't use magic. I was pretty interested myself to be honest, but I think we'll all get along. They seemed to be the same age as us after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny simply smiled, and said she'd stand with whatever I did. That's what I loved about her, that trust she put in me. I wanted to live up to that, I'm standing outside in my Starmage uniform leaning on the wall. And sure enough I clock team RWBY emerging from the nearby forest, the place where I met Light when he was wondering on the grounds. They've got a lot of luggage with them too, well Weiss does. In fact I'd say she's really overpacked. She struck me as the time, the rich girl always does that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hiya!\" Yang says with a nod of the head, she's got two large suitcases with her. Ruby has the same, Blake too. Weiss has.....well......enough to warrant one of those holders from an airport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So is there where we're staying?\" Ruby asks, she's looking around at the other dorms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI give a nod and say \"Yeah school's just up the road, let's get you lot and your stuff in. Need a hand with any of that?\" I stand up off the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang nods and says \"If you don't mind that'd be great, we're exchanging right. Might as well exchange the burdens too!\" I ignore her terrible attempt at a pun and give a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi Light! Give us a hand like!\" I shout inside the dorm, Light emerges out. He's tall at 6ft 9inches, he dips his head under the door frame and gives a nod to the girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, aren't you a tall one!\" Yang says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight merely grunts before saying \"Yeah I'm big, what bout it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI roll my eyes and say \"Nevermind, Light take some bags and let's get them in the room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he grunts and Yang gives the luggage to Light, the big guy simply hefts them on his shoulders and moseys on back into the dorm. Yang's actually a bit surprised by this, I smirk and say \"He's really, really strong. It's one of his many powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang whistles and says \"I'll bet. Ruby you can give big C here your stuff. Blake are you fine?\" the black haired woman simply nods and smiles politely at me. She moves into the dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks a lot.\" Ruby says, I accept her luggage and move in with it. The hallway's become a buzz, Viva pokes her head out of a door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you the new students?\" she says to Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang smiles and says \"Yeppers! Remember not to tell anyone we're aliens, or another world. We come in peace!\" Chon's daughter simply smiles. Blake's nipped past us to stick her luggage into RWBY's room. Weiss is proceeding to gently take one of her luggage bags off the rack, I move forward to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be very, very careful with this. There's a volatile substance in these bags.\" Weiss says in a concerned tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes go wide and I mutter \"What are you talking about? We've got children in here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's called Dust, it's a type of energy we use in Remnant. My style of combat revolves around it, I'm part of a family that has a big stake in dust.\" Weiss says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh and say \"Okay, the pair of us will move it in. Light's strong, but in spite of his name he can be pretty darn dense. Take it you don't want any of this stuff dropped?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss nods and says \"It's happened before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that me and the snow queen set about getting those bags in carefully, thankfully it seems everyone else is out of the hallway for now. After getting the last bag in Weiss says to me \"Thanks for the help, good to see that someone in this world has their head on their shoulders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response I say \"Someone's gotta lead this lot, they're a right bunch. Have you had dinner yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss nods and says \"If you don't mind I'm going to retire for this evening, it's been a long day. I'll just be reading till about 10PM though, so don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, if you or your team need anything just let me know. This is the first time we've had people from a brand new world here, so we'll make sure your at ease.\" I smile after saying that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response Weiss lightly coughs and says \"Thanks that's appreciated, goodbye.\" with that she goes into RWBY's room. </span></div></div>",

I strained my ears to hear the sounds of battle and turned to team RWBY. \"Stay here.\" Firmly but kindly, I said. \"Light and I will investigate this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI motion Light to follow and we ran out towards the woods. We did not have to run far; we spotted Tex and Jessica seemed to be locked in some kind of practice duel. Only it was a new type of duel I had never seen. The two other world visitors were creating monsters and monstrous machines; having them lock horns as they directed them with wild but graceful hand motions like conductors of an orchestra. Jessica conjured a ten foot cyclops made of magical energy that roared before charging Tex. He replied by summoning a robot warrior of pure energy that blocked the path of the cyclops. The ground shook as the two giants locked in a struggle between the two siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to intervene when Ozpin stepped in our path. \"Trust me, you don't want to get in the middle of that duel.\" His voice carried great concern. \"They are using raw magical and chaotic energy; it is very powerful and difficult to control.\" He frowned. \"Energy and matter are interchangeable; those who master this technique can create anything they wish out of their own energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a scary thought.\" Raising an eyebrow, I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin sighed. \"I have lived in their world for a year before joining Beacon Academy.\" Darkly, he said. \"The Moray family spawns the most powerful witches and mad scientists I had ever seen in my lifetime. Tex is very powerful when focused only his fear of failure prevents him from pushing his boundaries.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it he is more comfortable with his sister around.\" Serious, Light said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin nodded. \"Jessica is a powerful witch.\" Softly, he said. \"In fact, she is destined to the her world's next head witch. Only she fears being alone. The two are at their best when they are together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the members of RWBY emerged from the dorm rooms to see what was happening. They all stared at the duel as Tex summoned a horde of helicopter type drones that sped at Jessica with their blades threatening to cut her to ribbons! His sister grinned and responded with a wing of dragons who attacked and destroyed the drones with ease. Again and again, the siblings attacked and countered in turns with each summoning being a different tactic or attack angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to stop this before they destroy each other!\" Concerned, Weiss shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe a distraction will cause them to pause long enough to listen to us.\" Thoughtful, Yang said. \"She then fired a small blast between the two siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang, don't!\" Sternly, Ozpin ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, a small blast would do nothing but make a loud boom. Only when it made contact with the unworldly energies, both exploded!  There was a bright flash that blinded the entire group followed by a thunderous boom that rocked the campus. When I was able to see again a few moments later, I sighed seeing that Tex and Jessica...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And fired what sounded like shotgun pellets, was that her weapon of choice? No matter, my main concern is the huge blast that we were caught in. For a second there I thought that was it, we were all wiped out. But then I find myself lying down on the ground, looking up at the near night sky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly shake my head and lean up, I wiped the smoke and dust off my uniform. These things are like everything resistant, thank God for that. Given the shit I'm usually in I'm thankful for that, means I don't have to pay for new ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone alright?\" I state as I proceed to get back up, I hear various mutterings of yes and other things from everyone.

The hell you talking about?\" Light mutters as he stands up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aura is something all hunters in Remnant posses young man, it is a manifestation of one's soul. The specific abilities differ from one to another, but it can be used to shield oneself and heal wounds. Which is what I've just done with our guests over there.\" Ozpin states while gesturing at Tex and Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAura huh? Sounds interesting. So people having a soul is true? It's no myth! I mean yeah Azura inhabits my sword, but I thought it was a sprit. But maybe it's his soul, I'll need to ask him sometime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then suddenly Weiss folds her arms and said \"Yang what the hell? We could have been blown to kingdom come!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang raises her arms in defence and says \"Hey I just used a normal attack from my Ember Celica. How was I supposed to know it was gonna be ingredient X? I wasn't using my Aura or Semblance with that for the record.\" Semblance? Jeez the terms they're tossing around is kinda going over my head, maybe I should have gone to Beacon first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake sighs and says \"Tex and Jessica was it? Are you alright?\" Damn I can't help but pay attention to those amber eyes, can Jenny do that? I sure hope so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTex grunts and says \"You lot were interrupting some family stress relief! We've had some issues to work through, and for us fighting's the best way to go about it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI step forward and say \"Even so Tex this was done on school grounds, what if those things you summoned went out of control. Or you damaged the wildlife in this area? Your lucky I'm off duty as a prefect, guest from another world or not your ass would be booked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica bites her lower lip, pausing before saying \"Your point is valid Carlson, however the interference of Yang Xiao Long was unwarranted really. Everything was under control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang raised her arm to signify she was going to talk, but Ozpin puts his hand on her shoulder and shakes his head. The blond woman huffs before saying \"Guess we ain't started on the right foot have we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, tell you what. The day's gone on long enough, Yang you and your friends must be feeling tired. Why don't we all just drop this and put it under the bridge?\" Ozpin states to everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Works for me, I'm out.\" Light said as he quickly turned around and made his way back to the dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod and state \"Well no one's injured, I'll be calling it a night. Ruby you and your friends ought to do the same, classes start tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby groans before saying \"But we've just gotten here, can't we get a day to see all the basic things before moving into the swing of things?.\" before giving a small huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm moving back to the dorm and say \"Not my problem.

She will be crowned here at Starmage and be taken back to her world to fill out her new role in life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frowned at that. Sure Jessica was very mature for her age and very patient, having to deal with a brother like Tex. However, she was only thirteen years old! \"With all due respect, dean, isn't Jessica is a bit young to take on such a great responsibility?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree with you but it is not our place to judge them, Ryan.\" Serious, Elvira said. \"Jessica is the new head witch of her world and I expect her to be given the proper send off. Am I clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very clear, dean Elvira.\" Politely, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira ended the call and I sighed placing my phone down. \"Damn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica, who had slept with me that night was awake, looking at me with concern. \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would seem that Jessica is now the head witch in her world.\" Startling her, I replied. \"We need to get everyone together and summon the other prefects. We are expected to see her off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, Jessica slowly walked down a hall on a red carpet towards a stable rift. She was wearing an elaborate but elegant dress straight out of a fantasy story with a number of powerfully built women in police uniforms surrounding her. Walking in front was her brother Tex in a strange suit of armor bearing a strange weapon. My group and I were in dress prefect uniforms standing in a line along the red carpet while Jessica and her brother walked through the rift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tex is carrying what is called a motion control rifle.\" Whispering carefully, Ozpin said. \"It literally stops anything in its tracks and holds it there until a positive motion blast hits it. Perfectly nonlethal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded but kept silent with my eyes forward. Jessica stopped in front of me and gave a sad smile; there were tears forming in her eyes. I knew she was frightened of what awaits her back in her own world. \"Ryan Carlson, would it be okay... I mean may I rely on you for advice if I so feel the need to request it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"I would be honored to assist you any way I can, madam head witch.\" Politely, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica smiled. \"Remember, you are under the protection of my family.\" Loudly, she said. She then touched my forehead, leaving me slightly dizzy for a second. \"If you ever need us, just call our name to any mirror and we will appear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madam head with, we must be off.\" Politely, one of the guards whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica sighed. \"Very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then walked down the red carpet and entered the rip. It immediately closed behind her with a hollow boom; Jessica and Tex had returned to their home world. Jenny looked into my eyes once everyone began to leave the hall and giggled slightly. \"Jessica left you with a magic marker.\" Smiling, she said. \"Normally, I would be dangerously jealous but I think her intention was to allow you to talk to her in her own world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She said to call her name to any mirror.\" Curious, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Witches use mirrors as a form of video phone.\" Amused, Jenny said. \"Mad scientists jumped it up a notch to use them as teleportation devices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their world is as dangerous as your own, Jenny.\" Appearing before them, Elvira said. \"I have no doubt many witches will challenge Jessica's position due to her age. She is in for a rough transition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since classes are dismissed, how about that tour?\" Smiling, Ruby asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed as Jenny giggled slightly. \"This way...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll take you through the places you'll need to know.\" I state, motioning for team RWBY to follow me. Light had guided Lunar and Jane around the school in the past, speaking of which we've not had the chance to introduce everyone. I introduced Jenny to the girls before, I'm next door to the girls and Jenny sleeps with me so it was easy. They've not seen everyone in the gang though. Will need to do that later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So there's another world apart from your own? And ours?\" Blake asked as we walked away from the ceremony, it was a good thing that the whole incident was forgotten. I wouldn't want to be remembered for it to say the least, I remind myself that RWBY has to take in the fact that there's lands beyond their own. I kinda knew that already, but the world they come from seems different from my own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much, it's the same in terms of how they look. Same history, same lands etc. But there's different powers. Here it's magic that is the dominant power, over there it's science. If you look at a map of this world it's the same over there.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, like a coin I take it?\" Weiss said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but we keep things secret. The general public of both worlds do not know that magic and advanced science is real, unlike in your world where I take it you operate openly?\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, Beacon Academy is pretty much like the best school ever to be a hunter. The monsters are present, and so are the heroes!\" Ruby says, interesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, but just remember that in future if you ever come back to this world. Remember that most people here are sheep, ignorant ones at that. We can't afford spooking them. But enough of that, let's go.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lead the girls past the dorm, well our one. We also walk past the others. \"So these are the dorms, where the students live. We have uni-gender rules, but it's up to the students to how they live.\" I motion with a thumb as we go past them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! So that's why no one bothered about stopping you and that girl from having some smexy fumbles in the dark eh?\" Yang says with a snicker. I say nothing to it, and make sure I'm not looking at them. How did they find out?! Maybe the walls weren't reinforced from their room? Oh bollocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving on we arrive to a large circular building, with several windows. \"This here is the library, you can find books related on a wide array of topics.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such as?\" Blake asked, she sounded a bit interested here. Maybe she had some things in common with Jenny, she loved books. When we went there Jenny would take a stack of books, read through them. And then put them back and take another stack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All sorts, history both non magical and magical, biology, current events you name it's probably there. I don't think you'll find anything related to your world, but still you'd do well to go there and read up. For the future you know, just make sure you bring the books back on time. The librarian has been known to hex and curse those who don't return books.\" I add that last part in, I'm not sure if it's true or not. But Chon certainly stated it, and given how much he hates magic that's proof enough for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scary.\" Ruby remarks, without a hint of fear in her voice I think. With that I press on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe main school is a massive complex, I don't actually know the length of it. But it's quite large, me and RWBY walk up a worn cobble path that leads from the dorms and past the library. I gesture up at the building and say \"Well here's where most of the magic happens for lack of a better term.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right the part to the left there? That's non supernatural studies, English, Maths, all the basic shit. Stuff that's boring I'm afraid, but hey need to do it.\" I'm not gonna lie I find it a pain, Light couldn't even read or write before he showed up. To say helping him through that was a nightmare was an understatement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boo! Is there any cool stuff?\" Ruby says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The right deals with the supernatural. Alchemy, summoning, magical studies and various other things. Timetables are catered to the individual, there's not a lot of students here if you didn't know already.\" I state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beacon's like that too, only the best of the best are welcomed there.\" Weiss says with a hint of pride in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! My Sis here got welcomed in because she's a pro! In fact they welcomed her early!\" Yang says leaning into Ruby for a small hug. Ruby simply giggles and smiles at me. Early huh? Made sense, I thought she looked a bit younger than the rest of the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, your going to have pretty much the same timetable as me and my friends. Just follow us when the classes start and you'll be fine, we can't really go in the building when classes aren't on though. Magical enchantment, but the Dean's at the very top floor. And the field over there is the PE place. We do sparring there, hopefully we can sometime. I'm curious to see how you lot fight.\" That last part I add with a smile as I turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh we're some of the best, not gonna lie! But you look like someone who knows what they're doing.\" Yang says with a wry smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response I fold my arms and grin. \"Well I do what I can, we'll all see. Oh I've not been able to let you meet all of my dorm, let's head back and get to know them. Race you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that I quickly sprint past the girls, only there's a flash of red and black zipping past me. And before I know it Ruby is already at the door, she sticks her tongue out at me and goes \"Never lost a race yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm actually surprised, but quickly regain my composure. It's not magic or science, must be something from her world. I can't wait to know more actually.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He cracked a small grin before adding, \"What took you so long?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo small girls in school uniforms peeked out behind him grinning. \"No one beats big brother at anything, lady!\" Beaming Viva boasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, BB is the best at everything!\" Smiling, Vogue cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B- But you were just over there!\" Stunned, Ruby stammered. \"How did you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the one known as the Blind Vengeance, Ruby.\" Calmly, Ozpin said. \"He is faster than all of you combined and has moves you have not even dreamed of in his arsenal of hand to hand combat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Blind Vengeance is it?\" Walking up to Chon, Blake inquired. \"I had read horror stories about you; the darkness and its monsters took your brother's life.\" her eyes narrowed with anger. \"I hope you gave the guilty everything they deserved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon raised a single eyebrow. \"That was a lifetime ago.\" Serious, he said. \"I am completely different now; my anger is focused as well as my resolve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh great!\" Snapping, Weiss stated. \"More kids!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to find a short boy walking towards us wearing a black cloak and hooded cowl. He completely ignored Weiss, which infuriated her, and walked straight to Ozpin. \"Matt Moray, present and prepared for transfer to Beacon Academy, dean Ozpin, sir.\" politely, he stated. \"My luggage is being shipped to the RWBY dorm rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another Moray?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I requested his presence, Mr. Carlson.\" Serious, Ozpin stated. \"Matt Moray has the ability to control both magic and mad science without switching genders. Beacon Academy has the means to train such people so I offered to take him under my wing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy, Matt Moray lowered his hood revealing he had doll like features and wolf like ears on the top of his head. Upon removing the cloak, everyone saw that he also had a wolf like tail. \"Yes, I am a Neko boy which is a rarity in both worlds.\" Calmly, he said. \"However, my power is derived from pure spice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spice?\" Raising an eyebrow, Light asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am sure you know that witches add rare herbs into their potions to give them more power.\" Turning to Light, Matt said. Light nodded. \"Well, these herbs have high amounts of natural magic.\" He turned to Ozpin, serious. \"What your world calls dust, or a sort of equivalent to it if you will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss' curiosity seemed to have peeked. \"Interesting. Tell us more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The spice in this world effects girls more than boys.\" Ignoring Weiss, Matt said. \"In my world, it is the opposite; added to serums, but the principal is the same.\" He turned to me. \"According to head witch Jessica, your dorm mate, Charlie ate these herbs when his family attempted to starve him into submission when he was growing up. You know the result.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss turned to Ozpin, confused. \"He gave a sly grin. \"Classified.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem very knowledgeable for your age.\" Changing the subject, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt sighed. \"Knowledge is power but it will only take one so far.\" Darkly, he said. \"Passion, gut instinct, sacrifice, and raw courage is also required.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Starmage and welcome to RWBY, Matt Moray.\" Serious, Ozpin said. \"You will be expected to follow all rules established here during our visit. Is that clear, young man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have memorized the rules and regulations of Starmage Academy.\" politely, Matt replied. \"I shall not act outside of their boundaries. However, I have yet to acquire any material relating to Beacon Academy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin smiled slightly. \"You will get them in due time. For now, let us meet the rest of Mr Carlson's team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI motioned to the dorms. \"This way...\"</span></div></div>",

Ladies first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to this Ruby tilts her head and says \"Well thanks, your a top student and a gentleman. All in one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I try to do so.\" giving a small smirk, I motion with my head and Ruby heads in. Wordlessly Weiss, Blake and Yang enter also. I take a moment to look at the school before making my way back in, inside the dorm is a buzz of activity as it usually is in this time of the day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone in the living room!\" I shout as I enter there, I motion for team RWBY to take a seat. The girls take one of the big couches, the one right next to the window. One by one my friends enter the room and take up various spots in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now for those who weren't here when I did my briefing we have some new guests. And they're from another world, not the one we've been to before but another one. Introduce yourselves girls.\" I say as I grab a folding chair and sit next to them, Jenny does the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay well uh....I'm Ruby. And this is Blake, Weiss and that's my Sister Yang. We're like an elite team of monster hunters, and we're called team RWBY! I know it's kinda odd and we get mixed up at times, but ya know!\" Ruby says. Smooth, real smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, well you girls know me. This little kitty cat is Jenny Forth, she's a Neko. Half human and half cat witches. I didn't mention that last night cause you just got in.\" I motion to the brown haired girl that I call my love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meow! I'm half cat alright! Check it!\" Jenny says, she flicks her fingers and suddenly brown tufts of fur pop up on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby's eyes go wide as she leans forward to look at them. \"Oh wow! They look so cute! Can you make them move?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny giggles, and her ears go back and forth and side to side. Ruby leans forward as if to touch them but Jenny quickly leans back and says \"No! They're sensitive, o-only Ryan can touch them! These sacred tufts of fur! Hiss!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response I quickly cough and lean forward, putting my hand on one cheek so Ruby and co can't see my blush. Dammit Jenny, your getting the brush on them later tonight! Blake is paying close attention to Jenny's ears, is there a similarity with the pair of them? Maybe, side note ask Jenny if she can have fancy eyes. Ruby huffs and sits back, Weiss rolls her eyes at this. Yang gives a little chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moving on, you already know this one. The guy with the red blindfold is Chon, he's my wingman.\" I motion with a hand. In response Chon nods politely to team RWBY, even with his blindfold it's evident he's staring right at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah! Can you see us?\" Ruby asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon gives a small smirk before saying with his Chinese accent \"Why yes, it's one of my many powers. I can detect your chi and see you based on it, your hearts are in the right place morally.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang smiles, I quickly asses that she's looking at his biceps before saying \"So I gotta ask. What's behind the blindfold? Is it another blindfold? Can you shoot lasers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh shit, you shouldn't have said that. Fuck, fuck. Chon's smile suddenly turns sinister, Viva and Vogue close their eyes and cover them with their hands. The man then stands up and walks forward, I quickly turn my gaze around as Chon's hands go up to remove his blindfold. Suddenly the temperature in the room just dropped harshly, and I can swear I hear muttering in Chinese. Sounds like something from a ghost or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon then sat back down and had his blindfold on, mercifully it was only a few seconds. I risk a glance at team RWBY, who actually look unsettled by it to varying degrees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you walk around with an injury like that?!\" Weiss spluttered out, a good thing her hair can't get any more white than it already is. Blake's silent, but her eyes are wide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, that was.....just..well...spooky.\" Yang mutters, man I remembered the first time he did that to me. Fuck I couldn't eat for the rest of the day. Ruby rubs her eyes real quick, you know that colour she's got is pretty nice. Not as nice as Blake's, still good though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon smirks and says \"That answers your question, these blonde girls are my adoptive kids Viva and Vogue. Do say something my dears.\" he motioned to the twins. When it comes to those Chon's actually a really good carer for them, he's actually happy thanks to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hello, a pleasure to meet you.\" they state while they give a bow. They're shy when it comes to meeting new people, they've had it rough before they came into Chon's care. To put it mildly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw hey there, so are you the grasshoppers to uh, ol redeyes here?\" Yang says, redeyes? Really? Damn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva gives a little giggle before saying \"Well yes, we train everyday. We're only to fight as a last resort though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we only fight to defend others. Like our dear Charlie! Give us a hug.\" Vogue says as she leans in and wraps her arms around his left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister I am hugging him too!\" Viva grabs Charlie by the right and they both glare at the other, the aforementioned shyness went right away when he was brought in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Chon was it? Your daughters are both dating the same boy?\" Weiss says with a small frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chinese man merely grunts and says \"They are not harmed, so I see no problem with it. Charlie introduce yourself boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie then nods to team RWBY, he's not saying anything so I motion with my hand for him to do so. \"Um, h-hi. Your our new dorm mates yes? I'm Charlie, pleased to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lean in to Ruby and mutter \"The kid's had a very rough and abusive childhood as I said earlier, he can be a bit timid towards women because of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.....well he does seem happy at least.\" Ruby responds, something about when I said women made her a little sombre. I simply nod, the kid has been through a lot. Least I can do is make him a better life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts then that Yang noticed Light and says \"Hey there big guy, what's the weather like up there?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight's 6ft 9inches tall, and he emerges from behind the kitchen table. He's shirtless as he usually is, with his intricate magically enchanted tattoos on display. Yang looks like she's eating the eye candy, the tattoos and biceps. Team RWBY's checking those tattoos out, I have to admit even after being used to them they can still catch your sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight frowns before saying to me \"Boss what is she talking about? We can all see the weather, it's right out there.\" and he then points at the window behind RWBY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn spite of his name Light is actually very dim, the room becomes very quiet. And I turn my head away in shame, Yang leans in and mutters \"Is he serious?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fraid so, his name's Light by the way. Though he prefers John.\" I mutter back, better set the record for the future. Just in case Yang thinks Light's playing her, he couldn't play twinkle twinkle little star. Weiss frowns before shaking her head, Blake lifted an eyebrow and Ruby blinked rapidly. Light simply does a meh motion with his hands before getting a cola can from the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShomei then coughs politely before saying \"Your are new dorm mates yes? My name is Shomei Akatsuki, pleasure to meet you.\" and he gives a formal bow as well. Weiss smiles before nodding her head to him. Blake does the same respectful gesture, perhaps it's how Sho carries himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a nice jacket you got there, are you like some sort of military officer? Tenhut!\" Yang says giving a salute, it's the way Shomei carries himself. And how he wears his usual coat, and he is former JSDF.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSho frowns, before giving a small chuckle and saying \"Er, something along those lines. It's a long story, best saved for another day.\" he's usually straight laced. But we're rubbing off on him, Ruby and co might be surprised regarding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well the girl in the corner is Amy, and Lunar's next to Light.\" I state, Amy simply nods and waves. She's not really a sociable person. More so with guys, but she'll warm over time I'm sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunar meanwhile states \"Hello, I know little about Remnant. I have always curious to know more, I hope you can assist me with that.\" she bows, and then suddenly her head comes off! And the people of team RWBY react in shock to this, heck that always gets me. And Lunar delights in it I'm sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!\" Weiss yelled out as she fell back in her chair. Lunar quickly scooped her head back up before giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies, it's just I'm a robot you see. And from what I've learned from human nature pranks on newcomers tend to be common. Again I apologize if I caused any undue stress or harm.\" Lunar says with a nod of the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rub my temples before checking the room, I then say to Light \"John where's your Sister Jane?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the library.\" Light mutters after crushing the can in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThought so, that girl took to books like a fish to water. Blake then pipes up with \"Um would it be alright if I could check the library? I'm interested in seeing what is there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine with me, anyone else going?\" I say standing up, Jenny pinches my butt and walks out the room to signal yes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss stands up and says \"I'm going to relax for today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah same here, can't make my puns if I'm tired.\" Yang says as she heads to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you later Carlson.\" Ruby says, the three of them retire to their dorm room. I motion to Blake to follow and we're out with that.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>Ryan's POV</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following morning, I wake up to a visit from dean Elvira. She had a bemused look on her face which was rather out of character for her. She smiled at team RWBY who were all waking up at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize for waking you all up before classes but I need you all to meet the new team junior rogue hunters to form at Starmage.\" Politely, she said. \"This group rather surprised me but I am curious to see how they pan out in the up coming days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDean Elvira lead us all out of our dorms to a dorm on the other side of the school. She then motioned me to enter as I was the leader of my group. I grab the door by it's handle and open it, and instantly I am shocked by what I witness. There, standing in the middle of the main room of the far dorm was the team Elvira had mentioned. It was Rose and Carla Ren, Charlie's sisters! With them were three of the most infamous quasi rogue students Starmage had ever seen!  What threw me off was that they looked really....well.....different.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/prettycure/images/c/ca/Smile_pose.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20120317094741\" target=\"_blank\">http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/pret...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose had pink hair, and Carla was dyed blue. They and the other quasi rogues were wearing dress style uniforms straight out of a fantasy costume store. They looked ridiculous! The one with the green hair was Lisa Montaron, she was known for drawing pictures of boys dressed as girls and pasting them on their backs. The blonde was Eliza McTon, a bitchy cheerleader in the Starmage cheerleading squad. And the orange girl was Erin Godda, a rather hotheaded woman with a penchant for picking fights with guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Ryan!\" Carla shouts with a really gleeful wave, all of it just seemed so damn surreal. The hair, the outfits and the beaming smiles seemed so out of place for them that I half suspected they were under some bizarre curse. Suddenly Rose leaned down and....gave Charlie a hug?! It seemed oddly friendly too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant Viva and Vogue are right at Rose. Just as it looked like all hell was going to break loose Rose backed away, with her hands up to signal peace. \"Woah! Easy! No harm meant girls!\" Rose says with concern in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe V girls cling to Charlie's and glare daggers at Rose, to be honest I was waiting for them to beat the shit out of Rose and her sister. Only they held themselves back. Chon had trained them well. Viva then blurted out, \"What's with the hair and outfits?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla smiles and says \"Well you recall that incident with Matt, and how we were punished for it yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could we forget, I felt like celebrating. But I merely just nod my head, this prompts Rose to go on with \"To put it mildly, we were experimented on. And it wasn't very nice, at all. It's amazing a human can survive without a spine eh Sis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy other Sister nods and says \"It was sort of like a wakeup call, all that torture and we realise something. We put you through that, but for much longer. And we know that our Mother is to blame for that, but in the end our actions are also to considered our own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose then chimes in \"We vowed never to walk down that dark path again! We want to make things right, and so we've set about finding other women in our school. Who you could say were teetering on the brink towards evil, we shared what happened to us and explained what we had in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa speaks with \"We've decided to renounce our ways, and try to set about fixing our mistakes and helping those in need! So from now on we're the....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princesses.....\" Erin says, with practised bravado.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of.........\" Eliza<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Justice!~~\" Rose and Carla says at the same time, the group then get close to each other and smile and make poses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth my team and team RWBY are silent. We were at a loss for words to say thew least. Now I know why dean Elvira seemed so bemused. The worst quasi students in the history of Starmage were suddenly switching sides and fighting against evil?! I will believe that when I see it in action; words only carry so much weight. The silence was broken when Matt Moray, the transfer student to Beacon Academy spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your uniforms are certainly eye catching.\" Raising an eyebrow, he said. \"I suggest you tone them down a bit and go for a type of armor as you will no doubt face rogues who will consider you 'traitors' to their twisted cause.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh these are armor!\" Grinning, Rose replied. \"We made them this way so to draw a villain's attention away from the victim we are rescuing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow..\" shaking his head, Charlie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three groups then fell into conversation; an oddly friendly one at that. Dean Elvira giggled before taking her leave. \"This will prove to be interesting.\" Amused, she stated. \"They will be acting prefects while you and your team are visiting Beacon Academy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis shocked the hell out of me! \"What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not fear, they will be closely monitored.\" Smiling, Elvira said. \"This will be their one test to prove their worth after renouncing their old ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she left, looking rather bemused. I could not blame her, I was bemused as well but by the sheer irony of it all. I turned back to the conversation to hear Ruby ask Ozpin \"When these people enter Beacon Academy, they are going to need weapons to fight the darkness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin chuckled ever so slightly. \"My dear Ruby... they <i>are</i> weapons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby gasped. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin turned to the three groups, clearing his throat. \"I believe some practice duels are in order so we can all see if the err... Princesses of Justice are ready for their role as temporary prefects.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a good idea.\" Serious, I said. \"I need to know if Starmage is in good hands while we are off to another realm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours later, all three teams meet at the dueling field where Ozpin paired the first match. He told me that I would pick the next pair to face each other. The first two to face off were...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She stopped, momentarily confused which was all Matt needed. He fired an energy blast from his and his clones' hands, sending Ruby stumbling back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Expect the unexpected, Ruby.\" Smiling, Ozpin instructed. \"You do not know your opponent as well as the creatures of darkness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm over here, little girl!\" Taunting, Matt yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Calling out, a clone said. \"I'm over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't listen to them!\" Yelled another clone. \"The real me is over here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of Matt's clones had run off in different directions, surrounding Ruby. They were each claiming to be the real Matt. Fortunately, Ruby saw through their scheme and jumped up out of the path of their blasts, allowing the energy beams to cross, hitting all of the clones. All of the copies vanished in a puff of smoke, leaving the real Matt momentarily stunned as Ruby landed on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are!\" Grinning, Rose announced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The same trick rarely works twice, Matt Moray.\" Grinning, Chon called out. \"Try something else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby charged again, this time keeping her eyes on the real Matt. He responded by raising his wolf like tail, summoning a magical shield. Ruby's scythe made contact. She smiled seeing the shield shatter but frowned as the pieces came together to form a scythe identical to her own only in Matt's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt gave Ruby a mad grin as he expertly spun the scythe around like a baton before pointing the curved blade at her. \"On guard, Ruby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby smiled. \"You may have made a copy of my weapon but you have no experience in using it!\" Boldly, she said. \"I'd surrender now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt childishly stuck his tongue out at her. \"Blah, blah, blah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does Matt really think this match is a game?\" Shaking his head, Light inquired. \"In real life, his antics could get him killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is also only seven years old.\" Calmly, Ozpin countered. \"To boys that age, everything is a game. he needs to learn that he must mature before his time if he wants to face monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby and Matt clashed with identical scythes, sparks flying as the blades met. The two danced around each other, each using their own unique forms of hand to hand combat. Being more experienced in the use of her weapon, Ruby managed to keep Matt on the defensive. Only he learned quickly, duplicating Ruby's moves while adding some of his own. The fight seemed to be leading to a stand off until one of the scythes was thrown away from a combatant. The match had ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin raised his hand. \"That is enough!\" Firmly but kindly, he announced. \"The winner of this match is...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira smiled before saying \"Would you and him be interested in seeing what he is capable of? Against say Blake Belladonna?\" in response I look to Charlie. The kid briefly meets my gaze before looking at the grass in front of him, is she serious. Against a member of Team RWBY? Blake looks noticeably hesitant, perhaps because she is slated to fight a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response I instantly turn to Elvira and Ozpin before stating \"Mr Ozpin, Dean Elvira I must protest this. Charlie has barely learned to know what it is to wield a blade, let alone tap into his powers as a magical familiar. To put him to the test like this against one of our exchange students would be unfairly slated against him, I know fighting against odds is a part of what we do. That said in my mind he's not ready.\" are they serious? Charlie wouldn't stand a chance! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie coughs before saying \"Yes it's true, I'm aware of my limits right now. Ryan, I'll sit this one out. In time I will be ready, and then I can make you proud.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile and ruffle the kid's hair before saying \"Proud of you already kiddo. Mr Ozpin, Dean Elvira I'm sorry but I can't in good conscience allow you to put him into a battle.\" I look at them with a serious expression while doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira smiles and says \"It was as I told Ozpin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed, I believe I owe you 20 dollars now.\" Ozpin states with a wry smirk, he produces a wallet and hands some money to the Dean. Are they serious? They're supposed to be serious, not petty like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another of your tests Dean?\" I remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mine actually, I wished to see if you have trained Charlie properly. Charlie is aware of the fact that the odds are stacked too much against him, and rather than proceed to fight he picked the right option of knowing when to fold them.\" Ozpin states, taking a sip of his coffee. Does he always have that mug on him? Is his weapon some kind of magic teacup? A teacher would love one of those.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, and based off your comments you bet against him?\" Blake asks with a frown, she doesn't seem too happy that she seemed to be slated up against a kid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin nods before sighing, he then states \"Yes, but you have to understand that this is important. Not the fact that I lost 20 dollars. But the fact is that we are making history, many things could go wrong. Carlson you and your group are still unknown to me, do not take that the wrong way. But if I am to trust you I need to know you will put the safety of your friends and team first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frown before replying with \"That has never been questioned, but that's fine. So long as you know this is a two way street.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct, however we'll get nowhere if neither trusts the other. Since Charlie will not fight Ms Belladonna will there be others to volunteer?\" Elvira says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I can talk further Chon pats me on the back and says \"I'll step up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a surprise, I look at Chon and ask \"Why are you so eager to take the helm Chon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blind man smiles and walks forward and nods to Blake. \"I am simply curious as to how these people fight, Blake since you seem to be chosen will you battle me? I assure you despite my blindness I am perfectly capable of holding my own in fights, as you might know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nods before saying \"Yes Ozpin and Elvira told me about you, your quite infamous among witches. But I'm not a witch, so don't think this will be easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon smiles and then kneels down, he had hidden weapons there it seemed. And he produced a pair of Shaolin hook swords, he then took his uniform's coat and shirt off. He handed them to Viva and Vogue who bowed to him before stepping off the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will fight to either first blood, or until the other yields.\" Ozpin states as we make our way off the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go elder Brother!\" Viva shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take that woman down! To Chinatown!\" Vogue cries out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon says nothing, but merely nods to Blake as he settles into a stance. Blake readies her weapon, and then settles into a stance of her own.

I draw my blades and crack my neck lightly and state to Blake \"Blake-san, I don't trust you 100 percent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake lifted an eyebrow and says \"I see. I felt that from you Chon, its fine. I feel similar to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThought so, we are from two worlds. Carlson probably doesn't like my view here. But I can have my own opinion and mindset. Blake readies herself and so do I. I make no dilly dallying and use my chi to boost forward and aim a kick at Blake's gut, Clearly she was taken aback and landed a good distance away but recovered quickly, Blake quickly drew her weapon and fired a bullet at me, the handle taking a gun like format. I naturally tilt my body to one side to avoid it. My past in hunting witches gave me plenty of experience in avoiding long ranged attacks, she fires more but I simply run and use my reflexes to dodge them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will need to do better than that to get Chon lady!\" Viva yelled out and I smirked in response. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI close the distance quickly, Blake wide eyed at my agility and speed. I lift my left blade  and aim to slice into her midriff. Blake blocks and then uses her bladed sheath to try and attack me, I roll away and stand up. My chi energy surges in my body, radiating in a thick blue aura to remind Blake she faces no mere blind man. But the blind revenge of China.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continue on the offence, attack, attack and attack. But instead of swinging with a blade I instead lift up my left leg and connect at the waist, instantly Blake's eyes roll back in her head and I lifted her up 2 feet in the air. Blake groans as I struck her in the liver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey low blow!\" Yang barks at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made a fair move.\" I simply remark. When I was fighting witches they would do anything to win, I am simply applying my own tactics based off my experience. Blake rolls backward and suddenly I notice that she has a long black cloth wrapped around her weapon and flung it at my feet, wrapped around my leg. Yanking the ground out from under me, sending me down to the grass. Blake tries to yank me towards her, but I quickly dig my hookswords into the grass to remain where I was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing my chi energy I grunt loudly and heft my legs upwards, Blake was taken aback by this and as I suspected I was physically stronger than her. I lift a hooksword up to try and cut her rope, sensing this Blake retracts her weapon away from me. I roll away and move once again to press the offence. I prefer to be the aggressor in battle, always dictating the pace of the fight if I can help it. Blake dodges my strikes with my hookswords, but I use my reliable fallback. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHand to hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI fling my weapons up into the air, as expected Blake is momentarily caught off guard. I use my chi energy to manipulate the movements of my hands, appearing as blurs to the untrained eye. Blake's seemingly are. I proceed to follow up with a series of kicks and punches, Blake tries to muster an offence but by the time it takes for her to lift her weapon up I socked her in the gut. I floor her with a palm thrust to the gut. As Blake makes to stand up I catch a hooksword by the handle and aim the blade at her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yield Blake-san, I win.\" I simply state. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake pants quietly near me, her eyes focusing on the gleam of my steel hook swords. She then says \"Fine you win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put my blades away and let Blake stand up, she was probably expecting me to help her up. \"In my country's culture we don't shake hands. But a bow shows our respect.\" I perform said action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh okay, nice fight Chon. You certainly live up to your nickname.\" Blake dusts herself off. I wave to Viva and Vogue and give a small smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan states to me \"Know I can count on you pal.\" Carlson probably knows how I won, I mixed up my offence and relied not on just my weapons but my entire body. Blake probably didn't expect that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby nears me and asks \"Say Chon, I am curious. You glowed blue in battle, can you use Aura?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Aura, well its not that. Its known as chi, the life force inherit to all living things. Its similar in practice I see now, we can use it to protect ourselves for example.\" I reply, Are they one and the same? Could I use Aura and a Semblance? Our world is already vast and another is almost entirely different.......</span></div></div>",

The guy can take me down by jabbing pressure points and then knock me out, he's a guy who knows war in and out. Likely he decided to suss Blake out with that spar, so he can get to know these girls better. I give him a pat on the back as the blind man walks back towards me and Carlson. \"Well fought Chon, you recognised a way to take advantage of your situation and exploited it to take the win.\" Ozpin praised, raising a mug towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon bowed to him and to Blake before kneeling down. There's this audible pause as people wonder who will fight next, Elvira says \"Come now someone else step up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smirk and step forward and raise my hand \"Me teach! I want to punch stuff, let me do it!\" I shout, I want some stuff to do dammit. I step forward and fold my arms, cracking my neck lightly. I am hungry and want to feed off fighting, Chon and Blake just made me want something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat blonde chick from those girls looks at me, smirking with her shades on. \"I'll take you on big boy! You look like fun.\" Yang's her name right? Damn, she's something. She walks forwards, readying those big yellow gauntlets of hers. I take off my jacket and sling it across my shoulders, I always do that before battle. I display my tattoos, magical enchantments that bind my full might. They glow faintly, over time I've learned how to take them off without my creators doing upkeep on them. Yang takes off her shades, she is eyeing me up and down. But not in the way Charlie's Sisters do out of fear or Chon does before we battle. Its like she's.....how does Ryan say it? Checking me out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope your muscles aren't just for show big guy, cause at your height I worry your compensating.\" she says, I raise an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I ain't got anything to compensate for, okay maybe I'm dumb. But I got stuff you've never seen before, so welcome to the jungle lady.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang simply licks her lips and loads her gauntlets. Its go time, this chick looks ready to kick ass. But can she handle someone as bad as me? I dig my nails into my arms, drawing blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowns, I actually feel a bit uncomfortable. Usually I don't mind unleashing my powers in front of people, but I'm kinda.....uncertain. But I want to fight, been too antsy and need to duke it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy blood lets my unleash my magic, but I have to shed it first. Not a girl so I can't use it properly, but I heal super quickly. Like really fast. But I will the blood to manifest on my hands as a pair of claws, scarlet red and razor sharp. \"You can do stuff with your blood?\" she says to me, a hint of worry in her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can say that, I just need to think and I can manifest stuff with it. I usually use it to punch stuff. Now bring it chick. I don't play nice.\" I state, I quickly go down onto all fours. Dashing right at Yang, she's probably got off guard by my primal stance and movements. I learned that in the forests practising the way of the bear. In a heartbeat I slash at her midriff, that aura tanks the hit. I wasn't trying to be lethal anyway, just a nick across as a warning shot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang then smirks, the next thing I know she delivers a hard fist into my jaw. I let out a squawking noise and go flying back, rolling backwards several times before stopping on my ass. Yang then says \"I'm not a delicate flower big boy, you want to beat me you better be ready to bring it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stand up, spit at the ground next to me. Carlson says \"Better give them more space, things are about to get heated.\" I see a problem, she relies on punches it seems. I can't really draw blood from that, she probably knows too. Well I'm just gonna get in there anyway, I yell a battle cry as I sprint at Yang. One thing is for certain, she sure doesn't hit like a girl.</span></div></div>",

Ryan and Chon favour blades so I can shed my blood really easily, gives me a lot of options for how I wanna go about this. But Yang busts my nose with a hard uppercut, instantly I feel the red juice that I need. I cup it with my right hand and leap back, transforming the blood into throwing stars. Yang takes on one the head, her aura taking the hit but she staggers back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly rip at my arms to shed more blood, but dammit its never as good as when my opponent does it to me. I gather enough to form a two handed claymore and lunge back at Yang, she ducks and weaves around my cleaving swings. But I was expecting this, she ducks to the left. I feint a strike and then slam the blade down on her head and neck. That would kill a normal person, but I know she can take that. Yang crashed to the ground with a heavy thud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, that hurt to watch.\" Ryan said in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI simply smirk and say to Yang \"I know your not done, get back up. Your too fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later Yang slams her hand into the ground, she seems to light up afterwards and the next thing I know I'm getting pummelled hard by several swift blows. I block them best I can with my blade but before long it shatters under the constant attacks. I take a hard blow to my ribs, coughing up blood. But I grit through the pain and land it on my right arm to form a gauntlet, grabbing Yang by the forehead with my left hand I drive a hard hook into her jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething's wrong, it seems like Yang is getting stronger as we fight on. Before long Yang becomes a sheer flash of yellow, energy roaring from her. My eyes bulged, she drives a fist into me. It goes right through me, I hear a squishing noise as my guts get punched into. Yang steps back, likely in shock at the fact she just donutted me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI step back also, but then I quickly perform a pelvic thrust motion and the blood around my abdomen forms into a large ramming spike. Yang however quickly reacts and punches it, a second later it too shatters. Then suddenly.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel a tremendous blow to my head and I embrace blackness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is until my vision is stirred and I open my eyes, I see everyone's gathered around me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's awake!\" Ruby says, poking at my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank god, I thought I killed you.....\" Yang mutters in concern, she actually sounds.....worried for me? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah I've walked off being disembowelled in the past, you'll need to do a lot more than that to end me.\" I mutter, still I'm slow to rise up. Just because I'm practically unkillable doesn't mean I can just get up after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill Ryan gives me a boost, I put my hand on Yang's shoulder and say \"That was a hell of a fight there, your the only person beside my boss here to have whooped my ass. Congrats!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang seems surprised by how easily I take this revelation in stride, truth is I was wanting someone that could take me mano e mano. And Yang fucking delivered on it. Yang playfully punches my arm and says \"Guess I got the other cheek then eh?\"</span></div></div>",

However, Blake did not seem to tire in the least. Also, her speed never dwindled as she pounded at Chon's defenses until he found it futile to try to tire out his opponent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blake my not be as fast as Chon but she has reserves that can outlast most of the students in my school in any one on one competition.\" Calmly, Ozpin stated. \"On top of that, she has reflexes that would rival even your girlfriend, Jenny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem to know a lot about my team.\" Equally as calm, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Smiling, Ozpin replied. \"I have read your profiles; I have strict requirements for anyone to attend my academy, even for a week visit. On the same coin, Dean Elvira had read the reports on the students i had brought with me so the exchange is equal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed then nodded before turning back to the duel. Chon seemed to have the upper hand for the moment only Blake moved in with a surprising blinding speed and threw her opponent off his feet! Chon was quick to get up only to face Blake holding her weapon against his head, drawing a single drop of blood from his forehead. \"First blood.\" Calmly, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is enough.\" Calmly, Ozpin said. \"The winner is Blake.\" He then turned to Blake. \"Just so you know, had Chon removed his blindfold, the odds would have fallen heavily against you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis confused Blake. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chon did the honorable deed by not giving himself an unfair advantage.\" Motioning to Chon, Ozpin explained. \"The very sight of his eyes give off an energy that instills irrational fear into anyone who sees them; including any Faunus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faunus?\" Curious, Chon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your equivalent to Neko.\" Softly, Blake replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like your Neko, Faunus possess extra ordinary powers and skills.\" Politely, Ozpin said. \"Each Neko, each Faunus have a different skill set even though many may seem similar.\" He smiled slightly. \"Blake has incredible endurance, speed, and reflexes as well as a lifetime experience in fighting monsters. She had learned long ago that any hesitation could cost her life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon bowed to Blake who nodded back in return. \"I would like to duel with you again sometime.\" Smiling, she said. \"Side by side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon smiled. \"I would be honored.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked back to a disappointed Viva and Vogue and reclaimed his uniform shirt and coat. \"It would be wise not to assume you will always win.\" Calmly, he told them. \"Even I must strive to be a better warrior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is your turn to pick the next combatants, Mr Carlson.\" Calmly, Ozpin said. \"Who will you send to face each other?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Good question.\"</i> After a moment, I stated...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Time to earn your keep, you don't mind do you?\" I stated turning around, this ought to be good. She's been too lazy as of late, maybe a spar against someone not of Starmage will serve as a good lesson for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy was sitting by a nearby tree, busy drawing in that sketchbook of hers. She's dressed in her usual gothic attire, her eyes meet mine and I smirk. The girl gives a sigh and says \"Why should I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's part of a lesson, now come on.\" I say, I can tell Amy's not too keen on the idea. She doesn't really like to fight, but we just need to press her right. Like I know how and so does Chon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last I checked this wasn't an official lesson, now if you'll excuse me I'm trying to draw.\" Amy retorts, I can't help but notice that Chon is in the shot. Is that intentional? Or not? Regardless Chon looks to me and smirks followed with a nod to me, here we go.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch this.\" I mutter to Yang. The blond woman stops admiring Light's tattoos and looks as Chon begins to approach the moody girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Frick you wanting?\" Amy says as she looks up to the blind man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon folds his arms and says \"It's funny, I think I noticed you watching the fight I had just now with Blake. You seemed rather concerned when Blake attacked me, isn't that right girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah totally!\" Viva says in a sing song tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looked like she was gonna shed a tear~\" Vogue pouts after it, Amy in response bites her lower lip and looks angry. She shuts her sketchbook and stands up, dusting off her skirt in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please. Like I care about this blind fool, you lost as I predicted!\" Amy snorts as she goes up to Chon, and pokes him in the chest. Though it looks like tapping your finger against a brick wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're bickering like some kind of old married couple, they like this all the time?\" Yang mutters with a snicker to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI give a little chuckle and say \"Yep, long as I've known them. Hang on it gets better.\" 3. 2. 1.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon puts his hands on his hips and says \"Goodness me girls, Amy's broken my heart! You'd think she'd want to avenge her beaten comrade, or at the very least show this blind fool how it's done. Won't you please enlighten us dearie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did it, Amy starts fuming and promptly says \"You know what? Fine! Carlson who am I up against?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Worked like a charm.\" I mutter to Yang, and then promptly say to Amy \"Uh let's see......Weiss? You up for it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss gives a shrug and says \"Sure I'm fine with it.\" wow, that was kinda easy. She kinda strikes me as the stuck up rich girl from her looks, then again I know they can deceive. No one expects Chon to see perfectly fine after all. Weiss has some kind of rapier ready, fancy. Seems like she knows how to use it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same rules as before girls, start when your ready.\" Ozpin says, then another coffee sip. How much does he got in that mug? Man.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon then produces something and hands it to Blake. \"Oh you dropped this, well I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake's eyes go wide and her hand quickly moves to her head, where I see a pair of ears that resemble that of a cat! My God, it was true. They were about the same size as Jenny's and everything, Viva and Vogue see them and quickly say at the same time \"Kitty!\" as they near her<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Belladonna quickly grabs the bow and sticks and ties it in the usual position, and she quickly stammers \"H-How did you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had a hooksword at the right angle, I had planned to use it to try and surprise you mid-fight. But well it wasn't called for I feel, after all it was only a simple spar. Sorry if I've caused any stress, girls do not harass Blake.\" Chon states, huh. He's being rather polite here, usually with strangers he's quick and to the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake huffs before muttering her thanks and attaching as how it usually was, Ruby then says \"Go Weiss!\" and the battle is underway now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy flicks through a few pages of her sketchbook while glancing at Weiss, almost as if she doesn't seem interested in this fight. Weiss frowns, clearly not enjoying the fact that Amy's not doing much. She decided to take the chance to attack, with a rushing stab attack with that rapier. I noticed something around her, like some kind of glyph image thing. Weiss was moving a lot faster than I thought she would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then she stopped, she and the rapier didn't reach Amy at all. It looked like Weiss has just ran right into a brick wall in fact, Weiss landed on her arse and blinked rapidly at Amy. \"What the hell?!\" she stammered out, Ruby and the other girls look a bit surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy shuts her sketchbook and smirks before saying \"Oh I put a force field spell in place when you weren't looking, I don't like to get myself dirty you see. So just make sure to keep your knocking on it to a minimum please while I do some drawings. Thanks.\" with that she took a pen out and started drawing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss quickly got back into her stance and looked at Amy, Yang says to me \"So is that her sort of thing? A barrier babe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, she's a natural when it comes to defence based magic. When we go into battle she usually sticks back and ensures we're protected, it comes in handy let me tell you. Her drawings in that book of hers can come to life too, and she can use telekinesis too.\" I mutter back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn really? She's gotta have some flaws in her gameplan.\" Yang replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she does, she spends most of her time reading and drawing and not working out. In terms of endurance I'd say she's the worst out of us all, apart from the kids of course. If Weiss actually hits her I'd say Amy will fold like a sheet of paper, of course that's if your friend can actually get past the defence and things that Amy might send her way.\" I say while watching. This is either going to be a short battle or not, if Weiss could just find out how to get past the barriers and summons of Amy before she got tired out. Time would tell..........</span></div></div>",

After a moment, Weiss grinned then spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I used to be an arrogant spoiled brat just like you.\" Loudly, she stated. \"Only I matured after learning what being a part of a team was really all about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy turned to Weiss annoyed. \"I am far from anything you just described!\" Ice in her voice, she said. \"Say whatever you want, you can't get through my shields.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think so, eh?\" Smiling, Weiss asked. \"Then you are in for a rude awakening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looked up at Weiss, raising a single eyebrow. \"What are you talking about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss fired a blast at the ground just in front of Amy's shield, up-heaving the ground under her feet! Amy let out a yell of surprise as she was thrown into the air. Weiss moved fast and slapped the notebook out of Amy's hand before placing a light scratch upon her arm before she even hit the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy yelled out in frustration and anger finding her outfit covered in dirt from hitting the ground as Weiss landed squarely onto her feet. \"You- You got my outfit all dirty!\" Angry, Amy yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had you been in my world, you would have been eaten alive!\" Ice in her voice, Weiss countered. \"You needed a serious wake up call and I gave it to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy screamed in frustration and took a step towards Weiss only to meet an invisible wall. \"That is quite enough, young lady.\" Firmly but kindly, Ozpin said. \"Weiss is correct. Had you held that attitude in Beacon Academy, you would not have not survived the initiation trials.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We fight monsters and people alike who will not hesitate to kill you.\" Frowning, Weiss said. \"Your current method is not enough; you need to be willing to fight as well as defend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy pouted before mopping over to the tree she had been sitting under, not willing to look at anyone as she passed us.

Chon keeps his blind gaze on her as she goes back to the tree, Amy's never really had her magic challenged like that. Chon's one of the few that ever did make it past those barriers. Though I think Amy's kinda being underestimated, she can summon monsters from that sketchbook of hers. That and weapons, but perhaps it was that self assuredness in her perfect defence which costed her that fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a hand gesture I signal to Weiss that I'll speak with Amy, as I make my way there though Chon tilts his head to her. Chon's wanting to speak with her? Why?! The pair of them can barely stand to be in the same room, and he's wanting to talk with her now?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck it, I mouth for Chon to go ahead. Though I'm watching just in case anything happens, he knows that Amy can be volatile from first hand experience. Amy's opened her book and is busy writing in it. No doubt doodling Weiss getting struck by lightning or something like that, Chon stands in front of her with his arms folded. Amy keeps her focus on the book, before stopping and glancing up at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you want?\" Amy says, she's closed the book. No doubt expecting some kind of confrontation with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That woman has a point you know.\" Chon states plainly, smooth man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy snorts and responds with \"I guess, I'm only glad you didn't give the whole I told you so crap. And if you do it now I swear I'll summon a giant sword and stick it into your head.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon doesn't instead he takes a small pill bottle out his pocket and does an underhand toss to Amy, she catches it and glances at it. Before looking back at the blind man and saying \"I can't read Chinese you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's herbal medicine, something that helps you relax. Used it when my girls have nightmares, take a couple and you'll feel better. Ancient Chinese remedy, no need to thank me. In spite of our conflicts your wellbeing matters to me Amy.\" Chon says, he's being oddly caring to her here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can see that Amy's cheeks are lightly tinted, before she looks away and opens her book. I can peek at it and see a rather detailed drawing of Chon in it, quite a lot of effort with it. She grunts before saying \"Well, thanks I suppose. J-Just don't worry about me though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon nods and gives a small smile, before suddenly kneeling down and stating \"I shall remain with you until the day ends. I will not take no for an answer Amy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy looks more flustered before stating \"Fine!\" returning to her sketchbook. The V twins are grinning at this, though they keep their distance per Chon's subtle ordering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, like the old married couple.\" I mutter to Yang. She gives a small chuckle in response. Chon and Amy come from opposite places. He was born into poverty, she was rich. Chon despised magic due to losing his family, Amy hated guys because of how she was left with her nanny while her male relatives worked to keep people safe. Perhaps there was a link between the two that went beyond verbal exchanges, this certainly was evidence of it.</span></div></div>",

He can create an army of energy based clones of himself and attack in mass with whatever weapon he happens to be carrying.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That has to take up a lot of energy.\" Wincing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin nodded. \"Indeed it does but that boy has energy to spare.\" Serious, he said. \"However, he is just discovering this power so he will be clumsy with its use until he gains some experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat of my team?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin motioned to my team. \"Whose semblance would you like to see first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your semblance is the most troubling because when you learn to hone that skill, you will actually see the mistake play itself out like your life flashing before your eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced hearing that. My semblance was looking more and more like a double edged sword. Then I saw Ozpin smile before he said, \"On the bright side, once you get to master your power, your future self can potentially send warnings to your team mates as well as send you clues pertaining to where to go or what to do in a difficult situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This semblance I have sounds like a double edged sword.\" Sighing, I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin nodded. \"Indeed it is.\" Calmly, he said. \"However, it is not your power that makes you who you are; it is how you chose to use that power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded then turned back to the field. I had a lot to think about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was impressed that Yang, despite being a touch reckless was able to hold her own against Light. The harder she gets hit, the harder she can hit back. It was almost as if she absorbed the energy of the impact and refocused it upon her opponent. This made it a challenging match for Light; I never saw the bloke so happy especially when he won against her without any weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin told Light he would need a weapon to compete in Beacon Academy. Light agreed to build a weapon for himself and left the field. I must admit, I am eager to see what the man comes up with. he might not have a lot of book smarts but when it comes to fighting, he is a bloody genius.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was on my way back to my dorm to get some sleep when a brief but clear vision passed before my eyes. It was like a telepathic message hitting me fast. I had learned to study objects in swift motion during a fight so I was able to make out the vision. Hans Grist, a known loudmouth and trouble maker at Starmage was running down the main hall in a panic with over a hundred wolf puppies on his tail. Every last pup was bearing their sharp teeth as they overran Hans and tore into him. The man ran from the horde of monsters in a blind panic with his clothing completely torn off as a lone boy growling in pure fury. There was a certain madness in his eyes, one I knew all too well. The eyes of blood-lust. Behind him was the main hall clock; it was eight at night. I looked at my watch; it was seven fifty five.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit!\" Annoyed, I spat. \"I better get to the main hall and see if this is really happening!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI yelled for Light and Chon, just in case I needed back up and made a mad dash for the main hall with Light and Chon directly on my heals. \"What's the emergency, boss?\" Concerned, Light asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That fool Hans Grist is about to piss off that Neko mad scientist!\" Approaching the main hall, I replied. \"That kid is a one boy army of monsters!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon nodded though I could tell he was curious how I knew. Still, explanations had to wait. We tore into the main hall just in time to find Hans Grist confronting Matt Moray. Has Grist was a mountain of a teenager, around 16 years of age. He was a bully and a loud mouth who thought he could get away with anything so long as he stayed within school rules and regulations. I had warned the git more than a few times to tone down on his bullying before he pissed off someone he can't handle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're another one of those freak mad scientists from the other side of the rift.\" Eyeing Matt, Hans said. He scoffed. \"Why did they send a scruffy little Ferrel dog like you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" Under my breath, I cursed. \"No wonder Matt was so pissed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCalling a Neko a 'Ferrel' or wild animal was a great insult. If he had called Jenny that, it would have taken everything I had to keep her from tearing him apart. \"This is going to get ugly!\" Whispering, I said quickly. \"Chon, get that jerk out of here while I try to calm the boy down! Light, you are my back up in case the boy decides to be difficult!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want me to do?\" Serious, Light asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frowned, a deep seriousness on my face. \"If he gets passed me, knock him out any way you can before does anything stupid!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, I sprang into motion just as Matt roared in anger at the arrogant bully, Hans Grist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI leaped over Hans and landed squarely between him and Matt who eyed me irritably. \"Out of the way, Carlson!\" Angered, he ordered. \"This is is personal matter, not of your concern!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head as Chon grabbed Hans and expertly pulled him out of the way. \"You and I need to have a serious talk!\" Whispering, Chon said. His tone was very threatening, causing Hans to shiver slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The student who insulted you will be dealt with, Moray.\" Firmly, I said. \"Stand down; that is an order from your school prefect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt growled at me before moaning, his face softening. Finally, he decided to...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His face turned from rage to childish curiosity in less than a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fascinating!\" Walking towards Chon, he exclaimed. \"Pure Chi sensory perception!\" His eyes began to light up with excitement as he nearly bowled Hans over to stand in front of Chon. \"This Nobel Prize worthy material just for the rights to study this phenomenon!

I mean just the prospect of a third eye existing in another realm of reality is groundbreaking to say the least...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said you were speechless.\" Grinning slightly, Chon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt blushed brightly. \"I apologize.\" Softly, he said. \"Every new discovery excites me; I want to learn everything... <i>everything!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon turned to me with a familiar smile on his face. It was the same smile he had when he captivated his two daughters with a story or a new martial arts technique. he knew how to handle children, there was no doubt about that.

This may lead to a study that can do away with cybernetic implants that have been known to malfunction and or be hacked into to tamper with ones vision...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight shook his head. \"How does he do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of his gifts, I guess.\" Shrugging, I replied.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After I had finished, Chon sighed. \"That arrogant fool, Hans has no idea how lucky he was. Fortunately, Matt's curiosity is greater than his hunger for revenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I read the kid's profile, he has a violent temper.\" Serious, I said. \"He has the ability to summon hundreds solid energy clones of himself in either human or wolf form. However, that is not his favorite form of attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does he use as a weapon?\" Curious, Chon asked. \"In honorable duels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He uses gravitational force waves; focused from special gauntlets.\" Whispering, I replied. \"Anything the blasts hit instantly become lighter or heavier. He could throw an opponent clear out of the ring with one hit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He could also break every bone in a person's body with extremely high gravity.\" Frowning, Light said. \"I say those are too dangerous for a boy his age to play with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to agree with Light.\" Darkly, Chon said. \"If the kid has a violent temper, such a weapon is too dangerous to be in his hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"It's not my call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have nothing to be concerned about, gentlemen.\" Appearing before us, Matt said. \"The gauntlets are preset to non lethal limits unless it detects stress levels that suggest my life is in danger.\" He frowned at me. \"Reading a person's profile during dueling classes is grounds for disqualification. I demand you show me proper proof that you went through proper channels to obtain that information for prefect business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After your confrontation with Hans Grist, I found it necessary to know all of your strengths and weaknesses in case I found myself in a position where I had to subdue you.\" Firmly, I countered. \"Your older brother and sister forced that practice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They went through proper channels, Matt.\" Serious, Ozpin said, standing by the door.

The monsters, although not real, will be solid and you will feel it when they hit you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hour later, we were all inside a small arena in a vacant field on Starmage grounds. It was a miniature version of the Roman Colosseum, about the size of a small baseball stadium. I was asked to go first with Asura in my grasp. I faced a gate of some kind with a screen above it that showed spinning images, obviously making a random decision of what creature I would be facing.

It was the most soulless, horrifying roar I had ever heard in my life. The creature raised its paw with dagger like claws as if to strike me down! Only I could see its planned move in my head and jumped just in time to avoid a surprisingly quick charge. The bear had tried to ram me off balance with speed I had never seen in a normal bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This creature will not hesitate to kill you, Ryan.\" Calmly, Ozpin said. \"You must destroy it before it takes you off guard and strikes a fatal blow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, I saw the bear's planned move, a split second vision but I was trained to see fast moving objects with great detail. I could stop a bullet with the edge of my blade if I had to. I saw the bear fire its claws from its paw like some type of bullets. I saw an opening in that split second vision and charged rather than dodged, barely missing getting hit by the flying claws and sliced the bear's head clean off with one blow from Asura!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image instantly vanished as Ozpin applauded. \"Well done, Ryan.\" Smiling slightly, he said. \"Former Dean Tanaka was not exaggerating when he said you were a master fighter.\" He raised his coffee cup as if to salute me then added, \"You would make a fine huntsman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded but did not speak and the gate opened allowing me to step out of the arena. \"Who goes next?\" Eyeing everyone, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight stepped up and walked into the arena without a word.

But it's not an ordinary stone sword, to say the least. To make any sense of this we need to go back to the morning, when he made this weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>This Morning.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell we got that mess sorted out with that Matt brat, and it was time to call it a night. Me and Jenny just hit the hay without saying a word to each other, too tired and wanting to feel up the other under the sheets. Fine by me at least, though we made sure to keep the noise down. Yang said she heard us, and I don't really want to test that. Maybe later to troll her, but not right now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the hours of the morning everyone's waking up, we all tend to wake up at the same time. It seems that Yang and Ruby have the same hours as us too, I'm not wearing a shirt as I walk down the hall. I turn my neck when I hear \"Yo Carlson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Yang, hey Ruby. Weiss and Blake still asleep?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah they tend to prefer their beauty sleep, you kept quiet last night. Didn't hear any loud purring from Jenny.\" Yang says, giving a snicker. But that's nipped in the bud when Jenny pokes her head out the door and looks at Yang, before hissing and shutting the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's not much of a morning person either.\" I dryly mutter as we make our way to the living room, Lunar is cooking. And so is Chon, in spite of his blindness he can actually be pretty damn adept at cooking when everything is their, perhaps it's enhanced senses. But there's something off about what's in front of me.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Lunar, where's Light?\" I ask, he's usually hear eating some raw meat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know Carlson, I've not seen him since the fight with Yang.\" she states without turning her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang grunts and says \"Probably hiding from me, cause he knows I'm gonna unleash my wrath on him.\" Yeah right, I could tell the pair of you were really into fighting each other. She was eating that eye candy since day one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's odd, maybe he's in trouble?\" Ruby asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doubt it, nothing can kill Light. Seriously.\" I mutter, just then there's a loud boom that comes from the forest. Like the very foundations of the dorm shakes, I nearly wobble but I keep my ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hell was that?!\" Weiss shouts as she and Blake run down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably Light, better go check it out. I'm gonna get dressed and go.\" I state as I walk back to my room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going too, that big guy's crazy!\" Yang shouts as she goes to RWBY's room with Ruby in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breakfast will be ready for when you return, Ms Weiss. Ms Blake will you be staying?\" Lunar says, she's cooking without missing a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't pay attention to their response, I'm in my uniform. Yang and Ruby are dressed quickly too, I nod to them and we make our way to the forest outside the dorm. That was where the blast came from. I've got Azura on me though just in case, Yang and Ruby are packing their heat too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long we come to a clearing in the forest, there's a big hole in the ground. And I see the body of Light there, only.....Oh fuck his head is off! Gone! Blown up from the looks of it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh......shit.......\" Yang mutters under her breath, Ruby looks horrified but says nothing. I'm briefly shocked but I stay composed, this has happened before. Light losing things and stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on, he's fine. Just wait.\" I say, and sure enough Light's body begins to move. His head literally reforming itself, first as a bald head. And then bringing forth that blonde hair, which he ain't washed in ages. He at least bathes now though, and in a couple of minutes his head is back there. And he promptly grabs it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking hell......That hurt.\" he groans out with both hands on his noggin, he half opens one eye and sees me. Light gives a nod before saying \"Hey boss!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you hey boss me Light, what the hell are you doing?!\" I say walking towards him. I'm ignoring Ruby and Yang right now, no doubt they're a tad shocked by the fact Light just regrew his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Ozpin bloke told me to make a weapon, that's what I'm doing. Oh hey Yang!\" Light says as he acknowledges her before carrying on with \"So anyway I got some concrete mixture, and made a sword out of it. But I wanted it to be something more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on....\" I say, casting a glance over at the big hole next to him. It's got a lot of white stuff inside of it, was Light making drugs?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that Weiss girl, she told me about dust. I was ignoring her till she told me it can be used in combat, and gets infused into stuff and shit. So I nicked some of it from her, thought I could infuse that in the thing I was making and make it fucking powerful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dust? This stuff here?\" I point to the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! It ain't a drug it turns out, I....tried snorting it and it and my brain had a disagreement with it.\" Light says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's stuff's lethal! More than Weiss and her cooking! Fuck!\" Yang shouts, seems she's adjusted quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right so anyway, it blew my head off. Mean man that's stuff's awesome! My blood got into that dust stuff where my weapon is, reckon I could fuse both into it at the same time.\" Light said as he promptly stood up and went to the hole. I take a few steps back, out of a sense of caution. I don't have Light's ability to shrug off things like a blown up head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut the mixture emerges this giant weapon! It's got to be the height of Jane, who is a very stunning 6'5. I can see a handle at one end of it, that looks crudely made. There's a large crack right down the middle of the weapon too, which has a white glow to it. Light's red blood has formed on the blade into what look like giant clips that hold the blade together. The whole thing looks like it's pulsing, and alive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://pre10.deviantart.net/c87e/th/pre/i/2012/317/2/2/guilty_gear_accent_core___order_sol_sword_by_skv0ra-d5kx4ss.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://pre10.deviantart.net/c87e/th/pre/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?!\" Ruby exclaims, her eyes drawn to the way the blade looks. Light shakes it a little with one hand to wipe off the dust that's left on the sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This here's my thing! The sword! Ozpin said to make something, so I did!\" Light said as he promptly slung the weapon over his shoulder, with one hand. Like it was nothing, as per usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But.....that's a heap of junk!\" Yang said with a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight points a finger at Yang and says \"Just you wait and see! This thing's gonna have more power in it's little handle than you can dream of!\" with that he ran past us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at the hole full of dust, we need to get rid of this. If what Weiss said was true it's going to be a health hazard, I'll have to notify Ozpin and Elvira. They'll handle it. For now I motion for Yang and Ruby to come with me, this is going to have to be explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Light and I hurried into the dorm to see Matt and Weiss in each others face, pointing fingers and shouting over each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You Vexatious, irksome, ananias, thieving nincompoop!\" In a rage, Matt yelled. \"Return the spice sample you had illegally acquired from my possession!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dare call me a thief, you little freaked out Faunus wanna be?!\" Enraged, Weiss demanded. \"Give me back the dust you stole! You have no idea how powerful just one sample of that truly is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt snorted. \"I'm amazed that they entrusted a pampered, pompous airhead like you to carry that dust crap around!\"  He then childishly stuck his tongue out at her. \"Spice is grown, making it more easily available and clearly superior to something that will eventually run out as it is mined.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss took a step back as if she had been slapped. \"How dare you!\" Exploding into rage, she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He didn't take your precious dust.\" Stepping up, Light said. \"I took it and I left a payment for its use.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss paused, pulling a huge diamond out of her dress pocket. I could tell by the look in her eyes that she was practically drooling all over it. What made this all ironic was that diamonds and gold had no value to Light but he knew it was valuable to others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean this little trinket I found in my room.\" Softly, Weiss asked. \"It- It will cover the cost... barely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear Weiss, that diamond is worth all the dust you brought with you.\" Grinning, Ozpin said. \"Try not to get greedy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if I did not pay for it, what would you do about it, you angry little chinchilla huh?\" Smiling, Light demanded. \"I suggest you offer Matt a form of payment for the spice you took.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That kid can literally be a handful if he loses control.\" Chiming in, I said. \"I really do not want to have clean up another mess like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss winced seeing Ozpin's face turn serious then gave a nervous chuckle. \"I can offer you a good amount of credits that can be used in Beacon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt sighed before nodding. \"I accept.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being given his payment, he walked away, muttering, \"I can just hear my father laughing at me all the way back home. I, Matt Moray, mad scientist in training got bested by a girl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang suppressed a giggle while Weiss grinned. It was a small victory but she took it. Ozpin then cleared his throat. \"After we all have breakfast, we will train until lunch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I winced, seeing that it was a pack of Grim werewolves. Matt took a step back as the four creatures entered the arena with him, clenching the metal clad fists of his gauntlets. He summoned four floating energy rings with strange designs, similar to the ones summoned by Weiss with his left hand. They appeared around the four creatures. He them fired lightning through one near him with his right hand. The lightning fired through the four portals, striking the creatures!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He has magic!\" Stunned, Weiss asked. \"How can a boy be a magic wielder?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is a Neko boy.\" Calmly, Ozpin said. \"He has both magic and chaotic energy within him.\" He sighed, adding, \"However, without those gauntlets, he can easily lose control over his power. They are a training tool as well as his weapons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss rolled her eyes. \"Perfect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Grim werewolves howled in pain from the lightning strikes but Matt gave them no time to recover. As the energy rings vanished, he fired a blast from both gauntlets behind him, propelling himself forward at incredible speed! He was in the middle of the four in an instant where he slammed his hands together! There was a dull flash followed by a loud boom that shook the arena as the two powers within him created an explosion!  When the smoke cleared, I saw that the Grim werewolves had been completely incinerated and Matt was standing in the middle of a force-field, breathing heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin turned to Yang, a serious look on his face. \"Remember the blast you triggered earlier?\" Darkly, he asked.\" Yang nodded but did not speak. \"If it were not for our own semblances, we would have had similar fates to those holographic creatures Matt just defeated.\" He sighed. \"As I told Master Carlson, there is a thin line between being a hero and being a memory. Think before you act.\"<br>\r\n............................................................................ ............................................................................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, in a grand cafeteria, my team and I sat down to have lunch with team RWBY. Yang was pouting slightly as she sat down with her tray of selected dishes from the buffet. \"Man, Ozpin is really being strict lately!\" Exasperated, she muttered. \"How was I to know my blast rounds would ignite the two supernatural powers?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had no idea a Grim Scorpion's stinger was deadly acid.\" Frowning, I countered. \"We all need to know what we are getting into before we engage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just the problem.\" Calmly, Blake said. \"Sometimes you just don't know what you are getting into and have to work on what you know; use the strengths you have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" Handing a plate to Viva and Vogue, Chon said. \"Only I can see professor Ozpin's side as well. When you are going into battle, who do you send first; the soldiers or the scouts?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang sighed then suddenly perked up seeing something on the buffet. \"Hey! Apple over here!\" Waving she yelled. \"Toss it to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn apple came flying in and Yang grabbed for it only just missed. I saw it coming my way and caught it with ease. I threw Yang a grin and tossed it at her. It lightly hit her square in the eyes. \"Next time, just get up and grab one yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang picked up a pie in a tin. \"I see you want to play!\" Teasing, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't start anything...\" Turning serious, I warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang threw the pie at me! I easily dodged it only to see Chon catch the tin from underneath and expertly throw it right back at Yang! She let out a yell, diving to the side and the pie hit Matt full in the face as he approached the table! For a moment, the room was silent; we did not know how the young prince of mad scientists was going to react.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe dropped his tray to the floor and licked at the pie on his face. \"Hm! Banana cream; a comedy classic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waved his left hand over his face, completely removing the mess from his face but not his clothes. He looked at the people at the table then chuckled madly. \"FOOD FIGHT!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raised his two gauntlet clad hands, causing food from every table to rise off their plates before throwing his arms at my team and team RWBY! The large assortment of dishes from apple pies to yams flew directly at us! Jane screamed before diving under the table as Chon pushed Viva and Vogue under the  table with her! Amy quickly threw up a force field only this time, it was a sphere, protecting her and her team. Unfortunately, that left Team RWBY to fend for themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss, her outfit covered in food stains, was less than impressed with Matt and Amy. \"Revenge will be ours and it will taste sweet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girls voiced their approval and the free for all food fight was on...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The boy mad scientist laughed hysterically as he punched the watermelons one by one, thwarting the attack. Only the last one got him in the gut, pushing him backwards as it broke against his abs. Matt was still laughing but stopped abruptly as Light then threw the table at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt raised his left hand, stopping the table cold in mid air! He then lightly placed it down onto the floor. \"Slow down, sport!\" Sternly, he said. \"This is a game, not combat!\" He picked up a pie and ran to Light with lightning speed. \"Food only!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt pushed the pie into light's face then laughed as he growled under the whipped cream mess. For a moment, I thought that Light was going to tear him apart as he wiped the mess off his face. Only, to my surprise, he picked up another watermelon and broke it over Matt's head! With the fruit covering his head, Matt stumbled around, giggling. \"Hey! Who turned out the lights?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon laughed at the sight until Ruby hit him in the chest with a piece of cake.

Sometimes I think I can't even go to take a piss without something stupid happening, I just wanted to have lunch after nearly getting my lower body in acid. Maybe kiss Jenny and other happy stuff, instead I'm in a fucking food fight. Chon stuck his girls under the table to save them, I quickly get Charlie down there too and Chon instructs \"Viva! Vogue! Keep Charlie safe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls nod, Amy isn't paying attention to this fight. The barrier is over us, and she's painting in that sketchbook again. Jane's a coward, so that's why she is hiding. Those powers of hers would surely come in handy right about now.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carlson, what now?!\" Chon exclaims, I frown as I assess the situation. The Princesses of Justice had burst into the room too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Halt all of you!\" Rose shouts as the girls assume stupid sentai hero poses, everyone is silent as they turn to look at them. Before suddenly........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Piss off!\" Light shouts, he promptly grabs a slab of his raw meat and tosses at Rose. She promptly ducks and points at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will fall! Our heroicness is matched only by our valour! And vice versa! Princesses of Justice chargggeeee!!!\" Carla screams out as the girls barge right into the chaos, team RWBY begins mixing up with them. I'm staying right where I am, the food bounces off Amy's barrier and she lightly shivers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Carlson. Can you tell this lot to keep it down? I'm trying to draw here, go out there and talk with them or something.\" Amy says with a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI give a small chuckle, and lean into before saying \"I'm good at talking, but something tells me talking won't do much good here. We're just going to have to fight, put those powers to good use Amy! Keep us defended.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sets down her book and groans. \"Fine, I'm not getting involved besides protecting us. The stuff that's being thrown around feels little more like love taps to me.\" Amy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll settle for it. Lunar! Strafing run!\" I bark out. Lunar nods to me and quickly moves behind me and Amy, whereupon she quickly readies her flight mode. Held in her hands are bottles of ketchup, which promptly get fired on all enemy fighters as she flies around the dinner hall. The Princesses of Justice scream and hit the deck, just in time to get put in the impact zone of Yang slamming both of her hands into the ground. Ruby and Blake fly in with giant cake slices to crush the costumed idiots. Only for Rose and Carla to hold hands together and send the pair of them flying, using the old twin magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure the Ren girls are pretty sucky as witches, considering that their evil Mother didn't teach them everything she knew. For fear of being backstabbed naturally, but twin witches possessed much greater power when they used their might together. John often told me about the twin factor, usually it only concerned the twins when one was a boy. But it did give them bigger magical might. Ruby and Blake clearly weren't expecting it and are sent for a loop, only to be caught by Weiss flinging her rapier and conjuring those glyphs of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby and Blake leap off of them, and promptly ram Rose and Carla with the cake slices right into the walls. Shortly after the doors open, I'm expecting Elvira or Ozpin to enter. But instead it's Shomei, I informed him of the situation of these new students and new world. He arrived from Japan ASAP, he's a lot older than he looks. He claims to have been an officer in Japan's SDF when it was first formed, even had a picture of him there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carlson-sama! What in Kami's name is going on?!\" Sho shouted, Yang promptly tossed a watermelon at the man. But he used his Kage Yurei powers to turn into his ghost form, the sprit that inhabits my sword is his ancestor. And they are Japanese demon slayers, all that mattered was the watermelon flew right through Sho and into the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit! It's a ghost!\" Yang yells out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carlson-sama is this one of the new arrivals I was informed of?\" Sho says, he promptly assumes his karate stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. It's a warzone isn't?\" I remark as I nod to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSho tightens his gloves. \"I know of war, this is nothing compared to what I've gone through. I'll humour you all however.\" he remarks. Crap, hopefully he's not taking this seriously. There's children here for Christ's sake!</span></div></div>",

Jane was forced to kill people and watch the life slowly fade from their eyes.\" Jane began to sob slightly as Sho continued. \"It was their intention to give her blood lust only that backfired. She instead has post traumatic stress syndrome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains a lot.\" Sighing, I said. \"She's seen too much bloodshed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She knows the true horror of war at a very young age.\" Softly, Sho said. \"What is worse, one of those who had rescued her lost control and slaughtered everyone. The one known as Tex has a fear of failure; only he fears failing to control his temper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hence why he is not joining us.\" Entering the room, Ozpin said. \"Greetings, Shomei Akatsuki. Please do not judge these people too harshly, they are still only children. Why not let them play the part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSho bowed respectfully to Ozpin who bowed in return. \"Being children is one thing; being disrespectful to house rules is another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite right.\" Nodding, Ozpin said. \"Still, it is not a role they will have forever.\" He smiled seeing Elvira enter with a bemused look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Students, the next time you make this big of a mess, you will be cleaning it manually.\" With a mock scowl, she said. \"Do I make myself clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone quickly nodded and Elvira waved her hand once, restoring the entire dinning hall with a dull flash before quietly leaving, hiding a smile. I caught her mutter, \"Do be that young again... How I miss having all that fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled then turned to Jane with a sigh. I wondered if it was wise to bring her along. As if sensing my thoughts, Sho carefully whispered, \"All she needs is to know she is doing the right thing when she goes into combat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Students go there during their time off and some even stay there if we don't have enough rooms for them, I've been there a few times myself. But for the most part I've just kept to the school and hit the books when I had time, all the stuff we get up to leaves little room for studying. I'm standing at the road to the school, there's a big coach bus. I've gotten out of my Starmage uniform and dressed in something that I consider casual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/megamitensei/images/f/fc/Tatsuya_Suou_EPP.png/revision/latest?cb=20131125121103\" target=\"_blank\">http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/mega...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny meanwhile is in a pair of blue jeans, black sneakers and a creamy white jumper. Light's got black leather pants and shoes with belt buckles all tied around the ankles, with an orange jumper with the sleeves torn off. Lunar wears the dress that she normally has, she doesn't really need to wash her clothes. What with being a robot she doesn't really produce sweat after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon's wearing black tracksuit trousers and shoes, with a red shirt that has Chinese letters for fighter. The V girls wear matching white jeans and pink leather jackets. Charlie's got that coat I bought for his birthday, a red and white one. He's wearing a pair of shorts and sandals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuanle's wearing a red qipao and thigh high boots. Sho's still wearing that sort of military uniform he's always got, it helps him use his blitzmotor. The tech that is fused into him. Jane's wearing a big green dress, she smiles a little but glances around the place as she normally does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn my head and nod at team RWBY, they've changed as well. Weiss has a really nice white dress with black buttons, not too far from how she looked before. Ruby's still got that hood on, but she's casual looking too. Gotta admit Yang's got a nice coat on, Blake's simple but nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S'up?\" Yang says with a smile, I give her a nod of the head and point to the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's all hop in boys and girls, remember you break you buy when your out on the town.\" I say aloud as I open the door, I let the RWBY girls on first. They give their thanks, I'm on next with Jenny and we sit behind Ruby and co. Everyone else piles in after, I'm sitting in front with Jenny taking the window seat. Ruby and Yang are behind us, with Blake and Weiss behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough we're all on and the bus starts driving, as we go through the pristine forests that surround the land of Starmage Yang taps me on the shoulder and says \"So Carlson, tell us a bit bout yourself why don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Shoot.\" I response leaning back in my seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How old are you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"17.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fancy that, same here. Any of your team related to you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought Yang was the same age as me, Ruby looks just a little bit younger than us. I've got an eye for details.<br>\r\n\"Nope, only child. Dad died before I knew him, my mom lives on her own.\" I state plainly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang's silent for a moment, I can tell she's looking at Ruby there. But she responds with \"Me and Ruby are Sisters, we've sort of got the same problem with parents. Just kinda the other way around.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI simply nod, there's some silence before Ruby speaks up with \"Say Jenny, your not a Faunus right? You were a what again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny giggles a little before saying \"I'm a Neko. We're witches that are half cat and half human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So kinda like Blake, but not like Blake? Is there other witches that have other features?\" Ruby inquires, in the back I swear I can hear Blake cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Neko's are the only ones that occur. We don't know how they came to being, other than witches hundreds of years ago attempted some form of ritual. To let them shift into the forms of their favourite pets, but something went wrong and we don't know it.\" Jenny explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, lost to the ages then? Say do you get any perks with that though?\" Yang asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah we get some gifts, better smell and hearing. And our magic tends to be more potent than a typical witch, not to brag but I'm one of the best in my year it turns out.\" my girlfriend gives a little giggle in response to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Means she can't ever play hide and seek, makes things too unfair.\" I remark, Jenny elbows me in the arm with a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long we arrive, it's not too far from Starmage after all. It's pretty bustling in the evening, most students come here after all. So there's a lot of trade from the students. Me and everyone else get off the bus and Elvira states \"Okay everyone, you've been given money. Do what you wish, but be here for 7 or your staying at the capsule hotel for tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Capsule what?\" Weiss asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a place where you sleep in a really small room for the night, quite popular over in Japan from what I know. Anyway, off with all of you!\" Elvira says as she walks back into the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carlson, I will be taking my daughters to the park. Charlie, Huanle will you accompany us?\" Chon says as the V girls take his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing bro, we could do with some family bonding.\" Huanle says, that's true. She and Chon are long lost siblings, it was kept a secret from both of them given that Chon's killed witches in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah okay.\" Charlie plainly says with a nod, Chon returns it and smiles at me and with that they make their way to the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunar meanwhile has her fingertips pressed to the sides of her head before promptly stating \"Light I wish to visit the arcade, according to my sources there should be a street fighter tournament there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight grunted and said \"Hey Jane, take your coming with?\" Jane said nothing but merely gave a little nod. She wasn't going to ditch her Brother when she was at a place she had no clue of. Light waved at me and said \"Later boss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on big guy! I'll come too, maybe we can have some fun.\" Yang says, she promptly walks ahead of Light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly he then remarks with \"Fine then, follow us. You've not been here before remember?\" Yang simply gives a little chuckle and Light walks ahead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a bookstore nearby Carlson?\" Blake asks, come to think of it Blake has a lot of books as I recall. Again another similar thing to her and Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes there should be one a block or so away. Sho would you be willing to escort Blake around?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSho gives a nod and says \"As you wish Carlson-sama, Ruby-san, Weiss-san will you accompany us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss frowns slightly before asking \"What's sama and san?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sho's from a place called Japan girls, it's his country's equivalent of someone important to him and a mr and ms respectively.\" I explain, remember these girls aren't from my world. So the lesser known cultures would go unknown to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby gives an \"Oh.\" but then says \"Sure let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Weiss huffs a little before saying \"Alright then, don't get us lost Sho.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former JSDF officer gives a smirk before motioning to follow him. And with that it's just me and my dear little JenJen, she leans into my arm and mutters \"Shall we get something to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course........\" I simply say, time to get a nice candlelit dinner.</span></div></div>",

We met inside a small office where Ozpin had temporarily put up shop during his visit. He offered Jane a plate of cookies, which she timidly accepted then offered her a seat while he sat down in a chair opposite of a table. I stood by the door, watching and listening in a neutral pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First of all, Jane, I completely understand your fear of combat.\" Calmly, Ozpin said. \"No warrior wishes to see anyone killed who does not deserve it. However, the food fight in the cafeteria was mere play, why did it frighten you so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It- It wasn't the food.\" Blushing slightly, Jane said. \"It was the fight behind it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin tilted his head slightly to one side. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was trained to fight to kill!\" Crying, Jane screamed. \"I can't do that again!\" She slumped in her chair, sobbing. \"I can't... not again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin was silent for a moment before stating, \"I see...\" He then took a sip of his coffee. \"The monsters of Grim do not have a soul, Jane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raised a single eyebrow as Jane looked at Ozpin, curious. \"No soul...\" Wincing, she asked. \"How is that even possible?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They were created through dark energy.\" Simply, Ozpin replied. \"You can use the skills that were given to you for evil to do great good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Hopeful, Jane demanded. \"How can a trained killer learn not to kill?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By releasing your aura.\" Standing up, Ozpin said. \"It is a part of your very soul which surrounds and protects you from evil and harm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane jumped slightly then turned to me, not knowing what to do. I decided it was time to intervene. \"How exactly do you intend to release Jane's aura?\" Politely, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin shook his head, a smile forming. \"I will not be doing this.\" Calmly, he said. He opened the door, revealing Light who was listening in from outside. \"He will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight entered the room, looking confused as Ozpin closed the door. \"What is this about auras and my sister's soul?\" Gruffly, he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Place your left hand onto her right shoulder, Light.\" Ignoring the question, Ozpin commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight turned to me, raising an eyebrow. I nodded and he did as Ozpin instructed. \"Okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close your eyes, Jane.\" Calmly, Ozpin said. \"Focus on your inner self.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin then walked Light through a strange ritual similar to the awakening of ones Chi I learned from Chon when he awakened the chi within Viva and Vogue. Once the ritual was over, Jane opened her eyes and smiled slightly. \"I feel... strange.\" Softly, she said. \"In a good way but still strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By releasing your aura, the memories of your torment are but a forgotten dream.\" Calmly, Ozpin said. \"You will still remember them only you will no longer be controlled by them.\" He then sat back down at the table, taking a sip of his endless cup of coffee. \"If you wish to join us at Beacon Academy, you will need to forge a weapon as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane sighed. \"I'll need to think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided to check up on Jane the next day to find that...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was made of a strange wood I could not identify and had a circular piece made of the same wood on one end. Inside the circular piece was a strange jewel that looked a lot like one of Weiss's dust gems. On the opposite end of the staff was what looked like the butt of a rifle! I had to assume that this was Jane's weapon of choice. She was practicing using it against lifeless targets that we used in martial arts training.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This should be interesting.\" Softly, I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane held up the staff in the center then pulled back with her free hand. Instantly, an arrow made of magical energy appeared against a string of energy! She released the 'string' and the magical arrow fired forth, destroying the target! She then spun the staff in a rapid motion as energy blasts were fired at her from an automatic defense stun cannon. Not a single one got through!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impressive.\" Smiling slightly, I whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane then turned the staff so she was holding the 'gun' end and fired energy blasts, disabling the cannon then swung the staff with precise strength, sending it flying! Once she was done, she finally took notice of me. \"I call it the Guardian Staff!\" Smiling, she said. \"It will destroy anything without a soul but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then fired an energy arrow in my direction! The arrow hit before I could react but it passed harmlessly as if it were a ghost! Jane smiled then finished saying, \"It will not harm those who have a soul unless their intention is to harm me or my friends!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice!\" Smiling, I said. I then frowned slightly. \"Don't make a habit of doing that though!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane blushed, her shy nature showing through. \"I want to go with you guys.\" Softly, she said. \"Only I will not kill anyone if it can be helped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"Fair enough.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryan's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell it was time, team RWBY had stayed a week in Starmage Academy. It was pretty damn fun too, they really fit in well with us. Hell I even entrusted Blake and Yang to look after Charlie for a bit, he needs to open up to new people. Sure he's got two girlfriends, that are twins and witches. But he's still pretty introverted, I blame her Mother. But Yang managed to get the kid to warm up to them after enough bad puns, that meant a lot to me and I made sure to thank them for it in private. I feel I can trust them, as much as I would with Chon or Light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe've packed our bags, with enough clothes and other things to last at least a week. Everyone in Team Starmage is coming, even the kids. They're gonna be staying in Beacon Academy with us, but they're not doing the entry test. Viva and Vogue have been personally trained by Chon, and he didn't beat around the bush with it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon once told me he trained with someone who served in the Chinese military, and trained Chon when he had just lost his Brother. Those girls might have some great training, but they're still kids. Same with Charlie, he's been learning bojitsu at his request as well as looking into his new found power. But he's not going to be fighting grimm anytime soon. Nothing bad will happen to that kid, it'll have to go through me first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs of right now I'm currently standing in a huge airship, that was waiting for us after we got through the portal. It seemed remarkably secure, looked like a black ops site. Understandable considering we're on a maiden voyage, on the second part of it now. The armed escort was turned down at Ozpin's request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Carlson.\" Ruby says, I'm looking out a window to admire Remnant. You know if it wasn't for the grimm that I've heard and seen, might not be a bad place to live. Looks nice, well the stuff that I can see at least. I nod to Ruby and smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....You worried?\" Ruby asks. Smooth girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn to her and tilt my head before saying \"Of course. I'm in a world I've never been to before, that's far more dangerous than my own. And I'm bringing kids along with me, and the love of my life. But I'm fine, don't worry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby bites her lower lip, I take a sigh and say \"Look I'm not getting at you or anything like that. It's just I worry for those in my group, I know how tough they are. Even Chon's daughters can eat nails and ask for seconds. But still.......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully everyone else is out of earshot, perhaps telling someone who shares a common role as myself is allowing me to confide. Ruby smiles and says \"Well I've only known you for about a week Carlson, but I like to think I can tell a good person when I see them. And your well....solid gold, your guys are like some family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckle and reply with \"Yeah that's kinda true, maybe it's because of that I worry too much about them. Jenny says that sometimes I'm trying too hard to set the example, and ensure they're all fine. It's not healthy, between that and everything else it'll be a miracle that I don't have grey hairs by the time I turn 30.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby giggles a little and looks past me, Jenny's coming back. Ms Rose gives me a nod and says \"See you around Carlson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything okay dearie?\" Jenny says as I turn around, the girl wraps her arms around me for a hug and I respond in kind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, just having a talk with Ruby. Kinda helped me see a flaw in how I lead us all, guess it's born out of worry.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm, Though you worry cause of love Ryan.\" Jenny mutters before kissing my cheek, I smirk and turn to look around at everyone. Light's having a chat with Yang it seems, and no surprise she's making some bad puns. But they're going over Light's head, though he's smiling at least. Something tells me he fancies her, even if he doesn't know bout love. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy? Probably because she can fight Light so evenly, even beat him two days ago. Only one other person has done that, and that's none other than yours truly. Yang's eyes are darting to his face and those tattoos, I will admit Light's pretty damn ripped. But when it comes to kicking ass, you can't mess with the man who's on the lead guitar in the band. And again, your truly.</span></div></div>",

The kid, Matt Moray was standing alone in a neutral stance with his hands behind his back. He was wearing the Eligere Sententia school uniform which was black pants with a light grey stripe one the outer sides, a white shirt with grey tie and a long white lab coat with black boots to finish the outfit. On the lab coat was the insignia from the school which was a DNA strand with two swords crossing through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess he will be representing the school from his own world.\" Softly, Weiss muttered. \"I shudder to think what they might teach there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never been there.\" Honestly, I said. \"I have heard that their teaching methods are... unique.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss shrugged it off and moved on as the doors to the ship opened; we had arrived. I looked about, impressed by the fine architecture and diversity of students. Matt Moray was exiting with a number of robots carrying his small cargo of spice. Where did he get those? Nearby, Weiss was with her servants, moving her cargo of dust. The two shot each other an impatient look then walked away from each other with a huff. I smiled, knowing that they come from similar backgrounds; both used to always getting exactly what they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place is amazing!\" Whispering, Jenny said. \"I wonder what type of magic or science keeps this place hovering over the city!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you can ask Ozpin when you get the chance.\" Smiling, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny smiled back then turned to see a tall man in some kind of military uniform approaching. Ozpin gave a slight chuckle seeing him and motioned us all to his side. \"Students, guests, this is General Ironwood from the city of Atlas.\" Introducing us, he said. He then frowned slightly motioning upwards to a large number of flying ships. \"I see you brought your army here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take my work with me everywhere I go, Ozpin.\" Calmly, he said. \"Speaking of an army, who are these strangers you have brought with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Prince</i> Matt Moray.\" Stepping forward, Matt stated. \"I and this group were invited in a gesture of good will between two parallel worlds whom a stable opening had been formed. This one week visit will not disrupt the normal affairs of this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A prince, huh?\" Unimpressed, Ironwood stated. \"Do not expect me to bow before you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt frowned. \"A true warrior bows to no man.\" Sternly, Matt said. He turned to his robots. \"Escort me to my quarters! I must prepare for the opening ceremonies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, my prince!\" Saluting, a robot responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robots escorted Matt away with his small number of large suitcases as Ironwood watched him leave. \"Well, he's a charmer.\" Sarcastically, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin smiled. \"He is a child, General.\" Smiling, he said. \"Also, he has something that may help our world greatly in the days to come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronwood raised an eyebrow. \"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will discuss the matter at a later time.\" Politely, Ozpin said. \"Right now, I must speak to our new students so if you will excuse us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronwood nodded then left as Ozpin turned to my team and I. \"I allowed Matt to move ahead because I have already given him my speech earlier.\" Calmly, he said. \"You are all here to expand your knowledge and hone your skills but all I see at the moment is wasted energy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced at that as Light raised a single eyebrow at that while Chon grunted, clearly not liking where the speech was going. Still they remained silent as Ozpin continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Knowledge will only get you so far. More advanced weapons are only as good as their greatest weakness as they can be taken advantage of.\" Serious, Ozpin said. \"Knowledge, strength, weapons and tactics must all work in unison to achieve the status of a true Huntsmen or huntress. Your initiation begins tomorrow at sunrise; be ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he walked away from the group as Yang took one of Light's arms. \"Come on, big guy!\" Smiling, she said. \"I'll show you to the dorms!\" She winked. \"I'll then show you your dorm. Growl...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny suppressed a giggle as Yang lead Light ahead of the others while Rose motioned to a different direction. \"The exchange student dorms are down that hall.\" Kindly, she said. \"You will find your names posted on the doors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We each get separate rooms?\" Curious, Chon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's one large dormitory with several bedrooms.\" Smiling, Rose said. \"We are used to hosting large amount of exchange students.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryan's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell Yang's dragged Light off, good luck to him. Something tells me the dude's gonna wind up getting manhandled or having his world turned around by that chick, well so long as nothing gets broken I think it will be nice to have Light get to know her better. They do seem to get along pretty well, both tend to be in your face in battle too. Still remember the fight they last had, the field was pretty much wrecked and Light's head was buried in the ground. Turns out Yang piledrived him, Light's gotta weigh well over 250 pounds. So that's pretty damn impressive I gotta say, and if there's one thing Light respects it's strength. It was how I first recruited him in the first place, when I mistook him for a wandering vagrant in Starmage's forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes he know what love is though? Ah there's not much point in thinking that, he'll just be happy that there's someone other than me who can kick his ass. Ruby leads us to a hallway and points down it and says \"Right, there's your rooms. If your wanting anything just give me a shout guys, you'll be wanting a tour round Beacon later right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod and say \"Yeah, we're going to be here for a week right? Better check everything out and all, but first things first. Guys let's unpack.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Ruby exited as me looked at the rooms, Jenny's was next to mine. But she looked at me and winked, with that we tore the name down and got our stuff unpacked. Me and Jenny can share a bed no problem, she's a cute little kitty after all. And very flexible at that too, though I'm not sharing any of her secret moves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Chon he's unpacked all his stuff as quick as he could, all nice and simple to find. There's a saying, some blind people know their homes better than those who can see. Chon certainly proves it true, he's got his stuff built to last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy simply has three things, books, sketchbook and clothes. She had requested a big shelf in her room, and she's already got four rows filled. Something tells me there's hexes laden in them for those who pick them up and open them wrongly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunar's room isn't really a room, it's more like a science lab. There's all sorts of odd machines in there, but if it what she requires to sustain herself that's all that matters. Sho's is pretty simple, being that he's from another time he doesn't really have many personal belongings other than his JSDF officer uniform. Which he will be wearing for the Beacon Academy test tomorrow. Charlie and the V girls aren't doing the test, but they're staying close just in case. Chon would go apeshit if anything happened to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we're all done Light is now entering, dipping his head under the door frame so he doesn't clonk his head on it. Yang's still on his arm too and she says \"Right this is where your at Light, I'll see you around.\" and then the blonde woman stands on her tiptoes and mutters something into Light's ear before giving him a wink and waving goodbye to us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny's tufts of fur wiggle slightly and she giggles, my girlfriend mutters \"Yang just said, meet me outside my dorm at six. They'll be out by then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snicker, Light's gotten himself a date it seems. He probably doesn't know it, as I said he's pretty dim. But hey, it might work out nice for him too.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Light's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang said to meet her at six, where her dorm was. Now if there's one thing that I'm good at it's not getting lost, before I came to Starmage I spent a lot of time wandering. So I learned over time to get a good knack for where I was generally speaking, and so that meant I remembered where Yang's staying. Don't know what she wants, maybe Yang wants to have another fight! I'd love that, that girl can punch like nobody's business. Plus she said she had this semblance thingy, that meant the harder she got hit the harder she gave back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn it's awesome, mean I never got piledrived into the ground so hard. Must have been slammed from about 60 feet when she did that, people can talk about their ideals and all that other crap. But truth is, I really care about one thing. If someone can fight or not. And Yang, well she's beaten me in the past. That's good enough for me, only other person that's pounded the shit out of me was the boss. She's pretty too, I ain't had any other girls talk to me side from those who stay in the dorm. Most girls I'm told are kinda scared bout me and my height, though Yang seems to like it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm dressed in a pair of black jeans with boots, a red jersey and my old leather jacket. I nicked it from a biker, one time I thought it was a panther. And me only knowing how to fight I clotheslined him off his bike and decked him the fuck out, then I realised who it was. I liked his coat though, and he was out. So I figured I needed it more than him. I ripped the sleeves off when they got in the way of using my blood, and right now I am going past various students. They're giving me weird looks, probably cause they ain't ever clocked me before. Whatever, chumps aren't worth my time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI enter the hallway, and sure enough Yang's there leaning on the wall. She has a little grin on her face too as she looks me up on down, her eyes fall on my magically enchanted tattoos that are visible out of my jacket. That or my biceps, but she then looks me in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there big boy. Was kinda worried you lost your way.\" Yang playfully mutters while sticking out her tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response I chuckle and fold my arms while saying \"I've learned to adapt to new surroundings, so were you wanting anything lady?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang puts a finger to her lip in thinking, before giving a little grin and saying \"Well I was thinking some quality time, just the two of us. I gotta admit Light, your the most well built out of your group. And I like what I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she likes the way I look? Odd. I mean I don't exactly focus on my body all that much, Lunar has to remind me to wash my hair often and shower everyday. But I did before we went to Beacon, so that's probably why. Truth be told the reason I look the way I do is because of my past, Yang doesn't know. I should tell her, because it'll be for the best. She deserves it, boss says trust is important. And if Yang can beat me up, well I trust her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well um....thanks. I'm impressed too Yang, mean hell you managed to beat me. And only my boss has ever done that, if you want to spend time with me that's fine. Are we gonna fight again?\" I say, a hint of excitement in my voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang walks up to me and lightly punches me in the arm before saying \"There I win again, now come on.\" and with that Yang grabs my hit arm and......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Light's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Night on the town?\" I inquired, that sounded kinda boring if you ask me. Mean Yang's cool to hang around with, but I don't really care bout this new world. What I wanna do is take on some of those grimm creatures, I hear some are as giant as Starmage's main building. Now that's something I would just love to punch the shit out of, I think that Ozpin guy said they are focused on negative emotions. Well in combat I don't have any, I see a horde of those things running at me. And I'm gonna feel like a kid at Christmas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, there's this one place I know of. Just wait and see.\" Yang says, she's dragging me along. But I quickly move to match her pace, and sure enough we're outside Beacon. The sun's set already, and I've had dinner. Raw meat, good thing about my life so far is I can eat that and not have the side effects. We're past the gates, and to a sort of parking lot. Where I see a bike that Yang takes me to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hrm, nice bike you got there Yang.\" I state, big and powerful. Just the way I like em.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response Yang gives me a beaming smile and says \"Thanks big guy, got a spare helmet for you. Stick it on, I know you can't get killed from something as simple as falling off it. But safety first you know.\" the helmet's yellow. I give a little chuckle and stick it on, nice and fits like a glove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm no stranger to riding shotgun on bikes, did it with Carlson a few times in the past. So I know what to do, once Yang gets on I sit behind her. And wrap my arms around her waist, Yang lifts her head up a little and mutters \"Mhm, a bit higher and a bit tighter~\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThought I was doing that, but alright. My arms are above the belly button, and as tight as I can go without busting ribs. Yang settles into before saying \"Now hold tight, cause your world's gonna get rocked....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she revs the bike I smile, before saying \"Awesome.\" with that we speed onto the road. Yang's going fast here, and I feel the open air rush past my bare arms. As I have so many times beforehand, as we drive past various cars and other things on the road I shout over the din of the engines with \"Can you give me a hint on where we're going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh just sit tight big boy, you'll get a fight don't worry.\" Yang shouts in response. I smile, good. If there's something I like it's busting heads, one of the reasons I stick with my boss is because I know he's going to get into some deep shit. And then I can punch the fuck out of it, one time I actually fought a real fallen angel. And I beat her, beat a fucking fallen angel. Too bad her master showed up to take her away. I ain't gonna tell Yang that though, she'd probably not believe it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough we're in the city, it's now night. And from what I can see as we're driving around it's looking like a seedy part of this city, there's one thing I do know. Seedy places mean you can get into fights, that's more than enough to convince me to look forward to what Yang's got in store for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang parks the bike next to a swanky looking place, kinda jarring with how the rest of this street looks. I take my helmet off and say \"We here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet Light, er John. Let's get these helmets off and lockup the bike.....\" she says, Carlson reminded her to use that name when I'm in public. Something to protect me from those who made me, even if they're not in this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we're off the bike Yang grabs me by the arm and leads to the big door, she opens it and I'll admit. This place is pretty damn fancy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/8/8c/Yang2.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20130822164858\" target=\"_blank\">http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap! Boss she's here again! And she brought company!\" one guy shouts, instantly the music stops. And a heck of a lot of guns are pointed at us, and those who aren't are suddenly exiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you lot, I'll take a strawberry sunrise. One of those little umbrellas. John are you wanting anything?\" Yang says, playing it totally cool in spite of all the guns pointed at us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smirk, looking at the thugs here. I point to a random one and say \"You, I want your hat, your glasses and your coat. And I'll drink a pint of vodka, no ice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You again?! Fuck's sake!\" a man loudly grumbles, I can tell from the way he looks that he's probably the owner of this place. And he knows Yang too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Junior, I got a new guy in school here. Figured I'd take him here for a good time.\" Yang says as she steps to the side and displays me. I simply fold my arms and grunt to this Junior dude. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunior really doesn't seem very happy, he throws his glasses away and says \"Well guess what? Your not getting out of here alive, you and that idiot! Get them!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang readies her weapons, those fancy gauntlet thingies that shoot shotgun shells. And she turns her head and smiles. \"You like to fight don't you? Think of this as a welcome to Remnant gift Light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAh, so that's what she intended? Heh I won't turn this gift down, I quickly get my coat hanging and tied around my neck. \"I can't wait for when I get to kill big grimm, but this will be a nice little appetiser. Feeding time!!!\" I say as I run at the array of goons. I love my job, get to meet new people everyday. And punch the shit out of them.</span></div></div>",

I did not need an excuse to bust their heads; I made a note to maybe thank them later. The first punch hit me and I laughed! The second and third punch came and I laughed harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang was already knocking the thugs out left and right. Only I wanted to savor this fight, the first one in another world. \"Is that what you guys call a punch?\" Laughing, I asked. \"Let me show you how its done!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI threw a fist into the first thug, sending him flying off the ground, into the second thug! They both crashed to the floor with a crack, knocking them both out. The third thug drew a sword, slicing a deep cut into my bare arm before I caught it by the blade. Blood dripped out of the cut for a second before it healed completely in the next second. No blood was coming out of my hand; it had been cut so many times, it had formed a sort of callus that acted like a natural armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait your turn.\" Smiling, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pulled the sword out of the thug's hand and beat him senseless with the hilt before tossing it aside and running to the next group of men. These guys had pulled out pistols which made me smile as the tattoos on my body slowly vanished from sight. This was just what I needed, a good old fashioned bar brawl! I leaped high into the air and slammed my fist onto the floor, sending the men flying in all directions! They were quick to recover and began to fire their guns at me! I drew my sword and knocked the bullets away like so many pesky flies before slamming it onto the floor, cracking the very foundation of the night club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Run if you wish to live!\" Flashing a toothy smile, I declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI so wanted to knock them all into next week but I did not want to get carried away. The boss would certainly have a word with me later if he got wind of this so I decided to give the punks one chance to not fight me but simply run away. Most did but a few I guess were just too thick. I dealt with them with a simple smack of the side of my sword, sending them flying out the main entrance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was fun!\" Grinning at Yang, I said. \"Think they'll still give us our drinks?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Best part is I can get away with it too, I gave them one chance to walk away. But as it turned out I sent them packing anyway! Fancy how that works! Yang hears my words over the din of all the ruckus and responds with \"Maybe, hey Junior! We'll pay double if you serve us what we wanted, cause we're such nice folks aren't we John?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHah! In response I plant my sword on the ground, and lean on it with my arm drooped lazily over the hilt. Remember it's more or less a big stone pillar, and just as tall as my Sis. I then grin and say \"Yeah, mean I like to fight but if you give us what we want then I'll be happy. Know what? Fuck it I don't want the drink, get down here so I can beat the shit out of you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunior has some sort of weapon in his hands, but he simply scoffs and puts his hand in his mouth. Giving a loud whistle, shortly after a pair of chicks show up. They look about a year younger than Yang, and they're pretty fancily dressed too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby/images/6/61/Melanie_and_Militia.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/640?cb=20130626081623\" target=\"_blank\">http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/rwby...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look Sis.\" the red one says as they stand by both sides of Junior, she folds her arms. I look at those claws she's got on, kinda reminds of that what's his face. The one from Street Fighter that had the claw, was it Vega or Balrog? I can't remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems the annoying lady brought a stupid man with her, what a pair they make.\" the white one says. In response I spit at the floor and flip the bird at them. Yang simply smirks and reloads her shotgun gloves, it seems she's a bit more serious now. I reckon she's mixed it up with them in the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough! Militia! Melanie! Dispose of these freaks!\" Junior says as he prepares his weapon. The next thing I know he's firing a rocket right at me! My eyes go wide, but I quickly react. I grab the missile with my free hand, it's still trying to move but I've got hold of it. And I quickly toss it behind me so it's out the way, and not a second too soon. The one with the claws, I think her name is Militia is rushing right at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe leaps high in the air and both her claws are primed to stab me, but I quickly lift my weapon to block. Militia takes the chance to use the sword to leap backwards off of it, I stagger back but manage to keep hold of what I'm using. Come to think on it, I haven't named this weapon yet. Guess I'll call it The Stone Wall, cause really it's just a giant heap of concrete that's been fused with dust and my blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI move it out the way, and use my free arm to grab Militia by one of her boots. She clearly wasn't expecting this and I quickly spin around with her held in my grasp, and toss her to the bar. Where she quickly rotates herself and kicks off the wall, and the speed she moves at prevents me from blocking this time. One of the downsides of my weapon is in spite of my power I still can't just lift it at a moment's notice, it is a block of stone after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I get a hard slash across the chest, cutting my jersey open. And I feel the trickle of blood from my belly, I might be able to use aura to prevent this. But why bother, I like getting hit. Besides I heal fast anyway, Militia quickly goes for another stab. In fact both her claws impale me in the chest, and I droop my head to get a good look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWoah, it's about five inches in. Not bad, but I've had worse. I suddenly jerk my head up and give Militia a Glasgow kiss. That's a headbutt if you don't know. I hit her with enough force to dislodge her claws from my chest, and she's reeling. I bring my sword up, and it's gonna hurt. That I promise, but when the sword is brought down Militia managed to roll out the way. Leaving only a big ol crater where she was. I click my tongue, and out the corner of my eye I can see Yang's fighting that Melanie woman. And she's doing pretty good too, even getting round Junior's rockets too. Damn that's good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly turn my attention back to my opponent, she's running in again to try and stab me. But I use my free hand to grab her neck and hold her in place, I then quickly swing my sword in reverse grip style. The centre of the blade connects with her chest, and I proceed to grab it with both hands and lift it and quickly slam it down into the ground. Militia lets out a loud cry of pain, not surprising considering she just got sandwiched. And then I heft The Stone Pillar off of her and proceed to grab her by the leg again, she's still breathing but she's out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so I quickly spin around a couple of times, before throwing her out the nearest window. That's taken her out of the fight, Junior clocks me though and quickly fires another missile at me. Shit, I can't tank it directly as I'll be blown to pieces. I can come back sure but it'd take too long, and if I dodge it Militia might get hit in the blast thanks to being on the other side of the wall. Only one thing for it......gotta time it just right and.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBam. I uppercut the missile and roll to the side. The ceiling falls where I was, but crisis averted. Just how the boss would have wanted it. I quickly look to Yang and nod to her, Yang returns it and punches her gauntlets together. She's activated her semblance it seems, aw sweet. I promptly begin running, Yang's probably gonna let me have some of the scraps. And as I run forward I can see something falling, it's a strand of Yang's hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh shit........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang's clocked it, and she's like even more angry. So much so, that it's actually making me hesitate. But then I remember she's on my side, and I run in close. Yang suddenly slides in and nails Melanie hard with a gut punch, sending her right to me. Batter up, I swing for the fences. My sword collides with the enemy's back, and she gets sent right to the ceiling. And falls down like a sack of spuds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat just leaves that Junior guy, he's pissed me off. Cause he fired two rockets at me, and here comes another one. You know what? I'm sick and tired of it. I drop my sword and grab the projectile with both hands, I stagger backwards but then I suddenly rotate and let the missile loose back to where Junior fired it. I can hear him mutter something, probably that's he shat himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJunior's knocked off his perch, and goes flying towards us. Yang cuts him off mid air, with a massive punch right at the unexposed ribs. And the guy makes a big impact on the wall, and nearly gets peeled off of it and lands on the ground in a heap. He lets out a little groan before passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang lands, and lightly pants. Well that's that huh? Guess it was a nice warmup, it'll do till I fight some Grimm. I put my sword upright and lean slightly on it, Yang catches the noise and turns to me. And suddenly she runs up to me and jumps at me with a laugh, on reflex I drop the sword and both my arms catch her legs. And the next thing I know she wraps her arms around my neck and is kissing me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is the second time I've been kissed, Lunar did it to me one time as an experiment to find out what it was like. But this is different, whereas Lunar was curious. Yang had a lot of passion behind hers, it's as if she's trying to express her power via this. Her legs wrap around my waist, not to put pressure on me. But merely to remain close to me, my arms keep her upper body in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about a minute of this Yang pulls away and leans her forehead on mine. \"Hrmm, think of that as a victory prize. Was that good John?\" she purrs out into my ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang, that was tasty. I'd like more.\" I say, I'm about to lean in for some more. But Yang puts her finger on my lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd love to big guy, but we should get moving. Before the cops come.\" she responds, with that she gets away from me and walks to the entrance. Making sure to have her hips sway as she does so, I smirk before picking up my giant stone sword. And it slowly vanishes, it has my blood in it. Meaning I can control it, so I can dismiss it at will.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Light's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a good thing that me and Yang bolted when we did, I could swear I heard police sirens out in the distance. I know I can handle a few chumps in uniform, but I'd rather not as it's not them I fear. It's my boss, he's way more scary. Why? Cause he's beaten me in the past that's why, Yang too. But the same time, I guess getting my ass kicked by them let me trust them. Might makes right as the saying goes, and that's something I can certainly abide by. I like to hang with people who can fight good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang's driving a bit on the aggressive side, pretty sure we just went though a red light there. My boss says you can't do that, but fuck it. She's the one driving, I'm just the guy who's stuck at the back. Yang shouts to me over the din of the traffic with \"We're gonna nip down to a pier not too far from here, lay low for a bit before heading back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI say nothing, but I give a grunt to say yeah. All I need to do is hold tight and let her lead, everything's a blur. Though the police aren't around it seems, and I doubt that Junior prick is gonna tell on what we did. He's a criminal and I reckon the police know it too, who are they gonna trust? Yang takes the bike to an alley, and then into a neat little place. She turns the engine off and pauses, before taking the helmet off and sighing. I remove my helmet and give a chuckle. \"I'm never one to run from fights, but I think it was good we bolted.\" I mutter, tapping the helmet a little with my knuckles before handing it to Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirks in response and hooks the helmets to her bike, as I get off I can smell the seawater close to us. Yang probably went here in the past, there's the door to what looks like a mini pier. Yang wraps her arm around me and leads me to the door of it, and pushes it open. \"C'mon John, let's kip here. The fuzz won't check for us here, it's abandoned.\" she says. Well there's a few boats, but on closer inspection they do look pretty worn down. Fine by me, I kinda like the smell of the ocean. When I lived on my own I'd catch fish with my bare hands and use a twig to rip the scales open, they say raw fish is done in Japan. But I have it fresh out the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang leads me to the end of the pier and sits down, I do the same and we let our legs dangle off it. I give a sigh as I put my hands on my knees while Yang leans back and puts her palms against the wood. \"You know Light.....you fight like a beast. Where'd you learn to do that?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to that I'm silent, Yang picks that up. No doubt I'm generating this wave of anger, she leans towards me. \"Is there something wrong Light?....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh and nod, but before Yang can say that I don't have to tell her if I don't want to I say \"I was a human lab-rat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a pause of silence, Yang is silent briefly before saying \"What? You mean your some kind of super solider?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA snort escapes my lips \"Pretty much, the people who made me did all sorts of things to me. They didn't care about my say in it, they just wanted a weapon that could beat the shit out of things. They succeeded in that at least, because I broke free and killed them. Well most of them anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah.....Light that's.....\" Yang mutters, I risk a glance over to her and I see concern in her eyes. I look down at the murky water and see my reflection in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm, they got what they wanted but they couldn't control it. When I broke out, all I could think about was fighting. I picked fights with anyone and anything that came near me, I relished the feeling that I got from winning, from crushing anything that stood before me. Bears, humans, you name it. I became a fucking monster who was only focused on destruction.....\" I mutter, I give a heavy sigh after it all. Memories of my time wandering, with only a pair of ragged white trousers. I kill a bear in one punch to the head, and then I rip it open and feast on it's guts without even roasting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang says nothing at first, but she puts a hand on my back. My instinct tells me to freeze up, and I do. But Yang keeps her hand in place, and eventually my body accepts it. And she then says \"So how did you meet Carlson then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI give a chuckle to that and say \"I wandered onto the forest near Starmage, Carlson's a prefect there you know. And he caught me and demanded to know what I doing, probably thought I was some random bum from a looney bin. And he ends up kicking my ass, first time anything ever beat me. And I'm laying there flat on my back, and I'm just muttering for him to finish me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang gives a laugh and says \"Course I'm the second person who's kicked your ass, I got the right cheek. Anyway go on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Carlson's a nice guy, so he doesn't kill me. Instead he asks who the hell I am and everything, and it was pretty surprising. No one ever bothered to sit down and talk with me, but we chatted and I told him everything. I didn't know that I had things to hide. We came back to the place where I was made, everyone's long gone. But I put the place to the fucking torch, anything I couldn't burn I blew up.\" I still remember the smell of the fires, and the sounds of glass cracking. It makes me feel happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you did Light, you found some peace with it. I can tell.\" Yang says comfortingly, she leans closer into me. And I welcome it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So once that was done, I turned to Carlson. And swore that I'd follow him no matter what, the guy helped me when I needed it and I'd help him the only way I knew how. Follow him to hell and back.\" I mutter, it's actually really nice being able to tell someone outside of my dorm what happened to me. Feels.....liberating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang turns my head to face hers, her fingers under my chin. She has a warm smile on her lips and whispers \"You know, hearing all that. Just makes me like you more big guy, could you do me a favour?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI say nothing, but simply nod. And she mutters \"Hold still.......\" she leans in and kisses me. Once on the cheek, then on my lips. I've done this before, Lunar was curious about it. But it's different with Yang, Lunar was curious. But Yang, she knows what she wants. She's aggressive, and I love it. We're making out now, her hands run around my chest. My hands go to her hair, Yang flinches briefly. But she lets me do it, perhaps as a display of our trust. And for now I forget my troubles and issues, all that matters is Yang.......</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>Light's POV</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter we had finished making out, Yang sighed and looked up at thew night sky. \"My mother sort of ran off after Ruby was born.\" Softly, she said. \"It had been just her, dad, and I with Uncle Qrow sometimes making an appearance. I had searched for her but to no avail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she leave any clues?\" Concerned, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang frowned. \"Not one.\" Sadly, she said. \"All I know is that she is fighting some secret enemy somewhere and that I'm not ready to join her.\" She sighed. \"That's the real reason I train so hard! Why I must be the best of the best no matter what!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, only two people have ever defeated me.\" Smiling, I said. \"As far as I'm concerned, you are among the best in the world.\" I took her hand, looking into her eyes. \"I'll help you find your mother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang smiled. \"I appreciate that but I already tried everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckled at that. \"We have not tried anything yet.\" Softly, I countered. I grabbed my cellphone, what this world called a Scroll and called Matt Moray. He answered with a grumpy, \"Make it quick, Light I'm in the middle of a crucial test!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have the equipment needed to see through the eyes of everyone on the planet?\" Bluntly, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's three AM you vexatious, Irksome...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Answer the question you preadolescent virgin weakling!\" Snapping, I yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt jumped, blushing brightly. \"You don't have to get personal about it...\" Tearing up, he moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned away from the phone so Matt would not see me wince slightly. I knew I was going to hear about that one from the boss in the morning. I turned back to the phone and more calmly said, \"Yang's mother has gone missing and is assumed to be in mortal danger; can you find her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt was silent for a moment before his expression turned to that of grave seriousness. \"Sorry, I do not possess the needed mental energy to conduct a world wide search, especially an alien world.\" Flatly, he replied. \"However, I can help narrow down your search.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" Looking at the phone, Yang demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt sighed. \"It's a device that can hack into any camera in the world through the computer network; built specifically for this world.\" Softly, he said. \"No one below government level is supposed to have it so, if you get caught with it...\" He smiled. \"Just say you confiscated it from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will you say then?\" Curious, Yang asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt chuckled. \"I'm a mad scientist. I'm addicted to new technology; I can't help myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then ended the call just before a laptop computer appeared in my lap with a note that stated:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Load in an image of your target and press enter.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang smiled. \"I have an image of my mom on my scroll! We can find her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI closed the laptop and stood up. \"Not yet.\" Calmly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang looked at me disappointed. \"Huh? Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed then replied...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This was too easy; that and I guess I struck a nerve when I snapped at him. I knew there would be a catch if we blindly use this tech without first making sure it was all on the level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We want to do this right, Yang.\" Calmly, I said. \"If your mother is anything like you, she will be very careful when it comes to covering her tracks and i can only assume that she knows you are looking for her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only why would she avoid me?\" Looking hurt, Yang asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the same reason Ryan works so hard to keep Charlie out of harms way.\" Serious, I replied. \"He's a tough kid and he's going to go far but he still has a lot to learn before he can deal with half the shit Ryan and I face back at Starmage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang nodded. \"When do you think would be the right time?\" Hopeful, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled. \"When we know this thing will do what Matt says it can.\"  Calmly, I said. \"The brat may be a mad scientist but he's also only seven. If he stole this, returning it may allow us access to more powerful equipment to narrow down the search more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang smiled at that. \"Good idea!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us made out a bit longer before heading back to the school. Upon returning to our dorm, I took the laptop to Ryan and explained the situation in case the brat squealed on me about my snapping at him, calling him a virgin weakling. After hearing my report, Ryan sighed and said, \"The machine is a prototype Ironwood asked Matt to test for him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Seeing their disappointment, I added, \"You could argue that this would be a good test for the device as Yang's mother is no doubt being careful not to be found unless she wants to be found.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang's smile returned, knowing I had a good point. Only her smile turned to that of concern as an explosion was heard from Matt's room followed by a high pitched maniacal laughter. \"Eureka!\" Ecstatic, he screamed. \"Spice exists in this world! Spice exists!\" He gave another maniacal laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he alright?\" Half grinning, Yang asked. \"I knew he was a little off from the moment I first saw him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt then came out of his room, covered from head to toe in a fine black ash from the explosion minus the goggles he was wearing over his eyes. He turned to Yang and lowered the goggles, revealing a clean spot where they were on his face, making him look ridiculous. \"Hey, Yang!\" Smiling, he said. \"Did you find your mother yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang grabbed the grinning kid by the collar, scowling at him. \"You didn't tell us we needed permission to use the device!\" Annoyed, she hissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt laughed before vanishing from Yang's grasp to reappear on the other side of the room. \"Do you seriously take me for a novice buffoon?\" Amused, he asked. \"I got permission from Ironwood before I sent it your way only you only got twenty four hours.\" He paused, looking at his watch. \"Sorry, twenty hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay...\" Smiling again, Yang said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew that she did not know what to make of the little brat. Truth be told, I didn't either. The kid was even stranger than his older brother, Tex. Still, Sho knew how to get through to him so at least he was a little more controllable. Matt motioned for Light to place the device onto a table which he did and Matt began to work the controls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All we need is an image of your mother.\" Simply, Matt said. \"That and a small sample of DNA.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Curious, Yang asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt grinned then summoned a brush to his hand. Seeing it, Yang gasped and yelled, \"That's mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you rather I pluck a hair from your head?\" Smiling Matt inquired. \"This is necessary for the machine to do its job so stop whining.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang grabbed the brush back from Matt, huffing. The kid ignored her and worked the controls. Within minutes the machine beeped. \"Eureka!\" Yelled Matt. He then chuckled and added, \"Damn, she's good!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you find my mother?\" Anxious, Yang demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt grinned then replied, \"Your mother is jumping all over the board, I can't get a fix on her.

Why's Yang's Mom hiding? I thought parents are supposed to stick around to see their kids grow up, that's what Ryan said. Me I didn't have any family so to say growing up, with being bred to be a weapon through and through. I remember one time I punched a tree with magic so hard it actually turned into a book, filled with pages of me screaming as it turned out. Jane is my Sister technically speaking, not by blood but we're raised by the same bastards it turns out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt's pushing Yang's buttons, not a good idea but I don't bother to act on it. He'll get to the point, and sure enough he plays ball. Even if he doesn't know exactly where Yang's mom is he'll be able to figure out the most likely place, it's the best Matt can do here it seems. Damn this woman must be a, who do you call him? Harry Houdini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The South? But there's nothing there but ruins and grimm for miles, least the parts that aren't properly guarded.\" Yang says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's exactly the point. A place that hardly any normal people would go to, but someone of tremendous skill could survive and kill Grimm often.\" Matt replies with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grunt in the affirmative, I might not be smart but I can see the logic there. I decide to speak up and say \"She might have a base there, secluded. Can fight Grimm whenever, not too far from where everyone lives. It's the best place to be, Chon would do something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan nods before saying \"How far are we talking here Matt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt sighs and says \"It's about a day's trip, see this diagram here?\" Matt displays a map that has various shades of red. \"The red is for how concentrated the Grimm are overall. Yang's Mother is just above the medium level, enough to ward off casual wanderers but enough to give weaker hunters pause for concern.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go.\" I state with no hesitation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang begins to speak but I say \"I know, your coming too aren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirks and says \"I was worried you were going to say you'd do it alone, worried about me are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI simply nod, but I know how tough Yang is. With me there she'll be fine. \"Ozpin might wonder where you've gone you know......\" Ryan says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he goes on with \"But he'll figure it out. Get packing the pair of you. Yang, are you going to tell Ruby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang hesitates, bites her lower lip. Then she says \"Yeah, she'll probably try to follow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll bring her around.\" Ryan says, with that he smiles and exits the room. I exchange a wink with Yang and head out, I'll need some stuff to bring. This is going to be a nice trip I think.........</span></div></div>",

However, it also had a miniature jet engine in the back for maximum speed and the wheels turned up for flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here we are.\" Looking about, Yang said. \"Only I don't see my mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hit a button on my wand, sealing the rift before pointing to a wall of trees in the near distance. \"There is their camp.\" Calmly, I said. \"Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe rode to the front entrance of the camp where we were met by two guards. One was a young, gangling man with long dirt blond hair wearing worn out jeans, shirt and jacket. He had tattered shoes on his feet and a makeshift gun with a blade tied on the end. \"Talk about low budget.\" Grinning, Light muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm having a bad day, whoever you are.\" Scowling, the man said. \"I think I'll take it out on you three to put a smile on my face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead and try.\" Cracking a grin, I countered. \"I'm sure Light could use a good laugh.\" I then turned serious, snapping my fingers. All of my shadow wolves appeared, growling and snapping at the startled man. \"Open the doors or fight for your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man gulped then reluctantly opened the doors. We rode in with others following us until we reached the main tent. There we dismounted our rides and waited until a tall woman with waist length black hair stepped out. She wore red armor with high heeled boots and a grim face mask covering her face. After a short pause, she removed her mask revealing a surprisingly soft face with red eyes. It was Yang's mother, Raven. \"Yang.\" Flatly, she said. \"After all these years, you finally found me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know I searched for you.\" Annoyed, Yang countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you found me.\" Unfazed, Raven replied. \"Your persistence and drive served you well; I'm proud of you.\" She smiled slightly. \"Only who did you bring with you? A boyfriend perhaps?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang blushed brightly, though she tried to hide it. I decided to jump in before it became too awkward for my taste. \"I am prince Matt Moray; heir to the throne of all mad scientists on Earth.\" Boldly, I announced. \"I hath brought Yang and her acquaintance here upon their request.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't ask you, boy.\" Coldly, Raven snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care.\" With equal coldness, I countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI allowed my eyes to glow for a moment to push my point across. What many people did not know was the fact I was my world's Fall Knight. I had powers that went beyond extreme and with them, the responsibility to protect one of four ancient relics that protected my world from utter chaos and destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven blinked, showing a hint of surprise then turned away from me to face Yang. \"Right; well, I'm certain you have questions so i will be happy to answer any you may have. You are all free to spend the night. I'll even have our cook whip something up for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then turned to me, a hint of anger on her face. \"You I want to talk to in private!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frowned, sensing a great power within her. She obviously a knight herself or some Remnant equivalent there of. Finally, I scoffed and replied...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I am dressed in a sleeveless coat Carlson bought me. It was Japanese on the back for \"I crush you.\" according to him. No top under it, a pair of muddy blue jeans and black sneakers. I got bandages covering my arms to prepare my blood for attack just in case. Gotta admit one thing though. Damn, Yang's mom is hot! But I don't voice this, something tells me Yang wouldn't be happy to hear me state this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven does point me out though, I wave slightly. But to be honest I am not paying attention, I am only here to punch stuff that looks funny at Yang. Like that gate guard, Raven wants to speak with Matt. He responds by saying he wants me and Yang to speak to her first. Raven sighs and states \"Very well. Sit with me.\" and moves back into her tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put a hand on Yang's shoulder and say \"Are you sure you want me there? Remember we came here so you could speak to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang turns to look at me and puts her hand over mine. \"Please come on big guy, I trust you more than her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn. Boss always told me to respect my elders, funny cause mine tortured me. Same with Charlie, this woman left Yang with no Mom. I lean in close to her and mutter \"Don't be so quick to shout at her, remember we came here to find her. Not get angry. You told me negative emotions attract Grimm remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang simply nods to me, we move into the tent. Rather fancy, Raven is kneeling at a table in the middle of the room. I take my jacket off so its only on my shoulders now. Yang and I sit down opposite her. A few seconds of silence pass before Raven said \"Are you not going to introduce your boyfriend Yang?\" a hint of teasing in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy girl huffs quietly, I then cough and say \"I'm John, nice to meet ya.\" in the most polite tone I can get. Damn Yang your mom's hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven looks me up and down, I try not to squirm. She says \"I see my daughter has good taste in men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI huff and look sideways. Yang then says \"I'm not here to ask your permission on who to date. I have questions and I want you to answer them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNice, to the point. Raven rubs her chin and places her sword upright on her left shoulder. \"Go then.\" she states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you leave? Leave Uncle Qrow, Dad and Ruby and me?\" Yang says, leaning her arms close to the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI say nothing, simply fold my arms and look at Raven for her response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven......</span></div></div>",

I did not care how hot she was, she needed to come clean. I slammed my fist onto the table, visibly startling Yang and causing Raven to jump slightly. \"Damn it, lady!\" Annoyed, I snapped. \"You dance around a question more than Ozpin! If you know something, spit it out already!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven frowned at me, her eyes narrowing only to have me return the glare with sharper eyes. She blinked then smiled slightly at Yang. \"You sure know how to pick them, Yang.\" Almost kindly, she said. \"This boy seems to fear nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang smiled slightly in return. \"You should see him when he loses his head.\" Nudging me, she retorted. \"He takes brawling to an extreme.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI struggled not to blush, knowing Yang was referring to when I tried to sniff dust as if it were a drug and literally losing my head because of it. Raven merely gave a slight chuckle. \"Alright; I will tell you the whole story.\" Calmly, she said. \"Bear in mind though, it will be from how I see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and leaned back, expecting a long story. \"Go on.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaven told Yang and I her story, I watched for any holes in her tale as she and Ozpin seemed to like leaving out key facts which haunt them later. While we listened, other drama was being played out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chon's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was currently meditating in a forest clearing not too far from Beacon, to get better accustomed to this new world and its natural energy. I am told the Grimm live on negative emotions, I am glad then I sorted my personal baggage before I came to this place then. Don't want to make myself a massive target after all, I lost track of how much time I spent here, but I feel more in tune with my surroundings now. Speaking of which......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sense you.\" I mutter, its that girl from the hot springs. I can smell the grimm taint on her. She stands at least 7 feet away from me, I stand quickly but don't turn around yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only because I wished it to be so blind one.\" Mirage states with contempt in her voice. I clench my fists, I'd love to batter her but I don't know how powerful she is. Better play carefully now until I can get into position to run......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want from me? I'm just a blind young man.\" I say, taking a step to the left. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirage chuckles and says \"No, I sense your power. The life energy, its anathema to my fellow grimm. You need to be dealt with, I just so happened to come across someone from your world who just so happened to draw me to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lift my head, suddenly a rattle of the nearby bushes comes a blur of red chi energy. I quickly roll to the side to avoid it. Something grazes my chin however leaving a cut, I stood up and rubbed it with my hand. I get a feel of what this person looks like......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/25192079144035080/?lp=true\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/25192079...</a>  (First one on the left)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasp quietly, this girl is blind like I am. Mirage laughs and states \"Now I can crush you without even thinking, however I felt it more ironic your removed by a blind person. This one was trained from birth by rogue witches to kill. That's right, a gift from your world. Now begone.....\" Mirage vanishes from the place leaving me with this woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Away with you assassin!\" I shout, drawing my hook swords from my back and leaping at her intent on driving my hooks into her shoulders. She however moves out her palm and blasts me back with her magic, I can tell its that. She radiates it, and her chi is red. Intent on ending me, many have tried. None succeeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI land on my feet though I skidded back a fair distance away, her power is indeed very considerable. But there's something......primal about it, like wild and untamed. She's not formally trained like the Harrisons, but still powerful. No doubt amplified by her rage. I take a step forward only to feel a sharp pang in my cheeks. Next thing I know I stagger to one knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy head feels numb, suddenly I realise. She's poisoned me! Those claws and the attack on my head, I detect her rushing at me in an effort to try and cut my head off. I quickly gather my energy and roll to the side. I must defeat this before its too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily this is not the first time opponents have tried to use poison on me, I quickly cover the wound with my hand. Using chi energy I focus on the point where the infection occurred, a blue glow emerges from it. I have already performed the act. I will need to avoid further injury until the poison is fully gone. I will not play around, my first strike must be a winning blow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI step back and jump into the air, I must assume she can detect me in a similar manner. I land on a tree and make sure the crunch of my feet on the wood is detectable. She tilts her head up and yells, running at me again and leaping into the air. Perfect. Now she can't dodge my next move. I jump at her, intent on delivering a major blow. She's not much of a tactical thinker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hook sword drives deep into her left shoulder, spraying blood from the wound as my weapon connects. I then grunt as I feel a pang in my gut, she drove her claw into my midriff. We fall to the ground in a messy heap. We pant quietly, my wound is an ideal place to spread the poison. But at the same time I delivered a strike near her heart. I use my chi energy to help resist the poison. She puts her hand on my side, I'm too weak to try and shove her aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You.....defeated me.\" she mutters. A voice that sounds oddly delicate in light of her murderous nature. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't say a word, she continues. \"What will happen to me? I....lived a life of pain, its always been with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis.....she sounds like me.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter I cleanse my poison I bite my lower lip. She says \"Please.....spare me.......in return I will serve only you......you......my life.....for yours.......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was like me, as I once was. I hear Carlson's voice shouting but I can't discern his words, I use my strength to put my hand over her wound. To try and heal with what energy I have left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt glows blue. Her mouth opens slightly and I pass out shortly after........I just hope its the right decision.......</span></div></div>",

Wondering where I was, I felt my body shift about. Next thing I know I was on what felt like an operating table, I heard other voices. There was Lunar, that monotone and polite way she talked requesting blood for me. Sho was there too, he was actually quite smart in terms of the medical arts. Probably there to shock me if I go under, but I won't. That woman relied on her poison rather than directly being lethal till the end. But still where did she pick up such a toxin? I want to ask where she was, it wouldn't be like Carlson to just leave the girl alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's his status?\" I hear Carlson ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"His wound to the gut is pretty bad, but the traces of poison we found are already removed. I expect Chon to make a full recovery.\" Lunar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's a relief. I simply relax, sometime later I come to. my chi senses returning. The familiar outlines of the people I know are around me save for Light, I hope his quest is going well. I try to rise, but my wound prevents me from doing so. Carlson puts a hand on my forehead and says \"Easy buddy, you took a heck of a stab wound there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh, holding the hands of Viva and Vogue. I then say \"How long was I out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well a few hours, its about 8PM now. You'll probably be good to go in 24 hours or so according to Lunar.\" Ryan states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air is silent, I was about to ask about the girl but Carlson beats me to it. \"We picked up the girl, she's in intensive care. That hooksword cut you did was a number on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was trying to end me.\" I mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlson puts his hands up and says \"I don't blame you, but we can at least ask her some questions. It seems she was wounded before you met her, like she has some serious scars. But it looks like she'll recover yeah, she was muttering her life was yours or something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bite my lower lip. \"I saved her. I don't know why I did.\" I groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did the right thing Chon. When she wakes up you should speak to her, I think you sparing her was the one nice thing that ever happened to her.\" Carlson rose from his seat. \"Sleep well pal, see you soon.\" I silently nod my head and Ryan takes the V twins out the room.</span></div></div>",

No hesitation either, like she believed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm silent for a few seconds, pondering this. I then say \"I didn't ask that. I asked if your well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can sense her mouth opening slightly, she quietly states \"I.....my wounds from our battle have healed if that is the answer you wish. No one has asked me about that in a very long time......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your name?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"..............\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response from her. \"You don't have one?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nods. \"As far as I can remember I have only ever been given terms like child or weapon.\" she states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will aid me then?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother nod. \"Again, my life for yours. I will abide by your judgement.\" she mutters as she sits in an Indian position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take me long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lean back on a wall and fold my arms. \"I know, you will be called Mang Zhao. Blind Claw.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl changes to a kneeling position on the bed and bows herself down. \"I will accept the name Master, I am ready to serve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrowning I say \"Don't call me Master, my name is Chon. Look I don't know what happened to you, but if your willing to follow me I'll do my best to help you. I will come by tomorrow to pick you up. Do not attempt to escape, prove your loyalty to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she abides by this I will trust her then. Mang bows to me and says \"I will do so. Will you require anything else of me? Am I allowed to defend myself if it is required?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI need to be specific? Oh boy. I sigh and say \"Only if your opponent is being stupid and waving a weapon in front of your face and being clearly intent on it. Now be well and I will pick you up tomorrow. Farewell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that I exit the room, and I walk to the wall opposite and slide down it somewhat. I then say to the nurse outside \"Keep an eye on her.\" before moving to exit the infirmary. Now I got a assassin to look after? Well she might know about Mirage, and it seems like she's on my side now. </span></div></div>",

My mind is always like a violent tornado, I've been in hospitals before. I escape each time, but I......don't want to this time. For some reason, I want to stay. I want to. Its because I have sworn to follow him. That man. Chon, he gifted me with a name. Mang. I like it already. I've been nothing but a weapon, a tool to be used and discarded. Is this what they call appreciation? I've.....never had that, I've seen it. But never.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA rustle of steps from the hall is detected by me, but its coming towards me. Stopping just outside my door, my magic flows through my body. It's wild and chaotic, but I can garner things from it to make up for my lack of sight. If its a nurse they will only poke their head in, I'm partially restrained. My master is testing me, I will not fail him. I will only attack if I am directly attacked. I don't have my claws, but my magic is powerful. I can turn a whole room ablaze with just a wave of my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens fully, its an attack. Surely. But I remain motionless, using my magic to lower my breathing to appear as if I am totally out. Its hard to keep me sedated, I've built up a resistance to general toxins among them. I feel a figure glide across the floor towards me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts her. The woman who ordered me to attack my new master. She now stands over me, I tense up my hands. Ready to unleash my pure and unbridled rage at the slightest provocation...\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have failed me, now you latch to the one who you tried to end?\" Mirage said tauntingly to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grit my teeth and say \"He has spared me and I have sworn to protect him for it. Harm him and I will destroy you no matter what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirage simply snickered and lifts a hand, instantly I move to attack. A ball of fire engulfing my left hand as I seek to uppercut her and smear the walls with her. She teleported somehow out of the way, standing back at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I will let you live, after all your just a weapon......\" Mirage mutters to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething inside me snaps, I fling a ball of magic energy at her. Just like the wind she was gone, and I broke the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nurse runs in, its one of those what do you call them....Faunus? I say \"You need to improve your security.

Ozpin and this character named Salem were lovers only now they were bitter rivals. Ozpin was cursed to live, die, and live again in the body of like minded people for all eternity while Salem was cured with immortality by two Gods; one of light and one of darkness. Ozpin was given a task by the God of light to unite the people of Remnant before their return or its game over for everyone on the planet.

If it is cosmically based then the power that granted her immortality would have to be removed from her being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can it be done either way?\" Frowning, Raven demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Matt shrugged. \"If it is elementally based then yeah, no problem.\" Calmly, he replied.

I try to get up, but it feels like a massive weight is on my entire body. At best I can lift my head upwards but that's about it, I grit my teeth. Trying my hardest to stand or at least sit upright. It was then that I hear footsteps walking towards me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning my head I see......Ruby? No, is it her? No it can't be, her cloak is white. She's taller too. \"You......are you?.....\" I mutter, for some reason my strength has also left me.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opens her mouth, but I can't hear her.

At first, I thought the dream was over but then I saw Summer fighting along side TaiYang, Qrow, and a woman I did not recognize. They were good, very good. In a way, they reminded me of my own crew in how well they worked together. Then I saw team RWBY fighting just as well against the same impossible odds before Summer's voice came through. It was melodious, like the cry of a dove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again and again Ozpin sends his chosen warriors against his rival and her chosen warriors in an endless waltz to end a curse they both share.\" Sadly, she said. \"Both are immortal only Ozpin is reborn in the body of an alike mind where his rival, Salem cannot die so long as the world turns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are their goals?\" Taken back, I demanded. \"What is their end game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Salem wants to end the world in a vain attempt to end her own life.\" Softly, Summer explained. \"Only her plan will only leave her alone once again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of Ozpin?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ozpin has been entrusted by the God of creation to preserve all life by uniting everyone.\" Calmly, Summer replied. \"Unfortunately, that includes Salem. If he fails, all life will be extinguished on this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nsummer then went on to explain the Salem and Ozpin were lovers but an illness had taken his life. Salem went to the God of creation to bring him back but was refused because of a delicate balance between life and death. Undeterred, Salem went to the God of destruction and pleaded for his help. It was granted but the God of created intervened. This led to Salem being punished with the curse of immortality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngered and wanting revenge, she used her curse to convince an army of humans that they can claim immortality by defeating their creators. This failed miserably and Salem was punished further by the God of Destruction by destroying all humans on the world except for her....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The God of creation brought the humans back to the world, now called Remnant, but with one strict condition.\" Sadly, Summer said. \"Ozpin had to unite all humans, despite their differences, and have them stop asking the Gods for favors. Once this was done, he would summon the Gods back with four relics to which humans will be judged...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was pale with the realization of the incredibly high stakes. \"Salem wants to collect the relics so to end all life on Remnant, hoping it will include her own.\" Softly, I said. \"Ozpin has been given the task to unite all humans which is no easy feat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are no longer lovers as both had changed so dramatically throughout the centuries.\" Sadly, Summer said. \"I died at the hands of an unknown foe but my will and silver eyes allow me to reach out to one with great power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we stop this?\" Serious, i demanded. \"How do we break this circle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummer gave me a sad smile \"Victory is in a simple soul.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo my surprise, I saw Charlie who smiled at me before putting up two fingers as he always did when we won a fight. \"V for victory!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bright light filled my vision again and I awoke with a start in a pool of sweat as Asura whispered in my mind... \"Charlie is apparently more powerful than anyone suspects.\"<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

I am hoping to hear form him soon with a solution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, Matt's cellphone rang and he answered, creating a holographic image of the head mad scientist, Devlin Moray. He sported an eighteenth century gentleman's suit with unusually long coat tails that moved about as if they had a mind of their own. He wore knee high riding boots, a top hat covering his raven black hair, and carried a silver tipped cane with a large diamond. His eyes hid behind round shining glasses while he held a toothy, almost sinister grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My humble apologies for making you wait so long, my dear impatient grandson.\" Grinning, Devlin said. \"I have coordinated my efforts with the new head witch to bring you the solution you seek but I fear it is not as simple as you may hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please convey the solution to us so we make haste to end the cycle of chaos and destruction.\" Serious, Matt said. \"This issue has gone on unresolved for far too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must first eliminate the Grim part of Salem's being.\" Serious, Devlin replied. \"It is that which blinds what is left of her morality and humiliation.\" He turned to Ruby Rose and Charlie. \"Unfortunately, it will take more than the power of one silver eyed warrior to accomplish this... she will need the power of a familiar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silver eyed warrior?\" Confused, Ruby asked. \"I- I don't understand...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevil smiled. \"You will understand when the time comes, my dear...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have what is required for phase one.\" Serious, Matt said. \"What is phase two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do not... a familiar requires a witch to activate his powers and a silver eyed warrior requires a catalyst to activate hers.\" Darkly, Devlin said. \"Full preparation or none that is the way of a chaotic scientist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will be prepared, sir.\" Serious, I said. \"Please, what is phase two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phase two involves suppressing Salem's magic.\" Serious, Devlin replied. \"Without her magic, she is no more of a threat than any other powerful being of Remnant.\" he raised a finger in warning. \"The magic dampening devices of our world is not any guarantee of success. Ensure they work perfecting on Remnant before placing any plan into motion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We know someone we can test this on.\" Serious, I said. \"What is phase three?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevlin frowned. \"The third and final phase is the most difficult.\" Serious, Devlin said. \"It involves forcing Salem to see her life flash before her eyes.\" He frowned deeply. \"This requires a simple soul with the power to share ones mind.\" he motioned to Charlie. \"Your young warrior is the only one who possesses this ability.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a familiar and a telepath?\" Surprised, Amy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevlin solemnly shook his head. \"Charlie Ren is more than any of you realize.\" Darkly, he said. \"It is the reason his family feared him so...\" He looked directly into Charlie's eyes. \"You, dear boy are a World Familiar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is that?\" Confused, Viva asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevlin was silent for a moment before replying, \"Charlie Ren's magical power is directly linked to the world he resides in.

Now we discover he is literally a magical juggernaut among rare familiars. \"Dr. Moriarty Strange said he was literally one in a billion.\" sighing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Poor kid...\" Wincing, Amy said. \"A bit of a shock I would guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you suppose we keep his powers a secret?\" Wincing, Jenny asked. \"If Ozpin has magic, he likely can sense it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will have to mask it.\" Calmly, Sho said. \"At least until we can discover exactly who this Salem is and what kind of defenses she has between herself and us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon nodded then turned to Viva and Vogue. \"You are not to use Charlie's familiar power unless there is no other option.\" Serious, he ordered. \"Is that clear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, BB.\" Nodding, Viva said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got plenty of magic to use all our own.\" Serious, Vogue added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are counting on your two to keep Charlie away from Ozpin and those in his inner circle.\" Calmly, I said. \"We have already been tested and proven to be hunters and huntresses and we should have our licenses for this world very soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If charlie is given one, we will know if Ozpin is on to his power.\" Serious, Sho said. \"We will need to confront him with this new information as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is when we will test the magic dampening device.\" Nodding, I said. \"If it works on him, we will know we have at least that part of Devlin Moray's plan prepared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charlie will also need training in how to focus that power.\" Serious, Jenny said. \"If he were to unleash it with no knowledge of how to control it...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a lot of work ahead of us.\" Firmly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the plan, boss?\" Standing up, John asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first thing we need to do is to get Charlie into secret training.\"  Serious, I said. \"We'll start with mental and physical focus. That is right up your alleys, Chon and Sho.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two nodded and began to discuss putting together a training regiment. I then turned to Jenny and Amy. \"He will then need magical training, which will be your jobs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two nodded and began to discuss how to train a boy in the use of magic. As they talked, I turned to Yang. \"I will need you to brief your team on the situation. Let them know what they are facing so we will be better ready when this Salem makes her move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang nodded and hurried out of the room. That left John, Lunar, and Matt. \"Lunar, I need you to seek out Winter and tell her we need to have a meeting with her and Ironwood, ASAP.\" Firmly, I said. \"Matt, I need you to produce a good amount of spice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly are we going to tell Ironwood?\" Curious, Lunar asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everything.\" Serious, I replied. \"The first rule of any military operation, know your enemy.\" I turned to Matt. \"We need bait to lure whoever is infiltrating us out into the open. They likely already know about your spice discovery.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt nodded. \"I will step up security.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded back. \"Have Lunar help you with that when she gets back.\" Finally, I turned to John. \"You are with me, we need to have another word with Ozpin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn nodded and we all began our part of my plan...<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Seeing his expression, I nodded. \"Perfect, the magic dampening device works on this world.\" Serious, I said. \"We have all that we need for phase two of our plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly lowering his hand, Ozpin asked.. \"Exactly what is your plan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to answer our question first.\" Folding my arms, I said. \"How far can we trust you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Salem cannot be killed.\" Sighing, Ozpin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is why you failed all these years.\" Serious, John said. \"The idea is not to kill her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin raised a single eyebrow to which I added, \"The idea is to remove her curse. Doing so will kill her once and for all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you have a plan to do this?\" Curious, Ozpin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"We do but we must first stop her latest plan, whatever it may be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am not sure of that myself.\" Softly, Ozpin said. \"I can tell you that she has powerful magic but I am hesitant to tell you where to find her.

He was a tall and muscular older gentleman with a thick eyebrows and mustache. He was dressed like a hunter of old from our world with what looked like a blunderbuss rifle with axe blades on the top and bottom near the hilt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Carlson, I understand that you and your party do not have team names but I ask that you form a party of four to come with me on a field trip to Mountain Glen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I ask why?\" Raising an eye brow, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can but I doubt my answer will be to your liking as it is clear you are on a mission of your own making.\" Serious, Port replied. \"Regardless of where you are from, you are registered students and will go where the professors instruct.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. There was no arguing that. \"Very well but I must insist we know what we are jumping into. Each member of my team...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could find themselves in any given situation at anytime.\" Serious, Mr Port interrupted. \"If you have as much faith in your team as you let on, they can handle your mission without four of you for a short time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll go with.\" Serious, John said. \"That makes two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Count me in.\" serious, Chon said. \"That's three.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPort nodded. \"Very good and the fourth member shall be Miss Don.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy turned to professor Port surprised. \"Me...?\" Port nodded. She sighed. \"Very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We leave immediately.\" Calmly, Port said. \"You have ten minutes to gather your weapons and a minimal amount of gear. We will be gone for three days.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's in Mountain Glen?\" Curious, Charlie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was an extension of Beacon long ago.\" After a pause, Port explained. \"However, it was abandoned after it became overrun with Grim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What brought the Grim?\" Wincing, Viva asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPort shrugged. \"The city became too big and emotions flared.\" Simply, he replied. \"It is negative emotions that attract the Grim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all nodded to that and prepared ourselves. After assembling our packs, I sheathed Asura while Chon did the same with his curved swords. Amy packed extra notebooks and sheathed her Rapier sword. John only packed a few light snacks and grabbed his stone sword. Port raised a single eyebrow but said nothing. He merely motioned the four of us to follow him out of the dorms to an awaiting airship. As my group boarded, he stopped me as I began to pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are receiving strange reports of unauthorized activity in Mountain Glen.\" Quietly, he said. \"Our mission is to investigate this... discretely. Brief your team on the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded then boarded the airship and we were on our way to begin our mission...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So this is kissing huh? I kinda like it, Carlson talks about it with Jenny. But I didn't think too much on it back then cause I never did it before, but here I am. Making out with Yang, She's so forward with this, her arms tightly wrapped around my neck and quietly panting as her tongue goes in and out. I'm acting on instinct and wrap my arms around her waist and stand up with her, Yang takes this vertical cue and wraps her legs around my waist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Light.....\" she mutters into my ear, it's a hungry and husky tone. Yang nibbles on my ear and I purr in delight as I carry her along the pier, I move to press her up against the wall that leads up to where the gate is. Yang leans back and wriggles up in my hold before grabbing the back of my head, promptly burying my head into her ample cleavage. I close my eyes and indulge in the warm and soft flesh as she cradles me there, her breasts form around my head. I can't remember the last time I felt so well cared for, Yang rests her head on top of mine and runs her hands through my hair kissing the top of my head after it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look up at her from her valley of flesh, she looks right happy. Yang leans in to kiss me again, I eagerly return it. After a few moments of this Yang says \"Light we should probably get home. Your gonna need some rest for tomorrow.....\" purring in my ear after it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response I let her down and grunt, though I give her a smack on the ass to which Yang lets out a gleeful giggle. We make our way out of the pier, shutting the door behind us afterwards. I pull up the collar of my coat and grab my helmet, the ride back to Beacon is quiet and uneventful. Yang is quiet too, I reckon she's trying to focus on the road and not on me. We park a bit from Beacon, no doubt to keep things quiet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay big guy. I'll see you tomorrow, go get some sleep. And think of me, okay~\" Yang mutters in my ear after she puts our helmets away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI give her a hug and say \"I love you.\" it's strange, I've never said that to anyone. But with her it's just so.......natural. I like it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang parts way with me as we enter the academy, she's going to her dorm. Waving at me as she does, though I see that she's swaying her hips. I stay where I am, taking it all in. Feeling blessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath I start moving back to my dorm, though I take my shoes off. It makes it harder for me to be heard, lesson that can come in handy. I reach the dorm and slide in, tucking my head under to avoid clonking the door frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding at the window in the hallway is Chon, his blindfolded eyes meet mine and he tilts his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Long night?\" he mutters<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smirk and whisper back with \"Well Yang took me for a ride.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon quietly chuckles and says \"You deserve some happiness John.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk past the blind man and say \"You should get some too man. Don't give me that asexual crap too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe doesn't respond but he mutters night to me and slinks back to his place, I do the same. Though I'm gonna have a hard time sleeping.......<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The robots stopped their advance and I crossed my arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am prince Matt Moray of Nero Earth!\" Sternly, I stated. \"Stand aside or be moved aside!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe robots raised their weapons in response to my command to which the four boys laughed. The tallest, whom seemed to be the leader raised a large mace for me to see. \"Do you seriously think we are afraid of your little robots?\" Defiantly, he demanded. \"Also, your <i>prince</i> title holds little weight in this world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes narrowed. \"Does it now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI summoned my energy clones in the form of small wolves which surrounded the four arrogant fools. As I had expected, they all drew their weapons with a hint of concern in their eyes. The wolves growled and howled around them bearing their razor sharp teeth and claws. Of course, I had no intention to order an attack unless they attacked first. After all, I did give my word not to attack unless attacked upon only I did not promise to bear my teeth when annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a female voice spoke out in surprising authority. \"Team Cardinal, do not move!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to find a formally dressed woman approaching us with a riding whip in hand. \"Matt Moray, call off your pack this instant!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled kindly. \"We were merely showing off our weapons and semblances with each other, madam Goodwitch.\" Innocently, I protested. \"There is no conflict here to be concerned about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe members of team Cardinal quickly backed me up to avoid any trouble only Glenda Goodwitch was far from impressed. \"Now, Moray!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed and waved my hand, causing the energy clones to vanish. The members of team Cardinal put their weapons away in return. Glenda Goodwitch then smiled slightly. \"Save your energy for the initiation, young prince.\" Calmly, she said. \"Believe me, you will need it.\" She then eyed the four boys. \"I suggest, for your own pride and dignity, you do not try the patience of our latest visitors from Starmage Academy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four boys made way for my robots and I to pass through only the team leader whispered, \"This isn't over, you little brat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI only smiled and stuck my tongue out at him. Although I was aware it was childish, I also knew it would greatly infuriate the brainless brute. It was only a matter of time before he gave me the perfect excuse to take him down a notch. I smiled at Glenda Goodwitch before entering my dorm and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to me, Glenda Goodwitch shook her head as she passed Ryan and company in the hall. \"That little boy may be powerful but he lacks experience and maturity!\" Quietly, she muttered. \"He is going to get himself or someone else hurt... he needs to grow up fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan turned to her, hearing her comment and frowned before seeing team Cardinal blocking the hall, grinning at him and his group.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At first, they seemed intent upon blocking our path. I caught a brief vision of Light moping the floor with them with his stone sword and threw him a concerned look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, boss?\" Catching my eye, Light asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI motioned to the four boys. \"Are they really worth our time?\" Loud enough to hear, I inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight looked at the four boys, who were flashing cocky smiles and chuckled. \"They remind me of that gaudy group from Starmage.\" Smiling, he replied. \"At least these blokes are more flashy looking.\" He then eyed the four boys, flashing his sharp teeth in a smile. \"I'll handle this one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight walked up to the tallest man who took a short step back before holding his ground. \"What are you looking at?\" Shaken, the boy demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm looking at you, genius.\" Smiling, Light said. \"If you want a fight, then ask to face us in the training arena; I'd be happy to mop the floor with you.\" His smile then turned to a scowl that caused the boy to take a second step back. \"Otherwise, get lost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four boys, albeit reluctantly due to their pride being hit, they walked away without a word. Light then smiled again when he reached me. \"I know their kind, boss.\" Softly, he said. \"They're trying to get a feel for the competition before the matches begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, having met groups like that during the fight games at Starmage. They pick a little fight to get an idea of their opponent's strengths and weaknesses so to form a plan of attack before the matches begin. It was not exactly an illegal tactic but it was dirty non the less. \"They won't get any Intel from us but they may have gotten some from the impatient prince.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of that I have no doubt.\" Firmly, Sho commented. \"See the scratch marks on the walls? He had shown the boys his little army of wolves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He gave his word not to attack.\" Irritated, Chon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He did not attack.\" Again motioning to the walls, Sho said. \"He may have promised not to attack but he did not promise not to bear his fangs and growl.\" He sighed. \"Still, that boy has much to learn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all entered our dorm to find it was much like a house with several bedrooms, each with our names on them.  My name and Jenny's name were on the same door. We entered to find two separate beds which we immediately pushed together. Jenny used a bit of magic and made it one big bed for us to share.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then came out and found Matt's bed room; the name was still on the door. I pushed it open to find a rather large laboratory inside. Of course, I was not surprised. Mad scientists could place their laboratory anywhere, even in the smallest of places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you always bring your work with you, Moray?\" Flatly, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a portable laboratory.\" Kindly, Matt said. \"It is merely for study of the various plant life in this world to see if they can grow their own spice.\" He sighed. \"It is one of the reasons Ozpin took me under his wing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, we all slept well. Jenny and I had our first restful sleep in a long time. The following morning, I woke up refreshed and energized. We all then prepared for the initiations.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was an interesting choice to which I had to ask her why she selected such a dish for us. Lunar smiled and replied, \"Juan Smith suggested it. He will be at the initiations today as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled knowing Juan Smith from the States in my own world. He was at the front line of an effort to stop rogue witches and psychotic scientists from rekindling the ancient war between the two powers. I shuddered to think what the world would have been like if the war was not kept secret from the general public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who else will be at this initiation?\" Curious, Chon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunar though a moment. \"I believe Juan mentioned a reformed Dex Bedlam and a girl named Huanle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My little sister will be at the initiation?!\" Surprised, Chon asked. \"Why was I not told of this earlier?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was a last minute entry.\" Entering the room, Matt said. \"The same is true for Dex Bedlam and his cousin, a kid named Ron Schizo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How exactly do you know this, Moray?\" Frowning, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI suspected he had somehow hacked into the school's computers, being a mad scientist. Only, to my surprise, he replied, \"They were present in the meeting when I discussed going to Beacon with Ozpin. We all needed permission from our guardians first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to speak when the door to the dorm opened and Light entered with a huge grin on his face. I wondered where he had vanished to the night before. I grinned seeing the telltale lipstick stains on his mouth and face as Yang peeked in behind him. \"Morning, everyone!\" Happily, she said. \"I sort of borrowed your friend for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva and Vogue giggled seeing Light practically float into the room with an uncharacteristic smile on his face as he walked into the washroom. \"I hope you didn't tire him out too much.\" Smiling, I said. \"We have initiations today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang giggled. \"He'll be fine! If anything, I energized him!\" She then spotted the food on the table. \"Yes! Breakfast! Mind if I join you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly an hour later, we all met on the edge of a high cliff on a large metal platform. Professor Ozpin and Glenda Goodwitch were present. It was a warm clear morning even as the sun was just beginning to rise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Students, your goal in this initiation is very simple.\" Calmly, Ozpin explained. \"On the north end of this forest, you will find temple ruins where I have placed a number of artifacts. You will retrieve one such artifact and return to the cliff where you started.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will face the Grim along the way.\" Darkly, Glenda added. \"Do not hesitate to destroy those who stand in your path or you will be killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will be all falling and will have to rely on your own landing strategies.\" Firmly, Ozpin said. \"Here we judge which team you will be in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the platform suddenly sprang up, throwing the entire group into the air towards the forbidding forest. Jane let out a surprised screech while Matt laughed. He rolled himself into a ball, forming a shield around him yelling, \"Cannonball!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsura sensed my predicament and unsheathed itself before flying under my feet and slowed my decent as if I were riding on a flying skateboard! I guess there are advantages to having the soul of a warrior in your sword. \"What caused you to fall from such a dangerous height?!\" Concerned, Asura inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's part of an initiation at a school in another realm.\" Calmly, I explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly gave Asura the details to which he stated, \"I will serve faithfully in this and all worlds you travel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon reaching the ground, I sheathed Asura and looked up to see Matt slam into a tree, causing it to fall from where it was hit before he slammed into the ground. He got up, laughing weakly as he stumbled about, obviously a bit stunned. \"That was fun!\" Smiling, he said. \"Let's do that again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suggest we march forward to our objective, Moray.\" Appearing through a clump of trees, Sho said. \"The artifacts may hold a great significance in higher standing to those who obtain them first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raised a single eyebrow to that statement then smiled as I realized that Sho was playing on Matt's pride. \"You may have a valid point.\" Musing, Matt said. \"The Grim are attracted by negative emotions therefore I suggest an agreement to cease and desist all negative thoughts between us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is what, exactly?\" Cautiously, Sho demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt smiled. \"Just call me Matt and I'll listen to you.\" Calmly, he said. \"Calling me by my surname agitates me to no end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSho nodded. \"Matt it is, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt nodded back. \"Lead the way; I will assist where I know I can be of best service.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was easy enough.\" Shrugging, I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jenny landed next to me from the trees. \"I wonder how long that will last.\" Smiling, she said. \"The new generation working with the old.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would not say 'old' in front of Sho.\" Smiling back, I said. \"We better get moving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny nodded and we made our way through the forest.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It became rigid along the outer edges becoming a personal glider.  I steered the glider through the trees by shifting my body to the left or right until I reached the ground a few short meters away from the cliff. Upon landing, my lab coat became loose fitting again and I awakened Glitch from her slumber with a sharp whistle. The silver robotic lizard crawled out from a deep inner pocket of my coat and perched herself onto my shoulders before giving off a series of beeps and bops. It was a language I created for her so, naturally, I understood it completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlitch was my weapon of choice. She was as long as my arm and had the ability to transform into virtually any weapon within her size then return to me if thrown or hit away from me. My lab coat was my defense of choice of which often times automatically responded to most threats. If it did not detect a threat, I would have to manually activate its systems; nothing is perfect. It was actually standard equipment for any mad scientist in my world. Glitch however was entirely of my design; she was more than a pet project, she was a friend I could depend upon in any situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, stop complaining, Glitch.\" Calmly, I said. \"I let you sleep in. It's time to get to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sounds of a fight close by sent me into motion and I rushed passed a group of high bushes to find Huanle facing a number of Beowolves with with a Jian, a type of Japanese broadsword. Huanle made various acrobatic moves, swinging the sword with deadly accuracy before firing a shot from a type of musket that doubled as the sheath for her sword. I jumped in, giving a mental command to Glitch who transformed into a sickle sword that had a wide flat end like a hammer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's make this a more fair fight!\" Charging in, I yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuanle merely nodded and the two of us attacked the pack of Beowolves. I made short work of those who came near me with the sword and my lab coat fended off those who managed to sneak up on me with coat tails that moved like vicious whips on their own with a razor sharp side that sliced through the monsters easily. Huanle did not need rescuing by any stretch of the imagination but it made dispatching of the monsters that much easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We must hurry to the north end of the forest.\" Calmly, Huanle said. \"Our objective is not to fight these creatures but to get passed them to the artifacts and return to the cliff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and motioned to the path ahead of us. \"Then let us not waste any time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuanle and I ran down the path to the north where we encountered another member of the party of exchange students being initiated.

The man had been more than a handful for Starmage security in the past before his good/evil dual personality issue was shall we say corrected at Eligere Sententia. From the last reports I had read, he was now a force to defend the peace between witches and mad scientists. We walked up to him as he fired a blast of electricity from his two katakana swords into an Ursa or Grim bear. He then threw a blade with a ring and wire attached into it and pulled the wire causing the blade to explode, killing the Ursa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The temple is about four hundred yards ahead.\" seeing us, Dex said. \"However, there is a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, a death stalker.\" Taking a step back, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuanle also took a step back, drawing her Jian as Dex tilted his head to one side, curious. \"Yes; I saw it napping just ahead in a sandy clearing.\" Softly, he said. \"How did you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's awake!\" Jumping back, Huanle warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDex jumped back with the aid of rocket powered boots as the giant Grim scorpion crashed through the trees, snapping its claws at the three of us! It let out a roar before sending its acid poison stinger at Huanle who raised her Jian in defense! She managed to block the attack while Glitch transformed into a laser rifle which I fired at the beast. Unfortunately, the blasts seemed to only bounce off doing nothing more than aggravating the monster. Then a blue ray fired in from behind and the death stalker was frozen in place by its feet as Lunar landed next to us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will not hold the creature long!\" Firmly, she said. \"I suggest we get what we were sent here for and get out fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I second that notion!\" Pointing to the woods, Dex said. \"Only I suggest we avoid the sandy clearing; it may be a trap for would be prey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded as I too had studied the creatures of Grim before entering this situation. The death stalkers left sandy traps to capture prey so they could eat at their leisure rather than spend the energy hunting.

Those long legs are enabling him to rush ahead, though Lunar's flying just behind him. Perhaps to stay with us all, it's at times like this I'm grateful for Chon putting me into those running practise lessons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again I stress that the grimm monster we left back there will be free around 4 minutes, once we rush to the ruins we should procure the relics. Hopefully some of our allies will be present there and can assist.\" Lunar says, I have to admit she's speaking very calmly in spite of the situation. Perhaps it's because she's an android? There's no room for speaking about that right now though, I hear a loud crashing noise behind us. My hair on the back of my neck stands on end, but I don't dare turn around. It's that monster getting free, I grip my Jian and move with everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we're a team now then?!\" I shout over the din of the noise behind us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuan quickly turns his head to be while saying \"There are four of us present Huanle, I believe it to be the case. Quickly now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe're getting nearer to the ruins, Lunar estimated we have a 4 minute head start. But still that's not much of a reassurance, we come to the steps of a tower as our robot girl promptly states \"Our objective lies above theses stairs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner has the robot said that does the death stalker behind us let out a large, feral like roar. I quickly turn around in spite of my instincts, fuck it's loose! And it's charging right towards us. I then look to the people with me, Dex suddenly moves towards me and says \"We gotta get up this tower! Taking the stairs is going to be too fucking slow!\" with that he takes a dagger from his coat after sheathing one of his katanas and I notice it's linked to a wire that comes from a coat pocket. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead sticks the dagger in Lunar's hand, Juan nods and we're all suddenly in agreement. Juan converts his weapon into a sort of whip and wraps it around Lunar's left leg, meanwhile the robot accepts Dex's dagger and he wraps the wire around one hand and promptly grabs hold of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you let go, or you'll die.\" he states, and I know what's about to happen. And I cling to Dex as Lunar readies herself and promptly flies upwards, we're going to bypass using the stairs and take to the sky. That way we can get to the objective sooner, but still I'm really terrified. And I let out a scream to let everyone know that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDex promptly wraps his long legs around me, to ensure that I don't fall. And he merely gives me an irritated look, I stop my scream and feel a blush creep around my cheeks. You know in this light he kinda looks handsome, even with the blood red hair and that x scar on his face. Sure enough I see the top of the ruins, and there's people already there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carlson!\" Juan shouts. I see Ryan there, with Jenny and Chon and Light. They've grabbed what look like white castle pieces, and there's also Sho with Matt. And Jane and Amy, Jane as usual looks terrified at what we've brought with us. But everyone's here, thank Kami.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've got company, Juan. You and your team grab those last pieces, we'll fight this grimm! Charge!\" Carlson shouts as he draws his katana and everyone promptly prepares for combat. Dex lets go of me as we hit the ground, I grunt as I roll for a little before standing up and moving to the last set of pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Black knights.\" Lunar simply remarks. Dex scoffs before taking his, sticking it in his coat pocket. He's not going to the fight though, instead he's actually making to exit the ruins as Juan and Lunar join the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" I shout, moving to grab his shoulder. Dex swiftly turns around and looks at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? We got what we came here for. Isn't that all that matters?\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But our friends are in danger, we need to get out all together. As a team Dex.\" I say, I make sure my expression shows I'm not cowing here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDex simply rolls his eyes and replies with \"They're your friends, not mine. Fuck it I'll help.\" with that he moves past me and throws a dagger at the grimm monsters showing up. He's a bit of a loose cannon, but Chon was able to turn a rouge witch's daughters into prim and polite young ladies. So maybe I can help Dex with his issues too.</span></div></div>",

Amy took an idea from Matt's landing strategy and fired spherical force fields at the creatures like cannonballs, tearing them apart while shielding herself and her three team mates. Sho ran passed the shield, slicing and dicing the monsters with little effort while dozens more came running to fight. Jane used her staff to fire energy arrows at the Beowolves but there seemed no end to them! Sho jumped back then turned to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy, place a force field around the Beowolves! Don't let them gain any more ground!\" Barking orders, he yelled. \"Jane, you are with me! The Beowolf with the silver fur on its back, that is the Alpha! We kill it, the others will fall!\" He then turned to Matt. \"Matt... feeding time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy did as she was asked but made a stressed face as the monsters began banging against the field. \"This won't last long!\" Urgently, she yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt summoned his wolf pack and charged the Beowolves inside the wide circle of a force field and attacked them in force, devouring them quickly! Finally, Sho and Jane charged the Alpha Beowolf! With their combined efforts, the leader of the pack was destroyed and the remainder of the monsters fled back into the woods! Matt walked back to the group with a pained look on his face as Amy canceled the force field, exhausted. \"I'm going to hurl...\" Sourly, Matt said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Find a tree.\" Backing up, Amy stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, I was busy with the death stalker. After several failed attempts to kill the beast, Light leaped high into the air with an enraged battle cry and struck the monster on the head with his stone sword! There was a loud boom as the bony armor of the beast cracked in half! The death stalker roared in agony as Jenny used her magic to open the crack further! Chon and I then charged forth and struck our bladed into the crack, sending them clear into the monster's brain! One final roar later, the beast was dead! There was no need for any talk among us as we had worked as a team for a long time at Starmage. Still, it was an exhausting battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom above, a Nevermore or Grim Raven screamed from above and fired its quills at Huanle!  In a surprising move, Dex jumped in the way and sliced the quills before they came close then fired a blast of electricity, sending the beast flying away but circling back for another attack!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have the trees as an advantage!\" Quickly, Lunar said. \"We need to ambush the beast as it circles back; we only have one shot at this!\" She turned to Juan. \"Can your friend, Glitch fly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuan nodded. \"Of course!\" Hurriedly, he replied. \"What's your idea?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunar turned to Dex. \"We need two of your explosive daggers and your crack-shot aim!\" She then turned to Huanle. \"Loan us your musket and be ready with your Jian! You will know what to do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the giant grim raven circled back around for another attack, Glitch flew in front of it, firing weak laser blasts into its eyes! The beast gave chase, following Glitch into position for the trap. Dex fired two of his explosive daggers from Huanle's musket style laser rifle one right after the other, striking the Nevermore in the neck! Lunar then grabbed the long strings attacked to them and yanked hard! Not only did the daggers explode but the force of the yank sent the nevermore into a crashing course with the sand clearing! Huanle, seeing her opportunity, rushed to the beast with magical speed and sent her Jian crashing down, severing the head of the monster!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the battles won and the forest quiet again, we all made our way back to the cliff unchallenged!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From this day forward, you will be known as Team Wreckage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of us exchanged smiles as the audience applauded us. The name certainly fit as we wrecked any enemy who ever threatened Starmage.  Ozpin then finished stating, \"Lead by Ryan Carlson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny smiled at me while Chon gave a respectable bow and Light grinned, giving me a thumbs up sign as if he knew all along I would be the leader. Upon leaving the stage, I watched as Sho and his group walked onto the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shomei Akatsuki, Matt Moray, Amy Don, and Jane Doe.\" Summoning them, Ozpin announced. \"You four retrieved the white Bishop pieces. From this day forward, you will be known as Team Smash. Lead by Shomei Akatsuki.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy group and I applauded with the audience. Matt nodded at Sho who responded with a short bow before the group left the stage. When they approached us, Jenny placed a hand onto Matt's shoulder. \"Are you okay with not being the leader?\" Gently, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt smiled, eyeing Sho. \"A prince is not a leader but a leader in training.\" Calmly, he said. \"Shomei Akatsuki was kind enough to offer to take me under his wing and guide me on that journey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Matt shows a lot of promise at a young age.\" Firmly but kindly, Sho said. \"However, he lacks focus and discipline. I believe that, with some training, he can grow into a fine leader of men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that, knowing that Sho will do all he can to help Matt with his issues. We then turned back to the stage as the last group was called forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lunar Messiah, Juan Smith, Huanle Kay, Dex Bedlam.\" Summoning them forward, Ozpin said. \"You four retrieved the black knight pieces.

Chon had turned around as well and was looking towards the four children as Ozpin spoke. \"The four of you thwarted a Grim attack on Vale, saving dozens of lives. This has earned you a team status.\" We all exchanged shocked and concerned looks as Ozpin continued. \"From this day forward, you will be known as Team Severe. Lead by Charlie Ren.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe V twins hugged both Charlie and Ron, cheering as the audience applauded. I applauded as well but made note to speak to Ozpin about this incident as none of us were informed of this happening. I was certain Chon Kay would have a word with Ozpin as well due to his girls falling into danger. For the moment, we allowed the four kids to enjoy their moment.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I hated to be cold with him but there was no time for kid gloves. I turned to Charlie. \"Explain what happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As Ron said, we were just the right people in the wrong place at the right time.\" Calmly, Charlie said. \"We had all gotten passes to go to the fair in Vale and explore the many shops with some of the credits we were given for expenses...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** **********************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva and Vogue led Charlie by the hands into the fair with Ron Schizo tagging along as they had all become fast friends due to their closeness in age and similar interests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is with the utility belt?\" Giggling, Viva asked Ron. \"You look like a comic book hero!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon chuckled. \"My father is an inventor for the special armed forces in our world.\" Smiling, he replied. \"He likes me to be prepared for anything at any time as there are people who will use me to get to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds a lot like BB.\" Smiling as well, Vogue said. \"He taught us how to stand on our own feet and fight for ourselves and those we love.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BB?\" Confused, Ron asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're referring to Chon Kay, their adopted father.\" Kindly, Charlie said. \"They think of him as a big brother so they call him BB.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon smiled. \"Cool!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was taken under Ryan Carlson's wing after the courts took me away from my mother and sisters.\" Now looking sad, Charlie said. \"They were not exactly the best role models.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rogues, huh?\" Wincing, Ron said. He then smiled. \"Use your past to strengthen your resolve for a bright future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here Here!\" Cheering, Viva said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie smiled, motioning to the many shops. \"Enough going down 'amnesia lane'.\" Chuckling, he said. \"Let's hit the shops!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud crash and screams drew the group's attention to the far side of the fair. They saw a large hole in the perimeter wall with a number of Boarbatusks or Grim Boars charging in from the outside with an Eras or Grim Bear right behind them! Men, women, and children alike scattered, screaming in terror as the creatures attacked them at random.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did they smash through the wall?\" Shocked, Viva asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't matter!\" Taking command, Charlie said. \"There are people in danger and we are the only ones equipped to help them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's do it!\" Drawing his gun sword, Ron said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing upon all of their training, the four charged the invading creatures. Needing a weapon, Charlie grabbed a flag pole from a wall mount on the run and swung it with all his might against the first monster. To his surprise, there was a bright flash and the Boarbatusk was literally sent flying over the high wall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, Charlie!\" Killing another monster, Ron yelled. \"Not bad!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough Charlie was surprised that he had used magic, he had no time to worry about it. \"Watch your six, Ron!\" He threw the flag pole at creature charging his friend from behind! The pole impaled it through the head before bouncing back to his awaiting hand! He then turned to Viv and Vogue. \"Let's show them what twin witches can do!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva and Vogue were fighting the monsters with magically made katakana swords similar to Chon's. They jumped back to Charlie's side and touched his shoulders. Immediately, an energy field surround them and Charlie threw his hands out just before a powerful blast of magic fired from them, throwing the Grim bear back through the hole in the wall! Ron, seeing his opportunity threw what looked like a grenade at the hole! It exploded, forming a foam like substance that sealed the hole in what looked like solid rock!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cement foam.\" Softly, he explained. \"It will seal any door or hole with a foam as solid as cement. They won't get through that before the wall is repaired.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the invasion thwarted and the monsters destroyed, the people of the fair applauded and cheered. The children were, for once, the heroes of the day!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************************************************************************** **********************************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When Ozpin returned from the initiations, he was told of the incident and he summoned us to his office.\" Finishing his story, Charlie said. \"He thanked us for our bravery and asked us to attend the initiation ceremony.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grunted, looking Charlie in the eye. \"What of the flag pole?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie smiled and pointed to a long white staff with a red flag near the pointed end leaning against the closet door in his room. \"Ozpin let me keep it as my weapon of choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"Interesting...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed before walking to the window. \"During the initiation, my pack devoured a small pack of Beowolves to thwart an attack upon my teammates.\" Softly, I said. \"They are all made of dark magical energy; the reason they do not have a soul.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may sense dark magic within them but they are much more than that.\" Frowning, Ozpin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hens why I must study them.\" Firmly, I countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't get too close with your studies, young man.\" Serious, Ozpin said. \"The Grim may not have a soul but they are not without intelligence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raised an eyebrow to this but before I could ask any questions, Ozpin dismissed me with a polite wave of his hand.

Still, I was not there to educate anyone, I was there to enjoy some peace and quiet. I heard a low commotion near the center of the room and moved in to investigate. At a large table, I found the members of RWBY in the middle of some form of role playing strategy board game. Ruby had her head down with a defeated look on her face; I guessed she had made a less than spectacular move that cost her. I walked passed them to find Ren reading with Nora napping next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see the warriors are enjoying their down time.\" Approaching him, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen looked up from his book with a serious look on his face. \"Those who only think of the conflict will lose their soul to it as that is all they will be left with.\" Cryptically, he responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis words hit home as I had once only thought of my conflict against witches and magic. My private war had earned me the title of 'The blind vengeance'. Only I was now a changed man; I even adopted two young witches who call me their older brother. \"I see you read up on me.\" Softly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen smiled. \"Actually, I know nothing about you except for what I had picked up from the 'chatter line' of rumors and conversations.\" Calmly, he said. \"I prefer to know someone better face to face.\" He motioned to the exit. \"Shall we take a walk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and followed Ren out to a large garden off the library with various benches for people to sit down and read outside. I briefly told him of my past and my brief one man war against witches. He listened carefully; only nodding or grunting in response until I had finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The grim in this world is a constant threat.\" Calmly, he said. \"I have read about many people launching a one man war against them but it is futile; they outnumber us millions to one.\" He then smiled. \"You had achieved the true height of a warrior, Chon Kay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is that?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen motioned to Viva and Vogue, sitting on a bench with Charlie and Ron not too far away. \"You had made friends out of an enemy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at that; Ren was very wise for his age. \"True.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And he's not cursing magic or anything like that, sure we argue here and there. But Chon's a changed man now, a good thing that happened too. No doubt in the future he'd have probably ended up as a wandering assassin for hire, killing anyone for the right price. He's good at sneaking up on you too, the guy can tiptoe over twigs and dry leaves without you knowing of his existence. It can be quite the pain at times let me tell you, and what makes it worse? Viva and Vogue are learning how to sneak around too, in Chon's efforts to teach them how to fight without their magic. They get up to no good with that I'll tell you now, the number of times they've tried to get my precious sketchbook....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I sit down at a table I take out the book, it's magically enchanted to have several hundred pages. And a contents page so I can look at my past work, I'm just absentmindedly doodling a grimm monster with nothing else to do. Just then though I turn my gaze to the left, and see a book. Must have been left on it's own, I give a little frown before picking it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ninjas of love?......Who made this crap?\" I mutter, feeling curious I decide to open it. And sift through the pages around the middle, more out of curiosity than anything else. But as I read the pages, I can't help but feel a blush arrive on my cheeks. The contents of this are......spicy.......really........<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh......wow, talk about flexible......\" okay now that was pretty impressive, and the detail of the action they're taking.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy?\" I hear an Asian voice speak behind me. Oh crap it's Chon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let out a little yelp and jerk my head upwards and turn around, dammit he nearly gave me a heart attack. I quickly give a huff and look away before saying \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem flustered, is there anything that's bothering you?\" he asks, and it's in a rather concerned tone. Something that I'm not used to from him, perhaps it's because we're used to arguing. And then.....I don't know why but after looking in that book, I imagine us naked and sweaty in a dark room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon is really buff, with scars from the fights he has been in. And he can be troubled too, and......I need to focus! And quickly deal with this situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nothing! I need to go!\" I quickly grab my sketchbook and make to bolt out the room, thankfully Chon doesn't go after me. Oh God, I need to read all of that book. Dammit Chon, why do you have to cause me no end of trouble even when you don't mean it?!</span></div></div>",

Seeing that Viva and Vogue, a couple of 12 year old girls. Who are capable of overpowering and beating the crap out of Charlie's Sisters, who are 4 years their senior is the least crazy thing they can do. It's all thanks to Chon, I remember the disbelief on Mel's face when it was confirmed that he and I are related. Mel and Chon don't really well....get along, though I think it's more one sided now. Chon used to really hate magic, and pointed at the Harrison's as being the ones responsible for the state of the witch community. And Mel hated Chon because of how he murdered several rogue witches, and even tried to hit her in the past.

He doesn't really seem much of a nice guy, but he's going to need to open up to someone if he wants to live in this world. And maybe I can be that person, like Mel was for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm dressed in a pair of blue jeans with red sandals, a dark denim jacket and a plain yellow shirt with pink Chinese handwriting for \"Love\" written on the centre. I'm outside the library, and sure enough I spot Dex. He's dressed as he normally is, has the Starmage uniform jacket tied around his waist. His long legs wearing the Starmage slacks, and that green shirt of his. He's looking down at the ground with headphones on, and I can hear heavy metal music blaring from them as I near him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDex acknowledges me out the corner of his eyes, I smile and lean down with a tilt of my head. Knowing that I'm not going anytime soon he takes the headphones off of his blood red hair and turns them off, before giving a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want Huanle?\" Dex mutters, he's not showing me hostility. But it's clear that he doesn't want to be interacting with me if he can help it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was wanting to talk, if we're going to be working on the same time I figured I ought to get to know you. Lunar and Juan I pretty much know, you though I don't. You've got time right?\" I say, as I lean on the tree next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDex sighs, but he can tell that I'm not budging. He folds his arms and looks away from me before saying \"Fine, though your not gonna get anything fun or good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least you agreed, that means something to me Dex. Why don't you tell me a bit about yourself, the basics.\" I figured it best to get the ball rolling with something simple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead pauses, looking away from me. Before grunting and saying \"Well my parents are rich as you probably know, tech bigwigs. They're not mad scientists, but they know about it and magic. I never learned mad science, everything that I've done has been through trail and error.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like those swords of yours? They're quite nice.\" I comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to that Dex gives a little smile. \"I made them myself, I can cut with them. Or shock people with them, sometimes it's fun to let them wriggle a bit. Just to let them know who they're dealing with. Sorry if that sounds a bit mean, just I've not had much in the way of friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm. Well hey you've got them now, Juan and Lunar and me. We're gonna be there for you.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDex stands up and turns to me before saying \"Alright, thanks I guess. I'll do the same, I'm not much of a team player though. So don't expect me to go to your big parties, don't think your Brother would approve of me being there. Considering what I did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what matters is you learned your lesson, I think the Dex before wouldn't even talk to me here. I'll let you get going, if you ever want to do anything let me know. See ya around.\" I say waving goodbye as I walk away, though I can't help but make my hips sway. Just a little, maybe it's cause he's watching.</span></div></div>",

Considering his age, I did not alert the others in case it was nothing. Considering he was a mad scientist, I had to assume he would not use the term 'urgent' lightly. Upon entering his room, I was slightly surprised by how much if the space was dedicated to his science. Matt had his back to me, looking into a microscope. I cleared my throat to announce my presence and he turned, revealing dark rings under his eyes, he had obviously been up all night which was not a good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the situation, Matt?\" Calmly, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ozpin is not being completely straight forward with us.\" Bluntly, Matt said. \"I need your experience and foresight to help confirm my findings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took a seat, wondering what findings Matt might have discovered to cause him to believe something was afoot. \"I'm listening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I have reported to you earlier, I sensed black magic in the creatures of Grim.\" Frowning, Matt said. \"I had first theorized that that was why they had no soul; they were made and not born. However, that proved to be less than accurate; they are drawn to all things dark including black magic and devour it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does this have to do with Ozpin?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a Neko, Shomei.\" Serious, Matt said. \"On top of that, I am both a witch and a mad scientist. I can sense things normal humans can not.\" He frowned deeply. \"Ozpin was trying to warn me away from something only I have no clue what that might be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt then relayed the entire conversation he had with General Ironwood and Ozpin. He stressed the emotion in their words as he spoke. I listened quietly, searching the words that were said for any clues. When Matt had finished, I nodded. \"You are right, to a point.\" Calmly, I said. \"Ozpin is holding something back from you or all of us.\" I sighed. \"Still, remember that we are only here for a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt shook his head. \"That is where you are mistaken.\" Darkly, he said. \"Look at your class schedule; you will find that you, all of us are not scheduled as visitors but full time students.\" He respectably bowed before me. \"Something dark is most definitely afoot, Shomei. Please confirm my findings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I took in everything that Matt had said, I found that there was some weight to what he had discovered. Upon studying my schedule card, I discovered that Matt was correct; we were all listed as full time students at Beacon Academy. I decided it best to speak to Ryan about this immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made my way to the gym where I found Ryan and Light...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't think I had ever seen the man blush before and I'm sure it was a new experience for him as well. Only the levity ended the second I noticed Sho enter the room with a worn look on his face. I did not know the man for very long but I knew the expression he carried all too well; he was bringing us bad news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed as he approached; might as well get whatever it is done and over with. \"You have news for us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSho nodded. \"I'm afraid that Matt Moray has stumbled upon something that affects us all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrap! It's always something when it involves mad scientists, it seems! \"What did he stumble upon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSho showed me his schedule card for his classes at the Academy. \"First, we are only supposed to be here for one week and yet we are marked as full time students instead of visitors.\" Darkly, he said. \"Second, Ozpin seems very worried about Matt's obsessive study of the monsters of Grim.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSho then relayed what Matt told him in every detail.

I stepped into the elevator and rode it to Ozpin's office where I found him alone behind his desk. \"I had a feeling you would come to me after my meeting with the young mad science prince.\" Softly, he said. \"Yes, I made you and your companions full time students; Elvira Strange, the head witch of your world is aware of this.\" He smiled slightly. \"I assure you, she is one woman I would rather not annoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled slightly, knowing the magical power of Elvira Strange. She was practically invincible by mortal standards with patience to match. \"I need to know why we have been made full time students and why we were not informed of this change of plans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin sighed. \"We are facing a new enemy, Mr Carlson; one who we can't allow to spread her forces to other realms.\" Darkly, he said. \"I reached out to Elvira Smith for help and she recommended your team as well as Matt Moray and Juan Smith.\" He stood up with his cane in hand. \"I did not tell you or your group because I was not certain until; this morning that I was going to ask you and your team to stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Annoyed, I said. \"I prefer people to be straight forward with me, Ozpin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You also know that not everything can be made public knowledge, Ryan.\" Firmly, Ozpin countered. \"Dust, what we use for weapons and defense has been stolen and redirected clear across the board, making supplies hard to come by.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that is why you need the spice.\" Catching on, I said. \"Since it is grown instead of mined, you can replace the lost dust quickly in case of an attack from this new enemy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin nodded. \"Precisely.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Carlson's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell Ozpin's words had me concerned, from what I've been able to gather Dust is actually gathered in very large quantities. So much so they don't really know what to do with it all, and I think you could actually create more. But then again I've only been here a couple of days, hardly enough time to know everything about Remnant. I will admit it's been interesting, the land's beautiful but marred by the monsters. If they got to my world.......I don't want to think about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now I'm getting ready to hit the road, we're all going on a trip to a huge set of hotsprings that are just outside Vale. This is more like it, when I was training back in Japan I actually spent time in a hotspring. It can be really, really relaxing. And frankly all the stuff that we've done thus far warrants a rest, pretty much everyone is coming except for Matt. He's locked himself in his room and won't come out, Light tried kicking the door off the hinge but he ended up shattering his leg. It healed quickly but we reckoned the door was altered. So we decided fine then he can stay there, though something tells me he might show up later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny nudges me with her arm, that snaps me back to where I am. We're just getting off the bus, it's one of many and numerous people are getting off. There's Ruby's group, and a few guys who are led by a guy called Sun. Apparently he and Blake are having a similar situation to Chon and Amy, though it's not as severe in my mind. There's another team, one guy in it's huge and one of the girls has bunny ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ryan, this is those hotsprings Yang said.\" Ruby said, in front of us is a rather grand staircase. With very nice trees that look well cared for, this place seems really in touch with nature. Though I'm a bit concerned that grimm could attack, after all it is just outside the city limits of Vale. Granted it's probably protected but still, the fact that it's outside of it concerns me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy concern is justified, as suddenly I hear a loud pitched scream from the building at the top of the stairs. Instantly I turn to Ruby and promptly run up the steps while shouting \"Ruby c'mon! Everyone else stay here!\" Me and Ruby are the scouts. We're gonna check it out before anyone else comes up, to limit the chance of us all getting hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we reach the top of the stairs several people, mostly older people are running past us. Thankfully though most are dressed at least, based off of how they are I reckon they're married couples. I pause briefly and Ruby does the same, but we quickly recover and make our way inside. I can see a woman hiding in the reception desk, I sheathe Azura and near the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, we won't hurt you. We're from Beacon Academy, I'm sorry but please tell us what happened.\" I say calmly, like I do when coaxing Charlie out from hiding. The receptionist is an old woman with cat ears and a Japanese style hime cut, like a proper hot spring owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Your from Beacon? Oh heavens be praised, we've been attacked by Grimm! Oh our customers won't return now!\" she says as she kneels in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at Ruby briefly before saying \"Look it'll be fine, there's more than just us. Those Grimm won't trouble you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist claps her hands and says \"Oh thank you kind sir, if you do this you will have free use of the springs for the day. It is the least I can offer, our complex is quite large. Though it's strange, from what the customers said the Grimm ignored them and went right into the springs. That's never happened before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're using the springs?! Oh how dare them! That's our place of relaxation!\" Ruby says, stomping her foot after it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh, I'm no Grimm expert but it does sound odd. Regardless they could be a danger, and I need to step in. \"Don't worry, like I said we'll handle it. C'mon Ruby, let's get everyone and divide and conquer.\" I say as I make to head outside.</span></div></div>",

The place is actually quite huge, bigger than I first thought. No matter though, we have the numbers to handle everything there is there and then some. I step out with Jenny, Light and Chon. I can feel the heat already, a good thing I'm wearing my summer clothes. We have our weapons at the ready, and enter slowly and carefully. We don't know the exact number of Grimm in our location, so in this case we're playing it safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny nudges me and points, and I see......a couple of beowolves chilling in a spring not too far from us. I actually tilt my head in response to this, aren't they supposed to be prowling and snarling monsters? One of them looks at us and gives a little grunt and motion to the other, who simply rolls it's head and does nothing else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan, is it just me or do they seem to be enjoying the springs?\" Chon mutters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I can say anything Light moves forward with his sword. And he says \"Are you fucking kidding me?! These monsters are taking up the spots we were gonna have! That's it I've had it, eat this!\" with that he leaps into the air. And brings down his massive stone sword that he named \"Big Sister\" onto the head of one of a beowolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny then steps up saying \"This place is meant to be a place of relaxation, that's important considering the state of Remnant. You've got no right to be here!\" my girlfriend then conjures up a fireball in her hands and flings it at the other monster. Jenny and Light are acting kinda weird here, but the fact that these grimm are too busy with the springs could be useful to us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell most of them anyway, as suddenly to my left my semblance kicks in warning me of an attack. I quickly draw Azura and spin in place, beheading an Ursa grimm in the process. I put my blade back and sigh. \"It's clear that we can't allow these things to remain, not this close to Vale and Beacon. Chon scout the area, if you encounter any bathing grimm assassinate them. But don't push too deep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon nodded and lept into the air, I activated my communicator and said \"Ruby, this is Ryan. How's it going on your end?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ryan, we're doing pretty well. Most of the grimm seem to be bathing in the springs, it's easy pickings for us.\" Ruby chimes to me, she doesn't seem too bothered by how odd these monsters are acting. Though she might be more used to seeing grimm as she's from this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless I get responses from other teams, Sun says it's all too easy. Coco complains that it's making her glasses fog up, Juan states he intends to study the water for anything that might have attracted the grimm. And I'm done here, once I sign off I hear the loudspeakers going off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention hunters, upon destroying all the grimm in our establishment. Feel free to return to the reception to claim your complimentary yukata!\" the receptionist yells. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon comes back to me with his hookswords out, though he puts them away and says \"I wiped out 4 beowolves. This is a beautiful place, none of it is artificial and it appeals to my senses. Perhaps I might visit again if time permits it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI simply roll my eyes and smirk, but yeah this could be a place we could come back to. Maybe after a mission or something, I wonder what's happening back home. My Mom, does she know I'm here? In another world? Probably not, but I want to be safe. So that she can see me again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI draw my sword and say \"We've still got some ground to cover, let's keep going.\" the sooner we do this the sooner we can relax.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryan's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis woman, who the fuck does she think she is?! Comes in here, demanding I call everyone off. And for what? Just cause she's says so? I frown and fold my arms, the way Mirage looks screams evil. Fuck she looks like one of those nightmarish dolls that rogue witches like to keep, least that's what Chon says. He knows more about that than I do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry but I'm not in charge of everyone here.\" I state plainly, I'm told I'm pretty good at talking my way out of things. Time to employ that natural talent, I then shrug and say \"That said, my friends here I can call off. Besides at this rate we've already wiped out 80% of the Grimm in this area. Be grateful that you have at least 20% left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirage's smile turns into a scowl briefly, before becoming neutral. \"Very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI send a message to my fellows with my wristband, telling them to stand down. Though I send Chon another message, to convene at my location. I might need backup, just in case. Light complains but he'll do what I say, Jenny is probably thinking it's odd. But she knows me well enough to know that I'd call Chon, she just needs to be wary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's done, now then....shall we?\" I mutter, Mirage nods before proceeding to seat herself in a spring next to us. Without taking any of her clothes off or anything like that, I'm not gonna do that. I unzip my coat and lean on a nearby rock, and I'm silent as I look at her. Daring her to say something first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a pause Mirage says \"Do you always try to solve your problems with violence?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reply honestly after that with \"Only when no other option would succeed, your Grimm don't speak English. And have caused this world no end of chaos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirage makes to speak, but I cut her off with \"My turn, how did you know I'm not of this world? That's top secret information, tell me now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis woman wasn't as clever as she thought, saying that I was an out-world traveller. That's confidential, how did Mirage know?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't speak, and avoids looking at me. Hiding something, I can fucking tell. I chime up with \"I know we're relaxing, but why don't we get to know one another. And you know what they say, all good friendships are based on honesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirage then speaks, moving her hands across the water and saying \"I don't question your overall purpose human, don't do the same for my own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smirk, I kinda expected that answer. I shrug and say \"Well then, I just don't think I can trust you. Look I don't know much about this world, or the Grimm. But I do know is that they are the attackers, and don't feed me any of this stuff that they don't know better. You said it yourself, they're not completely mindless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA good shot there, Mirage pauses again. I can see her lips purse in a frown. She sighs and says \"Perhaps, though they have simply come to believe that nothing good can come from humans being near them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTouche, but still they do attack even those who can't fight back. I sigh and fold my arms. \"I just don't think I can trust you.\" I mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirage giggles, before saying \"Oh, your friend can come out now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that I hear footsteps approach us. Chon comes near and says \"I heard everything Carlson, is this woman the leader of the Grimm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leader? I am simply one who knows them better than you do, you know who so often speaks of the dangers of magic.\" Mirage says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You gotta be kidding me.\" Chon grunts out, he takes a couple of more steps. Intent on trying to attack Mirage while she had her back to him, I stop him though with my arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Mirage, I think you've outstayed your welcome. Go, now.\" I say sharply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first it seems that Mirage isn't going to listen, she sighs and stands up. And turns around and glares daggers at the pair of us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, I will depart. But know this Carlson, your simply a weapon being pointed at something. Look further, Ozpin hides things from you. He is uncertain of your world and how useful it can be to him, know that.\" Mirage says, a smirk on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck off.\" Chon says, he draws one of his hook swords and tosses it at Mirage. But she vanishes in the blind of an eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch.\" the Chinese man mutters, he turns and proceeds to storm off the way he came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh, it looks like the rest of the Grimm are going away too. This has been so confusing, is that Mirage's intent? I don't care, I don't like her either. Next time we meet, I might just slap her. For now though, the job is more or less done. Time to relax after all.</span></div></div>",

But it doesn't matter now, we've cleared out the Grimm here in this hotspring. I make a note to mention this person to Ozpin and Elvira, Ruby too. Ozpin and Elvira might keep secrets, but I don't. I have no qualms about stating my opinion to anyone, it comes in handy when helping my friends get over problems. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put my katana on my side and activate my comm, it sparks to life and I say \"This is Carlson, we're all clear here. Status?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! This is Ruby, we're done.\" says the cheerful voice of Ms Rose. Good, the other leaders chime in too. No one's hurt, it was too easy. Was Mirage here for another purpose? Or was she simply doing a case of antagonists out shopping? I don't care at this point, the fight's over. Time to rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loudspeakers crackle with noise before the woman from the reception speaks with \"Whew! Thanks for saving the hotsprings! Come on by and collect your yukatas!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey have those here in Remnant? Strange, though I don't comment on it. After all can't stick out like a sore thumb can I? Mirage seemed to know that I'm not from this world, but what does she know? Ah frack it I'm not going to get anywhere contemplating my navel like this, I begin walking back to the reception with my crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short while later I'm dressed a rather tight yukata bathing robe, it's white with red trimming. To be honest I never did like these things, though perhaps I'm just too used to modern clothing. It's nice to go back and try the tried and true outfits, moreso in a place of relaxation such as this. It's night now, leaving a slight coolness to the air that is above the springs. I'm walking through the complex, checking out what everyone else is up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing surprises me, I see Dex standing at a bridge. Dressed in a robe as crimson as his hair, though it's open entirely. Leaning near him is Huanle, who's actually making Bedlam smile. Kinda hard to believe that a month or so he was trying to stab me on the rooftop of Starmage. Still, yesterday's enemy is today's ally. Though I wonder how Chon's gonna take it that Dex is getting a bit cosy with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang and Light trot past me, she's dragging him by the arm. Keeping it held tightly between her chest as I quickly note, they're wearing matching canary yellow bathrobes. Yang's talking about something, though I didn't pick up on and Light was simply looking confused. Lovable oaf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny comes up to me, she's wearing a nice magenta yukata with white circles around it. She gives me a simple smile which I return, and we simply stand where we are. I've done good here today, tomorrow I'll talk to the folks about that Mirage woman. There's no way she's not important, the way she looked. Yeesh.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jane's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm dressed in this weird white dress, I don't really know why. John said it's traditional, though I'm not really familiar with that term. I'm trying to learn of the outside world as much I can, like with my Brother I wasn't given a normal childhood. When I was able to compare what happened to me at least, still I really enjoy my freedom. I can move around freely, and get to help people too. Though I'm pretty scared too, these grimm look so big and nasty. Even the little ones look like they want to chomp on me. Thankfully though I made that new weapon to keep them away, plus I've got magic powers too. Oh! And something else, I can do tricks with my mind! Elvira said that I had ESP powers or something, and that was another reason why those mean men and women studied me. It's not often a witch can use their mind as well as magic she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do remember something about that, I could lift stuff just by looking at it. And I just slipped into it, like turning something on in my body. I'm letting myself wander though, and the realisation hits me. My bare feet slip on a rock ever so slightly when I wasn't paying attention, my eyes go wide and I let out a loud yelp. Though as I'm prepared to take the water a pair of hands quickly dart under me, accepting my body and preventing me from falling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hyup, hold on I have you.\" a male voice says, I turn as I'm propped back up to face the speaker. He has bright red hair, combed neatly to the side. He's about my height too, because I find myself making eye contact with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh um, thanks.\" I mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man smiles and lightly coughs before saying \"Your uh Jane right? I'm Scarlet, nice to meet you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet huh? I find myself silent for a moment, then for some reason my cheeks flush. I don't know why though, is it because he prevented me from getting a fall in the water? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spoke to me though, John said I need to respond to people when they talk to me. I quickly state \"Y-Yes, I'm Jane. Jane uh...Yamada. Thanks uh again, I'm not much of a swimmer.\" I can swim, but I've not had to time to really learn. I was only at Starmage a month before this all happened, though I can use my magic to keep me afloat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I hear a whisper in my head, it sounds like Scarlet's voice just now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She's not much of a talker......\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lightly gasp, but I quickly refocus. Ryan said it's not nice to go about snooping in the head of someone who doesn't deserve it, Scarlet helped me so I don't comment on it. Before Scarlet can respond though he notices something past me, he motions and I turn around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that Yang? What's she doing?\" I ask tilting my head to one side, she's sneaking too. Like she doesn't want to be spotted, like Light does when he isn't being loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet smirks and says \"That's the boys baths, I think Ms Xiao Long is hoping to eat the eye candy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's odd. I respond with \"Eye candy? But they don't taste good right?\" Lunar said they didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly silence is there, did I say something wrong? I turn to look at Scarlet and he scratches his head at me, though he then shrugs and says \"Well I don't reckon she'll get too far though, my captain Sun's in there. Pretty sure your Brother's there too. Hold on.....3.....2.....1.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang had been peaking through a whole in the wood, but then we hear a loud bang. Might be a bucket, then I hear a voice saying \"Yang! Get out of here! Dammit John keep your girl under wraps!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde woman yelps and promptly begins crawling out of sight, that was so strange. Why did Yang want to see my \"Brother\" like that? This whole day's been really odd, I ought to go lie down now. Like when my powers are used too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn to Scarlet and say \"I'm.....going, hope to see you around uh Scarlet.\" I then do what Jenny said I should with people I like. I move forward and give the redhead a hug, wrapping my arms around his neck briefly. Scarlet freezes for a moment, but then he just pats me on the back. I take a couple of steps back and wave goodbye to him, his cheeks are kinda red but he waves back. As I leave I think to myself \"Making new friends! Yes I am!\"</span></div></div>",

Still though, that woman is clearly an enemy. She might act otherwise, but I can tell. I've told everyone about Mirage, Ozpin I recall actually made an important expression for about a second. He's hiding something, gotta be. Though he's like Elvira, plays cards close to the chest even with those who are supposed to be on their side. Why I don't know, I remember that I'm still new. Chances are Ozpin ain't gonna reveal what's on his mind for some time to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Elvira she's still in our world, making sure everything is hunky dory over there. Someone's gotta hold the fort in the place that's more safer, though I wonder if John's gotten word. Could do with another familiar person here, but I've got all my crew at least. And perhaps things might get more fun. There's going to be an upcoming dance, and speaking of that I'm in a hall that's going to be used for it. I'm just leaning on the wall, trying to gaze a hole in the floor when I hear a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ryan! I asked you a question!\" Jenny says, I suddenly get back to my current situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry babe zoned out, run it by me again.\" I state, no point in hiding anything from her after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny pouts, but then says \"We'll be using the stuff we wore for Charlie's bonding ceremony, makes things easier. What do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod and say \"Waste not want not Jen, let's grab our stuff soon. You helping plan this dance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response my girlfriend giggles and says \"I don't need to. Check it, Ice Queen's got everything under control.\" she points and I see Weiss with a clipboard lording Ruby over. No sign of Blake though, she don't speak much. Yang stepped out too. Neptune and Sun enter and the man with the blue hair is giving Weiss the preferential treatment. Smooth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might as well nip out and get our clothes.\" Jenny says, a smirk from me and we hold hands and exit the building. Though as we walk down the hallway we see Dex leaning on the wall, looking out the window with intent on focusing on whatever's out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at me and whispers \"Hey Carlson, check this out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frown, I've still not really forgiven Dex for trying to kill me on the roof of Starmage. But he seems reformed, so I'll hear him out at least. The redhead points to someone outside the window. It's a guy with silver hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Him. Something's not right about him.\" Dex says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh.....that guy. Mercury Black right?\" I say, I remember the face and name. Haven't spoken to him properly though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he's up to something. I know a prick when I see them, and he's got it written all over em. I'm telling you Carlson watch that one, him and those broads he's with.\" Dex is usually talking jovial like, this tone isn't lost on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, if you find anything out though Dex be sure to tell us all. Only way we can help people is as a team.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDex smirks at that and says \"Heh you know, all this goody goody friendship stuff is rubbing off on me. Sure thing, laters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he departs, Jenny is quiet though she's thinking what I'm thinking. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryan's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell Weiss guided the whole event's construction, and sure enough she has done quite the spiffing job. Sure she can be pretty snobby with regards to, well a lot. But hey the girl seemed happy enough, so I'm willing to have it slide. And besides, she had fancy curtains installed and has this elaborate theme going on that's really nice. Certainly better than anything we get over at Starmage, it's proof that Remnant has things which are delightful. And sure enough a lot of people are formal here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI catch Weiss sitting on the sidelines, I figured she'd be centre of the floor right now. But hey I don't know her as well as I should, so maybe I ought to can making the judgements so quickly. I see the guy who has the blue hair, uh one of Sun's guys. Neptune that's it! Seems Weiss is pretty flattered by how he's acting, nice and good guts to him. I'm wearing suit and tie, the same I had with Charlie's bonding ceremony. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid's sitting with Viva and Vogue, they're pestering him to do some dance with them. Chon's nearby too, Amy is strangely chatting and joking with him. The Chinese guy is even making an effort to smile, I reckon something good happened with them. Probably burying the hatchet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby is Dex looking really out of place with that suit and his blood red hair, he's making an effort to dance with Huanle. But still I can tell he's looking at this Mercury person, I'll admit something's not right about him. Has to be if someone like Bedlam can't stand him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny gets my attention with a tug on the sleeve, and I smirk at the sight. We make our way to the pair that have just entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good evening Akatsuki.\" I say to Shomei, the man is an ex JSDF officer. And needless to say he's looking pretty dapper, he's wearing that old uniform of his. But I notice it has a couple of medals on it, and it's looking real refined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't really know the woman next to him, but she's got some real nice bunny ears and a short black dress on. Must be a Faunus, so there's all kinds it seems. Sho gives a small and polite bow and says \"Of course Carlson-sama, I don't miss events like this. May I introduce my date for this evening, Velvet-chan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bunny girl blushes and says \"Um hi, Sho is pretty good at dancing. I was uh looking for a partner and Sho just happened to come across me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't like to brag but dancing was part of officer etiquette back in the JSDF.\" Akatsuki said, that Japanese politeness shining through. He then says \"Well shall we then Velvet-chan?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah er, bye you pair. Sho you'll really need to teach me about the way you address people, honorifics right?\" Velvet says, with that she leaves with the officer in tow. Wonder what she'd think when she found out that Sho's actually far older than he looks, probably take in stride considering all the weird things here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight's chatting with Yang, he's already got his suit coat off and leaning on the wall. Yang's eyeing him up and down, probably preparing to eat him alive. Well that's gonna be pretty difficult cause he can put his chin on top of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy gaze then drifts to Ruby, she suddenly looks concerned. And steps out rather quickly, I'm smelling something's up. More so as I clocked Ruby called her weapon down from a giant cylinder thing. Jenny sees it too, because she mutters \"Get after her, if she's called her weapon down that can't be good. I'll see if I can get Chon to follow.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grunt to say yes and swiftly step outside, I know where Ruby's gone. Mentally I request Azura at my side, his voice rings in my head. That aged and strong Japanese tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I answer my Lord.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stick out my left hand as I run faster, Ruby hears my footsteps and says \"Ryan! Look, these guys have been taken out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWordlessly I nod, but I choose to chime in with \"Something tells me someone's up to no good. Let's go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rose nods to me, and we step inside. Guards have been knocked out, all we have to do is follow the path. I'll admit I've not been to this place, must be pretty important if there's all these fucking redshirts around here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe step into the elevator, some of that corny music starts playing. A stark contrast to the tense situation, Ruby readies her weapon and I draw Azura. It's blade flickers, a subtle sign of lurking danger. The ride stops, and the doors open and we step out. Ms Rose though hesitates, trying to walk in those high heels. How the heck do women wear those anyway? Weiss can do it no problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless after that we move forward, Ruby calls out if anyone's there. Lo and behold someone does, she looks real fancy. Catsuit and mask and everything, Ruby begins to speak but I can already tell this woman's up to no good. Case in point she launches fancy dust spikes at us, in the blink of an eye though Ruby blocks them and opens fire. Which is blocked by the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spring into action, leaping up off the nearby computers and aiming to bring Azura down and cleave her in two. Only she blocks the attack with one arm and the bullets with her other, she makes to swing a trail of flaming dust up at me. But I quickly pivot to the side and dodge as she busts out a pair of swords, I yell and quickly swing into her. She blocks with both blades and sends me backwards with a kick to the gut, Ruby however moves in close with her weapon's bullet recoil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blade lock is broken with the enemy falling back, she suddenly turns her swords into a bow and fires dust arrows. Crap. But as she fires those arrows I move in with the spot that isn't being shot at and quickly attempt to stab her in the gut, I'm not playing here. If I must I will kill her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the enemy detects it and turns her weapon to swords again and uses them to get in the way of Azura, I grit my teeth and mutter \"Bitch.\" as she quickly backflips away. I put Azura in his scabbard, intent on drawing on our combined will to launch some blade beams at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough the elevator opens again, Ironwood's there. I turn around again though, and the enemy is gone......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit.\" I state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened here?\" Ironwood says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look at Ruby, who's silent. And simply state \"You need better men.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing this the next day I knew I'd need to talk about this with everyone, this went from great to horrible in a matter of minutes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><b>(Ryan's POV)</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the elevator opened again revealing the stout figure of Matt Moray who was wielding a strange remote control. I recognized it as a mad scientist's wand, similar to a witch's wand, from Juan Smith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see I missed the real party.\" Sarcastically, he stated. \"If the intruder was in here, it is obvious that his or her intention was to take something from the computers or place something into them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you mean a computer virus, that would not work.\" Serious, Ironwood said. \"Our computer system is too advanced to be breached.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No defense is perfect, Ironwood.\" Frowning, Matt said. \"To think otherwise is complete arrogance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronwood look insulted but he was not getting any help from me; Matt was right, no defense was perfect, even Light knew that. Matt walked up to the main terminal and pulled out his cellphone, what Remnant called a Scroll. Only, as he did, a powerful image flashed in front of my eyes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw Matt placing his cellphone into a port slot only to be hit with a massive electrical jolt. He screamed before the computer exploded, sending him flying across the room. Ironwood jumped into action and caught him but the mad science prince was dead. There was a flash and I saw Jessica Moray, the head witch screaming to a crowd of witches before I then saw Devlin Moray, the had mad scientist screaming to a crowd of mad scientists; all were armed for battle! The next scene took my breath away. I saw a massive hurricane with a star ship in its eye, the mad scientists flag ship, entering the world of Remnant through a rip with a castle pulled through the sky by huge dragons following with countless witches and mad scientists flying in attacking the world of Remnant! The death of Matt Moray would rekindle the ancient war only the two forces would be united against the unknown enemy Ozpin had spoke of only the world of Remnant would be caught in the crossfire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the image vanished, I saw Matt Moray reach for his cellphone!  \"Stop, you fool!\" Firmly, I screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew calling Matt a fool would get his attention quickly. It worked. He stopped in his tracks and whipped around, glaring at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dare call me a fool?\" Insulted, Matt demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you care to think that the intruder might have set a trap for anyone trying to follow her trail?\" Sternly, I countered. \"You are leaping in without even looking.\" I shook my head. \"Tsk Tsk. You are such a novice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronwood grinned slightly as Matt gaped at me, insulted. \"I... knew that!\" Blushing slightly, he snapped. \"Anyone with half a brain would realize that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how do you intend to follow this intruder's trail, young mad scientist?\" Hiding his grin, Ironwood asked. \"If there is a trap waiting for anyone trying to stop whatever she did...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt cracked his knuckles, smiling. \"We'll just have to do it another way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched, curious as Matt walked away from the computers before pulling out his wand. He fired a beam at the main computer from a distance, causing it to violently explode. Fortunately, no one was hurt as the pieces of the computer never hit the ground; they were suspended by Matt's event. With a satisfied grin, Matt pressed a number of buttons on his wand and the computer pulled itself back together as if nothing had happened. \"There, the trap as been dealt with.\" Smiling, he said. \"Now, down to business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt did not pull out his cellphone this time, he used his wand again. \"Intruder intentions that do not compute, show us all what you were told to execute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the lamest spell I ever heard.\" Rolling his eyes, Ironwood muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's called an event, wise guy.\" Sassy, Matt countered. \"You try to make something up on the fly.\" He then childishly stuck his tongue out at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned at that. <i>\"College level one minute and childish the next.\"</i> Amused, I thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronwood only grunted but became concerned as he saw a chess piece appear onto the screens. \"That is that; a chess piece?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is what we call a Trojan horse virus.\" Serious, Matt said. \"Any computer that hooks up with this system will be under the control of the intruder.\" He sighed. \"It's a very complex program; no doubt littered with booby traps to stop anyone who tries to remove it from the system.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you get rid of it?\" Concerned, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt shook his head. \"I honestly don't know.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But I quickly moved in and got my friends involved, Light was directing traffic and Chon made sure the kids got to bed. Sho was leaning on the wall, but I could tell he was peering through the folks departing. Looking for someone in particular, maybe it was Sho's built in BS detector. The next thing I know I'm standing in Ozpin's office, he glances at me entering before looking at his computer screen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Carlson. I have a problem with my computer, Elvira said you knew a thing or two. What say yo...\" Ozpin says but I go right up to his desk and point at the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a virus. It's in your entire system, Trojan Horse.\" with that I quickly pull the plug on the device and shut it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin lightly frowned before saying \"Was that what the commotion was about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Ironwood's wrapped it up. Listen you've got a Trojan Horse, it's gonna infect every inch of your system if we're not careful. Try and get every computer you have switched off, Lunar, Sho, Dex and Matt are looking into it.\" I explain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, right. We'll make sure to keep it as closed as possible, if we can find out who did this that would be the next good step. But first we must defend ourselves. Keep me up to date, I'll look over the camera recordings. Perhaps our enemy slipped up, just a bit.\" Ozpin says as he scratches his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod and exit the office, I briskly walk back to the scene of the crime. Lunar is standing with Matt checking the screen, Sho's standing by at the power source of the network. Dex is on a computer that I assume is separate from the network.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me you have good news.\" I say as I approach the robot girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunar shakes her candy cotton haired head and says \"This is a difficult task Carlson. I'm still not entirely familiar with the technology of this world, Matt is also of the same opinion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm standing by to power this place, my blitzmotor is seemingly able to interact with the computers here.\" Sho says. Oh yeah, he can produce electricity. It's a universal power source it seems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDex waves at me and says \"I knew it, that bitch is probably in with those pricks I talked about earlier. Just checking what I know about viruses, my folks might not have had time for their side project but I know tech. And I've dealt with bugs and stuff before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh and say in response \"As likely as it might seem Dex we can't jump to conclusions. We need to deal with the current problem, can we contain the virus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunar nodded and said \"Yes, we've already taken the steps to do so as best we can. It's not going to spread to anything out this room, but it's gotten a large amount of data from the present computers. We've preserved what we can and made sure it was backed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only problem is we can't trace where it's gone. Dammit they got one over on us.\" Matt said hitting the table next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay I have an idea on how to at least get it off these computers, good things these dolts have USB slots. Lunar this stick should make the virus implode on itself. Logic bomb.\" Dex says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys have done good, they might have won this battle. But we'll find them, they're good. But we've got the unity they don't.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSho smiles and says \"You would have been a great leader in the JSDF Carlson-sama, Kami knows that during that time we needed all the positivity we could have.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Dex has a little smirk on his face, still we need to be on the attack. Can't always get by on defence, I hope my semblance will tell me something useful. To win we need to attack, that's the key. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryan's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd finally been able to get some shut eye, or rather I had prepared to do so. Matt and the others had been able to mostly solve the problem with the virus, still the damage had been done. Some valuable data had been taken it seemed, we didn't know what it was but it must have been important. But sleep is calling, I just got out my suit and into bed. Didn't bother getting close to Jenny. I just shut my eyes and tried to let sleep take me as my body would demand it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo such luck, no luck at all. My semblance seems to be different from others like Yang or Ruby, I don't actually have control over when it occurs. It just does, without rhyme or reason. It's happened during battles, one time even when I took a shower. They come to me in flashes, like a glimpse of a photograph usually. Though sometimes they have audio to come with it, usually my voice yelling something which gives me another hint on what I should do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's activated, I can tell. When I view it there's always this reddish tint to it, like how you processed those old photographs in a dark room. But it's not like a picture this time, rather a movie. I think it's from my perspective as it always is. I see Beacon Academy, and I also see another place that I'm not familiar with. It looks like some kind of arena, people are running and screaming from something. I'm not sure but I feel panic grip me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it cuts back to Beacon Academy, I'm seeing it in flames. I know this isn't a nightmare, the tint proves it. But I wish it was so that I didn't have to see this, folks are running. There's grimm all over the damn place, the only good thing is I see everyone kicking ass and taking names. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the worst part? I feel that things are going to get worst. And they do, I feel my hair on the back of my neck stand up. Pyrrha's dead. I see it with my own eyes. How I don't know, I see her look at me. And then she dissolves into dust, not the power source that folks in this world use. She's just ashes, right in front of my eyes. Then suddenly I see this gigantic Grimm monster, bigger than anything I've ever seen before me. And it lets out this roar, that chills me to the bone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jolt up, having woken up. I'm dripping in sweat even if my whole body is shivering, this wakes up Jenny. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetheart what's the matter?!\" she says to me as she leans up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take deep breaths to calm myself, and eventually do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My semblance worked.\" I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it? What did it say?\" Jenny asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw that Pyrrha woman die, Beacon was in flames.\" I say, I move the covers to let my body breathe a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny was silent, she might have thought I was mad earlier. But my semblance has yet to be proven false. I still can't believe it, I don't want to. But I have to, what happens from here? It must have been a very dire situation for my semblance to be activated as such. When did that occur?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well......let's get some sleep Ryan. No point in thinking about it till the morning, don't worry. What you know can help prevent it, remember that.\" Jenny says as she runs a finger down my bare chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that I sigh in relief, muttering thanks I then close my eyes. Trying to keep them shut as much as I can to let sleep take me once again.</span></div></div>",

I'm racking my brain on who's behind this, I have a feeling. But I know Carlson's not going to be willing to get behind it, he'd like to probably. But given my history and all that, yeah I'd better get some evidence first. I'm looking at that Mercury Black guy, he's got something to do with it. Cards on the table I will admit that I am a prick, I look like it and proudly wave the flag of prick alert over my head. That's why I have an inkling that Mercury's a part of what's going on, because it takes one to know one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe's not in it alone, that much I'm certain. Black's gotta be a pawn, a goon. Maybe that chick he hangs around with, the one with green hair is the brains of the op. Then again Carlson said he fought a woman with hair that wasn't like that woman's, Emerald was her name. They've all gotta be linked together, somehow. They're involved. I fucking know it, but I need proof. I sigh and lean back on my chair, running my fingers along my scars. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I have a sort of revelation if you will, I could ask the others. Maybe Chon? Huanle spoke to me about how he can sense people's chi, what if........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decide to go to bed. I shut off the heavy metal music that was blaring from my headphones, sighing I slump into bed. Mulling it over until sleep takes me. I drift into the dance that I had tonight, with Huanle. She's a really nice girl, doesn't have a mean bone in her body. I really like her, Chon doesn't seem too happy with it. But Huanle is making the approach to me, don't know what she thinks I have. I'm rich sure, but I'm a prick. Yeah I'm one of the \"Good guys\" now, but I'm still probably not liked too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe danced though, I can actually be good at that. Maids were around me when I grew up, and I learned some steps. The morning comes as I think more on that Chinese girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun rises, I grumble and sit up. Rubbing my blood red hair to look vaguely neat, I remember who else was near us when me and Huanle danced. That SOB Mercury, and a woman with a certain hair colour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHair colour. Carlson talked about it, I remember it. And I realise something, the woman who attacked......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fucking hell.....\" I muttered, it was so obvious!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly turn my phone on, and call Carlson. It rings a few times, before I hear his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dex what is it? It's 7AM.\" he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured it out! That woman you met last night, she hid among the people dancing! She was right next to me with Huanle, dancing with Mercury.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a pause, and Carlson then says \"I need more than your word Dex, you know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stand up and say \"Well Huanle could vouch for me, she was dancing with me that entire evening. It was clever what they did. How do you keep a secret from people like us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Put it right in front of us.\" Ryan remarks before continuing with \"Okay, I'll have a word with her. Ask around as well, I hope your onto something here Dex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty sure I am.\" I remark before hanging up. Maybe my time spent as a douchebag might actually be useful for once.</span></div></div>",

But I'm wanting a piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anyone who wishes to take Dex on?\" Glynda asks, I've walked to the large opening. Drawing my serrated katanas and cracking my neck. I stare right at Mercury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe lifts his hand, bingo.

I tend to enjoy being the aggressor in battle, letting my foe react to me. But since losing to Ryan I've been learning other martial arts, to try and build up a more solid defence. Problem with dual blades is you can't commit both hands, but it provides more options for you. I've studies on single blade techniques in case of being disarmed of one, Mercury seems to favour his legs more than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaps into the air, bringing his left leg with an axe kick. I react by quickly side stepping to the right and spinning, as Mercury lands I spin and slam the hilt of my left blade into his forehead. Mercury staggers back, blinking rapidly. Usually I'd take this chance to lean back and gloat, but Mercury doesn't warrant that. He warrants me trying to batter the shit out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that I slowed his assault its time for me to mount my own, I quickly spin again and bring my two blades in at the right to try and slash at his midriff. Mercury managed to rally, the tips of my blade only managed to just nick him thanks to their serrated edges. But I carry on, poking at his legs with a downward stab. Mercury manages to quickly bring his left leg up and blasts me in the chest though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI go flying back, but my acrobatics allow me to shift back to my feet before I hit the floor. With this new distance I decide on a new plan of attack, quickly putting my right blade away I dig into my jacket tied around my waist. Where I take out three serrated combat knives, flinging them in a spinning motion towards Mercury. I quickly move to go behind them, using those to force a reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMercury thinks fast, leaping over them. Which I anticipated, I follow up with a leaping uppercut with my left blade. I call this the Izayoi Rise. I catch Mercury on the chin and lift higher than him, following into it with Izayoi's Rejection. A spinning left armed strike, driving the blade into his chest and sending Mercury crashing back down. Leaving a small crater where he lands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly shift in mid air so that I stand atop him on the way down, my blade pressed close to his neck. I can't resist a smirk as I say \"Give it up, your outclassed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to get under Mercury's skin, he begins to rise up only for Glynda to move forward and say \"Enough, the bout is concluded. Dex step off from him please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmirking I say \"Fine.\" Quickly stepping back afterwards and sheathing my blades. Mercury looks totally sour, he knows I got to him. But I quickly move back to my.....friends? Yeah that's what they are. That feels weird to describe, but I like it......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Way to go Dex!\" Huanle says, patting me on the shoulder. I can't help but grin, it feels really genuine too.....so this is what being good feels like......I like it.</span></div></div>",

See with regards to my physic powers I can't really turn it off, like if I don't do something specific I can't block people's thoughts out. So I can hear Light dreaming about Yang for example, those were ummmmm.....naughty I guess is the best way to speak about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira made me a special sleepwear, laced with tinfoil believe it or not. It really does help nullify my mental powers, so that way I can get a peaceful good night's rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe alarm goes off, that stupid beeping noise. I quick move to shut it off, 8 in the morning. I needed one more hour, groaning I heave my 6+ ft frame out of bed. Letting out a yawn I get myself dressed, with my mind I'm thinking on how to control my ESP powers more. It's rare, so there's not actually that much information I can use. Even Elvira confessed not to having an in-depth knowledge of it, but I need to learn to control it. So I can be useful and be a good person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick shower later I comb my long blonde hair that goes down to my navel, I really should get it cut. Yang's really possessive of her hair, but she trusts Light to comb it and the only person to do that is Ruby. I look down at my form, I'm nude. I really have to bend my head down so I can see past my breasts, these things always get in the way. And sometimes they itch, and then I swear they actually grow bigger at times! Ugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI go braless, from my time being used as a test subject I was never given one. So I'm just not used to it, Jenny pesters me to wear one. But I feel just fine without it, they just get in the way these things. I peer down to my breasts, they grow on their own sometimes I swear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I've brushed my hair I get out the room, I get out the dorm and come face to face with someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oof!\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no, I bumped into someone. That happens quite a bit with me, I'm taller than most women around me and I'm so clumsy too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so sorry!\" I instantly shout, more out of a kneejerk reaction that anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I realise it's that guy from last night, Scarlet. Him with the red hair that saved me from falling in the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh it's okay uh Jane, I was kinda spaced out myself. You okay?\" he says in that voice, it's got a melodic sort of tone to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe stand there for a second or two, looking at each other. His eyes drift down to my body, and I'm looking at Scarlet with my head tilted. I don't have anything messy on my outfit, I just got into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough I remember he said something to me, I quickly said \"Oh I'm fine Scarlet! I umm...kinda tend to bump into things a lot.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScarlet smiles a little and twirls some of his hair, it's quiet. He then says \"Well that's good, yesterday was pretty fun wasn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah it was, I never really had a chance to wear yukatas before. But I wonder why they let us wear them when we could fall into water like I nearly did.\" I say, I really like those fancy clothes though. I felt so cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say Jane, tell me a bit about yourself. I mean if that's okay with you.\" Scarlet says, motioning for me to follow him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do so, we walk outside to a bench and sit down. People are still waking up so we get to see the grounds of Beacon in a very peaceful sort of setting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well........\" I begin, I wonder what to say. \"I-I.....didn't have a good childhood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Scarlet says. Suddenly my ESP powers kick in and I hear his voice echo in my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Damn, that's a bit of a strange start there.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh, I might as well tell him the truth. \"I was raised by bad people, they wanted to experiment on me because I had special powers. Like powers that others didn't.\" I mutter, my long blond hair drooping over my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of powers was it Jane?\" Scarlet mutters softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can do things with my mind, lift objects and people. Those are things I know I can do, I don't know if I can do other stuff though. If I use it too much it gives me a headache and nosebleeds.\" when saying I know Scarlet is probably looking at me like a freak, I make to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Scarlet says to me \"That sounds really useful Jane, mean you can do it just with thinking. That's gamechanging, you could hold an opponent in place for your friends to attack. And save them from harm by moving them out the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait? Scarlet's.....complimenting me?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn to look at him, feeling my cheeks tint red. Oh wow.....Someone outside of my family likes me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I can respond though my phone rings, it's a text from my Brother Light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"We're making breakfast, get over here.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlunt as usual. I quickly stand up and dust myself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I need to go Scarlet, I'll see you l-later though! Bye!\" I quickly move to get to breakfast, but I've got a really happy smile on my face though. He likes me! He likes me!</span></div></div>",

He's blind after all, sure he can see just fine. But he can only really read something if it's in a style similar to braille. But at the same time......nah no point in thinking on it. Chon can be very surprising at times, and creep up on you when you least expect it. They say that you can't hear him if he wishes it, load of bull if you ask me. There's no way that's possible, he doesn't use magic! He hates it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, the evening comes around. Beacon is bathed in a delightful orange glow, it's really quite something this place, it's overrun with monsters aside from the rare places. But it's got a natural beauty to it, were it not for the grimm this might actually be a really sweet place to live in. But nothing's perfect I suppose, even my barrier magic. Since that Weiss bitch kicked my ass I've thought that maybe I should take a more offensive approach with combat, though I'm not sure how to go about that. I don't really work out, but I have been practising using a telekinesis spell to control things. Maybe I could ask Chon for weapons that I could use, and I could have the weapon move back into my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell it's good to know that I've got a sort of rough guide of what I want to do, though I should probably speak to Chon and request access to his oriental weapons. Damn, I ran off from him earlier. But I doubt he'll care about that, probably just thought \"Meh whatever.\" though where could he be? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably outside, Chon prefers to spend time surrounded by nature if he can. He says it helps him centre his chi, or whatever that is. Seriously sometimes he can be more cryptic than the head witch Elvira, if you can believe that. I'm walking down a park path outside Beacon, when suddenly I hear a voice. It's sounds like.....someone weeping?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, I creep towards the source of it. Sounds male. I slowly move around the tree, only to find out who it is. Chon. I.......didn't know that he could cry, I can see bloody droplets trickling down his cheeks. My mouth is slightly agape at this sight, Chon. You just look so.....vulnerable, I've never seen that to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon seems to realise that I'm there, his head jerks a little and then he turns away from me. \"Go away.\" he mutters, I can hear his voice quiver ever so slightly. His right arm moving to cover himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ought to have left him, I mean we've not exactly gotten along in the past. But I've never seen him like this before, and it's making me concerned. I bite my lower lip and kneel down, and mutter in reply \"I'm not, Chon. Please tell me what's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pauses, he gives a sigh. It's haggard, weighed. Eventually though he does move his arm away, and wipes his tears off. It's more water than blood it seems. \"Nightmare.....\" Chon whispers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that's it? Must have been something to give him this reaction, I've always seen Chon as a stoic man. He rarely smiles unless he's trolling me or with his girls, I tilt my head and say \"Would it help if I heard about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon pauses, considering my words. He sighs and says \"I suppose, no doubt you'd remain until I tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Chinese man is silent for a few seconds, before taking a deep breath and saying \"You know I've killed in the past right? All those rogue witches, before I came to Starmage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWordlessly I nod, before muttering \"They say you first killed at the age of 15, you faked yourself as a hostage to a rogue witch. And then....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Impaled her through the chest with my left arm, she fell 40 feet off the roof onto a car. She's there, and the other rogue witches I killed as payback for what they did to my Brother. But there's others, Triad assassins and various others that tried to kill me. I justified it, it was either revenge or that I had to defend myself. But.....the nightmare I have......I'm on a battlefield, flames all around it. On one side is me, and the other side has all those I killed. They do nothing though, merely just stand single file. And don't offer any resistance as I slaughter them one by one.\" Chon says, he's looking straight ahead. In a very calm tone in spite of the panic that he displayed earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm quiet, it all makes sense. The witch community despise Chon, seeing him as nothing more than some ruthless vigilante. But.....I know the truth now, he's a hurt person. Who performed what was done to him onto others, because he knew no other way. But after changing, Chon knows what he's done. It's haunting him, I can see that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrangely, I go close to him. And embrace him quickly, placing his head close to my chest and resting my head on top of his. Chon flinches and freezes up, but after a few seconds he accepts me. I sigh, pausing to think of what to say. Chon cuts me off by saying \"Don't talk, please. Just stay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can oblige with that, Chon.....maybe I've been wrong about you.........</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Amy's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis situation just feels sorta surreal, when I first met Chon I just thought he was a total jerk. He hated me just because I can use magic, like he was really bad. We came to blows more than once, and he wasn't pulling any punches whatsoever. I heard one time he actually gave John Harrison's Sister, I forget her name anyway Chon near gave her a black eye. Said that if the Harrisons were in charge it's just a sign that magic is a blight on the world. Kinda hard to believe he's so different now, but Chon's really hurt. And he dealt with it in the worst way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly I don't know why but I'm feeling myself well up, why? Is it because of what I think of him now? Maybe, I've drawn him when he's doing things. We've even had conversations where we laugh together. And I don't argue with Chon really anymore, the times that did were my fault. I realise that now, he had changed but I didn't think he had. It led to conflict because of how I acted, and I refused to see how he had improved. But Chon you......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry.\" I mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon freezes up again, we sit in silence for a few very tense seconds before he responds with \"For what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shuffle around so that I'm facing him, for some reason I find myself cupping his head with my hands. Chon's tears drip over my fingers, I then sigh and say \"You changed for the better, but I ignored it. When you did I stayed where I was, and I caused you more unneeded pain when I should have supported you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiles, it's a slight one but it's good that he does. I have been wrong about him, not at the start. But I was as time went on. \"Amy.....\" Chon mutters to me. His hands move to my own, they feel a bit rough. A side effect from his martial arts background, but it's nice to have gentle feelings with them rather than him trying to punch me. My eyes dart down to the rest of his arms, those nice, very nice biceps. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.....\" I trail off wondering what to do from here. Man, I'm a ball of yarn here myself. I take a deep breath, Chon's relying on me for support. It's not gonna do either of us any good if I break down now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a deep breath, and feel a sense of resolution in my mind as I proceed to speak with \"Chon, I want to help you now. To make up for how I didn't back then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you....intend to do that?\" he responds, confusion in his voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAm I going to say what I'm going to? Fuck it might as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd be there for you, to help shield you from when witches try to decry you as a monster. And I could.....hold you when you wanted it. No matter the time or day.\" I say, this is the time. I need to be there for him, I....want to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon's mouth opens slightly as he processes what I've said, but he eventually says \"Thank you Amy. But.....are you saying what I think you are?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWordlessly I nod, I know he'll see that. Chon is quiet, but he smiles to me. Though he says \"Amy I need to say something though, you know I'm asexual right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah he did say that, one time way back when we were arguing constantly he said that he didn't care about the gender of those he fought. I think it was all the things that happened to him that made him that way though, Chon's only focus was getting revenge. He didn't a normal teenaged life as far as I'm aware.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. But even so Chon.......\" I trail off as my hands drift down to his impressive arms, Chon simply stays still as I examine them. This is so odd from how we were back then, to now. And I like it.</span></div></div>",

They were each three feet square on a long handle made of enchanted oak which nearly unbreakable. All of it appeared to have been strengthened more with witch writing done in his own magical blood.

By the end of the day every muscle in my body was more or less screaming, but I know I'm going to need all of this. I'm no stranger to pain though, had it with me since as far as I can remember. If I wasn't getting hit with magic I was usually feeling the pain of having my stomach walls clang into each other, the only solace I could get from this was that at least I knew I was alive. It wasn't a very good way though I know that, and through it all. From the burns to the starving I could only think of one thing, something I never asked my so called Mother and my so called Sisters. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy put me through all that? Did they even have a reason? Oddly enough I never bothered to ask, most likely out of fear. Fear that it would only bring worse things onto me, I still remember the look of shock that Ryan had when he found me. I wasn't wearing proper clothes that day, I had a fucking potato sack on with duct tape and dirt. Though when I went to Starmage at least Mom had the decency to teach me how to read and write. But when I started learning, something just.....clicked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was probably to make up for the fact I hadn't learned much then, so I just got everything right first time. I even amazed myself sometimes. Then this happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm looking at this letter, given to me by my so called Sisters. I have my two girlfriends with me, sitting on either side as they usually do. I always feel safe with Viva and Vogue with me, they actually did beat up Rose and Carla one point. Ryan said \"It's recorded on CCTV? Great, I'll get a copy. That's never getting old.\" I don't get it though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe letter is addressed by my Mother, currently serving a sentence in witch prison. Not just for abusing me, but it turns out she's done all sorts of bad stuff. I understand it now, we were in hiding. And I was used as a test target for Rose and Carla. It's funny that I get this letter now after my power as a human familiar has awoken, like she's actually making an effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the contents of the letter it's basically my Mom stating that she's proud that my true potential has been tapped into. And proceeds to talk about all the time I was abused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was to try and prepare you for the pain that might ensue in your future, my son I was aware of your power this whole time. But I lacked the ability to bring it forth, so I with great reluctance put you through all that torment. To toughen you up for when it was ready to appear, as no doubt many witches would seek you. Ones that would do far, far worse than what already happened to you. I took no joy in it I assure you Charlie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReally? I don't know if I can really trust these words. My Mother wasn't a Mother at all, why couldn't she have just told me? I'm not sure what to think, and I frown at the contents before setting it down. Rose and Carla are offering me beaming smiles, though I don't make eye contact. My girlfriends put their hands on my legs in reassurance though, no doubt sensing my concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a think on it okay?\" Rose says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to visit my Mot.....Eliza?\" I say, Rose bites her lower lip. I'm not calling her a Mother to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yeah, a face to face conversation. Charlie she's not coming out of witch prison for at least 20 years, can you at least grant her this?\" Carla asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pause, moving the letter forward before saying \".......I'll think on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Rose and Carla depart, though they leave some chocolate bars on the desk. Sickly sweet indeed, these aren't even my favourites.</span></div></div>",

I noticed a worried look on all three of their faces and turned to Chon who seemed to have sensed their concern as well. \"What happened?\" Approaching them, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rose and Carla appeared in my bedroom with a letter from... Eliza.\" Frowning, Charlie said. \"She wants to talk to me; face to face at witch prison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see it.\" Sighing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie handed the letter over to me and I carefully looked it over. Having magic used against me again and again, I could easily sense if the paper or ink was magically enhanced by just looking at it. Fortunately, it was not but the wording of the letter left much to be desired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a trap!\" Hugging Charlie's left arm, Viva blurted out. \"I can just feel it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no trusting that woman!\" Hugging Charlie's right arm, Vogue added. \"Poor Charlie doesn't know what to do about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The decision to visit or not visit her is up to you, Charlie.\" Serious, Chon said. \"You owe that woman nothing after what she put you through; regardless of what reasons she may have cooked up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That and I find it highly suspicious that she sends this letter after the fact your new found powers as a human familiar came to the surface.\" Frowning, I said. \"If she knew of your power from the beginning, why did she not state this at her trial?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she was trying to bring that power to the surface, why did she use hateful, hurtful methods?\" Unimpressed, Amy noted. \"Anyone who knows anything about magic will tell you that the power only comes for those close to a familiar's heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I smell a set up.\" Serious, Chon said. \"If you do go, I strongly suggest you do not go alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie gulped, not knowing what to say but paused, looking up as a thump was heard. \"What was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might be Jenny.\" Lightly, I said. \"She mentioned she was looking for something she had lost earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thump was heard again and Amy sighed. \"I'll check it out.\" Heading towards the stairs, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need me to come with you?\" Offering, Chon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy smiled, a slight giggle escaping her lips. \"I'm sure its nothing.\" Lightly, she said. \"I'll be back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she vanished up the stairs to the second level of our dorm, we turned hearing the door opened and were surprised to see Jenny walk in with a notebook in her hand. \"I left it in the library.\" Smiling, she said. She paused, seeing concerned faces. \"What? What did I miss?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpstairs, Amy checked jenny's bed chambers to find it empty then heard the thump again. It was coming from a spare bed chamber they did not use. Gulping, she slowly walked to the room and threw open the door to see a tall, dark shadow standing before her! She let out a short scream before summoning a hand held taser and hit the shadow with it in the chest! A masculine yell was heard before the figure fell and Amy hit the light to see Tex lying on the floor with a goofy grin on his face. \"Sh... Shocking!\" Between coughs, he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tex!\" Annoyed, Amy blurted out. \"What the devil are you doing here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My pet lab rat got lose and I saw it scurry into this window.\" Pouting, he explained. \"I was just trying to retrieve it before one of you claimed it for yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy huffed but gave a low coo as she saw a white toothless mouse the size of a pug. Normally, Amy would have cringed at such a sight but the mouse had no teeth. \"You are just too cute!\" Gushing, she said. \"Come here, you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was about to pet the rodent when someone crashed through the window, causing her to scream. On the first floor, a small platoon of security guards with the Moray family seal on their sleeves stormed in with rifles at the ready!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Secure the dorm!\" Forcefully, the man in charge barked. \"Find the threat to our allies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is going on?!\" Alarmed, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon was immediately on guard as well and had already moved her daughters and charlie behind her with Jenny standing behind me. I did not know where Light was but I cracked a smile when I heard his annoyed yell before a security guard literally flew off the second floor landing onto a couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This ain't a forest get outta here!\" Angrily, he yelled. Walking back to the bathroom, he shouted out, \"You pervert!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny held a hand to her mouth, trying not to laugh. I could not help smile a little, imagining the scene as a security guard no doubt walked in on Light trying to take a shower. The guard was lucky he did not tear him to pieces. Only I still did not know what happened to Amy until she came down, holding a white toothless rat the size of a pug in her arms with Tex following with a pout on his face. The rest of the guards followed them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We found the source of the disturbance.\" Somewhat proudly, the guard in charge reported. \"I fear Mr Moray had brought his pet Flores cave rat with him without proper clearance from either realm. He will receive a lecture for this, I assure you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had the situation under control you... maniacs!\" Annoyed, Amy scolded. She turned to me, smiling. \"Tex lost his pet and was just trying to retrieve it, fearing it would cause a panic.\" Cooing, she added, \"Only who would panic over a sweet little thing like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva and Vogue ran over to the rat, dragging Charlie along and cooed at the rat as well. I could only shake my head, wondering how things could have escalated so quickly. \"Tex, you should have called us in advance.\" Lightly scolding, I said. \"We have dealt with worse threats than a giant toothless rat.\" I then turned to the guards, my face hardening. \"We have hundreds of students in this school!\" Annoyed, I yelled. \"Your move may have already caused a complete panic on campus!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Eliza in witch prison without depleting the prefect forces here at school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You speak as if this Eliza is a threat.\" Serious, the commander of the group said. \"I am Ron Foray, my platoon and I would be honored to provide you protection for this visit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie smiled, seeing Light coming down the stairs, fully dressed and mad as hell. \"Very good.\" Loudly, I said. \"However, next time you decide to test Light... give us an advanced warning. Light could have killed the one who walked in on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was a test?\" Angry, Light demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie nodded. \"They wished to prove themselves worthy.\" Bemused, he said. \"However, to a mad scientist, off limits is not in their vocabulary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight grunted. \"Does enter at your own risk compute?\" Irritated, he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guards quickly nodded and Light walked away, grumbling. I could not help smile at the situation. Light was very rarely caught off guard like that. I made a note to talk to him about it later. I turned back to the guards to find Charlie briefing them on who Eliza was to him and what she had done. Upon showing them the letter, they all fell serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This woman has no further claim to you.\" Gruffly, Ron said. \"Her abusive actions are unforgivable!\" He then turned to me and saluted. \"I swear on my very life that no one shall lay a single finger upon Charlie Ren while under our protection for this visit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will be going with him.\" In unison, Viva and Vogue said. \"We are bonded!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon turned to Charlie, a bemused smile forming onto his face. \"Bonded to a set of twins?\" He chuckled. \"You are ambitious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva and Vogue giggled, causing Charlie to blush slightly. \"Keep your minds focused on your mission.\" Serious, Chon chimed in. \"If anything happens to them, I will know immediately.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should one of us go with them?\" Worried, Amy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe they are in good hands.\" Calmly, I said. \"However, if it would make you feel better, one of us will go as a casual observer; acting only when necessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later, the letter was sent back, accepting the invite to visit Eliza but under heavy protection. As Charlie entered the helicopter for the flight to the island prison, he chuckled. \"They are going to be surprised to see that protection is a small army from the world of mad science.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cracked a grin then decided who would be the 'casual observer'.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

I'd want you there looking out for Charlie. To them your their worst nightmare.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can see that, out of the whole group save for Light I know the darkness that can lurk in the hearts of witches. They have a tremendous power, and when it's abused the damage it can do is severe indeed. I know it first hand, and that was what led to me killing a rogue witch at the age of 15. I got out by being able to manipulate the situation so that I could plead self defence. I walked and escaped punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach and every time I got off on self defence I knew the witch community knew otherwise, but without proof I couldn't be convicted. It was fine I thought to myself, after all each and everyone of them had a power to abuse. I saw every magic user as a walking time bomb. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut over time I have realised how hypocritical I became, I abused my power of chi and the law. I welcomed Huanle when she herself was a witch, guess the hardest thing is to accept that you have problems. But it's the first step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then. Charlie, girls prepare yourselves. We leave shortly.\" I state, going towards my room. I shut the door behind me. The room is simple due to my blindness, but I have placed weapons securely in this place. Blind people can know their homes better than those who aren't after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor example my keen senses allow me to detect the hollow floorboard under my feet next to the futon bed that I have. I debate on pulling the Jian that I have there out and hiding it under my clothes, but I decide against it. The place where Charlie's Mother is confined is the most extreme witch prison, I doubt I could bring any weapons in. No matter, me on my own is more than enough. I grab a long black trenchcoat from my cupboard and sling it over myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie's ready to go, the kid simply put a jumper on. Viva and Vogue have the same on, I recall they got them after their bonding ceremony. Because it came straight out my wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding to them we proceed to make our way to the helicopter, but before we do we're patted down. Likely so that we don't make these people look bad, Viva quickly becomes flustered and takes a pair of rubber nunchuks out of her jumper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really Sis?\" Vogue says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I just didn't want us to be unarmed is all. I know we're with BB but we need to be on guard too.\" Viva stammers out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly I sigh before saying \"Remember this isn't like those prisons you see in fiction girls, no chances are taken and every measure of security is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie then chimes in with \"Besides girls, each of you is good as five of those guards. Remember the time you both kicked my Sister's asses? That's never going to be forgotten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy girls giggle at that, then we all step in the copter. After shutting the door and buckling up I put my headset on, the kids follow my motions. \"Can you hear us?\" the pilot says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, how long will the trip take?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1 hour, this prison's got nothing but sea for miles. So we'll be a while.\" came the voice in the cockpit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWordless I nod, Viva is making various whooshing noises as the helicopter takes off. I smirk. Though I lean in towards everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen kids. When we land you will stay within arms reach of me, this place is home to some of the most ruthless witches known. They won't hesitate to cause harm to you.\" I say with a grave tone, they need to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVogue nods and says \"We know it first hand Chon, but we know what you mean. Charlie let's just speak with your Mother and go, is there anything your wanting to ask her?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie nods, only he says \"I got one thing, I'll save it for later though.\" he's actually smiling. I return it and lean back and crack my neck lightly. We've got a while to wait.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chon's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot informs me that we're now arriving near the witch prison, he is then contacted by someone from the place. I can't hear that part of the conversation, I could with my enhanced senses if I focused enough. But I know it's just the witch prison requesting to know who is coming. Charlie looks out the window as well my girls. I know what the establishment looks like already, I've been there before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a very large series of buildings all connected together, around it is a giant forest which I'm told house mythical creatures that were created via alchemy. Plus the grass is sharp as needles and all prisoners are barefooted just like with most real life normal prisons, there's also giant stalagmites that are as tall as the buildings themselves. There's other witch prisons of course, but this is where the worst of the worst are placed. Those that committed murder for example. Charlie's Mother just happens to be one of the witches that killed me and Huanle's older Brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember to stay close to me, do not respond to anything any prisoners say to you. They belong where they are.\" I say, these witches are staying for life most of them. They've got a lot of time to be angry, Viva and Vogue were rogue witch daughters and Charlie is a human familiar. I perhaps should have asked Ryan to come with me, if only for him to watch my back. Then again he always said something when I asked him to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no need. Your back is a weapon in its own right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe helicopter touches down, the door opens as me and the others unbuckle from our seats. I make sure that Viva and Vogue are both holding onto me as we exit, no doubt dragging Charlie along with them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large woman backed by several rogue witch hunters approaches us. I can tell from the way she carries herself that she's the warden of this place, her chi tells me of her power. Dressed in the witch prison guard uniform, light pink is the standard colour for them. I know because I'm told, I've visited prisons like this before also.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well well, it's the blind vengeance Chon Kay himself. I take it this boy is Charlie Ren?\" she askes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod and say \"I take it your in charge?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are correct Mr Chon, I am Zarvesta. Warden of this prison for over a decade, the prisoner is already prepped in the meeting room. Before we go however we must pat you down for any weapons or contraband.\" she said. The rogue witch hunters make to advance towards us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI simply lift my arms into the T position so that I can be frisked, I didn't bring anything so I know I'm good. After all these formalities we are escorted inside. This place reeks of evil chi, it's all I can do to avoid focusing on it. I must be ever vigilant, more so than I am at home. I doubt word has been leaked of our arrival, but the prisoners likely know that Charlie is a male magic familiar. How would they act in response to this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI care not, again my focus is the children. We go to the main desk and speak to the receptionist, sure enough we're processed through. A whole squad of armed rogue witch hunters with the warden in tow, we're walking down a series of corridors. I hear screams in the distance, likely an evil witch losing her mind. I think we're taking the most discreet route to avoid rogues being aware that such a great catch like Charlie is in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe reach a visitor room. Zarvesta says to me \"I assume your going in as a group?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, this is prison after all.\" I state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZarvesta peeks into the room, before saying \"Very well, Eliza is in the room with two guards. I'll be outside. If I hear any sounds of a scuffle I will be in there, so keep your hands un balled Chon. It goes for you as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI merely nod, we step in. Eliza stands on the other side of a glass wall, she looks very, very ragged. Like she aged at least ten years than the last time I saw her, hair knotted, eyes baggy and so on. Her red chi is very present, though its subdued. Witch prison is scaring her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Charlie.\" she says calmly, ignoring myself and the V girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva and Vogue stand on either side of Charlie as he takes the chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How have you been?\" Eliza asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's what she starts off with? Hah. Trying to be a Mother won't help you now Eliza, not after what you did to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better, much better Eliza. I can actually eat and have my skin heal.\" Charlie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEliza makes her move to speak but suddenly Charlie leans forward and says \"I'm going to cut to the chase Eliza, I have questions and I want answers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".......Very well.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy leans back and says...........</span></div></div>",

What also caught my attention was the large number of deep cuts, bruises, and burns all over his body; someone had been torturing him! I quickly sheathed Asura so not to frighten him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy moaned miserably as the rip closed itself behind him then began to silently sob on the floor, quivering like an infant. \"Mommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny gasped, seeing how badly injured the boy was and carefully took him into her arms.

She viciously slashed at me only to have them meet Ryan's sword. \"No fucking way are you hurting my girlfriend!\" Enraged, he roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get lost you amateur!\" Ignoring my emotions, the woman spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she pointed a single steely finger at him. A powerful gust threw him stumbling a few steps backwards before he regained control. It took a lot to push Ryan back; I was in a serious duel. The prefects ran up to assist but only found themselves being thrown off their feet by the same blast wave. I took the chance to put Matt down and urged him to stay behind me. With both my hands free, I could fully focus on fighting this evil witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan, protect the boy!\" defecting a spell, I yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't take that bitch on your own!\" Concerned, Ryan countered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen one of my friends, Chon Kay arrived on the scene. \"Hang on, guys! Help has arrived!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, recognizing Chon's voice but screamed as I narrowly avoided another slash from the rogue's knife like fingers. I threw spell after spell at her but she expertly defected them all as if I was nothing more than a mere nuisance to her. It was taking everything I had and more just to keep the rogue at bay! It looked bad until a fist powered passed me and made contact with the rogue's face. The woman screamed in surprise as the blow sent her tumbling away from me. I looked and found John Doe, A.K.A. The Light Killer standing at my side. His chest was heaving with an anger I had never seen in him before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Olivia Omega!\" Naming the rogue, he screamed. \"I thought I killed you when I escaped!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman, Olivia cackled. \"I thought you would have committed suicide by now.\" Clearly amused, she said. \"You were such a disappointment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped literally hearing John's teeth grinding. \"This ends here and now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no time to play, little boy witch.\" Turning serious, Olivia countered. \"The Moray boy is coming with me.\" She gave Light an evil grin. \"We have perfected the process. He was chosen to be honored with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA gasp escaped my lips as Light gave out an unnatural roar. His rage was over the top...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was about to show this woman I was far from that. Only John leaped at her with an angry roar, bearing his razor like teeth. Jenny ran out of harms way, knowing this would be a battle to the death. Chon jumped in behind John, knowing the dean would want her questioned later. Then, a child's scream caught my attention and I turned to find Mat running from another rogue. This one I recognized and immediately jumped in her path. \"You have a lot of nerve coming here, Elena Kruse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena Kruse was the leader of the dark government, an organized crime syndicate of the witching world. Both she and I were on the others number one hit list due to earlier run ins. Mat hid behind Jenny like any other terrified boy as I held Asura in an offensive stance. Elena, however, seemed unfazed. \"I am not here to play, boy.\" Flatly, she said. \"Just give me the boy and we will be gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not happening!\" Angry, you raged. \"You are not using him for your sick experiments!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John Doe was the experiment.\" Grinning, Elena remarked. \"This boy will be the end result.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do to mommy!?\" Daring to speak, Mat demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena smirked. \"She has embraced oblivion.\" Simply, she replied. \"You will get over it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears streamed down Mat's face as he screamed in childish anger. I knew that type of scream all too well; the boy was going to charge Elena. If he did, he would only play right into her hands. \"Easy, kid.\" Firmly but kindly, I said. \"I have defeated this scum more than once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will come with me, boy!\" Sharply, Elena demanded. \"Don't make me kill the rest of your family!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMat gasped before clenching his fists. \"Not before I kill you first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could not fight this rogue and protect the kid at the same time, I had to think fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Only instead of throwing them aside, he used the knife like fingers to slice at her arms and chest while Chon used his martial arts skills to knock her to the floor. In an instant, Olivia had regrown her hands but she remained still as John stood over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon placed a firm hand onto John's shoulder. \"We need her alive.\" Calmly, he said. \"If she makes a move, however, she is all yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn growled. \"Make a move... please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon then turned to find Ryan making short work of Elena Kruse despite her powerful magic. Ryan knew all of her tricks and how to combat them as they had fought several times in the past. She saw me running off with Mat and tried to intercept only Chon stepped in her path. He pulled off his blindfold, revealing the glowing sockets of his eyes. \"Going somewhere?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElena scowled, looking into the 'eyes' of Chon. \"You are only delaying the inevitable, boy! Mat will be ours, he has already been given his first mark!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then vanished from sight, leaving Olivia on the floor, staring into the hungry eyes of John. He turned to Chon, hearing Elena's boast. \"The first mark...\" Whispering, he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face turned red before turning to Chon. \"Keep an eye on her!\" Furious, he snapped. \"Ryan, we need to get the infirmary!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI never knew John to panic over anything so this had to be serious. \"What is this first mark?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a curse mark!\" Running behind John, Ryan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped and turned to Chon who slowly nodded. \"The curse mark is what John's captors used to infuse him with magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then again I've killed a few of them, and they all what a piece of me. Only this time it's not me they wanted, it's some little kid. I don't know what the hell's going on this time....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I bet this bitch knows, I bend down and grasp Olivia by the neck. And then I hoist her over my shoulder, it's just like rogue witches to ditch others who are weak in their eyes. It made it easier for me to pick them off back when I used to kill, but I bet she knows something. I'll just need to get her to spill what she knows about all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get me an empty room.\" I say to the other prefects, sure enough I get an empty classroom. I also requested magically enhanced ropes, to make sure Olivia stays in place. This is going to be a long sit-in, or at least I hope. The fact that I, a man wanted dead by all rogue witch kind will interrogate her is sure to anger her. But at the same time she will fear me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't need any truth serum or weapons, Olivia is out of it for now. The shock of what had occurred to her had rendered her out of it, not for long I'll bet. But before I get ready to wake her up I hear a knock at the door, I move to open it. And there's a person who I know will be of good use here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Shomei-san. A pleasure to meet you.\" I say to him. Shomei Akatsuki, the ageless solider. Don't be fooled, he's sure not in his early 20's. In fact he was around back in the 1950's. He's ex Japanese SDF, and a descendant of the sprit inside Ryan's katana. Now's he here as a \"Foreign exchange student.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chon-san, has the prisoner been secured?\" he speaks to me in Japanese. He still has trouble speaking English, he knows a bit though. But better we speak like this, so that if Olivia listens in she might not know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you done interrogations before Shomei-san?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man gives me a small smirk, it's tiny but it's rare considering his stoic nature. \"When I was in the SDF, Yakuza hitmen would quail in horror once I was finished with them.\" he says to me. Perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will play to Olivia's needs, convince her that we'll slit her neck if she doesn't speak. Play to your reputation of terror.\" Shomei advises in Japanese, and then the woman's starting to wake up. Time to get it underway.</span></div></div>",

Standing next to her was a muscular boy of similar height with the same jet black hair but bright hazel eyes. Both were wearing school uniforms similar to what Starmage Academy requires. Looking at them, I was immediately aware that they were twins.

She and I both jumped as an oddly pleasant male voice rang out from near the center of the garden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your defensive posture suggests you see me as a potential threat.\" Calmly, the voice stated. \"However, I come bearing gifts to all who merely have the courage to ask for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a thin line between courage and foolishness.\" Serious, Jenny retorted. \"Show yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that your wish?\" Calmly, the voice demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI now had an idea why the other world visitors stated that this wishing orb was psychotic.

He had long blonde hair that looked greasy and untamed, with bright blue eyes that seemed to look into your very soul. He bent a little as he went through the door to avoid hitting his head and he said \"Good morning Ryan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis name to the public was John Doe, but in secret his name was Light Killer. Several years ago evil witches gathered in secret and abducted an infant from it's crib, that child was him. The witches wanted to conduct a test, to see if they could instil magic power into the veins of a male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight grew up with needles being jabbed into him, tests that pushed his mind and body to their very limits. It left him powerful, his blood could be shed to enable the use of different powers. Yet he was teetering at the edge of sanity and one dark night he broke free from his testing area, killing the guards and escaping into the night. The project was covered up and the facility abandoned, no one knew of where he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the next few years he lived as a vagnabond, preying upon anyone he found. It wasn't out of being evil, it was merely the only thing he knew. But then one day he was in the forest of Starmage and found me, we duelled with my blade clashing against his iron arms. Although he was powerful he was...Lacking in intelligence, quite often he just resorted to brute force with no planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus I was able to defeat him, he layed there. Begging me to finish him, I did no such thing and put my blade away.<br>\r\nWe parleyed afterwards, he acted shocked that this was the first time someone actually engaged him in conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then learned of his past and volunteered to help him, he asked how and I replied that we'd locate his old testing facility and burn it to the ground. And so we did, I could sense how relived he was that his past was now going in flames. He then said to me that from here on out he would stay and act as my bodyguard. While I'm no slouch in battle I had to admit, having a huge guy that can spew his own blood to use his powers his quite handy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so fast forward a few months later, he has taken on the name of John Doe. The excuse is being that he has amnesia, me and my team have vowed never to bring up his real name. And there he stood now, dressed in the starmage summer uniform.

You see Jenny is not like most witches, she is a neko. A half human and half cat witch, their origins go back to the middle ages. Witches who attempted to gain the form of their cat familiars botched the spell, resulting in them and their future offspring becoming half and half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeko's are quite rare, about 1 in 100 witches are one. Thankfully there is no real stigma against them, although they do have one major problem. They can have cat like tendencies, and sometimes they can go into heat just like normal cats. And when they get moody, oh boy can they be moody. On the upside their magic is usually amplified, Jenny was certainly powerful than most witches her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the third time this week, didn't you try to stop her?\" I asked John Doe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, however she kicked me in the nuts. She then threw a plate at me and I decided to retreat here and get you.\" John stated in a matter of fact tone, I then noticed he'd been holding his legs close together. As if to numb the pain to his balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, tell Chon to make sure everyone stays away from Jenny's room. I'm gonna go in and take care of the beast. Wish me luck.\" I muttered as I stepped out into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then made my way to Jenny's door, I could tell she was there. Flinging stuff about and yelling a lot, part of me was filled with dread. I've faced my mortality several times in the past, but this was different. This wasn't a foe I could just run my blade through and say \"Come back in another lifetime.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo this was a foe I wasn't sure I could handle, but I knew I was the only one who could really handle this. So without thinking of all the bad shit that could happen, I rapped on the door twice. Briefly the noise stopped, perhaps Jenny had fallen asleep or something. Maybe I could catch a lucky break?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo shit like this wasn't that simple, not for me at any rate. I could hear the \"Beast\" stomping up to the door and....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But I could still feel it, the Doctor called it \"Phantom Pain.\" where your nerves still think your arm is there and act like it. Chon explains to me I'm getting a cybernetic one to replace it, but considering I've only woken up quite recently they fear my body would reject it due to it. I just want to get out of here and pick up the pieces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI asked Chon what became of our friends. Jenny is still alive, but is in hiding for fear of those who attacked us. Light and Lunar are travelling taking the fight to the enemy, Charlie and the kids are still at Starmage being protected by the staff. Amy is there too, Sho is leading a resistance movement. The rift was opened by a large army of rogue witches and scientists, who simply wished to cause chaos for the sake of it all. And I was the first causality. But they've made one major problem, they didn't finish the job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly I hear a loud rumbling noise, the lights in the hospital flicker on and off. Fuck. Chon bursts into the room, panting quietly. I stick my head up to see him, a cut on his cheek and he's holding a knife stained with blood. \"We need to get you out of here Ryan, they're here. You've been found out, c'mon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walks towards me briskly, taking out a syringe he jabs it into my body and injects me with something. Chon says \"This is gonna get you up on your feet, it was supposed to be given gradually but we've got no time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've not gotten out this bed since I woke up Chon.\" I say, I've remembered stories about your body and its performance decreasing while they were out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, the docs said they kept you in shape via massages and electro stimulation. You'll just need to get the feeling in them.\" Chon flings the covers off, I'm covered in scars and wearing only a pair of white trousers. I shift as best I can to a sitting position, only to fall to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, we gotta hurry Ryan they're killing everyone here.\" Chon props me up as best he can, my feet slide across the tiled floor like a wraith gliding across the land. I try to find solid footing but its not having much luck. Getting me to the door Chon turns around and a solider with a hi tech rifle enters the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no you don't.\" Chon mutters before the man can report out location to the enemy Chon flicks his wrist, the blade is sent flying and lodges right into the neck. He falls to the floor and gurgles twice before breathing his last. I quietly whimper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chon, you just killed that guy......\" I mutter out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe carries me over to him, keeling down to pluck out the knife from the body. Chon states to me \"You are more important Ryan, if we lose you then its all over. You need to be willing to do the same Ryan, times have changed. Witches and scientists aren't leaving it at brainwashing or gender swapping. No, now people fight to kill. I've had to kill Cassie Bane two months ago, she gave me no choice to end her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings must really be serious, Cassie Bane was a rogue witch daughter. Chon killed her Mother and many privately hoped that it would allow Cassie to go down a better path without the toxic influence. Instead with the destruction being caused she took the path of a rogue and Chon killed her for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stagger down, grabbing the rifle. It looks really high tech, but it had a trigger so I assume I can fire it. I've....never killed before.

Once we reach the second floor I lean against a wall, I find my legs are actually getting feeling back into them. I sigh quietly, keeping myself as balanced as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your catching on quick, let's take a pause and figure out where we're gonna go. I got a motorbike parked in the sewers of this place. We just need to find our way into it.\" he mutters. I hear gunfire and screams all around us. Are these people here for me and they're just killing everyone to be sure? Dammit, who would do such a thing? I try not to think on it, we just need to escape.</span></div></div>",

Chon had to kill Cassie Bane and probably other people to protect me while I was out, I can't say I approve of his decisions but I respect the man. He could have simply hid with the rest of the team, but Chon has probably been watching for when I'd wake. Knowing I'm the key to the side of good. I don't want to be though, I've just woke up from a coma and lost part of an arm. Least I have a new one, but still......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIts still so surreal, but I know we need to get out of here before its too late. I feel my legs getting back into, I've got feeling in them again. I move off the wall. Chon noticed and said \"Great, looks like your getting feeling back into you. We need to keep heading down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But won't....the enemy be there? If they're entering the building from down there then.....\" I mutter, hefting the rifle in my hands as we prepare to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon thumbs his nose and says \"I've got a plan, just keep following me. We're going to take alternative routes. While you were out I scoured every inch of this building, I know it as well as if I worked here. I stayed here as a patient in the meantime. C'mon.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe keep hearing screams and gunfire, but Chon seems to be able to move us out the way of ambushes from the enemy. We step into a hallway, the air is thick with blood and charred bodies. They just killed a bunch of doctors and patients without a care in the world.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel ill in the pit of my stomach, but I fight the urge to vomit. I don't have much in me anyway. Me and Chon gingerly step past all the bodies, I feel myself stepping into the blood. But I don't focus on it, instead keeping my hand on Chon's back and looking at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually we come to a door after a trek down more stairs, he opens it slowly. The smell of sewage in my nostrils. Yeah this is the sewers. \"We're here, it doesn't seem like they've checked this location. My bike is stashed close by.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe walk for a bit, the place is actually really large it turns out. Perfect for a bike escape, we find a red Harley Davidson bike in there. Chon says to me \"Your better off driving it, my senses aren't as sharp when I drive. I'll guide you though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting a recently awakened coma patient drive a bike? I'd laugh it our situation wasn't so terrible. But I can't argue, I know about his senses better than anyone.....</span></div></div>",

Driving with Jenny at my back with her arms round my waist. But I store all these thoughts at the back of my mind, now is not the time. I'm half naked, escaping a hospital that is being gunned down by essentially terrorists and I'm in another world. Fuck, my concentration is wavering. I start breathing rapidly. Chon was able to detect this, I feel his palm on the middle of my shoulders. He can use his chi energy to soothe people, used to use that to calm down the V girls when they had bad dreams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't drive as well as you can Ryan, just keep driving straight until I say otherwise.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod and settle into the seat, its coming back to me. Revving up the motorbike we bolt down the lane, ignoring the smell of sewage the best I can. Like I said I've got nothing to throw up with, so the point is moot. I focus on the road, remembering the words of my instructor. Don't let my mind wander again, I'm not at that hospital anymore. They will pay, killing innocent people like that. This is no game anymore, witches and scientists using their powers to kill. Chon adapted a lot easier, he had.....done that before even if it wasn't well intended. But still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe tells me to turn left, a bit straight, then to the right. Its like he practised this route already, he was undercover as a patient of course. Eventually we fly out the sewers and into what looks like a small forest  I turn right and into what looks like a man made forest path, Chon tells me to drive slowly. In case we make too much of a ruckus. I agree on that one. I can hear the roaring of the fire that is now the hospital, cars driving past and all that. But we've slinked out more or less to safety. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually we come to a clearing, Chon tells me to park the bike. We get off and I sit down, the blind man gives me a light kick. \"No time to sit around Carlson, our ride is coming. Hold on.\" he then starts to hack and cough. Producing what looks like some kind of beacon device, he opens the lid and presses a button before dropping it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later I hear the sounds of a helicopter, Chon must have arranged for a pickup here. I slowly stand up, he gives me a hand. The adrenaline has passed now, I'm so tired.....The helicopter doors open, revealing Sho to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carlson-sama! Chon-san! Let's get you out of here!\" he barks, I'm hefted into the helicopter. Where I lay on a nearby set of chairs. Shortly thereafter we take flight. I'm really feeling out of it. Sho senses this and says \"Rest sir. We'll need to catch up on what's happened while you've been out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod, but I feel a tingling sensation in my arm that I used to have. My cybernetic fingers twitch lightly in response. The doctor called that \"Phantom Pain\" where your nerves are still adjusting to the loss......I black out after contemplating this. Though any sleep I get likely won't last......</span></div></div>",

He was clean shaven with longish greying black hair and glowing white eyes that seemed to pierce into anyone he gazed at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, Mr Tanaka to the kingdom of Olympus.\" In a booming voice he calmly said. \"The agreement stands firm; you have four years to track down your friends and be gone.

That was two months ago, Nero Earth time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning my mind to the present, I reached down and helped Sho pull Ryan and Jenny onboard with Chon following on his own. \"We do not have much time.\" Serious, I said. \"You were all pulled into a pocket universe onto a parallel world where witches and mad scientists fell into an all out war on a global scale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much time do we have before we are trapped?\" Wincing, Jenny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Less than a year.\" Serious, Sho replied. \"We still need to find Light, Amy, and Luna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't there a way to end this war?\" Worried, Ryan asked. \"We've been trapped here for ten years, haven't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's only been about ten hours in our reality.\" Serious, I countered. \"Hence why none of you are not ten years older.\" He then turned to to the pilot. \"We are ready, Professor, Ry Carlton!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe side door slid closed on its own and we could all feel the helicopter swiftly flying upward and away from the field. \"Where are we going?\" Curious, Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To New Starmage.\" Serious, Professor Ry replied. \"There we can safely plan our next move.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, Ryan moved to the front of the helicopter and was stunned to see an older version of himself who merely nodded upon catching his eye but did not say a word.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But he continues, perhaps this meeting was what he needed......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy's version is wheelchair bound for the rest of her life, mad scientist removed her spine. If it wasn't for her magic she'd be dead. Light's is in some god forsaken cave, the buildup of all this meant he could kill us all if he's not careful. Sho's is MIA as far as we can tell. Lunar became one with New Starmage's mainframe in order to protect it from mad science attacks.

He looks at me in shock, a tear coming down from his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to be sorry, the fact you still fight is all that I need to say I believe in you. I'm grateful for the help.\" I say, god I never thought I'd be talking to myself.

I held back a few tears of my own, making note to tell my Jen how much she means to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was the other Earth Tanaka who discovered I was trapped in the mirror realm.\" Softly, Jen said. \"We owe it to him to help find the rest of his team so they can return home before they are trapped here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRy nodded. \"I am never letting you out of my sight again.\" Serious, he said. he then turned to me. \"We will do all we can to help find your missing team members.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the meantime, we will bring an end to this war.\" Serious, Light said. \"Neo Light and I have devised a plan of action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you two come up with?\" Curious, Jen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight held up a large vial of a clear liquid. \"Simple, we make everyone in this part of the world permanently immune to magic and mad science.\" Smiling, he explained. \"This alone will bring about the fear of it happening globally and the war will end.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The more magic is used against the one, the more resistant he or she becomes to its effects.\" Thoughtful, Ry mused. \"It's only logical that one would eventually become immune...\" he smiled. \"I am impressed, Light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We just need to get it into the water supply of this region.\" Serious, Tanaka said. \"Only it is heavily guarded, we will need a small raiding party to make it happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While that is being done, we will contact prince Devlin Moray.\" Smiling, Neo Light said. \"He is heir to the throne to the new mad science collective and a supporter of the end of the war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded but said nothing as the Devlin moray I knew was a grandfather and the most powerful mad scientist of his realm. I turned to Tanaka as he began to give orders. \"Ry, Ryan, Neo Jen and i will be team one who will hit the water distribution center.\" Serious, he said. \"Light and Neo Light, Neo Amy, and Neo Sho will be team two who will meet with Prince Devlin Moray. Charlie and the V twins will be team three who will use their powers to help search for all of our missing team members.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, I nodded as Ry and I said in unison. \"Let's get to work..\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryan's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door was opened, and then I heard several voices. One was Jenny's, but it sounded like....she was being attacked.<br>\r\nMy gut reaction kicked in, I swiftly kicked the door down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was an utter mess, but something else was catching my eye. Jenny was being grabbed, by three people in black hoods and wearing plain white masks with two slots for eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arag! RYAN!!! HELP!!!\" Jenny yelled at me, she was being grabbed from behind round the neck by one. She was kicking at the one facing her front. Then I quickly realised the third one was rushing towards me, before the figure could do anything I quickly delivered a head butt. The person was knocked down, my head stinging from the contact against the mask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I couldn't slow down, gritting my teeth I swiftly brought my leg into the figure in front of Jenny. The sounds was bringing people in, my fellow dorm mates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan! Shit!\" the familiar voice of Chon was heard behind me, thank God for that. He was most likely weighing in on the person I just headbutted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough! We have the girl, we must leave!\" the one grabbing Jenny yelled, the tone was female yet dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn that instant time slowed down, and I was looking straight at Jenny. I couldn't hear a thing, but the rest of my team were bursting into the room. Jenny's face was one I dreaded, one of sadness and despair. The figures who were accosting my dear kitten began to vanish, pink sparkles flowing up them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"no....\" I muttered out, I found myself moving forward. Lunging at the figure and Jenny but as I moved forth they were vanishing by very eyes. Jenny only had a look of shock on her face, but before her body vanished completely there was a look of panic and scare. No doubt dreading what would come as I had failed to save her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy body landed on the floor with a thud, but then I quickly stood back up. Standing right about where Jenny and her grabber were. I turned to see the rest of my team standing there, there was an awkward silence. I then shouted \"Quick! Lunar fly around the grounds! We might find them, Amy get the Dean! Everyone else split up and look!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dashed out the room, out the dorm. Panic setting into me, I could see a few students from another dorm look at me. Half thinking I was crazy and the other was concerned. But I didn't care, I ran forward into the forests. I could hear Lunar taking flight behind me, Chon barking orders for his daughters to come with him and help look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe scoured everywhere, turned all our surroundings upside down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny was gone......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next was a blur, I recall being next to a tree. Most likely at the entrance to the forest, my lungs needed air badly. I'd must have been sprinting all over the place, sweat going down my forehead in a deluge. It was then being mixed with tears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HUAGGHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!\" I screamed out, pounding my balled fists into the tree. Tearing out the bark as my knuckles began to bleed, eventually the pain caught up with me. I bit my lower lip, turned to the tree and slid down into a sitting position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy? Why did this happen? I lost her a year ago, that day I lost a part of myself. Now I had it back, and then ripped out of me before my very eyes. My bloody right hand moves into my dark blonde hair, my fingers running through the strands. The left one then did the same as I clenched my head in anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to find the bastards that did this.....AND I WILL KILL THEM!!!!!!!\" with that in mind I stood back up and made my way back to the academy. I must have looked like a crazy motherfucker, but losing one that you love in such a way in front of you would do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now I had a mission, and the fucking essay that was due this week is going to have to wait. It was a far, far distant second place to finding the woman I loved....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryan's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI moved back to my dorm, a crowd had started gathering and the people in the back were noticing me. They gasped loudly, well the ones who saw me at any rate. I didn't care about the peanut gallery, and so with that in mind....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move it. Fuck off, out the way....\" I muttered as I shoved past the crowd, I might have done it harshly but I wasn't in much of a caring mood. After getting up to the door of my dorm I turned to look at them all, I chose to say not a word and rushed back into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon was there as well, leaning on the wall. He must have sensed my injuries, the bleeding knuckles.<br>\r\n\"Ryan. Wait.\" he said standing in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went to move to the side but Chon did the same and blocked me off, I grinded my teeth and muttered \"Chon, move now....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blind man shook his head \"Not until you get that bandaged up, I know what your thinking. You want to search through Jenny's room for clues, we're going to do that. But I don't think she'd want her bed bloodied up by your hands if you take my meaning.....\" he said gesturing to my injured digits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down at them, a couple of drops of the red copper fluid that was in my body trickled down my hand. I sighed and said \"Fine, get the bandages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon nodded and produced a roll from his pocket, he kept them on hand during his daughters training. Handy to have, even more so in my case. I stood still and held out my open hands, without a word my friend wrapped two layers of bandage around my hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI clenched them, they felt secure. \"Now let's check the room, but there's something I should tell you. The chick you first attacked, what you did took a bit of her mask off. She had black hair, not much to go on but you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, we knew we were dealing with women. Most likely rouge witches, the thoughts ran into my mind. What if they tried to study Jenny, and do horrible things to her? I blocked that out the best I could, me and Chon walked into the room. It looked bad, like a fight had broken out here of course. The window was open and fluttering in the wind, but the escape was done by teleportation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then something got my eye, in the corner near the foot of Jenny's bed. It was a sheet of paper, I made my way across the room and picked it up. It was written in neat pink handwriting.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"Dear reader of this letter, if you are reading this then guess what? We kidnapped the princess! Hah hah!\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hands were about to tear the paper up in anger, but there was more to read.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"So here's the thing, now that we have the princess. We are going to do what we want with her, and that thing is.....Give her to someone who will be the best person for her, we don't think you are the right one. No offense, and also your not invited to the wedding. Too bad, so sad. But we like playing games, and we want to play with you.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down the page....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cpink\">\"You have one week, one week to find out where the wedding is. If you can find us and stop us, and free the princess. Then you win, and she is yours. If you don't, she forgets all about you and marries the proper love for her. Ask yourself, What's a prince who doesn't even know he's a prince? Think on that one, Prince Carlson. xxx.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy blood boiled, these fuckers were playing a game? A GAME?!!!! Oh we'll play a game, it's called \"I'm going to find out where you've taken my girlfriend, get her away from you. And then have my friend Light eat you alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still it was something, a clue and a chance. But what the hell were they talking about at the end? Prince Carlson? Was it just referring to me as the lover of Jenny? And what about marriage? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI scanned the archives of my memories, searching for something that might help. Then it hit me. I had an old penpal back in the US, his name was John Harrison. His family were all witches apart from him and a cousin of his, I forget the name. He might be able to tell me something useful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone else report back yet?\" I asked Chon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My girls looked with me, Charlie's crying into their arms last time I saw the poor kid. Don't know where Light and Lunar are, Amy's still with the Dean.\" Chon said as we walked into the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go and find Light and Lunar, show this paper to Lunar. She can maybe use her robot stuff, check handwriting or something.\" I muttered, without a word my friend took the paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to make a phone call.....\" I said as I moved to the phone in the hallway.</span></div></div>",

It came up and I dialled it into the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pressed the communication device close to my ear, the ringing in my ear like that of a death chime. Eventually the ringing stops and I hear a male voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello who is this?\" he asks, I can hear female voices talking in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John? This is Ryan.\" I state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Ryan, what's up?\" he replies in an upbeat voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI briefly stop, how he's acting is in such utter contrast to my current situation. It almost made me briefly forget about it, almost....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then take a deep breath in my lungs and say \"Jenny's been kidnapped.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn then quickly says \"Okay Ryan, slow down and tell me what happened. Wait one sec, Mom I'm going to need to talk with you soon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waited till he was ready, and then told him what had happened. Including the details where I tore up my knuckles punching a tree, just felt like I should keep details like that in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I was done John said \"Right then, give me a sec to think.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ensuing silence was near unbearable, thoughts were swirling about in my head. Things like why Jenny? What was John going to say? That last question was quickly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever heard of the wedding test Ryan?\" John asked in a somewhat quiet tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" I replied bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn sighed, as if what he was telling me was hard. But he did talk with \"Think an arranged marriage, but with magic forcing the people into it. The usual one is a guy turned girl is forced to get hitched to someone, usually someone they know. The victim must either resist the magic controlling them and escape, or at the very least not say \"I do.\" trust me I've been on the short end of this test more than once. Isn't that right Mel?\" no doubt shouting that down to his sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then bit my upper lip, harder till it drew blood. My tongue went onto it, lapping at the copper smelling liquid.<br>\r\n\"......Do you know anything about this John? I heard your council does tests on each other, tell me now.....\" I half muttered and half growled into the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn could sense my anger, my wrath was coming to the people involved. He then sighed and said \"I overheard the witch council talk about a wedding test, two or three days ago. They were talking about a bride to a prince, I don't know anything else Ryan. That's the truth, take that as you will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of waiting I believed him, but I was still fuming. I had no time to waste, a week was not much time. I needed a lead and fast, if I was to have any chance to save her. But there was one thing lingering on my mind....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bit my lower lip, digesting this information. I spoke up with \"Hang on, Jenny is already a girl. So there's no gender changing. But what will happen if I fail, and Jenny is forced to go through with the wedding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI dreaded the response, and John's heavy sigh told me it wasn't good.<br>\r\n\"She would be stuck with a person she'd be bound to. Those who fail normally end up married to a person they must learn to love, even if they are horrible partners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt a wave of nausea wash over me, like I'd just been dunked in a thick sheet of snow with no clothes on. The words ringed in my ear, my right eye twitched. My teeth were grinding against each other, and then before I knew it I had crushed the phone in my hands. I let the trashed metal go and stormed into my room, and there perched against the wall was my katana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grabbed it, the sprit inside the blade spoke to me \"My Lord, you seem distressed. What is the matter?\" his voice ringing into my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My love has been taken from me Azura, and if I don't find her then she will be lost forever to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear! My Lord, upon my honour as a samurai I swear to you. I shall do my upmost to aid you in this quest, and if I should fail then cast me into the abyss and leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but we need to come up with a plan. I'm getting everyone together.\" with that I went back out to find the rest of my team. It was time for action.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnd Ryan's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn moved his head away from the phone, the sound of static was the output. He then frowned and turned the phone off.<br>\r\n\"Who was that?\" Ms Harrison asked her son.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn sighed and said \"Ryan Carlson, my old penpal. His girlfriend has been kidnapped, for a wedding test it looks like. He's not taken it very well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Harrison sighed, knowing the damage that sort of test could do to people. \"You know I had no other option for you John, I just hope that boy doesn't do anything rash.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn scoffed upon hearing that \"Ryan's out for blood it seems, I just hope no one gets killed. Magic can't do that, but a katana can. I was about to tell him about that other bonding ceremony, the one you used for me and Megan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Harrison nodded \"The boyfriend and girlfriend one, John I know what your thinking. You have my permission if you wish to help Ryan, I think he'd need it to avoid any bad fates if you know what I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn gave a small nod, stood up and got his shoes on. It was going to be rough, and could all end in tears. But John spent the better part of his life so far helping others with their problems, and this would be no different.</span></div></div>",

We needed to act fast if we were to have any hope of saving Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy what has the dean said?\" I asked, I was standing up at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said that we should remain here and focus on our studies, but what he really meant was try not to be reckless.\" Amy said with a nod of the head. Our Dean Mr Tanaka was a wise man, he knew what I would do. And he trusted me to do it, but having a huge pile of unfinished work would be the least of my worries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's gather what we've got, John mentioned the witch council had been planning an wedding test for a princess. I'd say our best bet is to find the local branch of the council, sneak in and locate the records. Lunar any idea where that is?\" I said turning to our pink haired android.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded and put her hands on the sides of her head and closed her eyes, a few seconds later she said \"There are two local branches actually, one is located in Edinburgh and the other in London. As the United Kingdom is made of both Scotland and England.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell no shit, however Lunar went on with \"My belief is that either will do, they share the same country so no doubt they will share information.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that's what I wanted to hear, now the next part was to get in there. \"We need a plan, it's going to be highly guarded and I bet they might even try to destroy the records if they so much as think we're there.\" Chon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunar then took out a bunch of building plans and photos. \"I procured these upon locating the building in Edinburgh, I recommend an insertion via rooftop. Ryan I suggest that I drop you off there, I will then monitor the building from the air. Meanwhile Chon can infiltrate on the second floor, there is a window that will allow you to easily slip in under a camera's blindspot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could agree with that, me and Chon could take up the building half and half, I then asked \"What about Light and Amy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And us.\" Viva piped up, with Charlie and Vogue nodding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunar snapped her fingers and said \"Viva and Vogue can infiltrate alongside Chon, from the opposite end of the building. Once that floor has been cleared and Ryan has scouted the 4th floor we can check the 3rd one, I do apologize but I have been unable to locate the exact place where witch test records are located.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what am I doing?\" Light asked, leaning back with his arms folded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Light you will be on the first floor with Amy and Charlie, you three will act as a family. You can divert attention if things are getting bad up on the higher floors.\" Lunar said, I smirked as I saw Amy roll her eyes up in annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay people, get something to eat. We leave soon, and one other thing. No killing in this mission, we can get away with knocking some guards out. But if we kill one then the whole place will be turned upside down, and that makes things more complicated.\" I said, walking into my room after it. I needed to meditate with Asura, have a clear mind for this task.</span></div></div>",

My hands were flicking my katana up and down in it's scabbard, Chon folded his arms. Lunar was driving etc etc....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough I knew we were in Edinburgh, the place where I was born. The city holds many memories for me, of normal times. Times when I thought the situation I was in would be like something in a spy flick, but now I was the real deal. And I had to save the woman I loved, and this was the start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside it was the dead of winter, the cold air stinging my cheeks. I looked at my crew mates, I smirked as the V girls were clearly not used to the Scottish weather yet. Charlie wasn't either, but that didn't deter the look of focus he had. The kid wanted to help us, and he would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe looked upon the witch headquarters, based in Edinburgh's Castle. Wonderful, not only would we have to deal with whatever the witches have planned in their base we may have to worry about bystanders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the thought didn't deter me, and it didn't deter my friends either. We all had our plans. In each ear was a communication ear piece, mentally linked to each other. You see I had some....friends who knew high tech stuff, and a while back I did a secret mission to prevent world disaster. So I kinda kept the gear without telling them I still had it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was wearing a tan longcoat, with Chon donning a black one. It concealed our outfits, the V girls were wearing black leather coats and tracksuit bottoms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay guys you all know the plan, move out.\" I muttered to everyone, we all nodded and then went to our designated positions. I slinked into an alleyway, thankfully it was deserted. I had only one thing on my mind, and that was finding a clue as to where Jenny was.

My katana was strapped to my back, the scabbard blending in with my attire. <br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://data3.whicdn.com/images/1814755/original.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://data3.whicdn.com/images/1814755/o...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I reach the roof I allow the helmet to close on my head, the suit was a nifty little thing I used to stop a space station from firing at Earth. It allowed me to breath in dangerous environments, kept track of my vitals. And allowed me to communicate with my crew, the greatest suit of armour for a modern day ninja like myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rooftop was empty, except for two witches. Dressed in black dresses, they didn't see me. I was coming up from the cold alleyway after all, they were admiring the view and having a smoke. This was my perfect chance to strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI might as well have been a ghost, they didn't suspect a thing. And then I was right behind them, one took a final puff from her cig. And then....BAM! I smashed both of their heads together in a meeting of the minds, the result was them falling down like potato sacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing this I put my hand to my ear and said \"Asura reporting, does everyone copy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Revenge reporting in.\" I heard Chon's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mini ninjas reporting in.\" Viva and Vouge chimed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eyes in the sky reporting in.\" Lunar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic family reporting in.\" Amy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then took a deep breath and said \"Okay people this is our chance, I'm not going to bother with any motivational speeches. The more time we waist the less chance we have of saving Jenny, you all know what's at stake here. Let's get this done and be onto finding Jenny, good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the mission had begun, I looked about on the roof. There were two routes I could take, either the stairs at which the witches came from. Or use the ceiling window, the stairs could be an easier option but more closely guarded. Whereas with the window I could have the chance of surprise.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryan's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decided that taking the stairs probably wasn't a good idea, and besides there could be security measures that we don't know about. With that in mind I made certain to drag the knocked out bodies in a corner that was obscured, granted it wasn't the best but at least they wouldn't be seen right off the bat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter moving them, I looked at the large ceiling window. Taking a chance I peaked in through it, all I could see was a large wooden floor. With several books on display, I also caught a glimpse of a witch security guard. Dressed in the same black dress as the two on the roof, obviously it wasn't a place to be seen in. But my intention was to get in there, and I needed to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asura to Eyes in sky, are there any cams on the 4th floor?\" I asked using my ear piece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None in the room your looking at Asura, it's chalked up to faulty wiring. There's cameras in all the other rooms on the floor, but none in your room. I recommend a swift and silent entry, Eyes out.\" Lunar's calm and monotone voice went off my ear after hearing that, seeing that the guard had just left I figured now was my chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slid my katana blade near the window, and slotted it in. I then gently began moving the sword up and down, until I managed to force it to open ever so slightly. I then opened it fully with my hands, and sure enough there was no alarm. Thank God for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then gripped the window's frame and stuck my legs in, I then hung my body so that I was dangling inside the room. Dropping down I landed so that my weight was spread out, and the drop was light. I allowed only a minor thumping noise to give away my position. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is Asura, I'm in the building. Revenge what's your status?\" I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the building, mini ninjas 1 and 2 are en route to my location. How's the floor looking Asura, we got any records yet?\" Chon asked me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just got in, will look now. Asura out.\" I responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around I decided my best bet was to try and find a lead, a hint as to where the possible records may be kept.<br>\r\n\"That guard might know something, better shake someone down.\" I thought to myself. These books looked more like relics and artefacts to be looked upon by tourists, but they might be useful. At the same time though they could be trapped and I could end up compromising the mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then decided to.....</span></div></div>",

So she might know something, only catch was now I had to catch her. It was risky following her out this room, needed to lure her in somehow without being detected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had an idea, I pounded my sword's scabbard on the ground. Like a book dropping or something, and I did that a couple of times. I then heard footsteps approaching from right in front of me, using my speed I silently moved so that the door would open with the wood covering me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch guard went forward, and in a second I had kicked the door behind me and grabbed her neck with my arms. My katana's blade at her neck, her face appearing in the gleaming reflection of the steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me what I want to know, or I stuff your body in the girl's bathroom.\" I grimly muttered, moving the blade closer to her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...do you want to know?\" she said, I could smell the fear in her. I didn't blame her, I took her by surprise in the blink of an eye. Pressing an blade close to the neck, I was like the silent reaper. Here to collect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You witches do tests on people, I want to know where you keep these records. If I don't like your answer then you lose a pint of blood, clear?\" I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You....need to be specific, what sort of tests? Is this one?\" she responded back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI got an idea, I nodded and said \"Damm, you catch on quick. Boss she's found out, what do I do? Really? Ok I'll tell her.\" this was a bluff. But she had no way of knowing that with my ninja mask on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've passed Ms, this was a test to see if you can handle pressure and remain calm against an intruder. Well done. I'll go and store the report myself. Where do I put the security test reports?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh it's on the third floor, in the east wing. They're below the royalty records and wedding tests, can you let go now?\" she asked, her tone hopeful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grinned under my mask and said \"Of course.\" quickly brining up my katana to bash her over the head. She slumped down like a bunch of potatoes, fucking na\u00efve. But her loss was my gain, for I had the knowledge I was seeking. And sooner than I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Revenge this is Asura, I've got the location of the records over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Copy Asura, Revenge has met with the mini ninjas. Where's it at over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Third floor, east wing. Will meet there, over and out.\" I cut off the communications, I had a body to hide. Those girls on the roof still wouldn't be up, I hit them pretty hard. So they could use some extra company, but I knew we'd be on a time limit. That guard wouldn't be on the cameras anymore, so they might come checking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after sticking her near the glass window I figured I was safe for now, and with that it was time for me to meet with Chon.</span></div></div>",

But still there was the off chance that Lunar's info could be out of date, I thought about using the vent. But I decided it'd be too much hassle and noise, no better to sneak around the cameras to meet with Chon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open the nearest door, recalling that it was the quickest way to the stairs. But I do not peak my head out, instead using the reflection of my katana at the foot of the door. Less likely to be noticed that way, I can see no cameras. I then slowly push the door forward, trying my best to block out the noise of my rising heartbeat. It turns out the camera is above me, I shake my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing how easy it is I slide into the room, closing the door behind me while remaining in the camera's blindspot. I then time my movements, staying close and under it's field of view thanks to the various items on display. As I'm hiding under a small bookcase my earpiece pops up with \"Magic family to Azura, come in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stop moving, remaining in my hiding place as I mutter \"What is it over?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're closing down for the night, we're outside the building in an alleyway.\" Amy muttered to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere goes our distraction, but we'll be alright. Just need to find the records and we'll be out of here.<br>\r\n\"Roger magic family, go back to the meeting spot. Over and out.\" I muttered, cutting off contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that it meant that security might get ramped up, the more time we wasted the more chance of being caught. My thoughts turned to Jenny, was she okay? I hated not knowing my love was okay, hated the fact that I might lose her.<br>\r\nBut sometimes you find things in life, things that are worth fighting for. Jenny Forth was to me, one of those things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made my way to the stairwell, it was bathed in darkness besides a window. Said window was brining in yellow light from the lamppost nearby, I heard footsteps. Someone was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hug the wall and crouch down, making my way quietly under the window. The witch guard was walking up the floor, past me without even knowing I was there. I was a true ninja, she was right there and yet had no idea. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time I moved to the third floor, whereupon entering I heard a \"Pisst.\" noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up it was Chon, with his daughters hiding in the rafters above. I spotted a large wooden beam, that would enable me to join them up there. And so I did, the room was large. With a main floor and a pair of mini stairs that led up to where I was, the guards hadn't come over here yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd without a hitch I joined them there, whereupon we could examine the entire area.<br>\r\n\"You spotted the vault?\" I muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nViva nodded and pointed at a golden door, complete with bars and chains.<br>\r\n\"Any ideas?\" Vouge muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a vent that's above the door, not too far from our location. BB you and Ryan can enter through it. We'll watch the situation from here.\" Viva said. I was kinda taken aback by what the girl was saying. More in the tone, how it was to the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon saw the logic however and nodded, patting me on the shoulder. With that we crawled around on the rafter beams, till we were above the vent. Gently landing on the carpet below. This was it, Jenny's location could be in this room. I hoped to God it was.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryan's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room looked ancient, like a dusty old place of records should in my mind. The soft carpet below padded me and Chon's footsteps, we went low and checked the area out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two guards, let's sneak past. I'll reckon that some of these records are written in braille. Some witches are going to be blind of course.\" Chon muttered as he sensed the chi energy of two guards patrolling this area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere wasn't any cameras though, strange. My guess.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful, there might be hidden magic here. You stay and keep an eye on things, I'll go alone and look for the records.\"<br>\r\nI muttered as I began sneaking forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon nodded, he then put his hands to his blindfold. And began muttering in Mandarin, no doubt focusing on detecting as many things as he could. With that I began to move, slinking between bookcases, tables, and other things. Those guards didn't stand a chance at spotting me, I was like a sliver of glass. My footsteps light as a feather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the various signs for guidance, stopping at one that read \"Witch tests\"<br>\r\nThis had to be what I was looking for, my hunch was that Jenny had been kidnapped by this council. And what John said to me earlier fit the contents of the letter left when Jenny was kidnapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asura to crew, located the goods. Will move in for closer look. Over and out.\" I mutter into my earpiece, cutting off before anyone can answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that I take a look around, checking for any hidden things to attack me. There are none and I'm good to go, I gently and gingerly creep into the large room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are rows upon rows of scrolls, under them are letters of the alphabet. My eyes scan them, I decide to look for J first. And then F if they are going by second names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see....John, not Harrison.....Got it! Jenny Forth.\" I mutter to myself, I suspect the knotted rope is enchanted by magic. But I think the suit I'm wearing is nullifying it, I don't care so long as I'm not caught and find out what's happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI unfold the scroll, reading the contents from left to right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubject name: Jenny Forth<br>\r\nAge: 16<br>\r\nNationality: British<br>\r\nTest: Wedding test<br>\r\nRole in test: Subject has been kidnapped from her school known as Starmage Academy, target is to be placed into an arranged marriage with \"The Groom\" in one week's time following this writing. Ryan Carlson must locate the subject within that time and prevent her from saying \"I do.\" to the groom. If he cannot then the subject will be forced into marriage with the groom and her memories of Ryan Carlson erased and replaced with the groom in his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy face went pale, my blood turned cold. This was my biggest fear, that I would become just a stranger to her. No, I wouldn't allow it. I loved Jenny Forth with all my heart, no matter what. I read on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWedding will take place in New York City, at one chapel within the city. <br>\r\nOther notes: This is a high security test, maximum priority. Lethal force authorised to remove test interference from Ryan Carlson, his friends and any other threats are to be dealt with swiftly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were going to try and kill me if I tried to stop them? Fine, I knew people were going to leave in body bags anyway. Sure as shit won't be me, they have taken one of the most precious things away from me. And I will travel through hell, and fall through a dark abyss just to find her once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look further into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso if Ryan Carlson should succeed in this test, then he shall be placed in the position of \"British ruler.\" within our society. He is most likely unaware of his lineage, no doubt his Mother hasn't told him of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that I fold it up and stick in my coat, thoughts swirling about in my mind. I couldn't make sense of it, but I had what I came for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Asura here, let's pull out and meet at extraction.\" I mutter in my earpiece. As I walk past I accidently brush up against a scroll that falls down, I turn to pick it up when I see the name on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chon Kay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frown, is Chon being tested as well? I don't entertain the thought as I want to head out of here, I fold up his scroll and silently leave the room.</span></div></div>",

We had lost one of our own, I had a lost a part of myself. No one liked that when it happened to them, I had it happen once and I'll be dammed if I let it happen a second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as we all arrived in our dorm we all went to our beds without a word, I didn't even bother getting my outfit off. I just chucked the covers over myself and shut my eyes, even then I couldn't really sleep. Not with everything that had happened today, we had six days left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy room was pitch black, and I couldn't tell if my eyes were shut or not. I just let the darkness swallow me as I tried to rest, but I doubted I would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually though I must have fallen asleep, for I could hear the sounds of birds chirping outside. And the moving chairs outside my door, it must be time for breakfast. I remove my armour, stick on a pair of blue jeans and enter the kitchen. And in an instant everyone stops what they are doing and look right at me, with concern on their faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey know that out of all of us I'm the one most affected by Jenny's kidnapping, I love her. Still do after all this time, and yet fate conspires to stop us. Well I'm not going to let that happen so long as I still breathe, I'm not showing how I'm hurt though. The last thing my friends need is to see their leader distraught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight offers me a piece of toast, I take it and wolf it down. And then wipe my mouth and say \"Okay people, we did great last night. And we know where we are going, it's New York. As soon as we're done here I want you all to pack your bags, preferably for a week. Chon I need to have a word with you alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that the blind man frowns under his blindfold, but walks into my room with me. He sits on the bed while I stand up.<br>\r\n\"What's this about?\" he says to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a deep breath and say to him \"Do you recall when I snuck into the testing documents room?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods, and I open up the scroll in front of him. \"I found one scroll with your name on it. I'll read it aloud to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon's eyebrows lift up above his blindfold, but he remains quiet and nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look through the contents, and what I see makes me gasp.<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" he asks me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI read it through once again, there's no denying this. If the witch council wrote it then it must be true.<br>\r\n\"Chon....It says here you have a younger Sister....\" I mutter to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this the blind man lifts his head and opens his mouth in shock. \"W-What?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says she's studying at witchbloom academy in the US, she's two years younger than you. Qi Kay, that's what her name is.\" I respond back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon shakes his head in denial \"I-Impossible! I only had my Brother, my parents walked out on me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says here that neither you or her were meant to find out the other existed. It says that you were not to be trusted considering that you have killed rouge witches in the past and hold an immense anger for magic in general.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon took a deep breath \"Well they're right about the fact that I have killed in the past, what should I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want to know what I think? Go for it man, find her.\" I say to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blind man is about to open his mouth to speak but I cut him off with \"Don't feed me any of that \"I'm a monster and she wouldn't want to know me.\" crap. You have changed, you don't kill anymore. You've adopted witch girls under your care, you are a good person Chon. Prove that and they will show her to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon is silent, leaning his body towards me as he puts a hand on his chin. He then nods and says \"Your right, I need to do this. But we can find her later, right now our priority is saving Jenny. Once she's safe with you we'll find her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI respond with a nod and we leave the room, Chon then mutters to me \"Thank you Ryan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile and say \"No worries dude.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone begins packing bags, I've done mine. But there's something on my mind, what did that document mean by British ruler? My Mother hasn't told me everything, I assume it was to protect me. But the truth is going to be coming out, and before I leave I need answers from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen guys I need to go back to Edinburgh, I need to speak to my Mom about something. It's very important.\" I say while getting everyone's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Ryan?\" Light asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh, I still don't know enough pieces of the puzzle yet. But I say \"I'm not sure yet, but I need to ask her a question and get something cleared up. Once I do I'll tell you guys, it's just I want to make sure before we make any rash assumptions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone shows their trust in me, we're a united front. Someone has taken my girlfriend, and I won't rest until I save her. Even if I die trying.....</span></div></div>",

I've got things to deal with anyway, I'm heading to the school's teleportation room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI go up to the man at the desk and say \"I'd like to request transport from here to Edinburgh please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist looks at me with his owl like eyes through large glasses \"State your purpose for doing it please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Mother has been keeping a secret from me, and I need to confront her about this in person.\" I state cleanly and upfront.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat I said appeared to resonate with the man, for he nodded slightly and said \"Very well, your address?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI write it down for him on a piece of paper, he takes and nods saying \"I shall teleport you to the front door, don't worry about other people seeing you. As far as they'll know you just walked up to it, is this a one way trip or back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like to come back after it please.\" I state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response the receptionist hands me a wristband with the school's logo of a shield, and a sword and wand crossing over it. \"Press the symbol to arrive back here, take your time though.\" he says to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI give my thanks to him and near one of the teleporters, it had a sliver floor and upon entering it I was covered by a glass capsule. \"Location?\" it says to me. I state Edinburgh and the address of where my Mother lived. Shortly after my vision gets covered by a bright flash of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time it clears I'm standing in a flat, with the door of my Mother's apartment in front of me. I take a moment to compose myself, looking out the nearby window to see the hustle and bustle of traffic down below. After doing that I take a deep breath and raise my right hand to the door, giving a few gentle raps on the wood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is it?\" I hear a female voice inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's me Ryan.\" I respond. There's a pause, and then I hear footsteps coming to the door. They stop and then the door is opened. My Mother is standing there. She looks about the same as the last time I saw her, she's pushing her 40's now. With a slim body and blonde hair in a ponytail, clear blue eyes and thin eyebrows on her face go wide as she sees me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan! Please come in!\" she says, giving me a hug. I sigh happily and hug her back. It's been quite a while since I last saw my Mother, I've been too busy with schoolwork and the like. Not to mention that Starmage is basically on the other side of Scotland.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" I say to her as I take a seat in the living room, it's all familiar. Even the dark blue couch I'd spend everyday watching TV with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get you anything?\" she asks me, I respond by saying I'd like a glass of water. She gets me one from the nearby kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter accepting it and taking a sip she sits next to me and says \"So is there anything wrong? How's Jenny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that I wince, and bite my lower lip. My Mother picks this up right away and says \"Dearie did something happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a sigh and set my glass of water down on the floor, this is going to require a lot of talking. But I waste no time in bringing her up to speed, I tell her everything that's happened to me yesterday. From Jenny being kidnapped to the letter that was left. Then the fact she seems to be forced into an arranged wedding to me breaking and entering the witch council's building for records.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter saying this my Mom's in shock, putting a hand to her mouth. I'm trying my best not to start freaking out, although I'm most likely failing at that. But I managed to say \"Mom I have to ask, what the hell does Prince Carlson mean? And British ruler?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Mom sighs heavily, trying not to make eye contact with me. She then stands up and walks over to the window, sighing after it. Then she turns to me as I say \"Mom please answer me. This is important to Jenny's wellbeing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then says to me \"Do you remember the things I told you? About the great war that raged between scientists, witches and evils that man shudders to think of?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod, how could I not? Hell Starmage was built as a sign of peace following that. \"Yeah, let me guess this has something to do with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy Mother sadly nods and replies with \"I was to become the next in line for Britain's royal leader in the supernatural world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stay silent, I can tell she has more to say. She goes on with \"But in that final battle, I lost your Father. He died holding off enemy forces by himself, I was pregnant with you. I knew that it would be chaos, and I didn't want you to have that my son. I fled as a single Mother, I wanted to raise you to be safe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe's close to tears at this point, I bite my lower lip and get off the couch. I embrace her in my arms and she quietly weeps. I wait for about a minute and I then say \"You did what you thought was best. I don't fault you for it Mom. But it's time for me to embrace my destiny, I think someone wants me to take up my position.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" My Mother mutters to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The letter said I was a prince right? Then this test must be linked to Jenny, that or kidnapping her was just bait. Either way I'm going to get to the bottom of this rest assured Mom.\" I say to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe calms down a bit, and then looks at me with a smile. \"I'm so proud of you Ryan, you go and you save her. You hear me? You fight them and show them the power of your royal blood.\" she says to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take those words to heart, and I hug her once again. \"My team's getting ready to go to New York, I need to get back to Starmage and join them.\" I mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand son, take care. Remember that no matter what happens I love you no matter what.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that we say our goodbyes, I feel a lot better mentally now. A weight off my shoulders, and I'm even more focused to save Jenny now. With that I teleport back to school after leaving my Mother's apartment.</span></div></div>",

I was told that my seat was inadvertently given to someone else so they gave me first class to make up for the mistake. It was not that I minded; there was certainly more leg room. I simply found it odd that I was the only one in first class... or so I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, grandson.\" Startling me, a raspy voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy head darted up to face a tall elderly woman in an elegant black dress sitting across from me. She had long auburn hair, emerald green eyes, and a strong physique for someone in their seventies. \"Grandma?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman nodded. \"Your mother phoned me, stating that you had discovered part of the truth.\" Softly, she said. \"I was hoping it would not be revealed in such a unscrupulous way.\" She sighed. \"I am here to tell you the rest of the story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm listening...\" Frowning, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman drew in a breath. \"First, I am the head witch of Europe. You must call me Rhianna.\" Calmly, she said. \"Second, there are six powerful witches ruling the witching world. The regions they control are The Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia which includes the minor island nations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be five regions, grand... err Rhianna.\" Raising an eyebrow, I stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, five leaders and one who trumps them all.\" Serious, Rhianna said. \"Elvira Strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do I fit in all of this?\" Politely, I demanded. \"I thought only girls could be witches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have magic within you, Ryan, it merely lies dormant as a boy.\" Firmly but kindly, Rhianna said. \"For one to be head witch, the female heir must be married.\" She sighed, a rueful smile forming upon her face. \"Before the war, a male heir was transformed into a female to take the position. The resulting  transformation immunity forced us to change the rules slightly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you telling me that males could become head witch?\" Surprised, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhianna suppressed a low giggle before nodding. \"Ironic, is it not? A boy ruling a world where only the girls have power.\" She then turned serious. \"We had not had a male ruler in over a thousand years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes widened. \"So that's what this is about!\" Becoming angry, I shouted. \"They kidnapped Jenny so I would not assume the throne!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rules are the same, minus gender.\" Darkly, Rhianna said. \"Your mother was to be the next in line but she refused to marry another man after her husband was killed. You are now the next in line only you must be at least magically bonded, if not married before your eighteenth birthday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frowned. That was only a few days away. \"What happens if I do not meet this deadline?\" Morbidly curious, I asked. \"Who does the throne go to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRhianna frowned deeply. \"It would become up for grabs.\" Darkly, she replied. \"Anyone with enough magical power who is married could assume the throne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So whoever kidnapped Jenny is after the throne.\" Fuming, I said. \"I will not allow that to happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have more magical power than you might realize.\" Serious, Rhianna said. \"It enhances your attributes, senses, reactions... let your magic guide you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she was gone as if she were never there. You drew in a breath, trying to formulate a plan.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I hadn't seen my Granny in ages, she was at a care home the last time I heard of her which was a few years ago. But I guess that was just a ruse to try and help me live the normal life, but that was shattered once the truth of the supernatural came out to me. My luggage back is near me, just above me. I'm alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grab the bag and open it up, looking below at my sword. It contains the soul of a powerful demon hunter sworn to aid me to the best he can. I decide to take him out, and instantly I hear his voice in my head as soon as I grab the hilt. \"What do you require my lord?\" it speaks to me. It's voice sounds English with a Japanese tone to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It turns out that I could be royalty Azura, guess that would make me an actual lord wouldn't it?\" I think with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI expect the sprit inside the sword to reply back, but instead he glows brightly and says \"Master! A dangerous foe approaches!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy eyes go wide, and sure enough the door in front of me is slashed open. I just manage to get out of my seat and draw my sword to face my intruder. And in walks a nightmarish figure indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing I noted was the head of what I assumed was a male, it was wrapped in thick bandages. Not showing any hair or anything like that, the only feature his head shows is the large golden yellow eye that I see on the right side of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis chest is covered with several straps, which hold the scabbards of several swords. He has two out, one in each hand. But I also note that all the scabbards hold blades in them already, I'd assume two would be empty. A wide array of scars cover his upper body, like he'd been cut in several places and then stiched back up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis lower body donned a pair of ripped black hakama's, which through holes in it I could see scars there as well. Finally he was wearing a pair of black sneakers, he then pointed one blade at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carlsonnnnnn.....\" the man hissed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?!\" I shouted, entering my stance. It was then that I noted the plane was quiet, aside from the plane's engines of course. Suddenly the scent of blood wafted into my nose. I peaked past him to see several dead people, blood dripping past him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Canti of the savage, my client has asked me to ensure that you do not survive.\" the man muttered as he took two steps towards me. I got myself ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So please do me a favour and die!!!!\" Canti screamed out as he charged forth, making for a double thrust attack aimed right at my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime slowed down for me, I focused my willpower into my blade. Azura eagerly accepted and in an instant I had teleported behind the man, I then aimed my blade downwards in the hopes of stabbing him through the leg. Only Canti quickly turned around and blocked the attack, locking his swords as an X with my sword in the middle of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response I quickly fired a left handed fist to his head, he clearly wasn't expecting that. For as soon as I hit him he staggered back, one of the things about me is that I don't hesitate to fight dirty. This guy was calling for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master we must escape, this is neither the time nor the place!\" Azura speaks to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn that I can agree, but how? I'm on a plane. But a quick glance at a nearby window tells me we are over New York. Perhaps there is a parachute on board? If there is then I could make my escape, it would be risky. But it's better than staying cooped up in a flying plane with this nutjob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time Canti has recovered and he's back on the attack, trying to bring his dual swords down onto me for and X slash attack. Doesn't he know how impractical that is? I quickly step back, the swords harmlessly go down at where I was. And I rush forth, trying to swing my blade into his neck and head. Only he grabbed the scabbard close to his head and drew the blade in time to block my attack, having dropped his previous one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly jump back, trying to block out the fact that I'm now around a heap of dead people. Canti then calmly drew his new blade, and I noticed a brand new one just appeared. Were they magic? Could this guy actually create an infinite number of swords?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith grim purpose he advances towards me yet again, I begin doing several backflips. Missing the fallen arms of dead passengers, I make my way to near the cockpit. And sure enough near the door is a parachute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Canti is still advancing towards me. I need to get him back before I can mount any escape attempts. With that in mind I decide to take the fight to him, I spin forward while having my sword sheathed. Canti slashes to the left with both blades, only I clash against them perfectly with Azura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this? You've been hired by the people who took Jenny aren't you?!\" I spit out at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCanti gives no response, he merely tries to break the lock. But Azura stands strong, and begins charging a subtle blue aura about it. I proceed to draw the rest of the blade, and in an instant I have leaped back while spinning. The slash with my katana creates a blue coloured shockwave of pure energy, and it hits Canti square in the chest. The impact and the turbulence of the plane sends the whacked out assassin down the plane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time I quickly grab the parachute and sling it over my shoulders, and yell at him \"Fucker!\" as I proceed to open the entrance door. The noise of the door is almost enough to make me deaf, several corpses go flying out. I noticed that Canti's eye had narrowed to a slit, he's embedded both blades into the plane floor to keep himself there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that's fine with me, because the next thing I see is clear blue sky. I jump out the plane, and it's rough. Azura's slipping in my grasp, I can tell if I don't act soon....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI grab the scabbard with my mouth, keeping it there as I commence skydiving. I've done this a couple of times before, but not like this. Still though, I can see the hotel where Chon and the others are staying at. I set a course for it, right now I need to get there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI activate my parachute, and sure enough I'm slowly descending through the big apple. I can already smell the evil here, Jenny is somewhere amongst this lot. And I'll tear up every alleyway to get to her, that I can promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I near the hotel's roof I look down and see if there's anyone there, and I see that it's.....</span></div></div>",

He threw a bast passed me, knocking away a sword thrown by Canti. \"You accepted the wrong contract, Canti!\" Strongly, he called out. \"You are risking the wrath of the pseudo witch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miserable abomination!\" Cursing, Cani called back. \"You will rue the day you interfered with the Savage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn waved his hand, causing the entire plane to explode into a ball of fire before vanishing from sight taking Cani with it.  What surprised me was that no one below seemed to notice. \"That was not the plane you boarded in England.\" Darkly, he said. \"That was what mad scientists call a demon flight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A what?\" Unnerved, I asked. \"Are you telling me all of those passengers were already dead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a disturbing thought but John shook his head, a deep serious look on his face. \"No, they were all robots built to look like humans.\" Softly, he replied. \"They were your body guards but Canti is the best in the business when it comes to assassination.\" He frowned. \"Forgive me for saying this but you are damn lucky to have escaped with your life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is serious.\" Sweating a little, I said. \"I only have a few days to find Jenny before...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My family and I have been briefed on the situation.\" Politely, John interrupted. \"This is serious because these people are challenging the world's royal families.\" He gave me a firm nod. \"Your fight is our fight now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I appreciate that.\" Smiling slightly, I said. \"Do you have any idea where we should start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Elvira Strange has ordered every rogue hunter graduate to search for her.\" Calmly, John replied. \"That said, we already have a small army scouring New York City. Hayley is talking to her friends from Witchbloom to see if they had heard anything and Mel is talking to her friends from the local teen coven to see if they had heard any rumors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cracked a grateful smile. \"I am impressed.\" Relieved, I said. \"I only hope we find her in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom has a church all set up to perform the bonding ceremony the instant we rescue Jenny.\" Serious, John said. \"We are covering every angle we can think of including calling in a few favors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of favors?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even my youngest sister, Hannah has her contacts.\" Smiling, John said. \"She has a dear friend on the other side of the rift whose family mirrors our own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could they be of any help?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's smile vanished. \"Her friend's grandfather is Devlin Moray, the head mad scientist. He can see through the eyes of every person on Earth at once with the use of a massive machine.\" Darkly, he replied. \"No one, and I mean no one can hide from his gaze.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something tells me there would be a high price to this.\" Wincing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn nodded. \"He demands the exclusive right to enter this world freely for this service.\" Serious, he said. \"One of the conditions of the treaty ending the great war was that no one enters either side of the rift without permission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is a rather high price.\" Shaking my head, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\" sighing, John replied.

We stop at a large mirror where John waves his hand. Instantly, it became like a window into the bedroom of John's youngest sister, Hannah. Inside, Hannah was playing with her dolls. \"Hannah, I need you.\" Flatly, John said. \"Come on through to New York.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah grinned. \"I'm not even allowed across the street yet and you want me to go to New York through a high tech teleport system?\" Teasing, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Hannah.\" Irritated, John said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah sighed and walked through into the hotel suite. \"What do you need, John?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need you to call your friend, Matt Moray on the other side of the rift.\" Serious, John said. \"We need the services of his grand father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah waved her hand at the mirror and the image changed to that of a boy's bedroom where they found a small boy with black hair and ocean blue eyes. He was no older than Hannah but very well built. Also, he had wolf like ears. He was a Neko-wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Matt!\" Startling the boy, Hannah called. \"What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah!\" Happily, Matt called. \"Welcome to my humble bedding quarters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid this is a business call.\" Turning serious, Hannah said. \"A good friend of mine really needs help from your family.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA serious look fell over Matt's face. \"Details.\" Politely, he demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to find my girlfriend, Jenny Forth.\" Chiming in, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt nodded and yelled out, \"Grandpa!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a flash, a figure appeared in the room. He was a tall, dark elderly man. He sported an eighteenth century gentleman's suit with unusually long coat tails that moved about as if they had a mind of their own. He wore knee high riding boots, a top hat covering his raven black hair, and carried a silver tipped cane with a large diamond. His eyes hid behind round shining glasses while he held a toothy, almost sinister grin. It was Matt's grandfather, Devlin Moray. \"Greetings, my hyperactive grandson.\" Courtly, he said. \"What distresses you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear friend, Ryan Carlson needs your help.\" Pointing to me, Matt said. \"His friend has been kidnapped and an attempt was made on his life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to find her, sir.\" Politely, I said. \"Can you please assist us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can but I would require one thing in return.\" Without hesitation, Devlin replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course there would be a catch. \"What would that be, sir?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can not search your world unless I am allowed free entry into it.\" Serious, Devlin said. \"The treaty that ended the great war clearly dictates that no one shall enter the other world without permission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frowned. I was not certain if I had the authority to allow such a move. Only John touched my shoulder. \"I will call Elvira Strange and see if this can be arranged.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do so.\" Serious, Devlin said. \"I already have a full image of your girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You read my thoughts?\" Annoyed, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your girlfriend is forefront on your mind.\" Calmly, Devlin said. \"Her image and voice radiates from your thoughts; I did not have to peer into your brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed while John spoke on the phone with his grandmother. Finally, he ended the call and turned to me with a serious look that was hard to read. \"Ryan, Elvira...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Finally, he ended the call and turned to me with a serious look that was hard to read. \"Ryan, Elvira says that Devlin Moray only has one hour.\" Flatly, he said. \"She can't look the other way longer than that without causing friction within the witch council.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then that will have to suffice.\" Calmly, Devlin said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he vanished in a dull flash. An instant later, I found myself standing next to him in a strange room in a location unknown. I threw the man an accusing look to which he motioned to an odd machine. It looked like a comfortable throne with a virtual reality helmet attached to it via wires which were in turn attached to a series of machines on a rolling cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is called the clairvoyance enhancer.\" Firmly but kindly, he said. \"It allows the user to see through the eyes of every person on Earth simultaneously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does this have to do with finding Jenny?\" Frowning, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone had to have seen her.\" Grinning, Devlin countered. He then turned serious. \"I am not permitted a foot hold into this world so you must be the one to conduct the search.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded dangerous. To have that many images in ones mind at once would have to be maddening. However, this was Jenny we were talking about. I had to find her, regardless of the risks. \"What do I have to do?\" Finally, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sit here and wear the helmet.\" Instructing me, Devlin said. \"The second you put it on, focus your mind only on what Jenny Forth looks like from the front, the back and the sides. The machine will do the rest and you will find your girlfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, I sat down onto the throne and wore the helmet, focusing all of my mind on Jenny. In a flash, I saw her from all angles through the eyes of several different people! \"I see her!\" Trembling, I shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep focusing on her image!\" Working some controls, Devlin said. \"I am triangulating her position!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did as Devlin instructed but gasped as one of the images turned to a mirror. I saw the face of one of the kidnappers! Unfortunately, he seemed to sense my presence. \"Someone is on to us!\" Enraged, he screamed. \"I thought I told you to keep that bitch in line! Her magic is tampering with the shields!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched in rage and horror as someone viciously slapped Jenny in the face, sending a splat of blood from her lip. A second later, the image vanished and I ripped the helmet off in a rage. \"Damn it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDon't worry, Jenny. The one who hit you will loose a lot more blood than you did! I took a breath to calm myself then turned to Devlin. \"Please tell me you found her location.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevlin frowned. \"I narrowed it down to three points within New York.\" Disappointed he said. \"Had I had another second, I would have found her exact location.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I saw one of the kidnappers.\" Gruffly, I said. \"I know the bloke. His name is Zed Brawl, a former general among the mad scientist community.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevlin nodded. \"He tried to take over the collective council during the great war.\" Ice in his tone, he said. \"I will not shed any tears over his spelt blood.\" He then summoned a map of New York City with the three points lit up. \"I guarantee you will find Jenny in one of these places. The others, I guarantee will be traps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot much choice or time. \"I can have Elvira and her rogue hunters hit two of the areas.\" Flatly, I said. \"My team and I will hit the third.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you luck.\" Serious, Devlin said. \"Your girlfriend, Jenny Forth has a cousin in my world named Lilith Mage. Does it sound familiar?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded but did not say anything as Devlin quickly continued. \"She has a crush on my grandson, Matt. That makes us family. The point is, if you fall into a jam, just call my name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could respond, I found myself back in the hotel room with John Harrison and his sister, Hannah with the map in my hand. \"Did he find her?\" Hopeful, Hannah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He narrowed it down to three locations.\" Gruffly, I replied. \"John, I need you to have Elvira and her team check out these two locations. My team and I will hit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Plus the ship could be a good place to defend themselves, and not to mention it was in local waters. So we couldn't risk an all out attack, people would see it and get scared. Sometimes I need to remind myself that not everyone knows that all the supernatural shit is all true, hell I didn't believe any of it till that rouge witch tried to attack my Mom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll need a helicopter, me and my crew will drop in and attack.\" I say to John.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it, get your crew and head up to the rooftop. It'll be here within ten minutes.\" John says to me. With that I nod to both him and Hannah and leave the room, and I'm wasting no time in finding my friends. Who are in the room on the far left of this floor, I knock twice. And Chon answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he can say anything I say to him \"Gather everyone, I don't care what everyone is doing. Get them all to the roof in ten minutes, we are getting Jenny back.\" Chon says nothing. But he gives me an understanding nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that I make my way over to the stairs, only for Devlin to hand me a suitcase. \"Get this on, think of it as a little parting gift Mr Carlson. This is my latest and greatest creation yet, the armour of Adam. Use it with care please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI check the suitcase's contents, and the amour inside is like nothing I've ever seen. And I thought I had seen and was sick of everything related to magic and science.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://news.toyark.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2012/10/Metal-Gear-Rising-Revengeance-Play-Arts-Kai-Raiden-White-Armor-Ver-04_1351312665.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://news.toyark.com/wp-content/upload...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll do, does this have anything I should know about?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It will grant you the power to complete your task, that is all you need to know.\" Devlin muttered to me in a somewhat dark tone. I didn't bother to reply, I merely nodded at him and John and prepared to set out to the rooftop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasted no time in securing this armour that Devlin gave to me, if he was the head of science over in another world then this had to be good. It fit like a glove, like it was made for my body. Although my gut feeling said that this thing was a one size fits all, I felt a lot safer with it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon and the rest of the team show up, my blind friend is dressed in his hi tech Chinese battle armour. The same one he wore back when we broke into the witch council HQ in Edinburgh. Light meanwhile is just wearing a pair of blue jeans and sneakers, he's not one for fancy armour. Although given the fact that he can endure any injury he doesn't really need it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunar's dressed in what she calls her \"Lethal force\" outfit. And I briefly don't recognise her, but I see that pink hair and know it's her.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.sosgamers.com/wp-content/gallery/tekken-tag-tournament-2/tekken-tag-tournament-2-arte-031.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.sosgamers.com/wp-content/gall...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie meanwhile is dressed in a leather trenchcoat, with blue jeans and a Kevlar vest. The kid also has a pair of bokkens, which are basically wooden katanas. I have been teaching him swordplay after all, he wanted to pitch in. He also had a sort of hidden power, we didn't know what it was. But something about the kid wasn't normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon's daughters are wearing identical suits of armour to what he wears, only smaller and for their size. Viva makes herself different by having a black cloth draped above her mouth. Amy is last with a Kevlar vest and knee length black skirt,, with black and white stockings under it. Looking like the proper goth about to wade into battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a moment to look over my friends, we look a bit ramshackle. Light even more so, certainly a far cry from the professional rouge witch hunters we hear so much about. But yet I trust no one more than the people I see in front of me. The helicopter lands and we all waste no time in getting in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce it's up and we're flying over the New York skyline night has fallen, and I've not had much sleep besides most of my flight where I found it boring and just dozed off. I then start to brief my friends with what I know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay here's the plan. Jenny has been believed to have been sighted on a cruise ship leaving New York. We have reason to believe that the enemy is attempting to sneak her out and have her get married somewhere else, we need to drop onto that ship. Jenny is the only thing that matters, everyone else on that ship is expendable. I don't care what you do with them, just make sure Jenny goes home with us.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we have any idea of the enemy?\" Chon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah some guy named Zed Brawl. Long story short he's a former high ranking member of the mad science community, don't know what he'd want with Jenny though. I suspect he's in cahoots with other people.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoever they are it doesn't matter, cause they won't survive when I get them.\" Light muttered while rubbing his knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention the drop is clear, prepare for jumps.\" the pilot says to us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay people, here we make a stand. This is where we tell these motherfuckers that they can't take one of our own, I don't care why they want Jenny. All I care about is getting her back. We're gonna strangle them with their own guts and leave them in a pool of their own blood to drown in! Am I right people?!\" I yell out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody gives me loud shouts of approval, to which I reply with \"Damm right I am, now come on. Some bad guys need to get their nuts kicked in!\" with that I leap out the helicopter with a parachute. My crew follows suit, and the next thing we know we're planning to land right on the cruise ship.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>-Ryan's POV-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon landing on the helipad of the cruise ship in the back of the vessel, we were greeted by Zed Brawl and his hoard of robot soldiers. Zed was tall and lean with slicked back black hair and yellow eyes, likely from self experimentation. He wore a suit of armor similar to my own but clearly an earlier model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, Carlson and company to your destruction!\" Boldly, he announced. \"Prepare yourselves for a one way ticket to oblivion!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad guys talk too much.\" Raising his swords, Charlie muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to agree with the kid but now was not the time for it. Zed made the first move, throwing three small balls from his pockets at Charlie, Viva, and Vogue who were standing next to each other. The metallic balls flew around them, creating a type of force field. Charlie hit it with his sword with no effect. Zed gave an evil grin as he slowly closed his hand, causing the shield to get smaller. \"Be crushed with your crushes, little ones!\" Evilly, he taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon was the first to act. He tried to rip the shield apart but to no avail. \"Chon, step back!\" Urgently, Charlie shouted. \"We got this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon stepped back and was surprised when Charlie placed his hands on the V twin's right shoulder. His eyes glowed before Viva and Vogue cast a powerful spell. It was clearly beyond their level as it threw the shield off of them and onto one of the robot soldiers which was quickly crushed and destroyed by Zed's trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon raised a single eyebrow at Charlie. \"We'll talk later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZed growled then motioned to his robots. \"Destroy them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, the robots charged wielding swords and firing laser guns at us all. I drew my Asura, ready for battle when I was in for a surprise. The armor glowed and I felt a powerful essence within me. Before I could try to reason what it was, Asura spoke. \"It is a possession armor; it allows spirit and body to become one! Allow me to guide your movements!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was no time to argue. I sighed, releasing my control and I found myself performing moves I have never heard of, turning the robot soldiers into piles of junk. Lasers were fired at me only to be reflected off by the sword as if they were nothing but pesky insects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie and the V-twins stayed close, casing powerful spells at the seemingly never ending army of robots and reducing them to rubble. Noticing this, I realized that Charlie was somehow boosting their power levels. Only that would have to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight and Lunar were performing what they had called the dance of death where they tear the robots apart in what seemed to be nothing more than a graceful dance. Of course, we were all getting our hits, a slash on the arm here, a laser burn there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon and Amy worked together as a team. Amy had a knack for defensive magic so she served as a shield while Chon served as a sword, tearing the robots apart with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zed is keeping us pinned! We don't have time for this!\" Destroying another robot, I yelled to Asura. \"We need to end this now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Asura could respond, two robot tentacles ripped onto the scene and slammed down onto two changing room where the robots were emerging. Zed screamed in a girlish manner. \"My replicators!\" Distraught, he yelled. \"My beautiful replicators!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tentacles retracted and Devlin Moray casually walked onto the scene, his long coat tails moving in a threatening manner. \"Leave this filth to me, children.\" Darkly, he ordered. \"You have more pressing matters to attend to. I shall join you once Zed is neutralized.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not know what laws or treaties were broken with Devlin Moray entering the scene but at the moment, I did not care. Jenny was all that mattered...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryan's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey say a man is at his strongest when he's got nothing to lose, and if that's true then I am more powerful than I've ever been. And also, there was the anger. I felt mad, furious. I wanted to kill those who dared to kidnap Jenny, to slice out their guts and shove them back down their throats. In fact I was grabbing one of Zed's robots and crushing it's head in my left hand, stabbing my blade through another one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look around, Chon is coming at the machines with just his bare hands. Even though he had a pair of Shaolin hook swords on his back, he preferred them citing how versatile they could be. The man was feared by rouge witches as a killer of their kind, to the point where it felt like near mythical levels. And Chon was showing he could handle Zed's little metal toys with ease, the mad science community had no idea how lucky they were to not have someone like him hunting their kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of barehanded Light is swinging his arms wildly, gleefully laughing his head off. The magical weapon had a great lust for violence, it had been instilled in him since he was born. As much as Light proclaimed to be a protector of people, the truth was Light loved fighting. In fact he grabbed hold of one robot, and was literally tearing into it's head. If it were a living person I think even I could have been taken aback by this, but I didn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else was giving their all, we were fighting to save one of our own. I was fighting to save a part of myself, while Devlin was dealing with the master my crew was to move forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quickly! We must get deeper into the ship!\" I yell out, making even more of an effort to cut through the large amounts of robot mooks that stood before us. My blade and arm were a flash, and each time I saw it machines were sliced clean through. I had barely noticed that it had started to rain, because soon me and my friends were inside the cruse ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.blogcdn.com/slideshows/images/slides/216/725/1/S2167251/slug/l/1rp-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.blogcdn.com/slideshows/images...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a very classy place, Zed in all his arrogance must have thought that Jenny should only be wed with opulence surrounding her. But that's not going to happen, there's waves and waves of robots around the room. Only they move to give way to a woman walking towards us, and it's not Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eva Morgana.....\" I mutter, although I find it strange to think that Zed is working with a witch. Still evil minds can think alike, I don't know and I don't really care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rouge witch cracks a smirk and is looking at Chon \"Well the blind vengeance.....you know that I see you and that I can't let you leave alive.\" she speaks gleefully. Chon is saying nothing, he merely takes his twin hookswords off his back. I recalled how rouge witches have a massive bounty placed on Chon, namely cause of the body count he has from them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEva's not done yet though, she looks at Viva and Vogue. Frowning and saying \"Ah, if it isn't the former daughters of Helena Young. Traitors, only natural that you fall in with the enemy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly that hit the mark, the two girls were moving forward and were only held back because of Charlie. \"Our Mother treated us like crap!\" Viva said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVogue was following up with \"Do not ever talk about her.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as it looks like we're about to break into violence again however a loud voice from above yells my name, I know it all too well. Jenny is at the top floor, dressed in a large white wedding dress. I quickly turn to look at her, Eva shouts with \"How did you escape? Where is Thomas?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo that was the plan, I heard that Eva had a son. No doubt he was just a patsy here, someone that the rouge witch would have no qualms in controlling to her own ends. Jenny must have broken free somehow, perhaps Eva's son got her out or something like that. I don't know, all I know is......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3.....<br>\r\n2.....<br>\r\n1.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll hell broke loose, both sides charged and the battle commenced.</span></div></div>",

That was why we were here, to save her. I am Carlson's Brother in arms, I'll walk to the depths of hell with him if that's needed. Light and Lunar quickly start charging into the battle, the magical weapon tearing into the hordes of robots with his robot partner backing him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I can start moving the ceiling shattered open, with a helicopter above it. Then ropes were coming down from it, with masked soldiers holding laser rifles in one hand began to quickly slide down the ropes. However I detected the chi energy of someone I know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Akatsuki-san!\" I shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/in-birth/images/9/97/Story-aka02.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/105?cb=20141208110744\" target=\"_blank\">http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/in-b...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShomei Akatsuki, the man is ex Japanese self defence force. And is related to the sprit that is in the katana of Carlson, they come from a long line of Japanese demon hunters. This man has also brought backup with him, dressed in his old officer's outfit. He was a lot older than he looked, he looked like that back in the 50's from what I'm told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chon-san! My men will take care of the henchmen of this wench alongside Light-san and Lunar-san. I will aid Carlson-sama in reaching Jenny-san, dispatch that rogue witch!\" Shomei yells as he rushes to the stairs, roundhouse kicking a robot's head off. Yelling across the room to me, that SDF karate training really comes in handy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gladly! Eva you are sashimi. Viva! Vogue! To me!\" I yell, sprinting right at the rogue witch. My hookswords grinding against the marble flooring, Eva fires out a magic orb. But I've been fired upon in that manner before, dozens of times when I hunted her kind. I simply tilt my body to the right and it zips past harmlessly, and I adjust my grip on the blade in my left hand. One of the useful things about hookswords? You can connect them together at the top, and that's what I do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoing that easily extends my attacking range to 6 feet, and I hook the pair together and stand. Swiftly executing my spin, and the dagger blade at the bottom strikes Eva. Creating a nice and clean cut right into her gut, which she groans out and clenches her wound with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn you Chink!\" she spits out, I frown under my blindfold. So not only is she a magical Nazi, Eva's also racist it seems. Chink's a slur aimed at Asian people, namely the Chinese. But I take it in stride as my adopted children move in unison to take the fight to Eva, flipping and tumbling right at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just because I've sliced Eva open doesn't mean she's beaten, the rogue witch fires an electric blast at Viva. She took it right in the chest, a good thing that they're using the same sort of armour that I use. It's designed to resist the powers of offensive magic, made using metal combined with strong chi energy. Still doesn't make me feel better about seeing her hit like that, Vogue goes flying too with a wind blast. The pair managed to recover fast though, using their ballet training to get their grounding back quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time I've got my hookswords ready to keep fighting, and I rush forward again. Intent on making Eva bleed like a stuffed pig, if she knows one thing about me then it's that I've hunted and killed several of her kind. I use my chi energy to move at such a high speed, in such a short distance. That to the eye I'd appear to be teleporting, the ghost fade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then suddenly I've high into the air, ready to swing down my hookswords and dig them into Eva's shoulders. Only for the rogue witch to trigger a large circle of energy around her, and it blasted upwards. And I was smack dab in the middle of it, and suddenly I was near the shattered roof of the room. Thankfully my armour took the majority of the hit, I didn't have the durability of Light. But the armour did it's job and that was all that mattered, I had turned my body so that I was now looking down at the enemy. And I nosedive right at her, near suicide. But that was the point, I was rushing right down at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I flipped, my arms moving with the hookswords. I landed behind Eva, and smirked. Suddenly as she tried to move forward, suddenly her arms fell. I had sliced them off, and she didn't even know what her till it was too late. Viva and Vogue stood in surprise, then suddenly moved forward to apply healing magic. They stopped the blood flow, and I was inwardly impressed with how my adopted children coped. Granted they've seen blood, but still I just ripped Eva's limbs off there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not like our Mother, you won't die from this Ms Eva.\" Viva said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll live, so that you'll face further justice.\" Vogue said, giving Eva a kick in the head to silence her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle was done, Eva had no chance. But there was no time to dwell on that, we needed to keep going.</span></div></div>",

He was a gory sight; his body covered in blood from gashes and burns from his fight with Devlin Moray. His right hand was almost completely burned to the bone, likely from a powerful energy blast. His left hand was still intact and wielding an energy sphere the size of a large boulder. He laughed maniacally, madness clear in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With my last breath, I will become immortalized in Mad science history!\" Boasting, he declared. \"Jenny Forth's marriage shall unite the two realities with mad science reigning supreme!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took an offensive stance with Asura at the ready. This man was obviously sick and twisted. How he believed any kind of marriage would do this was beyond me. It didn't matter though, I was not going to let it happen, no fucking way! Then, a familiar voice rang out, bringing a slight smirk to my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you ever shut up!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Devlin Moray! I was shocked to find that there was not a scratch on him minus a deep scratch across his left eye. The head mad scientist slapped the energy sphere with his bare hand, instantly engulfing Zed into it! The crazed man screamed in agony before Devlin laughed madly as he summoned a nine iron golf club to his hand. \"Fore!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hit the sphere with the club, sending it flying into the sky at near super sonic speeds! There was then an explosion that lit the night sky, making it appear near noon before the night fell dark again. Devlin breathed a sigh then turned, madness still clear in his eyes. \"Who's next?\" Grinning, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then laughed out hysterically as thunder crashed everywhere outside... In the next breath, I found myself back in my dorm with Jenny sitting only a few feet away. She ran into my arms, crying. I held her tightly, tears falling as I had nearly lost her forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of my friends were in the room as well, looking slightly confused. \"Mr. Moray must have teleported us all back home.\" Shaken, Charlie said. \"But why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who cares?\" Bluntly, Chon countered. \"We have obtained our objective and returned home safely. That is all that matters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI continued to hold Jenny tightly, vowing never to allow her out of my sight again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not until the following day when I get a strange phone call.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That was after we checked everyone for any injuries, Chon took a few dents and scrapes but nothing more than what he's used to. All in all a total success, we saved the day and my girl. I got my armour off and Jenny got that stupid dress off, we climbed into bed and out like lights. After everything that we had gone through that was no surprise, I didn't dream. I was too tired from it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI awaken to the sounds of chirping birds, Jenny's sleeping next to me. She looks out like a light, clinging to me as she did. I glided a finger down her side, the covers are over us. Jenny must have done that. I feel the need to use the bathroom, and so I make to leave the bed. Jenny doesn't try to stop me, namely due to how tired she must be. I can't imagine what she went through, brainwashing and being forced to pose in her dress or something like that. I don't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bathroom is near me, I look in the mirror. And note that I have small bags around my eyes, and there's stubble around my face. In my quest to find Jenny I didn't take care of how I looked, all I cared about was finding her. My only regret is I didn't kill Zed, I wanted to stab him, slash him into bits and cut his head off. But I block those thoughts, not healthy thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else is starting to wake up, I make to get back into my room and wake up Jenny. But I'm cut off by a phone ringing in the hallway, who could that be?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking from side to side to see if anyone else will get it I realise I'm closest, so of course I'm to answer. I answer the phone and put it to my ear. \"Who is this?\" I state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carlson is that you, Elvira Strange here I..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't why but I just feel compelled to hang up the phone, and that's exactly what I do. I hang it up, and it rings right away. I sigh and answer it, whatever it is best to just get it over with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carlson did you just hang up?\" Elvira asks with a hint of annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No I didn't, think it's just cause your in US and I'm in the UK. What's needed?\" I state, fuck sake it's not even breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carlson it's come to my attention that you've uncovered your hidden lineage, your Mother explained it to you correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah pretty much, why?\" I say trying to will myself to wake up more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to come back to the US, there's much to be done in terms of our government and your new potential place in it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".........I dunno, I mean I am really behind on my school work right now. Any other side tasks and I might have to retry the year again...\" I respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that can wait, with what's happening you might not even need to graduate from Starmage. You have no say in this Carlson, a team of rogue witch hunters will be escorting you to the Edinburgh witch HQ from the school grounds in 10 hours.\" Elvira says all without missing a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere's a voice in my head telling me to hang up again. I am really tempted. But so long as I can get back to school that's fine. \"Fine, if there's anything more to say it can be done then. Goodbye for now.\" then I can get away with hanging up. Which I do, going to need to get dressed and all that. But for now I check up on Jenny, and she's shivering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI instantly go up to her in the bed, she flinches at my touch. But Jenny wakes up and realises it's me, and she huddles close to me silently. I just want to spend some time hugging, which I do. Ten hours is plenty of time for that.</span></div></div>",

Chon received a mysterious phone call three hours after my call with Elvira Strange. He soon left with Charlie the V twins in a black helicopter. I asked the dean what was going on to which she told me it was a personal matter; one I would have to address with Chon in person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got me worried as I knew Chon had several enemies in the rogue community. Damn, trouble just seems to follow me everywhere! Three hours after Chon hastily left, Light vanished without a single word. This greatly unnerved me and I hurried to his dorm to see if I could find any clues. Light never left my side unless it was extremely important. It did not take long for me to find a newly scratched image on the wall with a knife jabbed right next to it. This was how Light secretly left messages. It was two circles intertwined. Only that was it, there was nothing else. The symbol could have meant anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree hours later, Amy vanished as well! Now panic was beginning to set in as I held Jenny close in my dorm room. She was just as worried as I was after her terrible ordeal. \"Where did everyone go?\" Tearing up, she asked. \"Ryan, I'm frightened!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Jenny.\" Fighting my own fears, I replied. \"We will get to the bottom of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is nothing to fear, Master Carlson.\" Startling me, a female voice replied. \"Your friends are safe and sound in Edinburgh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to find four women in police uniforms standing at the door of my dorm. I shook my head at them, not liking whatever game they were playing. \"I demand answers!\" Forcibly, I yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will get them in Edinburgh.\" Firmly, the witch in command replied. \"However, due to security reasons, you will take separate helicopters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell we will!\" Angered, Jenny snapped. \"Just who do you people think you are!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe witch sighed. \"I guess we owe you twenty bucks, Mr. Moray.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI jumped hearing a familiar mad laughter. In the next breath, I was alone in a helicopter flying over the ocean with only my pen pal, John Harrison with me. He gave me a sympathetic smile before stating. \"Just relax, I went through this myself. Patience will bring its rewards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was fuming at this point only John was somehow preventing me from moving out of my seat. He again smiled as he shook his head. \"I know you are concerned for your friends and furious with us but it has to be done this way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething in what John told me caused me to pause to think. <i>He had gone through this himself?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe helicopter landed just outside of Edinburgh only to vanish an reappear somewhere underground! I looked around and recognized nothing! However, Devlin Moray was waiting for us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, Prince Ryan to Olympus!\" Grinning, he said. \"Here you will bond with Princess Jenny Forth and forever halt any future attempts to take her away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy head began to spin. I looked past Devlin to find Chon and Light in tuxedos standing on either side of a pair of massive doors at the end of a long underground hall. \"Where exactly are we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a temple under Mt Olympus on Mars, Ryan.\" Smiling, John said. \"Here, no one will be able to interfere with the bonding ceremony.\" He chuckled. \"Elvira Strange and Devlin Moray set it up together for you and Jenny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! I thought Devlin Moray was not permitted to enter our world without permission!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevlin smiled madly. \"This is not their world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rolled my eyes. <i>\"Loophole...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDevlin and John then escorted me to the two door where Chon and Light were waiting. Light looked very uncomfortable in the tux he was wearing but he seemed to be grudgingly tolerating it. Chon nodded respectfully before he and Light opened the doors. I was escorted through into a huge grand hall! I saw chairs set up, all filled with the students and teachers from Starmage Academy! Hering a giggle, I turned to see Charlie in a tux of his own to my right and the V twins holding baskets of flowers to my left. Tears began to well in my eyes, seeing all the work everyone had put into this for Jenny and I.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys really went all out for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just the beginning.\" Grinning, Devlin said. \"Now get your lover boy ass to the alter so Jenny can walk down the aisle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last thing.\" Serious, John said. He waved his hand and I found myself in an impressive black tuxedo with Asura, sheathed at my side. \"Now you are ready to become bonded with Jenny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, grateful and hurried to the alter to await my love to make her entrance. Soon after, a door at the end of the aisle opened and Jenny walked out wearing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

We smiled at each other then faced the head witch, Elvira Strange who was presiding over the bonding ceremony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you, Ryan Carlson take Jenny Forth to be your girlfriend; to honor and hold, to defend and provide, to love and cherish until you break up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira nodded then turned to Jenny. \"Do you, Jenny Forth take Ryan Carlson to be your boyfriend; to honor and hold, to defend and provide, to love and cherish until you break up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny nodded, smiling. \"I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira smiled. \"Then by the power vested in me by the witch council, I now pronounce you boyfriend and girlfriend, you may now kiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny and I embraced each other and kissed passionately with the crowd of witnesses cheering. We were now bonded with the protection of both our families and both realities protecting us.

My first real friend, the man who helped me towards the path of redemption. He deserved Jenny and vice versa, Carlson just looked so lost without her. To the point where he was acting like me, only concerned with blood. I knew first hand the path that can lead you to, thankfully he won't walk down it now. I have other matters to attend to however while Ryan speaks with the witch council regarding his new status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm sitting in a helicopter, that's flying towards Witchbloom academy for girls. It's an all girl school, all witch school. I used to despise magic, hated it with all my being. It killed my Brother, the only member of my family. Or so I thought. During the raid on the Edinburgh witch HQ Ryan uncovered records that proved I had a long lost sibling, a younger Sister. It all makes sense now, she was why my parents left. They saw my Sister as a chance to come out of being poor, plus China frowns on having big families. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuanle Kay, no doubt about it. She is my younger Sister, long lost. I know what the witch council sees me as, a demon. Someone who is a story told to keep people in line, with my killing in the past of rogue witches they kept Huanle a secret. Her name changed to prevent her from knowing about me, other than the lies that was fed to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe copter lands, I'm dressed in a black suit with white shirt and red tie. My girls are staying at Starmage, this is a matter that I must do alone. I open the door and step out, Elvria Strange is there standing before me. With a squad of elite rogue witch hunters alongside her, a precaution of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chon Kay! I was informed of your arrival. I hope your not going to be slaying all the witches in this school.\" Elvira shouts over the copter blades. Even with her statement she keeps a smirk on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile in response before saying \"I'm here to visit a student here. You know her I trust. Huanle Kay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing this Elvira's eyes go wide, before narrowing. \"How did you find out blind vengeance?\" she stated with a hint of anger in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter. I have a long lost sibling, I wish to see her.\" I state with my arms folded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe copter dies down, and Elvira walks to me. She sighs and says \"Very well, come with me. I will place you in a empty room and bring Huanle to you, please wear this bracelet.\" the head witch hands me a bracelet with a pink flower on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I assume this is to protect me?\" I ask as I put it on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira nods and says \"Make no mistake Chon, your are taking a great risk being here. Many witches despise you, however you are owed a great debt. And I know that you have changed your ways, now let's go. Follow me and stay close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI say nothing, merely nod. With that I'm escorted by Elvira and the rogue witch hunters, I ignore all the mutterings amongst me. Many are angry or fearful of me being here, no doubt wondering what brings the bane of witches to their very doorstep. Well they can keep thinking, the peanut gallery matters not to me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe go into the school, through some hallways and up stairs. Then we go into a classroom, it's empty aside from one student. Mel Harrison. I can detect her seeing me and she stands up and says \"Head witch why is he here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Melanie as long as your here please stay with Chon, I will bring his sibling here shortly.\" Elvira says, I know Mel. She's John Harrison's twin, and the weaker one in my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait sibling?\" Mel asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huanle. You know her?\" I gruffly state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat did something, Mel pauses before saying \"Oh I get it, she's your Sister isn't she? This is pretty ironic isn't it? You, the killer of witches and hater of magic. Now you suddenly come here and expect your sibling to be brought to you, even if she uses magic. Your a hypocrite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon hearing that I growl and storm up to Mel, and slam a fist next to the wall. The rogue hunters move behind me, I lean away from Mel who flinched at my action. \"You don't know a damn thing, not a damn thing. I might be one sure, but at least I face what I've done.\" I say. Unlike her Mother, I wonder how happy Jack was.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough both of you! Mel since you cannot tolerate Chon's presence here please fetch Huanle at once.\" Elvira says, she quickly moved in there. Mel doesn't say anything to me, she simply nods and leaves the room.</span></div></div>",

Elvira no doubt kept this knowledge secret, even from her own son only I was not fully convinced. \"Magic can not kill...\" I stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was not a magical curse.\" Hissing, Elvira countered. \"You forget the mad science and magic war that was felt globally.

It was not a pleasant sensation. \"Sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira drew a deep breath then slowly let it out. \"Regressing my son the the age of three was the only way to destroy the curse as it also regressed the nanites... to non-existence.\" Calmly, she explained. \"I was forced to raise a son who despised me, not knowing the truth.\" She shook her head. \"It's ironic that he turned to mad science to fight our attempts to make him a witch so not to repeat history.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had a greater respect for the head witch after hearing her story.

Her chi is so blue, only a pure hearted person could have it at that level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chi gives me features, she's 16 years old. Chinese, black hair to her shoulders. My God. It's her, it has to be her. I nod politely to her, the girl gives a small bow in response to that. She's shy though, I can tell that from her overall body language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Madam head witch, why is the blind vengeance here? Is there danger in this school?\" she states with concern, I bite my lower lip. Fuck she's scared of me, suppose I shouldn't be surprised though. After all I've done little to improve the view of those in magical power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huanle Chon is here for a reason, please sit down the pair of you.\" Elvira says as she takes a seat. We sit on opposite ends of her, well Huanle does at any rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remain silent as I turn my head to Elvira, she takes the hint and takes a deep breath before saying \"Huanle, Chon is your long lost older Brother. It was kept a secret for your safety, as your no doubt aware of Chon's less than stellar history with witches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon Elvira saying this I face Huanle and silently nod, but then I say \"I know this is a shock, but believe me when I say that I'm a changed man. You have nothing to fear of me....\" but I was worried by what my newly discovered Sister's reaction would be.......</span></div></div>",

Elvira sighed, as if expecting such a question. \"Your brother went on a bloody rampage after his and your brother was murdered by rogue witches.\" In a forced calm, Elvira explained. \"As you were a witch, we feared for your safety so we kept you secret from each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I detect stress in your voice, madam head witch.\" Calmly, Huanle said. \"I am guessing that this meeting was not your idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She is very perceptive.\"</i> Impressed, I thought. <i>\"That and so calm; such control...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was not my decision to bring you two together, no.\" Wearily, Elvira replied. \"However, I could not deny Chon once he learned the truth.\" She eyed me and added, \"Especially since he has proven himself no longer a vigilante but a true hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah.\" Nodding, Huanle said.

Not surprisingly, Huanle seemed unaware that she was talking directly to me. \"Although I have admitted you have become a true hero, it does not change your actions of the past.\" Darkly, she said. \"I have been too patient with you already, Chon Kay...

But no, it's scarred me for life as you know.....\" I muttered to Huanle, I feel like I've made great strides in my feelings to magic and witches. Before I would have been furious to be this close to any sort of magic, it was that bad. And I found no small amount of proof that magic was a horrible thing, there was one boy who had been transformed into a girl doll by his Mother and Sisters. The Sisters had a tug of war with that doll, and the end result was a woman who was quadruple amputated. It was stuff like that, that fucking pissed me off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut since joining Starmage Academy I lived among witches like Jenny, who were actually using their magic in a good way. It was Viva and Vogue though, they turned me around. Ironic given that I adopted them to save them from walking down a dark path, and yet they end up saving me. Even Amy helped turn me around, looking back was all of her jives and words all aimed at trying to turn me around? I'll need to think about that....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of that I said \"Starmage Academy where I stay has all sorts, I live with people in a dorm. There's witches like you, my friends are like a family to me there. We've been through thick and thin, you would fit right in there Huanle.\" I'm speaking in Cantonese, in case anyone is listening in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuanle nods and says \"That's good, I've not had a family......when everyone else goes for the holidays I remain here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frown under my blindfold and then say \"Your, our parents.....They're dead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuanle nods again, more slowly this time and says \"Yes to my knowledge, it was all such a blur. My earliest memories are of witch establishments, and any attempts to find out more was met with failure.\" so she was an orphan more or less. Our parents must have left with Huanle, but why? Did they hope to profit from the fact that she was a witch? I guess we'll never know, but it doesn't matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then come with me please, let's be a family as it should have been years ago.\" I say standing up and giving a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn response to this my Sister stands up too and throws her arms around me, she says \"Chon, witches may fear you. But you are my Brother, that much is clear. When they look at you and see dread and fear, I will see hope and courage. I will go with you to Starmage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI say nothing, I merely hug her. I think if I was able to cry I would, but I can't. My eyes have been damaged too much, however Huanle has probably suffered just as much as I have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuanle packs her bags and promptly joins me at the helicopter, there's no one to see her off it seems. Huanle just says \"I'll tell my friends later, they'll understand. Mel will at least.\" I say nothing to that but I give a nod to acknowledge it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the helicopter it's silent, Huanle is looking out the window in awe. But then she turns her head and asks a question \"Brother, I have a question. What was our eldest Brother like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI will need to get used to her calling me that, it's a word I've not heard in so long. I take a sigh, she wants to know? She must have put two and two together, people know that I had an older Brother who looked out for me. Who died at the hands of evil witches, which led to me removing my eyes and starting down a dark path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chuang......he was a good man. A kind hearted man who sought to do all he could for his little Brother, who died protecting him. And he would have done the same for you I'm sure. If he was still alive he would no doubt consider me a fool for my actions.\" I say, my voice chokes up at the end. Long buried feelings are a result of that. I'm done mourning him though, he wouldn't want me to carry on like that. Huanle sighs and sits down next to me, no words need to be said anymore. I'm just grateful that there is a family waiting for me, and it's going to get a little bigger now.</span></div></div>",

It seems they disagree with you taking your sister to Starmage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They know we can't fight them in the air.\" Worried, Huanle said. \"Our only option is for the pilot to out maneuver them and get away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a few tricks up my sleeve if we have to fight.\" Serious, I said. \"I just got you back, I'm not going to lose you so easily!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuanle gave me a grateful smile then sighed, seeing the witches flying straight for the helicopter. \"It looks like we will have to fight them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to us, in Starmage, Charlie was resting in his dorm with Ryan and the V twins. He suddenly gasped, gaining everyone's attention. \"Chon's in trouble!\" Alarmed, he shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you...\" Worried, Ryan began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie vanished from Starmage to everyone's shock and reappeared hovering over the helicopter to the pilot's shock as well Huanle's and mine. I could see him out the side door window; he had a deep scowl on his face which was rare for him. \"No one hurts my friends!\" Screaming, the declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately after, a strange sphere appeared around the helicopter. Any and all magical attacks literally bounced off as the helicopter flew passed the coven of witches. I was quite impressed to see Charlie playing the role of the rescuer rather than I for him. One witch managed to get through the shield only Charlie saw her and called out my name. I knew the witch was there but I was not prepared to find myself glowing just as a spell was cast. The spell bounced off me and hit the witch, sending her flying out of the helicopter with a scream!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuanle looked on in both awe and shock. \"A human familiar...\" Stunned, she whispered. \"A male human familiar...\" She turned to me, a look of worry on her face. \"I fear your friend took quite a risk to come to our rescue; now all those witches know he exists and the power he may offer them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can only give his power to those close to his heart.\" Calmly, I countered. \"Still, we will have a talk with him later.\" I then smiled slightly. \"For now, allow him this moment.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryan's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look out at the sights of New York, I've never been to the US. Too busy with my own life, till now where my path has taken me here. I bite my lower lip, I want nothing more than to leap down to the streets. Find those responsible for stealing Jenny from me, draw my blade and make the ground stained with blood. I wanted vengeance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn seems to have noticed my look, and says to me \"Don't entertain those thoughts Ryan, your better than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm trying not to believe me, but I can't help it. Something precious has been taken from me, would John be like that if Megan was taken from him? I don't ask the question, and I know that just standing here dreaming of killing would achieve nothing. Committing to action will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go talk with your family, I think Chon might also want to talk to Hayley about something.\" I mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn has a curious look on his face, no doubt wondering why I'm bringing Chon into this. Before John can inquire further I raise a hand and say \"He wants to find a long lost sibling.\" I decide it might be best to just bring it out now and erase any suspicions or doubt, better that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn nods and says \"Well one thing at a time, come on. They should be waiting inside for us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI say nothing to him, merely giving a nod of the head. My whole inner self is a wreck, I've had my girlfriend taken from me. Told that she might be married off to someone and she'll never recognise me again. I then break into a supernatural government's headquarters, find evidence that my best friend has a long lost relative. Discover that I'm hidden royalty, and have just nearly been killed by a guy who most likely sleeps next to his swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut do I show the fear? The pressure? No I can't, my friends can't see it. I need to be the one they turn to in a crisis, I'm the one that needs to set the bar and example. I'll break down once this is all over, if I'm still alive that is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm silent as I walk with John, he doesn't offer any words to me. But he's gotta know how I'm feeling, pretty sure I'm showing it. If I'm not then I don't know what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will find her Ryan.\" he says to me as we near a door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod, trying to give a smile. But to be honest all I can manage is a small smirk. Every second and every minute makes me feel like I'm losing hope. Losing more and more of it each time Jenny is in danger. But until I breathe no longer I will not rest until I save her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe enter the hotel room and there's John's mom sitting at a coffee table, on the phone talking to someone about something. I hope it's about finding Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll call you back Elvira, yeah Ryan's just arrived. Okay bye.\" Ms Harrison ends the call and motions for me to sit down at the table. I hesitate somewhat before moving to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did John tell you what we've been doing?\" she asks me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod and say \"But the hell did he mean by bonding ceremony?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's mom frowns slightly \"He didn't tell you over the phone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI recall what happened that time, I crushed it in my hands as soon as John told me what might happen if I should fail. I shake my head and say \"We got cut off, so after we've saved Jenny we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perform a ritual that magically binds you to her, so as to prevent anyone else from taking the pair of you away from each other.\" after Ms Harrison explains that to me I feel a sense of interest pop up in my head, so that would protect her? That sounds perfect, if only we'd done that sooner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI want to state that, but I know it won't help further things along. Hayley then walks in and greets me by saying \"Hi there Ryan, me and Mel have been checking with every witch we can find. Rest assured Jenny won't be leaving New York, if the people who kidnapped her try to sneak her out then we'll all know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat makes me feel better, still don't know her location yet. But still it's progress. I then say to Hayley \"Listen can you speak to Chon later? I think you might be able to help him with something, he's discovered he might have a younger Sister who's a student at witchbloom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley nods and says \"Will do, but we'll put that on hold for now. Let's get down to business, we have a few suspects that might know where Jenny is being held.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get serious and respond with \"Tell me where they are and I will hunt them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Harrison produces two pictures, both of women. And she then says \"Our first suspect is Samantha Forrester, she's related to us. But recently she's been sighted in New York, and she's gone silent. No calls answered, no emails, nothing. Although she's not done any rouge witch activity recently she still has ties to them, and I wouldn't put it past her to get a slice of this action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the other?\" I mutter, trying to picture my sword at Samantha's neck if she's involved in Jenny's kidnapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helena Young, a known rouge witch and repeat offender. She's been based in New York for years now, and was thought to have been dead when an attempt to turn half the population into females went awry. If there's anyone who knows what's going it could be her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pick which one you want to target Ryan, you and your friends can go after them while we can question the other one.\" John says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frown, both looked guilty as hell. I bet they were both involved. But I then chose to hunt....</span></div></div>",

But if this Samantha bitch has info then I need to know, before our foes do. Hayley then hands me a file saying \"Samantha was last seen at a crackhouse in Brooklyn, we suspect the place might be peddling magic infused drugs. And that rouge witches are present there, find Samantha Ryan. And please restrain yourself, there's enough witch presence in this city already. The last thing we need is for it to spill on the streets.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod, sticking the folder in my coat. \"Are Chon and co safe?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn nods \"Yeah their in the floor below us, room on the far right after going down the stairs.\" he explained to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI say my goodbyes to them and leave, there will be plenty of time for jovial fun later. Right now though I need to discuss things with my friends, we need to come up with a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sure enough I find the door no problem, I knock and in a second Chon answers. He peeks out at me, no doubt sensing me past the door. \"Come in.\" the blind man says to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do so, everyone's settled at the dinner table. They are all tucking into some pizza, I've never really been a person for it. But I make the effort to smile and take a couple of slices, we all eat and then after that's done I bring them up to speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a bit of a doozy. I make sure not to miss any points out, like me learning what I have from my Mom and Granny. Me nearly dying at the hands of an assassin, and finding out a possible lead. \"This crack den....are you sure?\" Chon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod \"She's gotta be there, there's magic infused drugs going on there. And it's run by rouge witches, she'll be there no doubt.\" I reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's the plan?\" Amy asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Charlie and the V girls need to stay here. Amy you watch them with Light.\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner do I say that Light plans to object, I say to him \"I'm sorry but this calls for a subtle approach, Lunar can stake the place out and me and Chon can sneak in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight frowns, it's clear he doesn't like that. But it's the right call. Me and Chon are the best at sneaking in our group, I had training from ninjas in Japan. Meanwhile Chon honed his skills through hunting rouge witches, Lunar with her flying powers and scanning devices will also be an important asset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be back with intel, and then Jenny is getting saved and those fuckers are dying.\" I mutter to Light. Chon and Lunar follow me down the stairs and out the building, there's a car waiting for us with Hayley standing next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll find some stuff that might help you infiltrate the building, sometimes the more mundane methods beat magic and machine.\" she said pointing a thumb at the backseat. There's some makeup and rag clothing, the kind that could let me pass off as a junkie in search of a fix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smart.\" I merely say, Chon gets in the back seat. Lunar takes the driver seat, I'm about to enter when Hayley stops me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carlson, I know that your feeling intense anger right now. But we need Samantha alive, she'd be more useful alive than dead. She's family to us even if we don't like that, I repeat to you. Don't kill her or there's going to be more problems.\" she mutters to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm silent, not even making eye contact with her. She has a point, but at this point I don't really care. I'd blow up this building if it'd get me closer to finding Jenny, nothing else matters to me right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No promises, but you've said nothing about me beating the shit out of her.\" I mutter back, and then I proceed to get in the front passenger seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter buckling up we drive off into the streets of New York, Chon hands me the clothes and make up. \"I'm known to rouge witches, my red blindfold's a dead giveaway. I'm not gonna be able to sneak in the front Ryan, I think Hayley gave you this stuff to wear. Make infiltration easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo shit, Sherlock. I start applying the makeup and stick on the old beanie hat. Chon must sense how I'm feeling and says \"Remember to show restraint Ryan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn around in my seat and shot a glare at Chon, his eyebrows lowering under his blindfold. \"Restraint?!\" I hiss out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon's not backing down though, and he says to me \"How your acting reminds me of myself before I met you and the V twins. Have revenge yes, but show focus and discipline while doing so. Else you'll only lose yourself in the process.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFuck he's right, Chon usually is. I sigh heavily, and put my balled fists in front of my forehead. I think of Jenny, and what she must be going through right now. I just wanted a normal life, but the fucking magic and supernatural has to rear it's ugly head. And......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm thinking like Chon used to, I can't think like that. I need to remind myself that I'm the leader of my team, they look for me to guide them. More so considering we're saving one of our own, with that I give a determined expression and make sure to look the part of a young junkie in need of a fix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have arrived at the location, Carlson you will be dropped off here. I have scanned the building. One moment. Samantha is located on the top floor, the room at the far left. Carlson the window is open, what I recommend is the following. Chon take Ryan's katana and place it on the nearby roof, that way if the situation turns hostile Ryan can quickly summon his blade through the window. I'll drive around the block and meet you back here for extraction.\" Lunar explains. All without missing a beat, I love that. Light's got one heck of a partner, makes up for the fact he's book dumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going in, Chon make sure your in a good spot to interfere. One way or another Samantha is gonna squeal, even if she's turncoat. Good luck everyone.\" I say, giving a smile to both Chon and Lunar before leaving the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see the building ahead, it's showtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://c4.staticflickr.com/4/3672/10954541203_12fbc6b454_b.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://c4.staticflickr.com/4/3672/10954...</a></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryan's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've left the car, and sure enough no one's seen me do so. That's good, a hobo coming out a car into the building would look odd to be sure. I look like some young wino, the fact that I've not slept much in a while really adds to the effect. I have a really pissed look on my face, like I really just want to start busting stuff up. And I do believe me, Samantha better have spill her guts. Else I'm gonna spill them for her, I got a lot of pent up anger. And I just need one good reason to unleash it, and if she has gone turncoat then I'm gonna go for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for now I play it bogus, as of right now I'm just some junkie looking for a fix. And as I near the building I pretend to look hungry, and like I'm really down on my luck. Chon's probably found a good spot to stake out the place, he's an assassin of rouge witches after all. That man can track one through a crowded street and nip her in the bud before she can even begin a spell, his mastery of the art of chi is something that the western witches can't comprehend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he can't walk in here, his red blindfold makes him stand out too much for something as subtle as this. Chon could wear sunglasses but....I'm not actually sure what lurks under his blindfold, he's never spoke of it. There's probably nothing there, either way there's also the chance that the rouge witches here could know him by sight and appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look left and right, then knock on the door twice. I hear footsteps coming to the door, the slider opens and a pair of female eyes look right at me. Gazing and trying to gain my intent, but I'm great at poker. So I'm still in character.<br>\r\n\"You wanting a fix?\" she mutters to me. The tone is sultry, as if she's already trying to tempt me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, the kick. I need it! Like, really really badly.....\" I mutter back, my tone one of desperation. It's half fake and half truth. I'm desperate to act the part, and desperate to find Jenny. So perhaps that helps enhance my acting here, the slider closes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the door opens, the woman is average in height with brown hair. A typical American woman, only I know that she's a rouge witch. All the women here are, I'm only here for one though. That's the only reason I'm here, after this I might just burn the place down. Or maybe I just send another statement, me and Chon beat up all the rouges here. Tell them that we're coming for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don't entertain those thoughts anymore, but I'll rely on them for drive. I've kept up my persona so far, and I'm gonna keep it up with \"I-I want the best you've got, I can pay honestly.\" I show a large wad of dollars. I felt them in my pocket, Hayley stuck them there to help the image along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rouge witch takes them from my hand, and counts the money. It's legit it seems, I don't know much about US currency. But she looks up at me and smiles, saying \"Well your in luck, we've got a new upgrade to our hum drug. Head upstairs and to the left at the farthest door, that's where you'll taste salvation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thank you.\" I muttered, giving a nod of my head. Just need to behave like a good little bitch for a bit longer, when I find Samantha I'm gonna make her talk. I move up the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pass another junkie, laid on his left in the hallway. He clings to my left leg. \"S-Spare some change?\" he mutters to me. The guy seems out of it, I don't have time for this shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get some rehab fucker.\" I mutter, yanking my leg free. A furious look is on my face as I march down the hall, and then I reach the door. I knock twice, calmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door opens, and Samantha is there. Fucking perfect, that makes everything very easy for me. But there's just one problem, she seems to know who I am. Despite the makeup and shoddy clothes that I wear, her eyes tell me so. Samantha says nothing, she motions for me to enter. I hesitate, I don't know if this is a trap. But she's right here, I won't get another chance like this and time is short.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I move in, and Samantha closes the door behind me. The room looks like your typical drugs lab, and there's magic books and runes drawn about. I don't care right now, I've got an important matter to attend to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What brings you here Carlson? Sad you lost Jenny?\" she taunts. In an instant my body goes on instinct, I quickly swing my right arm. Punching her square in the jaw, she's surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI glare down at her, Samantha says \"You can't assault me! The witch laws will prosecute you for this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, guess Jenny is a bit of a sore spot for me. But let's keep this civil, the Harrisons sent me to you.\" I mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamantha then becomes more serious after hearing this, she doesn't seem to have expected this. She snaps her fingers and mutters under her breath, I get ready but she says \"I've cast a silence spell, we can talk in private here. What do you want Carlson?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jenny's been kidnapped, and is gonna be married off at the end of this week. You've been missing for some time, tell me what you know. And make it good.\" I say, I'm wasting no time in getting to the point. I don't have time for any bullshit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's in this for me? I'm just a quasi rouge, you think they trust me anymore than Elvira trusts me.\" she says, folding her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your record isn't looking good Samantha, it makes you suspicious. Tell me who would have the most to benefit from all of this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's to say it's rouge witches that are doing this? Maybe the chaotic scientists are also involved.\" Samantha says. She makes a good point, but she's not being helpful. And that's why I'm here, she needs to give me something useful. And I'm not leaving till I get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Names. I want the person who's responsible, you better give me something to go on. Or else.....\" I growl out. Taking steps towards Samantha, it's time to get serious here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suggest you back off Carlson, need I remind you that I've not been proven of any wrongdoings. Jenny's held your leash it seems.\" Samantha's not showing any fear. And I'm pissed off now, that's twice she's used Jenny against me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then in an instant I've got my blade quickly summoned, it flies through the open window in a heartbeat. And in a second afterwards I'm pressing the blade against the neck of Samantha, her eyes go wide in surprise. She's pinned to the wall, her face reflected in the blade's sheen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TELL ME WHAT I WANT TO KNOW!!!!!\" I scream out, moving the blade ever so close to her neck. It's enough to nick blood, Samantha winces in response to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really want to turn her into sashimi, she's scum. She knows it and I know it, the world could honestly be better without her. And then I.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStare into the window, it's glass is broken. And I see my reflection in it, shattered along with the window. And it's in this crucial moment that I realise how far I'm falling, without Jenny to hold onto. This isn't me, Chon's right. And he's probably watching right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I can't press any less on Samantha, I won't hurt her too much. I just need a name, something. Anything to go on, and it seems that after realising my falling fate smiles on me. Samantha says \"Elena Kurse! She said that she kidnapped a neko witch a few days ago, that's probably Jenny. Find Kurse and you'll find Jenny! Just let me go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remove my blade from her, swinging it down to wipe the blood off it. Azura is then sheathed. \"Consider washing yourself of this line, it'll be the death of you.\" I mutter. I can't show any emotion to her other than what I'm doing right now, she'll take it as a weakness and get to me. With that I make to leave. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>*Ryan's POV*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I or Light could talk any further, the doorframe was occupied by Jenny. Her small frame looked dwarfed to Light's 6'9 height, she appeared to be rather out of breath to say the least. Heavy panting, looking a little sweaty, hands on her knees the works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....*huff*...need to tell you something.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI instantly went over to Jenny and put a hand on her back.<br>\r\n\"Okay slow down Jenny, deep breaths and then tell me.\" I stated to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny gave a brief nod and then took my advice, standing up to her full 5'3 height and took a few breathers.<br>\r\n\"Mr Tanaka contacted me, he wants Light and you to head to the reception hall at once. He didn't give me any other details.\" Jenny said, a somewhat worried look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow why would the headmaster want me? Usually it was to handle some delicate matter, as I had the reputation of being someone one could trust. That I could understand, but why Light? Aside from the people in our dorm no one knew of Light's true identity, something bad was going to happen I could tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet what options do I have? I can't just say \"Fuck it, not my problem.\" Because it always wound up being my problem in one way or another. And now I could just tell this was going to spiral into something too, but again what choice did I have?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right come on Light, Jenny you stay here.\" I said, motioning for Light to follow me. He had a light frown on his face, but he followed my lead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe made our way out the dorm and through the grounds of the school, past several students of different years. As we were in the middle of summer during this period of time most were just wearing their shirts. I found myself tying my jumper around my waist, I often did that so I could sheathe Asura when I wanted to use my Iai-jutsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough we were in the entrance hall, near the reception. The place was arguably the most expensive place in the academy, what with red carpet and plush leather sofas. Wish we had that stuff in our dorm, nope we just plastic chairs and circular tables with which to eat corn flakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe saw Mr Tanaka, the headmaster of Starmage Academy. He was in his early 50's, small streaks of grey showing on his features. He was half native American and half Japanese, with a body built like a tank. Even with that black formal suit on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah you've arrived.\" he said to the pair of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So sir, what is it this time?\" I asked, I was half expecting him to say that there was an enemy that needed dealt with. But what he would say would be quite a shock, more for Light than me at any rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's...an odd woman who arrived at our school in the dead of night yesterday. She was swiftly detained by our prefects, however she's requested to meet someone named Light Killer.\" Mr Tanaka muttered to us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn's eyes went wide, mine's were as well. Only a handful of people, me and Tanaka included knew of his true identity. He had a cover story here that he had amnesia and took the name John Doe, and now someone who knew was here! This wasn't good, not good at all. Now you know why I go on about how I seem to be flung from one shitty situation to the next, why me?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then said \"So who is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr Tanaka sighed \"She claims to have been from the same place where Light was brought up, if this is true then she's either been involved in the project. Or....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was subject to testing, something that wouldn't be considered human.\" Light said, that was rather rare. Having him finish a sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright let's get this thing over with, so you know we can all get back to our lives.\" I muttered as Mr Tanaka made to open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be careful the pair of you, the prefects say they saw this girl flying. Without magic, and if she's got something to do with Light. That alone makes her dangerous.\" our headmaster muttered to both of us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight merely nodded, it was kinda hard to tell what he was thinking at this point in time. But then again aside from screaming fury, Light never really revealed much emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with that we went into the room, it was a lounge sort of place. With fancy leather sofas and round coffee tables.<br>\r\nBut that wasn't what caught our attention, no it was the woman sitting in the middle of one of the sofas. She was looking at us with a smile as she crossed her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight gave a small gasp, I thought to myself \"Jesus, she knows Light?!\" as we looked her over.<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/161/a/5/alisa_bosconovitch_new_cg_by_lin_jin17-d3iinjw.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/1...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, I am Lunar Messiah. It's a pleasure to finally meet you Light Killer, when do we commence our first mission?\" she asked, it was a pleasant voice right enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who....are you?!\" Light said, his hands going up to go through his dirty blonde mane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman, who I assumed to be called Lunar frowned. Almost as if she expected Light to know her.<br>\r\nBefore this got any more out of hand I stepped in and said \"Look, uh why don't you tell me who you are. And we'll see if Light remembers you then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and fiddled with one of the flowers in her hair \"Very well, please take a seat.\"</span></div></div>",

Nope not at all, to be honest I thought we were done with Light's past. We torched that place, anything we couldn't burn got smashed instead. So how'd she survive? And why did she want to meet Light? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay right, before we get started. I want to be clear on one thing. You're name is Lunar correct?\" I asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink haired girl nodded and said \"Yes that is correct, now I shall begin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may not look it but I am what you'd call a robot girl, although I am real enough fear not. I was created and placed into cryo-sleep several years ago, around the time you were born Light.\" Lunar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay now that was kinda odd, not the fact she was a robot girl. I'd seen plenty of those before in manga and what not, a real life one was rather shocking. But I've been thrown into a sea of madness ever since I got to this place. What was odd was how she was made around the time Light was born, but I thought robots were usually rather recently made. Even more so with a girl like this, God she might be prettier than Jenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carry on.\" I said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was placed into a deep sleep after being created, once Light had reached the age he is now I was to join him and carry out missions for our creators.\" Lunar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat seemed to have touched a nerve with Light, he promptly leaned forward and started glaring at Lunar.<br>\r\n\"I fuckin torched that place, you should have been dead by it. Anything we couldn't burn we wrecked.\" he muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was in the facility yes Light, however I was placed underground. To be awoken at a certain time, when your powers had grown enough. I would then become your partner, the one who would aid you during your missions.\" Lunar said, fiddling with a strand of her cotton candy hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold up, what do you mean by missions?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything our masters told us to do. Assassinations, kidnapping, demolishing etc.\" Lunar stated in a machine like tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But about me? I'm not a living weapon. I shall not fall to that fate.\" Light said, leaning back and crossing his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm also suppose to take orders from you Light, is there an overall mission you wish to achieve here?\" Lunar said, leaning forward. I had to keep my focus on her flowers, her leaning down and her dress didn't leave much to the imagination. And considering she really was from the same place as John Doe, yeah it wasn't wise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then leaned to Light and muttered \"This might be our chance, say you wish to graduate from this school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight noticed what I was getting at, he then stated \"Lunar, since I've arrived here I've felt happier than I've ever been. My goal is to graduate from this school, I want you to enlist as a student here. And reside in my dorm.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI inwardly sighed, it seemed Light had got the ball there right. Now to see if Lunar would agree or not.</span></div></div>",

Then I shall conform to your wishes, I will speak to the headmaster about enrolling in this school.\" Lunar said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell her no killing.\" I quickly muttered to Light's ear, just a precaution you understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And there's another rule as well Lunar, you are to slay no one. Otherwise the mission is over.\" Light said, I always assumed Light to be well....primal. Not dumb but like animal-ish, I can't recall the last time he washed his hair. Although we told him to bathe on a regular basis at least. But it showed he could think logically here, providing an incentive to make sure Lunar obeyed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood, however I trust I am permitted to use non-lethal force?\" the pink haired girl said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure, so go on and talk to the headmaster. Ryan, you might want to go back and tell the team.\" Light said turning to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded and made to stand up, Lunar then spoke \"Team? So this is not a mission you are handling alone then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI saw Light getting more annoyed, I'd have laughed if the situation weren't so important. But I kept a straight face and said \"Yeah, Light lives in a dorm with me. So you could say he's part of a team, will explain to you later. I have to go tell everyone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that I quickly left the room, not letting the pink haired girl get even a letter edgewise. I then shut the door behind me and gave a heavy sigh, Mr Tanaka came up to me and said \"How'd it go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well she's not hostile, but she plans to enrol here. In my dorm of course, at least we can keep better tabs on her. You know.\" I muttered, the headmaster gave a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew I could trust you with this, you've really got your Mother in you. I see to it she gets a uniform and timetable alongside the one you and Light have, here's hoping for the best.\" he said back to me. You gotta love that, a reasonable authority figure. Better for everyone that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with that I trudged back to my dorm, I nodded at Chon who was sitting on the couch with the V twins.<br>\r\n\"Everyone, I have some news to tell you all.\" I said as I entered and shut the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon turned the TV off with the remote in his hands, Charlie, Amy, Jenny looked at me.<br>\r\n\"What's it this time? Underground monsters? Time portal?\" Amy said, in her usual deadpan voice. She never took anything seriously, least on the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not that I'm afraid, now you all know about where Light is from yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A secret testing facility, but we blew it up.\" Jenny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but something survived. And that something has made it's way to our school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon stood up and said \"So why haven't we fought it yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI raised a hand up and said \"Easy Chon, remember fighting isn't always the answer. No it seemed that a woman was created in that lab, stored underground. Her purpose was to assist Light, and she's going to be a member of our dorm now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly Chon balked \"What?! Are you sure we can trust her? What if she ends up going on rampage or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kept my calm composure, I knew what Chon was thinking. \"Light has explicitly ordered her not to do so, although I'm sure she would fight if he was attacked. But other than that I don't think we can expect an attack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon was silent, I could tell he was thinking. I can't blame him, I'm still a bit surprised by it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a knock was heard at the door, I quickly moved to get it. And sure enough Lunar the pink haired girl was standing there with Light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak of the devil.\" I thought to myself. Motioning for the pair to come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone, this is Lunar Messiah. Our new dorm mate. Lunar I've explained the situation regarding you, although there might be questions that they have.\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded and said \"I shall do my best to answer any inquires you may have.\"</span></div></div>",

I was taking the time to size up my crew and the reactions on each of their faces. Chon looked concerned, Amy had a mix of concern and interest. Charlie and the V girls looked stunned, most likely cause of Lunar's pink hair. It kinda reminded me of cotton candy now that I think on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny leaned close to me, for security most likely. Chon was the first to speak up with \"Okay first off, how did you survive? The place where Light grew up was torched to ashes, how are you around then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To answer your question Mr Chon, I was placed in cryo sleep below the facility. I was to be awoken at a designated time when Light was to be deemed \"Suitable for missions.\" and my purpose is to assist him in his missions.\" Lunar stated, in a very polite tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your made to help Light in combat then what can you do?\" Jenny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am equipped with flight capability, I can recon over a large area and provide advice on the safest routes through an area. For combat I can sprout blades from my wrists or shoulders, my hands are also capable of accepting 9mm bullets for firing via the fingers. I am also have the search engine known as google built in.\" Lunar said as she tapped both sides of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just stood there, a bit dumbfounded. I thought I had seen it all, but I always keep getting taken aback. And not in a good way sometimes. Just who to heck were the people that created her and Light? I hope they don't try to \"Reclaim their research.\" I have enough shit on my plate just trying to pass my homework.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your a pretty lady!\" Viva exclaimed, seemingly not aware of the tense mood that had covered us. Although I was thankful for it at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then sighed and said \"Look people, we know how what happened. Lunar has agreed to stay at our dorm, to assist Light in graduation. And if her claims are true, then she can make a good aid to the team. Are their any objections?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was silent, although Chon said \"You better behave, that's all I'm saying.\" coming from Chon that was great. Usually he was all like \"Why should I let this witch live? Magic is a blight!\" etc etc. Perhaps it was because he was in front of the kids, parent of the year to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if that's all, let's enjoy the rest of our day. Chon put the TV back on.\" I muttered, Jenny had said not a thing. But merely cuddled up to me.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Light's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was not showing it, but inside I was a whirlwind of emotions. I thought I was done with my past, that place where I grew up had been fucking destroyed. Anything that wasn't burned was blown up, this girl...she had survived by being under the rubble, safe in an ice cube. I had my arms folded and just stood there till Ryan piped up with \"Hey Light, why don't you show Lunar around the school. It might help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bit my lower lip, had Ryan just said what I thought he did? I sighed, I couldn't argue with Ryan considering the debt I owed him. Besides he was correct, it would help prevent annoying questions later on. \"C'mon, follow me.\" I muttered, patting Lunar on the back of her school uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded and we left the dorm, and then she slinked her hand into mine. My eyes went wide and I looked at her. \"Uh...the hell are you doing?\" I said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is so I do not get lost, now please lead the way.\" she stated. I knew inwardly that Lunar probably wouldn't take no for an answer, this day just kept getting better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed and said \"Fine, just don't talk to other people right now. They might think the wrong thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what might that be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That we do things like Ryan and Jenny do, I think the meaning is dating or something....\" was she thick or something? It was probably because she's a robot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dating.....Ah the concept of courting another and engaging in foreplay. Why not? It could be useful as a cover for our identities.\" Lunar explained, no doubt using her \"Google database.\" to check on the meaning. It did sound like it could be useful, but I didn't want to think on it and just stand here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, if we say we are together and you\u2019ve just come here then people might get concerned that something is up.\u201d I growled out, letting go of Lunar\u2019s hand as I did so. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the pink haired girl stopped walking for a second before nodding and said \u201cI understand, please accept my apologies.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI just wanted to get this over with, I clicked my tongue and said \u201cJust come on, curfew will be on and we can\u2019t walk around during it.\u201d Lunar took this as a motion to follow me, we walked in silence for a wee bit down a stone path from our dorm. There were other dorms that looked just like ours, it was where the students stayed. My room was\u2026well I didn\u2019t tidy it for a good while to be honest, but I\u2019m messy by nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo we walked towards the large building at the end of this stone path, past the pristine grass lawns in front of it. The building looked old but well looked after, like a fine wine Ryan would tell me.<br>\r\n\u201cSo you came here last night yeah?\u201d I asked, not looking at her cause I didn\u2019t want to give anything away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I was using my flight mode to scout the location. Whereupon I was caught by the security forces that you refer to as prefects. After a minor battle I was blindsided and shot down, I then woke up in a room with shackles that I couldn\u2019t break. I complied with the headmaster of this school, figuring it best to cooperate to locate you. Then you and your leader arrived and you know the rest.\u201d Lunar explained, it was all\u2026..machine like. Like she was firing off a series of facts to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI merely just grunted, I then had a thought and decided to voice it to Lunar with \u201cHang on, if you can fly. Then why do you need me to show you around? Haven\u2019t you seen all the buildings?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, but I have yet to see their internal structure.\u201d Lunar had retorted back to me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood there for a couple of minutes and then nodded, she made a fair point. With that I said \u201cWell you\u2019ve probably seen the entrance hall, I\u2019ll take you to the literature building.\u201d<br>\r\nThe building in question had about 4 floors, and was about the size of a football field. It had several windows as well, I saw this place as an enemy to be honest. I was still learning to read and write, but with Lunar perhaps I can get it done more easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo this is the literature building, the first floor covers math\u2019s. Then it\u2019s English, and then History and then it\u2019s uh\u2026.Languages. I\u2019ll just show you the first floor, they all look the same anyway.\u201d I said, opening the double doors for both of us. True enough there were about five classrooms that I could see, and I knew there were about five more to the left. I motioned for Lunar to take a peek in one, neatly placed tables and chairs. Fucking gripping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext.\u201d I said, I took Lunar by the hand and walked out the building. I could tell there were people looking at us, a few guys too. Although none of them knew me, so they didn\u2019t want to test me. Now off to the next one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a small building, with a rectangle shape and red bricks. Outside was several sport fields.<br>\r\n\u201cIn case you can\u2019t already tell this is the sports place, here things from football to martial arts happen here. They won\u2019t let us into the building unless a teacher is nearby, magic barrier. So don\u2019t get any funny ideas, you can go in there tomorrow.\u201d I said to the pink haired girl, she merely nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then lead her to a large building, it looked like some large tower converted into a learning center.<br>\r\n\u201cThis is the library, any book you need you can get here. And if it\u2019s not they know where it can be found. Come on.\u201d I said to Lunar, I actually enjoyed this place. I was still learning on how to read and write, considering I\u2019d lived most of my years as a highwayman. Least that\u2019s what Ryan said I was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStay quiet.\u201d I muttered to Lunar, the librarians here could be quite annoying if you didn\u2019t follow the rules. Although I was confident I could handle them if need be, but I wasn\u2019t going to start any fights for sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe library was large and grand, with bookcases taller than I was. And there were several old tables and chairs, with several students around. Lunar walked ahead of me to look at some of the books, I wanted to stay and read too. At least as best I could. But there were other things I had to show her, and it needed to be done today as school started tomorrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon.\u201d I muttered out, grabbing her once again. The last building was probably the oldest out the lot, it clearly looked aged to be sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd this is the last one, the magic and science department. One half of it is for science and technology and the other is for magic practicing and other shit.\u201d I said to her. Out of all the buildings this was the one I disliked the most, it looked fine but\u2026.magic and science don\u2019t\u2019 mix. Like magic and armor, like Chon and witches and\u2026..I\u2019ll just stop here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I said science and technology Lunar perked up and said to me \u201cCan I use these facilities to upgrade myself?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had a rather contorted glare on my face, I shook my head and said \u201cUh no Lunar, we can\u2019t have everyone knowing that you\u2019re a robot. It could\u2026.jeopardize the mission.\u201d I didn\u2019t want to get into any trouble, at this rate Lunar was being more of a liability than anything else. But I\u2019m sure if anyone could smooth this over it\u2019d be my boss Ryan, he could do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then I saw a couple of familiar girls walk past, it was Charlie\u2019s older twin Sisters. I forgot their names but I hated their guts. From what I remember their Mother had been a part of the witch coven that killed Chon\u2019s Brother, now Chon had chosen to spare the woman. Charlie and his Sisters were sent here, the girls were being given a chance to not end up like their Mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I could tell it wasn\u2019t working, they still hunted the poor kid every chance they got. Despite getting beaten up more than once for it. Just then they noticed me with Lunar, and then\u2026.. </span></div></div>",

Bastards, the stuff they did to Charlie was just cruel. Granted I've heard that it gives magic resistance and all that, but when I was growing up I learned there's a fine line between cruel to be kind and just plain fucking cruel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh look, it's the big dirty mongrel!\" Rose said, she was the one with the higher pitched voice. The pair stood there, grinning like hyenas. I wish they were so I could kill and eat them, and get away with it. But alas can't do stuff like that, British magic immunity and all that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this, is the big idiot playing with a doll? Awww.\" Carla said, I could taste the mocking in her voice. I snarled and went to go for them, I knew I couldn't start a fight. But maybe breathing down their neck would cause a fright or two, they had bark but no bite. Once you got to them they folded like pound notes, even Amy had some backbone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunar stopped me though, and then closed her eyes. A few seconds later she said \"Rose and Carla Ren, your Mother is known as a rouge witch. Someone who disregards the laws of magic use, you have a younger Brother called Charlie.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh the little doll is smart, who are you bitch?\" Rose said, getting right up to Lunar and poking her in the chest. I had figured that was enough, and decided to weigh in on her. Maybe I can get away with chomping on her ear perhaps?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lunar kept going with \"My name is Lunar, I am a new student here. And I believe you require a proper punishment, allow me to give one to you.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime had slowed down at that point, I saw Lunar placing her arm in front of her. And then suddenly half of a black steel blade appeared out of her wrist, my eyes bulged out at this. But Rose took it worse, she passed out from the sheer shock of it. I could understand that, but I was fine due to knowing about Lunar earlier today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla was stunned by this, and Lunar took advantage of it. Only instead of using her powers to shred the bitch into oblivion, she grabbed Carla's underwear with her other hand and yanked up. Giving her a harsh shove to the ground near her Sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took that as the cue to get the hell out of dodge, before any more shit happened to us. It was Lunar's first day and already she had started something, fucking brilliant. So ignoring the crater before us, I rushed away holding Lunar by the arm.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ryan's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was supposed to be just another day of school, learn stuff and not be involved in any supernatural world terrorist actions. Or at least be assumed to be involved in. Yeah just have a day at school. I didn't expect to be driving a motorbike at over 100mph fleeing from witches on broomsticks in the dead of night, my uniform in tatters and Azura strapped to my back. The rain battering down hard on my hair and eyes, my teeth gritted and clenched while blood drips from my lips. All I cared about was fleeing, then coming up with a plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what happened was........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a bombing, at a witch school. Long story short its been pinned on me, they have footage of me placing the explosives somehow. That's all I know, next thing I know is the Rogue Witch police are hunting me. It was 7PM then, in a split second I summoned Azura and attacked them. I know I'm innocent, but they held their weapons against me. I fled the dorms, I don't know where my friends are. In the confusion I ran into the nearby forest. With its thick trees and canopies it made for good cover, I recalled Chon had left a motorbike in the woods. Just in case he always said. Good a time as any, I get on board it and start driving. I head north, the Rogue Witches give chase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm simply acting on instinct at this point, Azura's mental voice speaks to me in a roar \"My Lord! What is happening?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm on the fucking run Azura, protect me!\" I yell out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's all the indication he needs. His blade activates and surrounds me, blocking their spells from reaching me with his barrier powered by his will to protect. The rain is getting too much for me now, eventually I don't notice that barrier........<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn slow motion the road vanishes, time slows down. Azura moves close to me, the flat of his blade catches me from hitting that cliff too badly. I still plummet down hard, my body hits rocks, twice. Then crumples into what feels like sand, the bike lands nearby and explodes in a heap......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIs this the end? I feel weak, the blood pooling around me. My head feels split in two. Azura nears me, I can actually see his spirit. He looks just like Sho but older with a beard. I see the Rogue Witches land near me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is he dead?\" one of them says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAzura nears me and says \"My Lord, hold and do nothing. I will slow your heart beat.......\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel it, I have an idea and Azura knows it. Chon taught me a technique to slow one's heart through a yoga technique. I meditated, felt my own pulse dwindle. They look at me with a flashlight, eventually they say \"I think so.......You stay here and guard the body, we'll report back to Elvira!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that all but one of them fly away, the one left looks at me. Before muttering \"Scum, witchkind will be better off without a monster like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remain motionless, eventually she moves away. To check on the wreckage of Chon's bike, in that instant it's all I need. Azura channels his energy into me, I find the strength to stand up. I drive the hilt of Azura's sword into the back of her head. She grunts and slumps to the sand in a heap, now I can get to work in getting out of here. Wherever I go next that is........</span></div></div>",

I start to get a move on, its only a matter of time before those witches come back. I didn't kill that one, last thing I need is to not help my case further. I see a clearing ahead, with a path. I wheeze inwardly, I count at least one broken rib on my end. Thankfully no limbs are broken, but I feel something's broken inwardly. I'm not gonna survive long if I don't get treatment I worry. Azura can stabilise me for the most part but he can't heal broken ribs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a deep breath as best I can, then prepare to move into the clearing. I heft Azura and mutter to him to guide me forward. I see a faint blue wisp on the floor. I walk towards it. Azura's senses are far greater than mine, so he'd likely sense people far ahead. Each step feels heavy, like my guts are made of lead or something like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoughing blood, I stagger forward. No way I'm going out here, I'm not giving those bastards the satisfaction. Its then I hear a voice. \"Ryan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know it, I see him. \"C-Chon......\" I mutter, he must have tracked me somehow. Still wearing the uniform. He quickly moves to help me, putting my arm over his back. I grunt and wince heavily. Chon quickly puts his other hand to my chest, I see a faint blue light emerge from it. This is the art of Chi Healing, Chon can promote a body to heal at a much faster rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel my blood coagulate faster, the bones are knitting. I feel sedated, just a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang in there Ryan, I've found a cave we can hide in. Quite hidden off, we can camp out there till this rain blows over.\" he says, I nod. I move as much as I can with him so that we can get there quicker. A good long walk takes us through trees, clearings and eventually a path tucked away that leads to a small cave entrance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short while later he takes me in there, we get a fire going. Though I can't exactly do much with how I am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening?\" I mutter as I lie down slowly, thankfully Chon seems to have brought a bag of stuff including a couple of blankets. We're wrapped up in one each, the fire goes strong at least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know Ryan, your wanted by all witches. Even rogues are getting in on this it seems, me and the rest of the group have scattered. They're saying we're accomplices to you bombing a witch school somehow.\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know where the rest of the gang is?\" I say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Lunar managed to connect us all to her. Private network stuff. I've messaged I've found you, Light and her will be on their way.\" Chon says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's a relief. We've got a plan of sorts at least. I grunt as I feel my wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take it easy, Ryan get some sleep. I'll put out the fire and keep watch for a bit.\" he says, I simply nod and let sleep wash over me....... </span></div></div>",

Like I'm so burnt out I can't help but sleep, I don't dream. My body has just shut down at this point, Chon is keeping watch I'm sure. I'll let him do that. My thoughts had drifted briefly to my mum and Jenny. But that was all before I blacked out......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm prodded awake after I don't know how long, I jerk upwards and shoot my eyes open. Chon is there, as are Light and Lunar. Light isn't wearing his usual uniform, instead a black leather jacket and grey shirt with black leather pants and black sneakers. Lunar still wears that dress of hers. We've got duffel bags around us too it seems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Boss, I'm so glad your alright.\" Light says with a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nod to him, wondering what to say. Images of what happened last night flow into my mind, I just want to think I'm dreaming and I'll wake up again and go to class. But I know that won't happen, I've got a job to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So. What do we know?\" I say as I get up and stretch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunar says \"Well currently we are all wanted, every witch police officer in the world is ordered to either arrest or cripple or kill us on sight. Rogue witches are apparently getting involved with this too, supposedly they had relatives that were harmed in the bombing. No announced fatalities so far.\" the robot girl conjures up a virtual copy of the magazine article.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they don't want to induce further panic, regardless if there is even one.....\" Chon says trailing off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight then says \"For fuck's sake Ryan's innocent! How the hell did this happen?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting my lower lip I think to myself. Azura reaches out to me mentally with \"My Lord I'm thinking, we must find the true guilty party and bring them to justice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Azura's saying we need to find the true culprit.\" I say aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon nods and says \"Well we need to try and assemble the rest of our team as well. We'll need transportation as well, we can't rely on outside sources like our friends and family. No doubt witchkind have already followed up on those things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn an instant I mutter \"Oh no, Mum.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight puts a hand on my shoulder and say \"Ryan if they hurt her in any way I'll tear them limb from limb I can say that right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd do far, far worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's the rest of the team?\" I say, changing the subject to better keep my mind focused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLunar interjects with \"Amy and Jenny took the kids and fled, Sho was already on his way back from Asia and should be near the mainland within a few hours. He's slept on the plane too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to all meet up, get a base of operations and go from there.\" I get an idea......I did finish my driving licence test recently. I then say \"We can use a caravan, head around Britain. If we need to travel abroad we can try and get someone to ferry us. For now let's.......</span></div></div>",

John was at his podium giving his speech about how men and women are equal.<br>\r\nJust then he noticed a gleam in a window on a nearby building. \"John duck!\" he yelled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan dashed towards John just as he got near a loud 'BANG!' was heard and Ryan fell down.<br>\r\nHis Mother and many people were screaming. \"Ryan!\" his Mother yelled as she rushed to her Son's side.<br>\r\nJohn knew that someone tried to murder him, just then he remembered he knew the name Ryan before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you Ryan Carlson?\" he asked as he knelt down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan was only able to nod as he was in too much pain to talk. His Mother was crying over his body.<br>\r\n\"Miss Carlson hold on, I can save him.\" John said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn quickly put a needle in Ryan's back. After a few seconds Ryan was able to stand back up. Not only that<br>\r\nbut his wound healed up quickly. \"What was that?\" Ryan asked as he rubbed his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nanite injection, it's a small healing factor.\" John explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ryan's Mother or John could say a thing Elvira and John's Mother arrived with a small girl. \"We have the suspect right here. You just wanted to kill him again Ms Hilary?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe small girl huffed, she tried to shoot John with a gun in a witch test a few months back.<br>\r\nRyan was about to walk up and smack her when John stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon she tried to kill you just now?\" Ryan said with barred teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn shook his head \"It ain't worth it Ryan, besides she will be going to court.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira frowned \"I thought you would forgive her John.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn turned and sighed \"I would've but she shot Ryan and not me. It's in your court Ryan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan was going to attack Hilary, but then he sighed and said \"Take her away, I think she can practice her snipeing from a nice prison window.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvria nodded and the two of them teleported away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom can I have a word with John alone please?\" Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded and said \"Let's go have some tea for old times eh Natalie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Harrison smiled and said \"I'd like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they walked off Ryan said \"What a way to meet huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn nodded \"I must admit that was some entrance Ryan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah so what now?\" Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn smiled and said \"Let's go for a walk and catch up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to present:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I get it.\" Mel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan nodded and rubbed his back. \"That healing factor still works sometimes.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn offered his hand. Ryan shook it and Jenny walked up to them.<br>\r\n\"Why were you not trying Ryan?\" she teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know why Jenny? Just can't smack around a good guy now can I?\" Ryan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll four of them laughed as....</span></div></div>",

He looked down to see a flash grenade on the grass. He tried to close his eyes to avoid the shock but it was too late. He was blinded and quickly found himself on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis vision went back to normal as he looked up at the afternoon sun. \"Did you Judo toss me again?\" he asked Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope that was the way of the ninja pal.\" Ryan said as he helped light killer up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still you did good.\" Ryan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight nodded and said \"Still need to pay more attention it seems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which....\" he said as they saw....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And it amazed me how this normally bookish and quiet girl could carry the voice of an angel from heaven. Ave Maria made it all the more fitting when you know what the lyrics are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Jenny finished the whole ballroom erupted in applause, Jenny smiled and bowed before going off the stage.  Taking a seat next to me, I wrap my fingers around hers. Turning my head to crack a grin the likes of the Cheshire cat, Jenny winks in response to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then I notice that people are getting up, I see Charlie entering the ballroom. Chon's kids with him, Viva and Vogue holding both of his arms. The kid's in a black tux, with the girls in white dresses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shouldn't you three be in bed by now?\" I ask, raising an eyebrow as they walk over to my table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie smiled and said \"Well Chon said we could, it's alright though isn't it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh that smile, the kid is pure gold. How can I say no?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ruffle his hair and say \"Enjoy yourself then, play nice girls. Charlie's only one guy.\" I look at Viva and Vogue as I say that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls in turn lean in on Charlie's shoulders and say in unison \"Oh we will Ryan, come on Charlie! Let's see if we can find some people to do the dashing white sergeant with!\" with that they drag the kid away from me. Although Charlie turns his head and lets out a smile towards me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn to see Chon, he's fuming over the \"Dance\" he had with Amy. They fight all the time, the fact our dorm hasn't been torn down yet is a bloody miracle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Jenny stands up, as I hear music start to play. Other couples, John and Megan as well as Harry and Mel start to stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no....\" I think to myself as I hear the music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXZ618pU_0\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXZ618p...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Ryan, let's dance!\" Jenny said, tugging at my wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sigh, I look around. Everyone's getting into it, I'm afraid of making a fool out of myself and Jenny. After that perfect singing she just did, we'd most likely end the night on a foul note. I mutter \"I can't dance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny rolls her eyes and says \"Please Ryan, do it for me. I don't care if you suck at ballroom dancing, your the best man I've ever known. When I see you I feel that the impossible can be achieved. So come on, and no arguing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that my darling tugs on my sleeve a bit more forcefully, I sigh. Let the babe have the bottle, how bad can it be?<br>\r\n\"Okay, I'll follow you.\" I mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that I stand up, looking around I witness Lunar talking with Light. No doubt telling him how to go about the dance movements, Lunar's a robot so she's probably got a database of dance moves in there somewhere. Oh how I wish I could walk over to her and get advice, but no I'm gonna have to wing it in my usual fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe and my darling kitten step into an open spot on the ballroom floor, my heart is pounding. I've never done this shit before in my life. It's funny. I've learned of the supernatural, and seen and done things I'd never thought possible. And yet here I am, getting worried about trying to do ballroom dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now put your arm here.\" Jenny said, I let her sort out my arms and that. Once we start moving I'll be able to catch on quick and do what everyone else is doing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sure enough I'm decent at it, Jenny is my soulmate. So we have that going for us, maybe it just comes natural to true lovers. I cast glances to what's going on around us after getting the hang of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy's sitting down, fuming at Chon as per usual. Chon meanwhile is kindly dancing with Vouge, like a caring Father with a daughter. He's even smiling warmly, yep that's right. Viva was the lucky one and was dancing with Charlie, casting a smug look to Vouge as if to say \"I'm dancing with our boyfriend and your not so hah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight and Lunar, are doing somewhat okay. Granted Light's huge compared to the doll that is the robot girl, but Lunar uses precision and grace. And Light's just going with the flow. The guy just doesn't suit the tux though, good thing it's all black otherwise his tattoos would glow out from under it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMe and Jenny continue the motions, and now I can only focus on her. Time seems to slow as we bring each other close, and we see a shooting star fly past thanks to the glass ceiling atop the ballroom. Followed shortly by fireworks, I look at my darling kitten and smile. She grins and kisses me on the cheek.</span></div></div>",

Ever since he had left Japan he had been kidnapped and taken captive.<br>\r\nThey were witches, that much he could know for certain. He shivered as he felt a chill on his bare chest.<br>\r\nHe would have rubbed it but it would sting. For he had been tortured by the use of lightning not too long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wtich guard walked up to his cell door and said \"You have a visitor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard left to allow John to walk in.<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Ryan asked.

You may not have known it. But the person who gave you this food is your old penpal named John.<br>\r\nI gave you something along with your food. Do you have a good idea on how to use it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan shook his head. \"Now I know you. What's next? Am I going to use a cardboard box to sneak past them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided it was his best bet. If he could just get the guard close enough then he could knock them out with no problem. He grabbed the bottle of ketchup.<br>\r\nHe then squirted it on him and the floor to make it look like blood. The 17 year old then made a loud scream as fell to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard stormed in and said \"What the? Did he kill himself?\"<br>\r\nShe slowly walked forward checking his body. He then lept up and grabbed her head. He connected with his forehead and she turned<br>\r\naround. Ryan then grabbed her and did a German suplex to knock her out. He checked her body, \"A keycard, can't use that wand. Ah she's got a stun gun!\" he said as he tied it to his hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then got out the cell and locked it. He then began to plan his next move.</span></div></div>",

I mean he's just looking into nowhere away from everyone else.\" Mel asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's the thing. Most boys I know are all talk and not listening. Ryan's not like that, he takes time out to hear what people<br>\r\nhave to say. When he does talk it's always important, no matter what he always says something good.\" Jenny explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like a hero.\" Mel said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny shook her head \"Trust me, Ryan always says that he's no hero. He says all the heroes he knows are either not real or dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel gave an odd look at that. \"How do you know all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny smiled and said \"I'm the only one he talks to about these sorts of things. He says that magic left him disillusioned with the world and life itself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMel grinned and said \"Sounds like a poet Jen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

I'm Hannah Harrison.\" Softly, she said. \"I had to get special permission to come meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded in greeting. Hannah was the youngest sister of my pen pal, John Harrison who had been dubbed the 'pseudo witch' due to his science that mimics magic. It seemed that his family was full of surprises as Hannah was found to have surprisingly strong magic for her age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would have appreciated a call first.\" Politely, I said. \"I have classes in less than an hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, dean Elvira appeared behind Hannah. She was a tall and slender 34 year old woman with shoulder length dust blond hair and ocean blue eyes that seemed to dance in the dim light. She had been appointed dean of Starmage Academy by the head witch, Elvira Strange who had every trust in her abilities. Mr Tanaka, the former head of the school took the chance to retire from the job. Ryan still kept in contact with him, he viewed the man as the Father figure he never had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We apologize for the short notice, Mr Carlson.\" Kindly, she said. \"However, due to the fact Hannah is the granddaughter of the head witch, the transfer had to be kept secret. The head witch, Elvira Strange has requested you be her body guard as you are a trusted friend of her grandson, John Harrison.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI inwardly moaned, hearing that as Elvira handed me Hannah's profile folder. She sensed my discomfort and lightly touched my shoulder. \"Hannah has greatly matured over the last year.\" Assuring me, she said. \"All you need to do is keep an eye on her during classes. She has a body guard detail for her dorm room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed but nodded. I was not exactly thrilled with watching over a little girl but this request came from the head witch herself. No was not an option in this case. \"Who is her body guard while in her dorm? If I am to be an effective body guard, I need to know all of the facts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira smiled. \"Her body guard while in her dorm is...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They were very talented witches, there was no question about that but they were no older or experienced than Hannah herself. \"Madam dean, is that really wise?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone else would be aggravated to tears, watching over a hyperactive little girl.\" Amused, she said. \"Viva and Vogue are well trained and they are just as hyperactive. They will get along just fine.\" She chuckled. \"Chon Kay is not exactly thrilled with the idea.\" She then turned serious. \"All of this had been preset by Elvira Strange; these orders come directly form her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, looking at Hannah who seemed to have become slightly nervous. \"Why now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira closed the door to my room and waved her hand. I could sense a powerful magic and realized that she had sealed the room for privacy. She then gave me a deadly serious look; what she was about to say held a lot of weight so I braced myself for the briefing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah has been dubbed the junior head witch due to her incredible magical powers.\" Softly, she began. \"This is a new position of which Hannah watches over the young witches of the world. It bears a great responsibility of which she will eventually grow up to become the next head witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's unique.\" Surprised, I said. \"Only I thought that the eldest male was transformed into a girl to be dubbed the next head witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would exclude those born in the UK and other pocketed regions of the world.\" Serious, Elvira replied. \"The laws had to be modified to be fair to everyone. Even so, John Harrison has been dubbed this world's head mad scientist so he is automatically out of the running.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was a shock to me. John Harrison had wrote that a great honor had been bestowed upon him but he never mentioned this! \"What of Hayley or Mel?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hayley is this world's witch ambassador.\" Calmly, Elvira replied. \"It is a position of great responsibility as she must keep the peace between witches and mad scientists.\" She smiled. \"Things will be much easier now that her brother is the head mad scientist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, remembering the war between the two powers. It became so intense that everyone born in the UK was immune to most, if not, all forms of transformational magic and science. \"I take it Mel is out of the running as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira sighed. \"Mel has been bonded to Harry Rich.\" Serious, she replied. \"They are now the members of the Watchmen, a very selective group.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The who?\" Raising an eyebrow, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Watchmen are people of all walks of life who are aware and immune to magic and mad science.\" Calmly, Elvira replied. \"They act as private investigators for both sides. Another method of keeping the peace as they help keep young witches and mad scientists in line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not a matter of lack of options.\" Annoyed, Hannah said. \"I worked hard to earn this honor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one is questioning that, dear.\" Patiently, Elvira said. \"We are merely giving Mr Carlson all of the facts so he can perform his duties to their fullest.\" She sighed, turning to me. \"This is a new position; one that alarms some of those dear to the old ways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You believe some may try to bully her into stepping down.\" Concerned, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira waved her hand, causing Hannah to fall to the floor, unconscious. I glanced at her then turned back to Elvira, surprised. Only I inwardly moaned as she explained, \"For now, her position is purely symbolic with no real power. It is a test on Hannah and the witch council.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis did not impress me at all. \"You are using a child as bait for this test?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The head witch is using her granddaughter as bait for this test.\" Patiently, Elvira countered. \"This is a double test, Mr Carlson.\" She drew in a breath. \"The purpose of this is to test if Hannah will be able to resist using her position to gain what she wants in life. It is also to test if the witch council had learned their lesson from testing John Harrison with his power of science that mimics magic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remembered John writing about the cruel tests he had endured to prove he was able to use his powerful science safely and remain male rather than the next head witch. Now it was Hannah's turn and I was thrown into the middle of it with my friends. <i>\"Damn, this sucks!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty minutes later....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nothing really strenuous and the teachers are cool, and it's just things like plain ol English and Maths and what have you. Stuff that's normal, which I can totally get behind. We just need to babysit Hannah for a while, should be easy. It won't be for long I till myself, just need to keep her out of trouble in the first place and then there's no problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough myself and Jenny and the older members of the dorm don't have the same classes as Hannah and Chon's daughters, given that we're in our teens. No matter though, the school's not that big enough. Anyway classes go by simply enough, I have no problem with anything. And the good thing is if any of us don't understand something Lunar can use her robot nature to tell in an easy to understand manner too! Either way it's impossible to lose, awesome for us. Essential for Light, the guy is pretty brick thick. Though he once punched a tree so hard it turned into a book filled with pages of the letters OW! I ain't joking on that one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell rings, and I promptly get packed up and begin to head out. We've got lunch break now for the day, Chon and co are heading outside. But something's not right, call it my intuition. I decide to check on the class that Hannah was in, I know Charlie's timetable and he's in the same class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough I'm walking with Jenny and in the hallway I see Hannah walking briskly with Viva and Charlie, from a taller girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey get back here you runt, I'm talking to you!\" she says. I think I know her, not personally but I've heard of her. Kristy Hart, some kind of cheerleader. Right bitch too from what I'm told, and she's seemingly intent on making a statement to Hannah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignore her Hannah.\" Viva says as she makes eye contact with me, no doubt feeling relief inwardly that I'm here now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! Looks like the runt of the Harrison pack has some fleas to cover herself.\" Kristy sneers, wow. Not even Charlie's older Sisters were this unsubtle, I simply frown at her words. No doubt she's trying to harass Hannah by playing the old she's the youngest Sister and therefore lowest in level card. Times like this I'm glad I'm an only child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before I step in though I see a figure walk past me, I have to admit I'm surprised to see him here right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sho?\" I ask, he turns his head to me and nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man is Japanese, one can tell from his hair and skin tone. He might look like a young exchange student, but make no mistake. He's far older than he looks though, Sho was apparently an officer in the Japanese Self Defence Force when it was first founded. And he's related to Azura, the same sprit that lurks inside my katana. They look quite similar save for Azura sporting longer hair and some stubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough Gaijin. Stand down.\" Sho said, he's right up to Kristy with his arms folded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKristy tries to stare into Sho's soul but he's having none of it, that old Zanshin stuff Sho has means he's not very easily shaken. Even when he was brought out of that block of ice and into our supernatural world he adapted fairly quickly, didn't take kindly to the fact that he was frozen for over 50 years and his faction forgot about him though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally it seems this bitch gets the message, she scowls and turns around and storms off. Sho simply huffs and cracks his neck, no doubt he wasn't fazed in the least by her. What the hell is she doing here anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Vogue?\" Jenny asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nipped to the bathroom, Hannah are you okay?\" Viva asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah simply nods before saying \"Yeah I guess, what did I ever do to her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrug and say \"Sometimes people just don't like others, that's the kind of person that isn't worth a thing.\"</span></div></div>",

Still, I had to ask as it was my job to keep the kid safe. Later on, I asked Sho what he made of Hannah and her new role in the witching world. Sho sighed before turning to me, serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that I can sense power from a person.\" Calmly, he said. \"Hannah's power is nearly 'off the charts' by what I understand magic to be.\" He gazed over at Hannah who was busy talking to Viva and Vogue then turned back to me. \"Hannah is obviously a very powerful witch though she is not yet aware of this herself yet. I suspect that this friend of hers is partially to thank for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you say that?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hannah allowed it to slip that this Mike Cutie as not magical but yet there is something about him that needs to be kept secret.\" Serious, Sho said. \"My guess is that Mike has the ability to enhance others gifts; in this case, Hannah's magic. It's rare but I have seen this happen first hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That complicates things.\" Wincing, I said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I perform well regardless however, indeed I've discovered powers of my own. Combined with my mastery of karate, I regularly spar with Chon and Huanle. The pair show the exemplary martial arts of China indeed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan sometime later approached me in our dorm, I greet him with a bow. No matter what I always make sure my uniform is well presented. \"How goes it Carlson-sama?\" I ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm well, but I have a mission for you Sho. We've gotten reports of a Neko Witch in town, she's been causing a ruckus. Lunar's located her to a mansion, I'd like you to get her brought before Elvira here and be reminded of the fact she needs to be a student here.\" Ryan said leaning on the wall of my bedroom. My place is neat, not a speck of dust to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood, I'll depart now. You've made a file for me I take it?\" I say rising up and donning my electric gloves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan hands me a thin file and says \"We've established she's a Neko Witch, Lunar managed to produce a picture of her. She's been sighted at a rundown mansion on the outskirts of Edinburgh. Head there at once please and stay safe.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI salute and depart, a quick use of the Starmage teleporter and I find myself five minutes away from the mansion Ryan mentioned, I quickly purse through the file.

The greenery around it seems tended to somewhat, indicating someone is likely living here. There was a dried up fountain in the centre, I walk past it when suddenly I hear a meow noise. I quickly turn to it, energy crackling from my fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly to find a stray cat, it looks at me then proceeds to walk away. It then turns to look at me, as if to indicate I should follow. This is likely a trap, but traps work both ways. I walk towards it and we come to the door, the cat slides through a flap. I open it with a loud creaking noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entrance hall is dusty, the drapes cover almost all the windows. But what strikes me here is the entrance hall is filled to the brim with cat themed objects and statues. Also suddenly over 20 cats leap down from the floor above and file up at the front of the steps.I flex my fingers in preparation of a fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen suddenly I hear the clacking noises of heels on what is most likely marble flooring. From the shadows of the upper floor emerges the girl, 18 or so. I estimate her height to be about 5'5, dressed in an elegant gothic dress with a opera mask covering her features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my, look what the cat dragged in.....\" she says in a voice as smooth as velvet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm straight to the point. I state to her \"My name is Shomei Akatsuki. Identify yourself at once Neko Witch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pouts and takes off her opera mask, her tail swishing behind her. \"You've got some nerve, striding in here demanding answers. Fine, I'm Kath Lancaster. What brings you to my humble abode?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs before I get to it \"You've been causing disruptions and must register as a student with Starmage Academy, come with me at once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know I'm in hostile territory, Kath has the home field advantage. No doubt these cats might be magically empowered by her, but my spirit powers will make me untouchable.......</span></div></div>",

And a part of me really wants to be there with you and I geuinely care about your well being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChirs opened her mouth quite a bit in surprise. She then began to smile as she said \"Well it looks like I have a knight in shining armor.\"<br>\r\nRyan and Jenny smiled in response to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexander gave a grin then bit his lower lip. \"Are you still wanting to hang out with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris got out of her seat and Alexander did the same. She then placed her right hand on his cheek and smiled.<br>\r\n\"Well....You've been very sweet. Not to mention you do look quite cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then quickly pecked Alexander on his left cheek and walked off saying \"Don't think I'm gonna make it easy for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexander smiled and walked after her muttering \"Was not planning on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny smiled as she held Ryan's hand. \"Let's get back to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan nodded and said \"Hope Juan ain't gonna mind Alexander.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think he will be okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah trust me.\" Ryan said.</span></div></div>",

Any evil witch that was in front of him was often later scrapeing themselves from the floor when he was done with them. If they were still alive at that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are in for a big surprise if they anger him.\" suppressing a shiver, Chris said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" curious, Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom doesn't know this, I'm trying to help him.\" to Ryan's frown, Chris replied. \"Juan has a dark temper which brings out his true madness.\" she gulped. \"Its like another persona altogether; he calls it Dark Juan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sound like someone we know.\" darkly, Chon remarked. \"Dark Ryan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, why is a mad scientist doing at Starmage Academy?\" pointing a wand at Juan, Rose asked. \"Why are you not attending Eligere Sententia boys boarding school?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I know.\" smiling, Carla said. \"He's American, meaning he is not immune to TG spells. I'm thinking he's here to become a witch like his twin sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" leaning in, Rose giggled. \"Well, we can help you with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Big mistake.\" wincing, Cris whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bug off.\" Juan muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a dark aura pulled away from Juan, revealing what looked like a twin brother. He laughed maniacally before taking two small vials from the lab coat Juan wore over his school uniform and poured them into the girls book bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do, you mad man!?!\" angry, Rose asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think your school work is about to catch up to you. You've been leaveing it alone for far too long.\" with a toothy grin, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose and Carla gasped hearing deep, incoherent babbling coming from behind them. They turned to see that their book bags had somehow come to life! The shoulder straps had torn in half and were serving as legs and arms. The open zipper of the main compartment was their mouth. Rose and Carla screamed as they spit shredding paper at them before charging, leaping onto their bodies, hitting them with the school books that were inside them. The two girls ran away, screaming in terror as Dark Juan laughed and most of the group chuckeled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Serves em right.\" Chon said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Alexander and Chris were done laughing they turned to Juan to find him frozen, as if in a trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to snap him out of this!\" pulling Chris forward, Alexander said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, wait!\" warning him, Chis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly it was too late as Dark Juan turned and spotted Chris holding Alexander's hand. \"Unhand my sister!\" in a sudden fury, he roared. \"Fear not, Chris! I am here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dark Juan is possessively protective of me.\" wincing, Chris said. \"I tried to warn you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexander turned back to Juan to see him charging with what looked like a remote control appearing him his hand. Ryan immediately recognized it as a tech-wand, a tool for dueling. The tech-wand glowed before becoming a sickle curved sword. Ryan drew his sword in defense of his old friend. The rest of the group stood in shock as the tension in the air was thick enough to slice.<br>\r\n\"Crap where are the prefects when you need them?!\" Ryan thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Through painful experiences in the past, both had learned not to jump to conclusions and hurried to the deans office to find the door closed. Still, they could hear her angered voice from within. \"I do not care what your intentions are, Dr. Vague!\" almost screaming, Elvira roared. \"Eligere Sententia has no right or authority to force my son into a transfer!\" there was a pause before Elvira screamed, \"My son finishes what he starts and I can assure you he has started here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she slammed the phone down before opening the door to find Ryan and Chon. \"You two get in here, now.\" irritated, she ordered. \"We have something to discuss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan and Chon entered Elvira's office and she closed the door. \"Eligere Sententia boys boarding school is sending a recruiter to try to convince Juan to transfer to their school.\" serious, she said. \"Juan is the type of person who always finishes what he starts and, as you know, he has already started something here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it you wish us to do?\" adjusting his blindfold, Chon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira waved her hand and Ryan and Chon's uniforms were replaced with prefect uniforms. \"You and your company are now officially prefects.\" nodding, she said. \"Your one job, at this moment, is to keep everyone out of the way when the mad science duel happens and I promise you it will come.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How exactly to mad scientists duel?\" curious, Chon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira frowned. \"In a civilized duel, it takes place in an isolated location like a junkyard or an abandoned rail station.\" explaining, she said. \"However, this recruiter will be bringing the fight to Juan so it will take place in the halls of this school unless you can manage to move it outside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough.\" nodding, Ryan said. \"Only, it does not answer the question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting to that!\" annoyed, Elvira snapped. \"Mad scientists have rules as well. Anything considered 'Holy Ground' such as graveyards, churches, and so on, is neutral territory; they will not fight each other there. As for how they duel, there are no rules except to fight to win. The victor is the one to force the other to yield or retreat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon frowned. \"Basically, anyone caught in the crossfire is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ignored.\" seriously, Elvira replied. \"They will only see each other. Even if a bystander is noticed by them, to place an innocent between one self and the opponent is considered to be a cowardly act. Eligere Sententia will lose face if that happens and word gets out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still those caught in the crossfire will get hurt.\" frowning, Ryan pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is why I made you all prefects.\" sighing, Elvira said. she then turned to Chon. \"Recruiters from Eligere Sententia have been known to kill those who refuse them to protect their secrets. Do what you must if it comes to that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon nodded. \"I understand.\" softly, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ryan and Chon left the dean's office, they heard the sounds of battle. They ran into the next hall to see several students running out of the gym, terrified. As came near, Ryan saw Jenny being thrown out the door! He ran forward and caught her in his arms. \"Are you hurt?\" concerned, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny sighed. \"Just embarrassed.\" irritated, she said. \"Some cloaked weirdo is attacking Juan. I stepped in but the guy threw me out of the room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngered, Ryan gently placed Jenny onto her feet then ran into the room with Chon to see Juan in an intense battle with he cloaked figure.

At first, he thought Juan was merely being stubborn. Then, Juan stabbed his curved sword down with a battle cry and a powerful laser blast shot down from the heavens!  The train was undamaged but Charles' technological armor was charred and sparking as the stunned man fell from the train.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An electromagnetic pulse wave.\" stunned, Ryan whispered. \"It fries anything technological in an instant but why was he not affected by it.\" This puzzled Ryan until he looked closer at the controls and realized that the machine was a hybrid of science and magic. \"Impressive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe swung the technological broom back to the train where Juan finally jumped on and pointed to a central piece on the control panel. \"You have to think about what you want to do before you do it.\" simply, he instructed. \"The Anti-Gravity Vehicle, or AVG will do the rest, leaving you open to use both hands to duel in the air or use the AVG as a partner when you find yourself outnumbered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" catching on to the true simplicity of the machine, Ryan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you like it?\" smiling, Juan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a fine machine.\" honestly, Ryan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuan nodded. \"Consider it yours.\" surprising Ryan, he said. \"It's a mark of our friendship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will you use?\" concerned, Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuan smiled. \"I already built another one.\" he then hushed Ryan quiet. \"Don't tell my mother, she'll strangle me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For having another, err, AVG?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For using school equipment to build another AVG.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan shook his head, somehow knowing he would not have to say a word as he figured Juan's mother already knew.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After he stood up he noticed that many students were watching him. \"Move along people, nothing to see.\" Ryan said as he dusted his uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the crowd had broken up Ryan noticed two young girls looking at him. They were called Viva and Vogue. The two girls were twins who's Mother was a rouge witch. Chon had met them and learned about thier age and childhood.

Ryan grabbed one of the Ren's and said \"Hey Chon shall we bring them in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon smiled and said \"As a prefect of Starmage you are under arrest for attacking a prefect and starting an illegal duel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And for being evil towards your Brother.\" The V's said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Ryan and Chon grabbed both the Ren twins and dragged them to the Dean's office.<br>\r\n\"Come in.\" the Dean said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe V's opened the door to allow Ryan and Chon to drag the Ren's in.<br>\r\n\"Well what do we have here?\" Elvira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A couple of offenders Madam.\" Ryan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They attacked BB!\" Viva said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been framed!\" Rose said trying to justify herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're the fallgirls!\" Carla said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira watched them with barely contained amusement. \"Okay girls let me get this right. You did it but you say you did'nt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are 100% innocent Ms.\" Rose said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan and co were grinning ear to ear as Elvira said \"Well girls I would like to belive you. But your records have offences that are as thick as tree trunks. You need a punishment I'm afraid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that she waved her hand and the Ren's had lost thier voice and Elvira said \"I think you'll find that your thongs have turned to diapers.\"<br>\r\nChon was enjoying this every second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"BB you look like your ribs are gonna bust!\" Viva said as the twins rolled around in humour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now get out of here Ren twins. Chon take the girls back home. Ryan stay here.\" Elvira said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon kicked the Ren's out and held the V's hands \"C'mon kids. Let's take Charlie and you two out for ice cream eh?\"<br>\r\nThe girls smiled as they walked out with Chon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan sat down and asked \"So what do you need to talk about with me Dean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira sighed and said......</span></div></div>",

So that's what his power is?\" Jenny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan nodded and said \"I won't lie. I'm kinda happy that he has this power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?! He could be a target for evil witches all round the world!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think I know that Jen? But he's always wanted to help us in many ways. Perhaps he'll see this as his big break.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if the worst comes to pass?\" Jenny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan sighed \"We're gonna train him. You know how much I care about that kid Jenny. Nothing bad's gonna happen. I fought for him once and I'll gladly do it again. It'll all be okay, we got a lot of people helping us and him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny sighed and said \"It's hard though. Ain't it Ryan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan nodded and bit his lower lip. Jenny pulled him in for a hug and she felt her right shoulder get wet from Ryan's tears.<br>\r\n\"It's okay Ryan. I'm here for you.\" she muttered to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 17 year old lifted his head and gave a sad smile \"I know Jenny. I swear I'll have gray hair before I turn 30.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny smiled and said \"Come on. Let's go to bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day Ryan awoke to hear a scream in the kitchen. He stood up and ran out in his boxers, he thought that Jenny must have brunt the ramen or something. However it was Charlie with a broken table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryan I just tapped the table and the next thing I knew it snapped!\" Charlie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan got down to the kid's level and said \"Charlie this is very important. Have you been near any magic in the last two days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um yeah. The V twins were giving me a fireworks show last night to show thier progress. Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan sighed and said \"Charlie. You need to come into my room. Wait there while I get Jenny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid nodded and rushed into Ryan's room. Jenny came out of the toilet and said \"I heard that Ryan. Has it happened?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan nodded and the two sat down with the kid. \"Don't worry Charlie we don't have any bad news.\" Jenny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know about that super power you have? Whenever you get really annoyed at the bad guys and you just wanna smash them?\"<br>\r\nRyan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie nodded and said \"I remember when there was a large rock on top of you. I just lifted it up with no problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan nodded and said \"That power is from a certain type of witchboy Charlie. You're quite lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny was about to say something to Ryan like \"What do you mean lucky? He'll be hunted by witches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ryan went on with \"Now that your power has revealed mostly in your normal life I have to train you in it. The power of the roughnecks is yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are there others like me?\" Charlie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Charlie. Consider yourself lucky. Your're the first in over two decades. Think about it, you could be a superhero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie grinned and was about to run around the room when he asked \"What about the V girls? I don't want them being hurt becasue of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny smiled and said \"Don't worry. Those girls will stand by you no matter what.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan smile, trying to keep the situation as light as possible. \"So I guess we'll need to start training you. But it's a school day so it'll have to wait.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie smiled and said \"Do I tell the V girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny shook her head \"Not yet Charlie. Wait until you have your first lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid smiled and the three of them walked out. <br>\r\nRyan later.....</span></div></div>",

But I have to give you some warning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\" Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira stood up and walked to the window. \"I know him on a personal level along with his wife.

After all the roughnecks dried up he opened a store selling mens suits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else I need to know about this man?\" Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I'm afraid. He has a sort of curse around him. Most witches become easily scared and start crying when he is near. Even some males can get fear down thier necks. But don't get him wrong, that man is one of the nicest people on the planet. But only those with great will can resist the curse, I think you can with your blade's help.\" Elvira explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan nodded and asked \"How would I be able to meet him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira turned and said \"I can contact him later.

It's odd but he's like a sort of son to me. I just want to be there and make sure he grows up okay.\" Ryan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElvira smiled \"That's great Ryan.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later that day, Ryan headed back to his dorm to work out a training regiment for Charlie when he spotted Rose and Carla taunting Charlie in another hall. He paused to listen in case he might be needed. As a prefect, he needed a reason to interfere other than just words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll never be a match for us, little brother.\" taunting, Carla said. \"I don't even know why you bother coming to this school, its so out of your league.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't even know why mom bothered having you in the first place.\" coldly, Rose said. \"You're a wasted one night stand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie teared up, knowing his father was better than that and felt his lips quivering as he hissed, \"Take that back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rose, I think you're taking this too far.\" taking a step back, Carla said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarla noticed that Charlie's eyes had turned blood red, the first of only two warnings of a roughneck attack. Only, as it had been twenty years since the last roughneck lived, no one remembered the warning signs. \"Take that back, Rose!\" tears falling, Charlie repeated. \"You take that back!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why couldn't you have been born a girl!?\" snapping, Rose asked. \"Mom would have at least had a complete family instead of two witches and a pet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all Charlie could stand and Ryan knew it. He took a step forward to end it as Charlie normally ran away in tears at this point but, to his surprise, he stood fast. Ryan paused, fearful as he then heard every joint in Charlie's body cracking from his toes to his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"What's happening!?!\"</i> worried, Ryan thought. <i>\"Is this the blast wave Elvira warned me of!?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cracking of every joint was the final warning, not that Ryan knew this, and he jumped upon seeing Charlie's eyes suddenly glowing as Chon's just before he threw his hands out as if to push his sisters away from him. What happened next seemed to occur in slow motion. There was a powerful distortion in the air between Charlie and his sisters before a deafening clap of thunder shook the halls. Ryan watched in a state of both surprise and horror as Rose and Carla were violently thrown into the air by an invisible force; they were hurled down the long hall along with everything in the path of Charlie's blast wave. Chairs, doors, carpeting, windows, all taken by the powerful blast with Rose and Carla screaming in the middle of it all before everything hit the far wall and suddenly stopped as the walls were all strongly reenforced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe deafening sound of thunder was still echoing through the halls as Charlie just stood there, his eyes no longer glowing but his body quivering in terror. Ryan ran to his side as Charlie fell to his knees, sobbing. \"I'm here, Charlie!\" falling to his own knees, Ryan said. \"It's going to be okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I hurt them!\" in shock, Charlie whispered. \"I hurt them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan tried his best to comfort the small boy but paused, seeing his friends running towards him in the hall. \"We heard what seemed to be an explosion!\" catching his breath, Chon said. \"What happened!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill comforting Charlie, he pointed to the floor to ceiling pile of debris at the far end of the hall. \"Charlie's power has surfaced in a big way.\" softly, he said. \"His sisters went too far in taunting him and he let them have it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon explaining what had happened in detail, Chon turned to Charlie and saw that he was very pale. \"You better get him to the infirmary.\" serious, he said. \"We'll dig out his sisters and take them there as well. Even if they don't deserve it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hurt them... I hurt them...\" sobbing now, Charlie muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did what you had to, Charlie.\" taking the boy into his arms. \"They had it coming to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharlie then began to sob quietly onto Ryan's chest, causing him to sigh. \"We'll work this out, bro.\" tearing up, he said. \"Let's get you to the infirmary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter seeing that Charlie was well being taken care of, Ryan returned with Jenny, Amy and Light Killer to his dorm only to sense a powerful feeling of dread as if death itself was near. Amy began shaking and covered her face with her long black hair. Jenny said \"Mew mew.\" and turned into a cat, she then crawled up Ryan's unifom to hide in his pockets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight began grinding his teeth and muttered \"I can feel it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of instinct alone, Ryan drew his sword and cautiously entered his dorm to find a towering, muscular man who easily stood seven feet standing in the center of his room. \"Welcome, Master Carlson and co.\" in a deep, booming voice, the man said. \"Elvira Smith has told me you know of a young natural roughneck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan gulped slightly; the dean was not exaggerating when she mentioned the fear curse surrounding Moriarty. He found himself struggling not to quiver in his presence. \"Dr Moriarty Strange, I presume?\" his voice even, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He makes my blood boil.\" Light muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan turned and said \"John don't. Here take Jenny and Amy outside for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight slowly did so, after he left Ryan said \"Sorry about him. He has problems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoriarty nodded. \"Focus only on the task at hand and you will not need that sword to enhance your nerve.\" seriously, he said. \"I heard the sound of a blast wave firing as I entered the building.\" he paused. \"Was that young Charlie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was.\" sheathing his sword, Ryan said. \"I believe he inadvertently used it against his two sisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one has control over the first blast.\" frowning, Moriarty said. \"It is manifested through years of anguish and pain.\" he then took a step forward and smiled, seeing Ryan holding his ground. \"I doubt his sisters will approach him for quite some time, now knowing what he can do if pushed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's still in danger, sir.\" worried, Ryan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He could not be safer.\" serious, Moriarty countered. \"I have every confidence in your skills and wisdom.\" smiling, he added, \"It may surprise you to know that your grandfather was a roughneck. The power is in you as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Juan was wrong on both counts.\" surprised, Ryan muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Juan is brilliant but he is also distracted with the aspect of becoming a witch looming over him.\" seriously, Moriarty said. \"Chris will keep him focused, you need not fear about him.\" he then sat down. \"Let us discuss Charlie's training.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan nodded and took a seat...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From what I understand you have trained him in basic kenpo. Carry on with that and also teach him what you learned in China. As for tapping into his power, I will give the boy a few basic lessons which you may also partake in to learn more about your own power. Also for exercise he must get 3 hours at first and then slowly raise that as he gets stronger.

It bashed off her head with a large \"Clang!\" sound<br>\r\nVouge meanwhile picked up a water bottle and poured it onto Carla's head with Chon lifting her up.<br>\r\nJenny then began slapping the taste out of Rose's mouth. With each slap she said \"Don't. Ever. Ever. Go. Near. Him. Again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on the group were sitting back down to Chalie's body. \"Don't worry kid.

She reached the door but was stopped by Juan's sister, Christina. \"Janna is having a freak out.\" calmly, Chris explained. \"We do not go in until she calms down unless you want to dodge random spells.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you are here, Chris.\" weary, Jenny said. \"Any ideas on how to deal with, um... Janna?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris nodded. \"When Janna gets like this, you need to let her blow off steam.\" she replied. \"Once she stops screaming and throwing things, we can deal with her calmly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Has Juan be transformed into a girl before?\" curious, Jenny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A few times, by me.\" grinning, Chris said. \"Only this was the work of the Ren twins in revenge for the book bag ghouls.\" she giggled. \"Janna wants revenge but mom forbid it as she was going to order you to change him anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was going to have me change him?\" surprised, Jenny asked. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Although witches and witch boys in the UK are immune to TG, TF, and shrinking spells, there are many places in the world where this is not so.\" patiently,  Chris explained. \"As a prefect, they may transfer you to a school in the States where you will have to deal with such things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is a test?\" guessing correctly, Jenny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris giggled, giving Jenny her answer. \"If it had not been a test, the Ren twins would have faced a very angry witch.\" smiling, she said. she paused, noticing that the screaming and crashing had stopped. \"She's done having her tantrum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Chris opened the door and led Jenny into what looked like a war zone in Janna's room. Everything had been thrown around and or bashed into pieces with a teenage girl in the middle of it all, wearing a dress, sobbing on her knees. \"Don't look at me, I'm hideous!\" in her new feminine voice, she begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are my twin sister.\" bemused, Chris said. \"Are you telling me I am hideous?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I tried to reverse the spell.\" sobbing, Janna replied. \"It didn't work and now I- I look.... pretty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanna looked up allowing Chris and Jenny to see a very attractive young lady who looked much like a princess ready for the grand ball. Jenny placed a hand over her mouth to keep herself from laughing out loud as Chris giggled slightly as she came down to her new sister's level with Jenny following. \"Let me guess, you tried a mad science cure?\" amused, Jenny asked. Janna nodded. \"Magic does not work like science, its a bit different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you fix this?\" pointing at her face, Janna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can fix that part but I am not sure about the gender spell.\" gently, Jenny replied. she could sense that the spell was not permanent but she did not want to tell Janna that as she believed she needed to learn a little patience. \"You'll just have to wait for the effects to wear off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJanna moaned then fumed, \"Those Ren twins!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a doll appeared in her hand and she screamed, throwing it away from her as if it were diseased. Seeing this, Chris laughed, leaving Jenny confused. \"What's so funny?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its the beautified beast spell.\" giggling, Chris replied. \"It won't cancel out until Janna is completely relaxed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny sighed. \"How do you make your brother completely relaxed?\" weary, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChris grinned. \"That is your test, prefect.\" walking out of the room she said. \"Good luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been set up.\" pouting, Jenny muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, its Chris' test.\" becoming serious, Janna whispered. \"She just doesn't know it yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing that, Jenny gave a sly smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere in the school, Elvira called Ryan and Chon to her office. \"I have just received word from witch prison.\" gravely, she said to the two boys. \"I'm afraid its bad.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The winds instantly shifted from a cool breeze to a hurricane like gale as a massive ball of distorted air fired from Moriarty's hand and speed murderously towards the three advancing witches!

Both of them gave a giggle and walked out the room with Chon.<br>\r\nThe blind man noticed Mr Tanaka grinning at him, Chon nodded and muttered \"You were right, I need to move on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done Chon.\" the former headmaster said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Chon turned down the hallway he noticed Juan who was leaning on the wall with folded arms.<br>\r\n\"To live in constant fear of one's enemy is a fate worse than death.\" he muttered. \"Take that as your revenge and move on.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What do you know about revenge?\" flatly, Chon asked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJuan walked away, darkly replying, \"More than you will ever know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChon could feel something bad in that statement. The Chon of old would have gone into an epic rant about how no one could know the pain and anger he had. But now the Chon of present would take heart in knowing that things were not as bad as they seemed for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon.\" he said to the girls as they headed for the dorm.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

They then fluttered away, and I didn't want to bother myself with trying to find out where they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI flung my bed covers off, and with practised movements got out of the bed and to my bathroom. Everything was always at the same place, they say blind people know their houses better than people who see. I can agree with that as I grabbed my toothpaste and brush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting myself washed and dressed I stepped out, taking a seat at the breakfast table and taking a seat there. I munch on some toast with my adopted daughters sitting down near me, I can hear them smile. They talk about what they'd like for Christmas, and if we are doing martial arts lessons today. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile and say me and Santa will give them want they desire as long as they behave, and martial art lessons will be later this evening. It's a half day after all, they've taken to my lessons with gusto. And in the first time in I don't know how long, I feel great. I can finally say I've moved on, and it looks like it's shown. Considering how chirpy and upbeat everyone is, hell even Ryan's grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe nightmares still happen, but not as much as it used to. Although the battlefield nightmare, where the people I've killed stand on one side and me on the other is the most common. To be honest I don't think I'll be able to let that go, but I'll do what I can. I've sworn to turn around, and not to be consumed by the hate and darkness. Despite pitch blackness being one of the things I see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough we're up, our study gear ready in bags. Light and Ryan give Lunar the brief, and most likely telling her to behave herself. I heard about what happened between that girl and the Ren bitches, bet they just about pissed themselves. To be honest I'm still not sure about her, but if Ryan and Light can get her to act normal then it's good enough for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI brought a blind man's cane with me, granted I didn't really need it. But it had it's uses at least, in more ways than one. A short walk later Charlie parted ways with my girls, they really took a shine to him. I remember joking with Ryan one time, about how they could be his cheerleaders. No doubt using the martial art moves I taught them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay class let's take our seats.\" the teacher was an aging woman, mid 50's or so I think. Her name was Kylie Sanders, the lesson was history. General history and that of the global supernatural society. My grades were all right normally, considering I was focused on my martial arts and revenge. Now though it would be different, now I would apply my mental training to my studies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took my seat, far away from the window. So that my other senses wouldn't be affected by the outside world. My friends sitting near me as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Class this is our new student, her name is Clara Roche. Introduce yourself darling.\" the teacher said sitting at her desk in front of the class. I sensed the new girl, her chi telling me of her location. I could make out her features, about Jenny's age. Blond hair in curls, steely blue eyes. Starmage uniform. But I wasn't concerned about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the light red chi that set me off, it warned me of evil intent. It wasn't the same colour that the Ren bitches had, they were in some prison for the time being. But I kept calm and made a note to tell my friends about this. The girl started to talk with \"My name is Clara as you've just heard, I like reading and magic. I'm also curious about new things in general.\" I was getting ticked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething about this chick just wasn't right, red chi and a sickly sweet voice. But I wasn't going to do a thing, she wasn't giving me no reason to. But me and my team, we had built in bullshit detectors. Clara was then going on about how she spent a few months in witchbloom, that school across the pond from where we live. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was done I heard the teacher saying \"Now Clara take a seat anywhere you like.\" I could tell the girl was making a smile. She then....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But this girl was just setting off too many alarm bells, the chi and nice voice. A bitch in sheep's clothing was who I was guessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't sit here, please don't sit here.\" I thought to myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she went and did that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck.\" I thought to myself, jinxes can be a pain in the ass. She took the seat to my front left, and glanced over at me and my team. When her eyes rested on me she had a look of interest in her features. Like I was some sort of new animal or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's he? Can he see like we can, hellooooo?\" she said. Oh that was making me annoyed, I fixed my head at her and just looked at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now now Clara, rest assured that Chon can see just as well as you can. You may ask him questions later, for now we must begin our lesson.\" and with that the teacher got to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so did we, my books were in that blind language braille. I can see using chi and my other senses, but reading needs an extra hand. But it was fine, I didn't mind. I was used to it, spent ten years getting used to it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the class went on I couldn't help but notice that Clara was looking at me whenever she could, as if she thought I couldn't see her. I didn't give any indication otherwise that I was noticing her, just a blank man with a blindfold. This whole thing stunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did better in the lesson than I thought, trying to keep myself distant from this was the main goal. And doing the lesson helped in that, but then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara had stood up after class had finished, I was just about to speak with Ryan. When she asked me another question \"Ummm, excuse me. I was just wondering, how do you see? Sorry I'm just sooooo curious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, I didn't want to interact with this woman. The less the better, but I figured if I give her a half answer that might be good enough. I folded my arms and looked to Ryan, who nodded and then I began to speak with \"Enhanced senses, I lost the use of my eyes in an accident years ago. And since then I've adapted to the point where I can act virtually as well as one with eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClara went wide eyed and said \"Wow! So that's not a myth, it can actually happen!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take much to entertain her, but I was guessing that's a ruse. Whatever I just wanted to get out here, besides it was time to help prepare the martial arts training for my children. Although something told me I wasn't going to lose this bitch so easily.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Chon's POV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'd gone through the katas I arranged for Viva and Vogue, it's challenging to not only focus on the schoolwork given to me but also ensure that my girls are given education not involving magic. So that they don't in future over rely on it and find themselves in a dangerous situation without it there to aid them, they have taken to it like ducks to water. Granted I've pulled no punches with it but they are accustomed to taking the bruises that comes with my regime, and they have become very good in martial arts now. Enough to overpower Charlie's older Sisters, 4 years their senior and taller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe training for today goes well enough, I hide the fact that something's bothering me. That woman in today's class just irked me, perhaps it's just my natural distrust towards witches. I have certain exceptions of course such as with Jenny and Amy, but still I doubt I'll ever get rid of it. Better that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours pass and it's time for dinner, Viva and Vogue have gone off to the library to study with their boyfriend Charlie. I'll admit I find it perplexing that one boy has managed to get both of them, regardless I know he'd treat them well. I'm dressed out of my uniform with a black tracksuit jacket and blue jeans with brown sneakers as I head to the dining room in our dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly though I pick up on something, and it seems everyone else has caught it too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Charlie and the girls?\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarlson has a worried expression and says \"We don't know, Charlie isn't returning my calls. We're gonna go and look for them before we eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm smelling bullshit here, someone's up to no good. I doubt Charlie's doing dirty with my girls, they're all 12 for fuck's sake. \"It was that girl. She's done something.\" I say promptly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't know for certain, but anyway let's go. We'll each take a floor, I'll check the library. Everyone else fan out, now.\" Carlson said, that's something I like about him. He doesn't beat around the bush, he does stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's starting to rain now, hopefully they're not outside. Lunar takes to the skies and Light goes to the forest, they know those areas the best after all. It's strange though, I don't feel their chi. But I should be able to from a mile off, this isn't good. If we can't find them we'll need to tell the dean, and the blame will be on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decide to run to the roof, I'm the fastest on foot after all. Carlson is behind me but cuts into the nearby library, he gasps loudly and I stop in my tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charlie!\" Carlson shouts, I double back to where they are. The library is empty, aside from Charlie's beaten form and books scattered everywhere. The kid clings to Ryan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Ryan! Viva and Vogue t-they were taken! I tried to stop her, but she blindsided me and struck them both down!\" he shouts, tears in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who did this?....\" Carlson mutters, no doubt pissed that someone hurt Charlie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The girl you told me about, the one in your class! She said she was going to toss Viva and Vogue from their higher than thou perch. What's that meaning?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI instantly connect the dots, and I used my chi energy to run faster. Up the stairs like a spectre, to the roof. I barrelled through the door and instantly I pick up on three chi signatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Viva! Vogue!\" I shout, I take a step towards them. But the evil chi steps in front, waving a magic filled hand at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not another step you bastard, otherwise these girls will be turned into boys....and then thrown off the roof.\" the evil chi mutters. It's the same from before no doubt, I can tell from her tone of voice that she's not joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do this?\" I say, I can't risk getting in close. The woman's poised her other hand at my girls, the hair on the back of my neck is on end. But I show no signs of being cowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl responds by saying \"Because you took something from me, and I'll never have it back. Today I'll do the same to you, and you will watch the only two girls you care for die in front of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't listen to her Chon! She's a bitch!\" Viva says, Vogue spits at her in open defiance. The girl slaps both of them, I make a step but she quickly focuses back on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you really? I don't believe your name that you gave me......\" I ask, I need to keep her stalled. I ran too fast ahead of everyone else, c'mon Lunar show up. Carlson please......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pauses, and then changes her hair and says \"My name.....is Cassie Bane........and you killed my Mother......\" in an icy tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBane? Yes I remember her, she was the second rogue witch I killed. One of those who killed my Brother so long ago.......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So......you've come for revenge then?\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie nods, not even trying to hide her negative emotions. \"You killed her! Impaled her through the chest with your bare hands and left her to bleed out! I was orphaned with my little Sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean your older Brother.\" I knew about that, she and her Mother planned to turn him permanently into a girl. They succeeded it turned out, not that I care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's dead! I only have a Sister!\" Cassie snaps back at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI need to be careful, if she gets too agitated she might just do it. I just need to keep stalling, still I'll admit this isn't pretty. I was only caring about my revenge, everything else was just secondary. I gave little thought to the loved ones of my targets, save for how to use them. I had actually considered kidnapping Cassie and using her as bait, it was just her Mother didn't know I was coming and made it too easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't kill them.\" I say. \"What if I were to offer my life instead? I'm clearly just scum aren't I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie pauses, she's considering it. Good, though I'm lying through my teeth. No way am I sacrificing myself like this. \"I'd prefer you just watch.\" she says. She's shaking though, she doesn't have the guts to go through with actually taking a life like I have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kneel on both legs, with my arms outstretched. The rain pouring down on my hair, I state \"Take this chance, if you go through with your current plan then it'd only fuel my hate even further. And make me much more determined to rid the world of an evil magic user such as you, who are an example that it's a blight on the world. If you kill me here I will be no danger to you later, and you will have your revenge much sooner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was it, I said the magic words. Cassie looks at me, before giving an evil smile. She steps towards me, as she does I remove a sai from my pocket and slide it along the ground. \"Stab me. In the heart, end it.\" I mutter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie seems to revel in this, she picks it up and eagerly strides towards me. Good, she's away from the girls. Now then...........<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Dinner time Light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then pushed his blade out and kicked Lavina over towards Light.<br>\r\nThe ex magic test subject grabbed her right arm and sank his fang like teeth into it.<br>\r\nLight then ripped out a part of her skin and said \"I can taste the evil in you. I'm not even gonna bother with your bones.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLavina screamed in pain, Light's fangs were as sharp as glass. He then spat out her skin and said \"Why did you bother showing up? Tell us or I'll feed you to Juan, if I'm feeling nice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the rouge could even answer Light threw her over to Chon, who promptly headbutted her. Chon then sat atop her and began to rain down fist after fist onto her till her face was injured real bad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny then came over and summoned a large water cooler tank filled to the top. She then promptly dunked it over Lavina's head.<br>\r\nRyan kneeled next to her and said \"So you gonna tell us now? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to steal that girl, a bargaining chip to use against that stupid John boy. Now don't hurt me anymore!\" Lavina cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan smiled and grabbed Lavina by the neck, he then dragged her out the room and said \"Let's take her to the boss for more questions. Oh and Light, wipe that blood off your mouth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight grinned and licked all over his mouth, he could gain power by consuming the blood of witches and scientists. The only one who could really control him was Ryan.</span></div></div>",

He then rose his hand, the rock rising with him before he slashed his hand through the air, slicing the rock in half from a distance!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"I've heard stories of ancient masters using techniques like that.\"</i> stunned, Ryan thought. <i>\"I just never thought I'd ever see it being used; especially not by a mad scientist.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Juan stepped off the grass and turned to the woods. \"You can come out, Ryan.\" calmly, he said. \"You have nothing to fear from me today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan came into the open and motioned to the rock Juan had cut in half. \"Where did you learn that?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That technique is older than both magic and mad science.\" surprising Ryan, Juan said. \"It is only taught to those who possess a high potential.\" he then turned to Ryan. \"That is why Moriarty is training you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you wanted to do a practice duel with me.\" changing the subject, Ryan said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuan nodded. \"Mad scientists do not cheat in honorable duels.\" taking a dueling stance, he said. \"For one to even attempt it will be to lose all credibility with all his peers.\" he then motioned Ryan to take a dueling stance. \"A mad science duel starts with a simple bow, always keeping eye contact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan nodded. \"I understand.\" he said. \"What's next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The rules are simple.\" serious, Juan said. \"The first to render the other unconscious or unable to continue will win the duel. Any nonlethal weapon, device, or technique is permitted. If you run from an opponent outside of the fight ring, you receive one warning. Three of these and you automatically lose the match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if you throw your opponent out of the fight ring?\" curious, Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same rules apply.\" simply, Juan replied. \"Your sword would not be allowed in the ring but not because it is considered a lethal weapon.\" he frowned as he added, \"It's because its considered a second entity due to it having a mind of its own. These duels are one on one only.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan sighed. \"Great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, if your opponent attempts to use lethal force, you can call upon the sword for defense.\" serious, Juan said. \"The same is your opponent calls in a second fighter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else?\" looking at Juan, Ryan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJuan smiled and bowed. \"On guard!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In contrast to how those around me currently felt, the power of a roughneck had been long forgotten. Until recently, and I'm sure there were witches around here who would be shocked that a guy was beating the arguable best witch in their school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I was using my real sword you'd be dead by now.\" I stated simply to Hayley, with my eyes narrowed and the grip on my wooden katana tightening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well good thing I'm holding back, I don't think Jenny would take too kindly if you were burned to an utter crisp.\" Hayley retorted, I could hear Jenny shouting in the background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch!\" Jenny screamed out, I merely shook my head. A second later I charged forth, ready to attack. Hayley had shot forth a small fireball towards me, but I remained calm and performed a move to get around it. I slid under the fireball by adjusting my body so that it went past my upper torso and head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sure enough I was perfectly placed to strike, and Hayley had realised it as her eyes went wide. She quickly shot out an uppercut to my jaw, I wasn't expecting such a counter from her so I took a step back and winced. Holding my jaw with one hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Little trick my Brother showed me.\" she said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spat at the ground near her feet and said \"You call that a punch? Chon's fist is like a comet in comparison.\" I then took the fight to her in an odd fashion, I toss my bokken high into the air. Hayley\u2019s gaze looked to it on reflex, which allowed me to quickly fire out both of my palms as I drove them into her belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHayley yelped out loudly as she was sent skidding back, I caught my bokken as it came back down and moved forward as I was intent on continuing my offense. Hayley had recovered, but I was on her. The pace of the fight was going to be dictated by me, by using my swordplay skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then I noticed that Hayley had flung a punch out at me, only this time it was covered with a flame. I quickly tilted my body and performed a back flip and re-entered into my stance. \u201cJust cause I\u2019m a witch doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m weak up close.\u201d Hayley said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smirked and said \u201cOmoshiroi, so you can coat your punches with flames eh? Well let\u2019s see how long you can keep that up. You should know that I am the more experienced in hand to hand combat, although I had expected you to just spam your magic from a distance. Let\u2019s see who gives the next surprise.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that I gripped my blade once again, Chon had taught me on how to channel my chi energy. And also considering the recent lessons I had taken in being a roughneck from the good Doctor Moriarty. Perhaps I could fire off a high powered attack or projectile at Hayley, I pondered for only a second before\u2026..</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Starmage academy is in an unknown forest in Scotland. You don't find it, it finds you.<br>\r\nAfter being forced to battle an evil witch after just discovering about his Mother's magic, young Ryan Carlson attends Starmage academy for witches and hunters. In the midst of all this Ryan must accept his new way of life, but in any school anything can happen.<br>\r\n Will Ryan and co enjoy thier year of learning? Or will some horrid fate befall them? You decide!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Below are the people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyan Carlson.<br>\r\nThe 17 year old hero of our tale. Before he attended starmage he had to spend a year in Asia. His Mother wanted to give him extra training in combat. The reason for this is so he could stand a higher chance of overcoming the road ahead of him called 'Being a witch hunter.' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he went around Asia learning different martial arts. He learned Kenpo from monks in Tibet. Ninjustu from ninjas hidden in Mt. Fuji. And Tae-Kwon-Doe in Korea. He is also well trained in the way of the katana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis appearance is short dark brown hair, narrow bright blue eyes and an often stoic face.<br>\r\nHe wears a leather jacket with Japanese symbols on it. He wears old nikes with blue jeans.<br>\r\nBut for the most part he wears the school uniform which is a red jumper.<br>\r\nIn terms of personalty he is a bit of a loner. However under that lies a man with strong will and morals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2-3cwObg7-8/TOzS0B_pi3I/AAAAAAAAB94/VBNbELgZ070/s400/Anime_Guy_by_CannibalTaco34.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_2-3cwObg7-8/TOzS0B_pi3I/AAAAAAAAB94/VBNbELgZ070/s400/A...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny Forth<br>\r\nA 16 year old girl who is attending starmage academy. Before that though she was at Ryan's old high school where the two of them dated in secret. Her leaveing left a gap in Ryan's heart but soon will that be healed?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was already given basic training by her Mother, she uses this to hide her secret cat ears from everyone. For she is one of the few \"Neko girls\" in the world.She also learned healing magic so she could look after Ryan if he was ever wounded. All her magic is used via an old book her Granmother gave to her on her 10th birthday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has brown hair in a ponytail. Her eyes are a light green and her face has a kind look on it often.<br>\r\nShe will wear a wide amount of coats, like a puma hoodie (Which she gave to Ryan as a gift before she left)<br>\r\nor a purple raincoat.<br>\r\nHer personalty is that of kindness. She will often have a kind word for all and is the moral rock for Ryan when things get hard for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://img-cache.cdn.gaiaonline.com/ca08bbe8985147928b51df638c0b690e/http://i213.photobucket.com/albums/cc234/inu5474/anime_girl_66523.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://img-cache.cdn.gaiaonline.com/ca08bbe8985147928b51df638c0b690e/http://i213...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you want to check the other people then check this  \"<a href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/view_item/item_id/1902405-Starmage-Academy-list-of-characters\" title=\"Told in the style of a supernatural society risk assessing the characters.\" target=\"_top\">Starmage Academy list of characters</a>\"\u00a0<a title=\"Told in the style of a supernatural society risk assessing the characters.\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/view_item/item_id/1902405-Starmage-Academy-list-of-characters\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\r\nHere is the intro part 1 \"<a href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/view_item/item_id/1902519-A-tale-of-witches-and-hunters\" title=\"Chapter one.

No TG or shrinking, or body swap. The reason for this is becasue all people in the UK were born with immunity to these magic types. You can use hypnotisim however but don't make them mentally think they are the other gender. You can make them act younger than they are, but only if it's for humour and they can go back to normal in the next couple of chapters.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n2. I encourage sex (They are teens after all.) but focus on the person's feelings at that point. You can do anything sex related, oral or anal etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Fights should be long and cool, I want to feel the action when I read it okay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. Oh and you can have any of them killed, but If Ryan bites it then the tale ends and you need to put an option before the death so you can avert it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5. Also becasue The Witch people are special guests they can't be killed, you can make it very close however. And I would like to thank Mr Runner and scifiwizard for allowing me to use a crossover. <br>\r\nIf you wish to read thier work then click this link. \"<a href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/interactive-story/item_id/1642255-The-Witch\" title=\"One of your female relatives is a witch and is going to change your life\" target=\"_top\">The Witch</a>\"\u00a0<a title=\"One of your female relatives is a witch and is going to change your life\" href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/interactive-story/item_id/1642255-The-Witch\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" style=\"opacity:.4;\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/nw.gif\" onmouseover=\"$(this).css('opacity', '1');\" onmouseout=\"$(this).css('opacity', '.4');\" height=\"12\" width=\"12\" border=\"0\"></a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso Ryan and co make a guest appearance in scifiwizard's interactive.

And if I enjoy new adds then I shall e-mail you some gift points as a token of thanks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Also the story has to take over the course of a year. Feel free to show what happens after the year is over. Please keep all adds focused on the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. First person writing is encouraged, please state the POV of who is speaking. But I will also allow third person.</td>",
