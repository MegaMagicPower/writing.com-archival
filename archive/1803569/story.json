You had a licence, but because of the move, a new one for Bestia had to be processed. Your eleventh grade year was just about to begin. Your parents meet you at the front door to wish you good luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun sweetie!\" you mom says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop babying the boy.\" your dad tells your mother. \"Have a good day son.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, whatever.\" you say with an unenthusiastic attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" your mom asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've heard the rumors, haven't you? About how high school girls on this planet are about boys?\" you ask. \"They fight over them, and some girls even resort to intimidation to get a guy. Their hormones are out of control at this stage in life! I have nothing against furries, but why did we move here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We went over this, son,\" you dad explains. \"We want you to experience new things. You're always so shut out from the world, so we decided to move to a new one. We only had your well being in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah,\" you say. \"I gotta go, Ramona's waiting on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you meet up with Ramona, the two of you make your way to school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you have a licence?\" you ask Ramona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but what I don't have is my own car.\" she quickly answers back. \"Besides it's more fun to walk and talk with my best friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've only known each other for two days.\" you remind Ramona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh details, details.\" she says with a carefree air about her. Then her smile turned into a frown. \"Don't look now, here comes asshole if the year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person she was referring to was none other than Luke, who was walking across the street to see you two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm surprised the school decided to allow you to set foot in the halls.\" he says with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning to you too, Luke.\" you say sarcastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, being a little overzealous, are we, Earth boy?\" he says, seemingly unfazed by your remark. \"Well I'd like to stay and chat, but i have more important things to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is one of those things being a complete tool?\" you say with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke looked at you with an angry frown. \"Watch it, [your name].\" he says. \"I'm about this close to beating the shit out of you right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Ramona pushed Luke away from you. \"FUCK OFF!\" she yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke was aware that Ramona had fully developed her transformation powers, so he decided to back off. \"Count your blessings, human. You're lucky that fatty is here to protect you.\" he says before walking off like the rat that he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LUKE!!!\" Ramona yells, but you just grab her shoulder. \"He's not worth it.\" you tell her. Ramona calms down. \"You're right. fuck him.\" she says. You look at your watch. \"Uh oh. We're gonna be late if we don't get a move on.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you arrive at school, Ramona senses that you're nervous. \"You've got nothing to worry about, dude.\" she says confidently. \"The girls won't be obsessing over you like that. Besides, you're not much to look at anyway.\" You gave her a look. \"I'm kidding!\" she reassures. \"Now get your ass in there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk into the school, and you see that there's nothing but girls at the school, with with exception of a few boys. All the girls turn and look at you, then they rush over to you and bombard you with questions and compliments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! You're a human!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you really move here from Earth?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you really going to school here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God You're so cute!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nervously chuckle. \"Sorry girls, but I've got to go.\" you say. You sneak out of the crowd, make your way to your locker and see Ramona at hers. \"See?\" she says. \"Usually, they would've tried to grope you by now.\" You could tell that she was serious. Just then something catches your eye: A beautiful cat furry standing just down the hall. She had thick, slightly messy blonde hair that went down to the middle of her back, silky orange fur with some stripes of a deeper orange, beautiful green eyes, and a lovely, bushy tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Chloe Benson.\" Ramona says to you, breaking you out of your trance. \"You didn't think that I wouldn't catch you staring at her did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up, Ramona!\" you tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now hotshot, you gonna talk to her or not?\"</span></div></div>",

Hell, you just walked in the door and you literally have half the school clamoring over you. Granted, you hadn't intended for it to be that way, but still, that must mean something. You straighten your hair and check your breath as you come up behind Chloe before tapping her on the shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turns around and looks surprised to see you. \"Hello.\" You say in your best charmer voice. \"Hi.\" Says Chloe, somewhat suspicously. \"I'm new here, and...\" \"Oh right, I've heard of you.\" Chloe interupts. \"You're that Earth boy.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, anyway, I'm not familiar with this school, and I thought maybe you could show me around?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe glances at the hall clock. \"Well, we've got ten minutes before the bell rings, so I guess I could.\" So Chloe shows you around the school, showing you were the library, gym, lunchroom, etc was. She finishes her little tour with three minutes until the bell rings. \"That's pretty much it. any questions?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one. would you go out with me this Friday?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Chloe was surprised that you would ask her this when you had just met her not ten minutes ago. Hell, you even surprised yourself by saying it. For a few moments there was an awkward silence as Chloe just stares at you. \"Well? What do you say?\" </span></div></div>",

That didn't mean she would go out with you, but it didn't mean she wouldn't either, so you still have a chance! \"Tell you what, come to my house at seven tonight, and I'll tell you if I've made my decision then.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. Fair enough.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say your goodbyes, and turn around and head back down the hall towards Ramona. \"So Cassanova, how did it go?\" She asks teasingly. \"Can't really say.\" You reply \"She said she'd think about it, and tell me later tonight.\" \"Well, at least there's a possibility of her dating you, that's more than most other guys who ask her out can say.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Other guys?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, dozens of guys have asked her out, but she usually turns them down. Who knows, maybe you'll get lucky.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, later that evening, you approach Chloe's house and knock on the door. When the door opens, standing in the doorway is what looks to be a smaller version of Chloe, except her hair is in pigtails. \"Hello?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, is Chloe here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chloe! There's a human boy here to see you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe comes down the stairs and shoos the smaller cat away. \"Was that...\" \"My little sister, yes. Come with me.\" You follow Chloe upstairs into her room. \"So, have you made up your mind if you want to go out or not?\" Chloe doesn't respond. Instead, she starts rummaging through an ornate jewlery box on her dresser. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know why I asked you to come here?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you tell tell me if you decided to date me or not.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. What I really to do, was to give you this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe holds up a simple golden ring. \"Whoa whoa whoa!\" You say \"I only asked for a date, don't you think it's way too soon to get married?\" \"That's not what this is for.\" She says, sounding somewhat annoyed. \"In our culture, when a male wants to be engaged, so to speak, to a female, she gives him a test to prove to her whether she can trust him or not.\" She places the ring in your palm and closes your fist around it. \"This ring belonged to my grandmother, and means very much to me. Your test, is to take this ring, and keep it with you at all times. If you return it to me in one week, no more, no less, then I shall go out with you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eagerly accept, thinking that this would be simple, and you would have Chloe as your girlfriend before you knew it. How hard could keeping a ring in your pocket be? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow very wrong you were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, as you're exiting the school to head home, you reach into your pocket for what must be the umpteenth time that day, to make sure the ring is still there.</span></div></div>",

Luckily, you see a solution walking down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ramona!\" you call out.

The girls begin removing their bathing suits, seeming to enjoy teasing you while they did it. Before long, they both stood in front of you, with only their fur covering them. \"Well?\" Says Ramona. \"We're waiting.\" She indicates your swim trunks. With another sigh, your grab your trunks and pll them down. At least Ramona and Lucy were nice enough not to make any remarks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three of you try to find a place to lay out your towels, you keep thinking to yourself, there's no one you know here, you just blend in with the crowd. The three of you find a spot close to the water. As you lay back on the sand, Lucy and Ramona on either side of you, you noticed that there are a good amount of furries on vacation here too. Reptiles, felines, dogs, all kinds of them sunbathing or playing around in the ocean. Unfortunately, Lucy catches you staring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying the view?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!

You feel your face burn red as you blush. \"What's wrong? You're okay with looking at other girls naked, but you can't handle me?\" Says Lucy teasingly. You suddenly feel Ramona wrap her arm around you from behind. \"Hey, don't I get some attention?\" She says as she presses her chest against your back. You were pretty sure that by now your face was so read, your head looked like a tomato. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make things worse, turns out you were wrong about no one you know being here, becuase you see one such person coming up the shore towards you right now.

We didn't plan to come here. We just went with the flow of things.\" Lucy said back. She then got up and stood face to face with her cousin. \"Besides, what's so bad about humans anyway. They're cool, especially [your name]. Why do you even care who I hang out with?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're my cousin, and if you're hanging out with a human, I'm a loser by association. I'm not letting you waste your time with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's two things wrong with that Luke.\" she said. \"One, I'm older than you by four months, so you can't tell me what to do. Two, you know that we live in a matriarchal society, so even if you were the older cousin, you're still a little bitch compared to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you and Ramona looked at each other. \"I think they forgot that they're in the middle of a beach.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meh, nobody's really looking or anything.\" she said back. \"Either they don't notice or they don't care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even so, this argument is starting to get annoying.\" you said. You then got up on your feet. \"Didn't you say you came here with Chloe? I don't see her with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's at the hotel. We're staying at a real fancy place, since I can afford it.\" Luke said, showing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so you're here at a nude beach by yourself with a bunch of girls around?\" Ramona rhetorically asked. \"I bet Chloe would love to hear how you're cheating on her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, please. It's not cheating if I don't touch anything.\" Luke said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are such a scumbag.\" said Lucy, looking at her cousin with a look of disgust. \"C'mon, you guys, let's go somewhere else.\" So the three of you relocated to another location at the beach. As you all got back to the hotel sometime later, you had a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, if female furries can sense dishonesty, and Luke was obviously lying to Chloe about where he was, why didn't Chloe sense it?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He probably used the 'tell the truth, but not the whole truth' loophole.\" Ramona explained. \"Of course that sly fox would have figured that out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, you took a shower, and when you dried off and open the bathroom door-</span></div></div>",

You get dressed and meet Lucy in the hotel lobby. \"Where's Ramona?\" You ask \"She decided to go off on her own for a while. Come on, we've got a lot to see.\" She grabs your arm and prectically drags you out of the hotel into the street. Your first stop was the Eiffel Tower. The two of you took the elevator up to the top, and looked out on the city. It was quite beautiful at night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel Lucy place her hand over yours, and almost expect her to try to kiss you, but she doesn't. Next the two of you decided to hit a local restaurant for dinner. Unfortunatley, the entire menu was in french, so you had no idea what anything was. Fortunatley, Lucy had studied several of earth's languages and was able to translate the menu for you. That was lucky for you, because you almost ended up ordering a platefull of frog legs and snails. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dinner, the the two of you went for a stroll in the park. \"Well, this was a pleasent evening.\" Says Lucy happily. \"Yeah.\" You say \"And we still have six more days here.\" Suddenly, you see a sight that instantly makes your blood boil with rage. About then yards away from you, you see Luke and Chloe sitting on a park bench, making out. even though Chloe wasn't interested in you, the fact that she was dating a lying, cheating, racist prick like Luke just fills you with pure anger. even if she wouldn't date you, she deserves better than him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, you get an idea. You could tell chloe right now how Luke had been at the nude beach this morning, that might piss her off enough to break up with him.

You cautiously approached the group, you watched each of the girl's gaze, doing your best to not be noticed even though you were walking through an empty hallway, although you could feel Ramona's gaze never once leave your back. You made it about a foot from her before she decided to turn, straight towards you, here eyes meeting with yours. You froze in place, any thought of a hello dissipating on your lips as her deep green eyes transfixed you, although your small trance didn't last long as you felt something latch itself onto you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Chloe, it's that boy from Earth, isn't he just so cute\" you hear from beside you. Turning your head slightly you see a smaller cream-coloured rabbit furry latched tightly onto your arm her ample chest surrounding your arm. Although she was smaller than you for the moment you could feel her becoming larger each second she held onto you. However before she could become as tall as you Chloe walked over and gently pushed the rabbit furry off you. \"Janice what exactly do you think you're doing?\" Chloe says her gaze becoming a piercing stare as she looked at the other fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean what am I doing? Look at him he's adorable, I just wanna cuddle him a bit.....maybe take him behind the school and have some fun...\"Janice replies her voice trailing off at the end. Chloe for her part looked quite the opposite of what you would have expected, she looked almost disgusted with the rabbit fur, although you had no idea why as Ramona told you that Janice's behaviour was normal. She turned to you for a second \"sorry about that, I'm Chloe Benson by the way\" she says a small very cute smile crossing her features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.... I'm [Steven]\" you reply, she continues to smile although you could feel the rest of the female furs moving closer \"see you later\" you say quickly before running back over to Ramona. Ramona for her part was just standing there looking more than a little shocked \"wow I didn't expect you to get out of there unscathed\" she says \"I knew Chloe was a good girl, but I wasn't expecting her to defend you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you wouldn't happen to know why she would do something like that would you Ramona?\" you ask. She just shakes her head in reply, \"I've known Chloe for a few years, but as I said, if you were on your own....well you probably wouldn't be a virgin for very long, so I don't know why she'd stand up for you. Although it is possible that she might like you\" Ramona says playfully pushing you. \"Sure sure\" you reply. Ramona looked like she had another remark but just as she was about to speak the bell rang for your next class. \"Race you to class\" Ramona says before taking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ramona wait up\" you yell running after her, thankfully you were able to catch up to her as she stood outside a classroom \"don't do that\" you say glaring at her as you catch up \"you're not only my guard but my only guide to this school at the moment.\" Ramona smiled at you \"sorry, you're right I really shouldn't have left you, forgive me?\" she says a slight whine escaping her lips as her head turned slightly to the side, her eyes seeming to grow big and teary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright I forgive you, just stop giving me that look\" you say her face instantly changing from the sad pouty look she was giving you to a smile before she walked into the classroom. \"Ramona you are such a cheat\" you mutter to yourself before you follow her into the classroom. Like the hallway the classroom was filled with female furs, although thankfully your first class was mathematics, which you normally loathed, but it was one of the few classes with a male teacher. Like the hall you were swarmed with female furs trying to get your attention either through compliments or questions, a few even trying to cop a feel, although Ramona hit their hands away. Thankfully it only lasted a few seconds before Mr.Markus, cleared his throat \"girls I know you are all excited about our newest student, however your hormones will not delay or interrupt my class, now everyone sit down or else\" he barks, being a dog furry this was literal. Every girl expect Ramona went scrabbling for a seat, their eyes coming to focus squarely on Mr.Markus, you choose an empty seat and sit down Ramona taking the desk to your right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now class we're going to start with some very simple algebra\" he says moving to the board and writing down a question. \"Alright can anyone solve the equation?\" he asks. You raise your hand and he nods in your direction, \"X = 2, Y = 3\" you say, he smiles \"very good, that is correct, now moving on\" he says. This continued for a few minutes although you were the only one who ever answered any of the questions, and you weren't the only one who noticed. Finally Mr. Markus had enough \"Ms. Thierson could you answer this next question?\" he asks. \"Umm...what?\" she says her head snapping back to face Mr. Markus, you could see him frown, \"ladies if you are not going to be able to pay attention just because there is one boy in the classroom we are going to have real problems\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamona raises her hand and he nods in her direction \"the answer is X = 5, Y = 6, Z = 2\" she says. Mr. Markus literally sighs in relief \"thank you Ms. Barks, it's nice to know at least one of the girls in my class can pay attention, as for the rest of you I will not lie, you don't have to pay attention in my class, however I can and will fail you do I make myself clear\" he says.  A smattering of \"yes Mr.Markus\" was the only reply he got. He sighed and got back to his lessons, before long the bell sounded for the class to change and Ramona led you to your next class which was English, thankfully you had a male teacher for English as well so the girls were kept relatively under control during the start of the class. Though there were only 3 male teachers in the whole school, even if you lucked out and got the 3rd, there were 4 classes in a day. English however went much differently then math, the girls were focused quite intently on the class, a few girls even using their ability to grow larger to make sure they were the ones chosen to answer questions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were quite happy that you weren't having to answer all the questions as although you were smart, you didn't know everything and even though you knew it wasn't really your fault you didn't like the fact that it was your mere presence was disturbing the math class. You gave off a very soft sigh, although Ramona apparently heard it as you felt a pencil jab you in the arm, you turned to look at her and she quietly passed you a note. \"What's wrong?\" it asked. You stared at her for a few seconds debating wether to tell her before quickly writing on the opposite side \"math\" and passing it back. You pass it back and she looked confused at your answer \"what about math?\" she writes back. \"I'm a distraction\" you reply, and she gives you a small smile she was about to pass you another note before you hear a loud \"ahem\" and the two of you look up to see Mr. Snythe the teacher staring at the two of you \"are you two passing notes?\" he says his gaze switching between the two, \"she was just giving me direction on how to get to places since I don't know my way around\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr.Snythe stare at you for a second before nodding \"very well, but could you please wait till after my class and do it then\" he says. You nod and he walks back to the front of the class continuing his lecture, the class soon ending after that.</span></div></div>",

You turn to look to your right and you bump right into somebody. It was Chloe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hello.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" she says back. \"We've got to stop meeting like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Ramona says. \"I see an empty table over there. Wanna sit with us, Chloe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the three of you spent lunch together, talking and laughing. You felt so good having Chloe around you. She had a presence about her that you found very attractive. At the end of the day you, Ramona, and Chloe meet up at the front door of the school, then somebody comes along that ruins your mood: Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell do you think you're doing?\" he asks you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you blabbering about, Luke?\" you ask, not in the mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're hanging out with MY girlfriend!\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe lets out a frustrated sigh while rubbing her temple. \"We've been over this, Luke.\" she said. \"I'm not your girlfriend, I never was, and I never will be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Ramona stifled some giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's right.\" Ramona says after getting herself together.\" You've been saying that Chloe was your girlfriend since middle school. You know that you're not getting any. Give it up, already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke turns red and walks away without another word. The three of you laugh as you leave the school building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my mom's picking me up in a few minutes.\" Chloe says. \"I'll see you guys tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye.\" you and Ramona say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of you began to walk back home, you tell Ramona: \"Man, Chloe is so cute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask her out, then.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I can't do that!\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because then she'll think that I'm coming on to strong, then she won't like me, and then our friendship would be all weird and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you need to pull yourself together.\" Ramona interrupts. \"Chloe's not the type of girl that would embarrass you if she rejected you. The worst thing that she'd do is say no.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right.\" you say. You approach Chloe and you begin to pop the question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chloe, I was wondering...\" you begin, \"if you would like to hang out somewhere on Friday night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she say?</span></div></div>",

Now, we both know that a teenager's hormones are a little awkward at this stage in life. That's another reason why girls are always chasing after a boy. If a girl wants you, and you reject her, one of two things will happen. She'll either be mature about it and walk away, or try and take you by force. Fortunately, there's a 1/4 chance that the latter will happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those are still pretty risky odds.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why there's the system.\" Colin replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"System?\" you ask, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every Friday, the girls all get together in the locker room and discuss the most desirable boys in the school.\" Colin explains. \"If you happen to be one of them, a girl is likely to 'claim' you. That means that this girl gets to pursue you for an entire week. If more than one girl wants you, then they will decide amongst themselves who will pursue you on which day. When the next meeting comes, if your name comes about in discussion, another girl might want you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a lot to take in.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but the sooner you know, the better off you are.

You look in the direction the voice was coming from and see Ramona waving at you. You give a sigh of relief and sit next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must feel lucky that I'm in this class.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of.\" you say. You hear the rest of the girls in the class muttering to themselves in frustration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess the new guy is a chubby chaser.\" you hear one of them say. Then you hear Ramona growling. You put your hand on her shoulder, which calms her down for some reason. Just then, the door opens quickly. You see a girl who walks in, breathing heavily from lack of oxygen. She was obviously running to class, thinking that she was late. She didn't seem like the type of girl that would be dying to get you into her pants, but you can never be sure on this planet. The only empty seat in the class was on your right side, since Ramona was sitting in the seat to your left. She quietly walks over to the vacant spot while you go over what she looked like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a mouse furry, like Colin, but her fur was an auburn color. She wore glasses and had long hair that matched her fur in one ponytail that went down her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that?\" you ask Ramona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her? That's Maylene.\" she says. \"She's like, the smartest girl in our grade, maybe even the entire school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Maylene takes her seat next to you, you decide to be nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" you say. She jumped a little when she heard your voice. \"Are you t-talking to me?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" you say. You introduce yourselves to each other, but that's as far as you got with her. She was obviously very shy, and you didn't want to come off as pushy or annoying, so you decide to leave her alone. After class, the rest of the morning goes by quickly. You and Ramona were walking around the lunch area when you are approached by somebody.</span></div></div>",

Then again, the less girls lusting after you, the better. Just then you heard someone speaking to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.

You knew that male furries could enhance any of their five senses, especially hearing, so you decide to keep quiet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher, Mr. Jonah, explained how his class worked. You were partly paying attention, until he came to one part in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To encourage student interaction and to help you enhance your study habits, I've paired up each student with another at random so you can be study partners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is it.

Not even Luke could bring you down now. As you were about to leave the school with Ramona, Chloe approaches you. \"Hey, [your name]. I was wondering, is Science one of your best subjects?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a matter of fact, it was. \"Yeah, why?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's just that I'm not very good at science, and I want to get all A's again this year, so I thought that I could use this study partner thing to my advantage.\" she says. Chloe then hands you a piece of paper. \"Here's my phone number and home address.\" You then take a piece of paper, write your number and address on it and give it to her. \"Thanks!\" she says. \"So, is tomorrow okay?\" You nod your head in agreement. \"Alright, see you then!\" Chloe says before walking off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice going Romeo.\" Ramona says.

You spotted Ramona and Colin sitting on the bleachers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you guys.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been waiting for you two.\" Ramona says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were?\" you say, surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We wouldn't want to start dancing without our friends here.\" Colin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You consider me as a friend?\" Chloe asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" Ramona answers. \"Any friend of [your name]'s is a friend of ours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe smiles and lightly blushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, and the teachers trusted us enough not to get any chaperones for the dance.\" Colin adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later you were getting something to drink. You still haven't started dancing with Chloe, though. As you finished your drink, another song starts playing. It had an upbeat, techno feel to it. Chloe gasps in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God!\" she exclaims. \"This is my favorite song!\" She then pulls you onto the dance floor and starts dancing with you. You were never the best dancer, and you knew this for a fact, so you try to go with Chloe's movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What song is this?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have no idea. I just wanted to get you to start dancing.\" she says with a giggle. \"You need to get out of your comfort zone, [your name].\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the song ends, and a slower one starts playing. You knew this was your chance to get close to Chloe. Just then Chloe embraces you with a hug and slowly moves with you. You hugged her back and danced with her. This was probably the best moment of your life. After the song ended, Chloe needed to go to the bathroom, so she excused herself. You used this time to leave the gym and go into the hallway so you can catch yourself. You felt like you were in heaven. You were on the perfect date, with the perfect girl. You walk down the hall and looked down the left corridor and saw Ramona kissing Colin. If that wasn't your cue to get back into the gym, you didn't know what was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you get back inside, you see Chloe sitting on the bleachers. The two of you get back to dancing, and when Ramona and Colin got back, the four of you switched dance partners, so now Ramona was dancing with you, and Chloe with Colin. After a while, you and Chloe decided that it was time to leave. Chloe wanted to get one last drink first, so you tell her that you'll meet her outside. However, as you made your way out, you run into the one furry that you've been wanting to stay away from all night, Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought I told you to stay away from my girl, you little bitch!\" Luke shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou really did not want to deal with this. Not tonight, of all nights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're here with Eileen, you hypocritical piece of shit!\" you answer back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke gets mad and pushes you.\"WHAT THE HELL DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME?!\" Luke was so loud that everyone in the gym turned their attention to you and him, including Chloe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen Luke,\" you say. \"You can keep harassing me if you want, but I promise you that when the day comes where you finally cross the line, I will beat the shit out of you so bad, you'll run home like a scared PUNK!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke has finally had enough. He starts cracking his knuckles. \"I'll take my chances, you little-\" Just then Colin punches him right in the face, out of nowhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been wanting to do that all year.\" Colin says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that you walk outside and stand by the school gates. What were you gonna do now? You and Luke just made a scene in front of everyone, including Chloe. What would SHE think? She'd probably assume that you were just as bad as Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was really brave of you.\" you heard someone say. You turn around and see Chloe shyly smiling at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you're not mad?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I be?\" she asks back. \"You did what you needed to do. Luke needed to be put in his place. He had no right to call me his girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh in agreement. \"You're right. Well, I should be getting you back home.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your way back, Chloe spots a photo booth. She pulls you over to the booth and the two of you take some pictures. It was pretty fun. Finally, you got Chloe back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for walking me back,\" she says. \"Despite what happened with Luke I still had the most wonderful night of my life.\" She then leans forward, gently grabs your shoulders and plants a passionate kiss on your lips. \"Good night.\" you nervously say after the kiss ends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't have to end,\" Chloe says. \"My mom sent me a text during the dance saying that he won't be home until midnight. We can hang out in my house till then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check your watch and see that it's half past ten. What do you say to Chloe?</span></div></div>",

Maybe Bestian history won't be as boring.

You didn't see much of Chloe, which disappointed you. You were about to leave with Colin and Ramona when the three of you hear someone's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Colin!\" the voice says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all turn around to see a white mouse furry with thick fur and bouncy, reddish-pinkish hair that went a little past her shoulders. She was taller than you and Colin but slightly shorter than Ramona, who was two inches taller than you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, sis.\" Colin answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's your sister?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eileen.\" she says. \"And you must be [your name].\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you know my name?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the new kid, and you're a human. <b>Everyone</b> knows your name.\" Eileen says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" you say, embarrassed that everyone at school knows you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, your're pretty cute.\" she says. \"You mind staying after school with me and a couple of my friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try it, Eileen.\" Ramona and Colin say at the same time. Then the three of you leave the school with Eileen just standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try, but I won't go down that easy.\" she says to herself with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, your last period was gym, a class shared by eleventh and twelfth graders, and you just finished changing back into your regular clothes. You were the last to leave the locker room, telling Colin and Ramona that you'd catch up with them later. As you left the locker room, you see Chloe coming out of hers. The two of you exchanged glances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" she says.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" you answer. A smile forms on your face as she walks away, but then a voice breaks your smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, cutie.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn in surprise to see Eileen standing by the door of the girls' locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was waiting for you to get out of there.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice, but I have to go.\" you say hastily as you try to leave, but Eileen grabs your shoulder and pulls you into the girls' locker room. Colin was right, it was huge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen then pushes you to the ground and she crawls on top of you. \"You did well at playing hard to get,\" she says, licking her lips. \"But I ALWAYS get what I want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she do now?</span></div></div>",

It was at that moment that I decided that I had to have you for myself. But when I figured out that you liked Chloe, it made things complicated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you just want me because I look attractive to you?\" you ask, disgusted. \"That's sick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the problem?\" Eileen asks, not even caring. \"It's not my first time doing this. I've taken several boys before you, but you're my first virgin, so I'm gonna make this real good, just for you.\" Your face freezes with fear. \"But for what it's worth, you're far more attractive than any of the boys I've taken. You're someone worth keeping.\" You appreciate the compliment, but you still didn't want Eileen to be the girl you lost your virginity to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just give in,\" she says \"Once you've had a go with me, Chloe will be the last girl on your mind. I'm doing you a favor.\" Eileen lovers her face down to yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...............................................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Colin was waiting outside for her sister to drive him back home, but he didn't see her anywhere. Just then, his laptop starts to sound an alarm. It was the alarm that he set up to ring whenever someone was in the girls' locker room when classes weren't in session. He opened his laptop and looked at the camera footage. His sister was about to rape his best friend! (Well, they had only met a day ago, but he knows a good friend when he sees one.) Colin rushes to the locker room so he can save you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the locker room, Eileen was about to kiss you, and once she does, you were hers for the taking.

Chloe also made it clear that Ramona was the only other female that she trusted to be close to you. Not having random chicks attack you gave you some peace of mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Chloe met up with the rest of your friends, and Ramona suggests that you and Chloe sit at a table alone and make googly eyes at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you think we've made our point clear already?\" you ask her. Ramona leans over to your ear and whispers softly so that Chloe couldn't hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought that you wanted to spend some alone time with your new GF.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I think of it, that is a good idea.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamona rolls her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Chloe sit at the table and start talking. \"I guess we should get to know each other.\" Chloe says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you say. \"You go first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe blushes slightly. \"Okay, well...\" she says. \"I'm an honor student, I like watching movies, I'm really interested in music, and I love singing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you good at singing?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe...\" she says with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, something interrupts you conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chloe!\" you hear a familiar voice say. It wasn't Eileen, so you were a little relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want, Julie.\" Chloe says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know damn well what I want, bitch!\" the rabbit says. \"Save the formalities. I want to make this quick!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should really learn to respect your upperclassmen.\" your \"girlfriend\" says casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT'S A CHALLENGE, PEOPLE!!!\" Luke yells. \"Dude, whip out your camera!\" Luke says to Colin. \"This shit is going on Facebook!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain.... Friggin' Mark Zuckerberg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamona appears at your side. \"The center of her lower back,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you say, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the weak spot for rabbit furries.\" she says. \"Chloe knows this already. This may be short, but damn it's gonna be fun to watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ramona said, it was quick, but it was longer than Ramona expected. Julie was fast, so Chloe had a little difficulty getting to her weak spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the fight, the rest of the school day went by nicely. You saw Eileen on her way to one of her classes, but she didn't see you. After school, you decide to walk home with Chloe since she lived three blocks away from your house.

By the way, um, where do you live?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re looking at it.\u201d You realize you had stopped directly in front of Chloe\u2019s house. She turned and headed towards her front door, turning back and winking at you before going inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, you stood there like a statue, frozen in disbelief at what had just happened. Then, you run home as fast as you can. When you get home, you race upstairs to your room, and practically jump for joy! You really got Chloe to agree to go on a date with you! You smack yourself across the face to make sure you\u2019re not dreaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMACK! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNope! This is real! As you rub your stinging cheek, you come to realize that this will also be the first date you\u2019ve ever gone on in your life. You pray to God that you don\u2019t screw this up, or what\u2019s worse, another girl doesn\u2019t screw it up for the both of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the week went by rather well. No one else had challenged Chloe for you, and you hadn\u2019t seen Eileen since she had tried to rape you. All in all, things were pretty uneventful. You told your parents about your plans for Friday night. Your mother insisted you wear a suit for the occasion, but you told her you were just going to see a movie, not going to the prom. Even when you told them Chloe was a furry, they didn\u2019t seem to mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see what the children will look like.\u201d Your mother said. \u201cMom!\u201d You say. \u201cWe haven\u2019t even dated yet! We\u2019re nowhere near ready to think about that!\u201d \u201cWell, it never hurts to plan ahead.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, it was your big night. You met Chloe at her doorstep exactly at seven. Thankfully, she answered the door, so you didn\u2019t have to meet her parents. \u201cI\u2019ll be back dad!\u201d She called behind her as she shut the door. \u201cSo where are we going?\u201d She asks. \u201cI thought we could catch a movie together.\u201d \u201cSure. Sounds fun!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Beastia had made contact with Earth, there was no such thing as movies. But since then, they had begun making films of their own, as well as importing them from Earth. As You and Chloe arrive at the theater and look at what was playing, you decide to be a gentleman and let Chloe choose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, she picks an action movie. You had expected her to pick on of the Twilight movies that were showing. Sure, you\u2019d rather get a lobotomy than see it again, but at least it would be bearable with Chloe anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou order a large popcorn and two sodas, one for each of you at the concession stand. Halfway into the movie, you reach over Chloe for the popcorn without looking away from the screen and hear an \u201ceep!\u201d You look over at Chloe and, much to your embarresment, you had missed the popcorn, and instead, placed your hand between Chloe\u2019s legs. You both visibly blush, staring at each other in awkward silence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person sitting directly behind you had seen what had just occurred between you and Chloe. To make it worse it was some one you knew! Who was it? </span></div></div>",

However, this didn't make any sense.

You like Chloe, and she seems to like you too, but Ramona's feelings for you were even stronger. Hell, she INSISTED on you choosing Chloe as your fake girlfriend when she could've had you choose her, but Chloe has some concern for you too. She took the time to warn you about the consequences of the whole Eileen situation, and just like Ramona, she'd defend you in a heartbeat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're so deep in thought that you pass your house without noticing, but then the sound of someone singing makes you stop. You could tell that it was a female, and her voice sounded heavenly. When you turn in the direction that the voice was coming from, you see that you had stopped walking right in front of Chloe's house and she was on her front porch singing a song. You remember her saying that she loved to sing, and from what you're seeing, she's damn good at it. Since she has her eyes closed, she doesn't notice you standing there. When she stops singing, she opens her eyes and is surprised to see you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long have you been standing there?\" she asks, blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only a few seconds. You're a great singer, by the way.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" she says. She walks over to you. \"Did you sort things out with Ramona?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I did.\" you answer. \"On another topic, what were you thinking about when you were singing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe blushes again. \"Last night.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even with everything that happened?\" you ask. Chloe nods her head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I was thinking... do you want this relationship to be for real?\" she asks. You say yes without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe giggles. Then she gives you a quick kiss on the lips. \"See you around\" she says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're really stuck, now. You don't know which girl to choose.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Secondly, during your time at the school, you've heard rumors about Jessica's various ex-boyfriends. Of course, those rumors could be bullshit, but it's better to be safe than sorry. Luckily, you brought your trusty can of mace with you on the trip, just in case. You'd have to wait until she tries something first, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want to talk about?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, word on the street is that Chloe and Ramona are your co-mates.\" says Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I heard that most humans were monogamous, so it's a bit of a surprise.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I still find it hard to believe, even now.\" you say. \"But I love the both of them. The thought of having to choose one and hurt the other is too much to bear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" says Jessica, then she looks at you with a glint in her eye. \"You know, if you ever get bored of those two, I'm always available.\" She puts one of her legs over yours while she says this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... no thanks.\" you say nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be shy, cutie.\" she says. \"I know how boys are, they eventually get bored of the woman they're with and seek satisfaction from another. I can be your other.\" She then wraps her arms around you back and says \"Maybe you'd like a demonstration?\" You felt Jessica's arms get bigger, as does the rest of her body. You reach for your mace before her grip gets too tight. You spray the mace right in Jessica's eyes and she screams in pain. As soon as you were free from her grip you run out of the room and head for the stairs, thinking that the elevator wouldn't be a good idea. The hotel had seven floors, including the roof. You were on floor five, which is right in the middle. Chloe was on the ground floor, in the lounge, and Ramona was on the roof, in one of the hot tubs. Where do you go?</span></div></div>",

A giant screen tv takes up one entire wall, showing some movie you've never seen. You frantically look around the room, trying to find Chloe.

I grew to twice my size to cover you, and we landed in the snow safely. I snuck back up here so nobody would know what happened, and you woke up five minutes later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So nobody knows what happened?\" you ask. \"Not even Chloe?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, it's our little secret.\" she says with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last question.\" you say. \"Why don't I feel the slightest bit of pain from the fall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamona chuckles. \"You can thank my girls for that.\" she says, looking down at her chest. You blush at the realization that Ramona's breasts cushioned your fall. You tried not to look directly at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay to stare.\" Ramona says. \"I <i>am</i> your girlfriend, aren't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, won't it make you feel a little uncomfortable?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, and I hope <b>this</b> won't make <b>you</b> feel uncomfortable.\" Without warning, Ramona kisses you deep on the lips. While she kisses you, you realize that this was the first time that Ramona's saved you. When she breaks the kiss, she gives you a smile.

After lunch, you met up with Luke and Collin  and decided to have a snowball fight. To make it more intersting, it was boys versus girls. Each group bulit their own fort and you spent the rest of the afternoon pelting each other with snowballs. Of course, Chloe and Ramona grew to twenty feet tall and sent boulders of snow flying towards the three of you, but doing so had aslo made them larger targets. By the end of it all, you all looked like living snowmen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat evening, everyone packed their things and loaded onto the busses for the airport. You sat next to Ramona, while Chloe sat bhind you, with Luke and Collin in front. Collin and Ramona were busy arguing over who had won the snowball war. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You two cheated by growing into giants!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? You can't cheat in a game where there are no rules!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, you had an unfair advantage!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they were busy bickering, Luke turns around to face you. \"Hey (your name), Luke and I are gonna have a guys' day out this Friday, wanna join us?\" \"Sure.\" You had been spending a lot of time with your girlfriends, but none at all with your new buddies. Not too long ago, you and Luke were worst enemies. If he had asked if you wanted to hang out then, you would have told him to go to hell.Yet here you are now, friends with him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time you boarded the plane home, you were already feeling tired from the day's events, and fell asleep almost as soon as the plane left the ground. The next thing you knew, you were awake in your own bed. Ramona lay next to you, her arm wrapped around you as she looked down at you smiling. \"Sleep well?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You passed out on the plane. You looked like you were having a good sleep, so I carried you home from the airport while Chloe carried the bags.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that you noticed that you face was once again pressed to Ramona's bosom. Ramona giggled as she saw you blush. \"I told you, it's perfectly alright.\" She gently presses you your face deeper into her cleavage. You decided if she was okay with it, you might as well enjoy it, the warmth and softness of her furry breasts feeling like heaven against your face. At this moment, Chloe happens to come in the room and laughs. \"I'm sorry, am I interrupting you two?\" Instead of breaking her hug, Ramona just shakes her head, holding you tighter. \"Not at all. Care to join us?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe week goes by rather quickly and pretty uneventful. At school, you sometimes pass Eileen and Jessica in the hall. The would glare at you, but they didn't try anything. Friday afternoon, you meet Collin and Luke in front of Collin's house. \"So where do you guys wanna go first?\" You ask. \"I know this great place we can hang out downtown. Follow me.\" Says Luke as he leads you and Collin up the street. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to you, Eileen was watching you from her window as you walked by. She smiles evilly as she dials Jessica's number on her phone. \"He's going with my brother to his hang out spot. I'll meet you there. Without those two other bitches to protect him, he'll be ours for sure. Just remeber, I get him first.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does Collin take you?</span></div></div>",

Challenging a newcomer to your best game? For shame.\" Luke says jokingly. You look at the game screen and see that Colin's name covered the high score chart in all the game modes. After looking at the game, you realize that this is similar to Street Fighter. Since you like a challenge, you decide to play against Colin. Hell, you have nothing to lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're on.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Colin fight it out, and it was pretty evenly matched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you so good at this game on your first try?\" he asks in amazement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I learn fast.\" you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight was taking so long that the timer on the top of the screen reached zero, and since you had a tiny bit more health than Colin, you won.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, you're good.\" he says. \"But I'll get you next time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's not gonna be a next time.\" Luke says, with an unusual tone of worry in his voice. \"Look who just got here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Colin turn around and are shocked to see Eileen and Jessica enter the arcade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt they're here to play video games.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick! To the bathroom!\" Luke says, and the three of you bolt to the men's room. By the time Eileen and Jessica spotted you, you had already made your way inside. You lock to door and turn to see Colin on the verge of a panic attack, and Luke didn't look so good, either. You begin to think for a moment, but your train of thought was interrupted by a knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luke, Colin, we know you're in there with [your name].\" says Eileen. \"Hand him over and we'll leave you two alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expected Luke to revert to his old ways and sell you out, but instead, he says \"Can we have a few minutes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get five, and that's it!\" says Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have a plan.\" you whisper to your friends. \"I noticed that this place has low ceilings, and there's a lot of people here, so Eileen and Jessica won't be able to grow to maximum size. All we have to do is work our way through the crowd and then we can just catch a cab to get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds like a good plan, but who knows how long it will take for us to get a cab.\" says Colin. \"We should just call Chloe and Ramona to come get us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows how long it will take them to get here?\" Luke asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If Eileen and Jessica try to bust down the door, they'll attract unwanted attention, and the arcade manager will most likely throw them out.\" Colin explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Colin, I have my mace on me, so if push comes to shove, I'll spray them, then we can just jab at their weak points.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Colin had your own opinions while Luke stayed neutral, so he had the deciding vote on which plan was better.

No matter what I do, they just keep trying and trying.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey keep trying because they know that deep down you\u2019re still scared of them.\u201d says your conscience. \u201cThat alone is all the motivation they need.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that he was right.

I'm taking your virginity, right here, right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer look of anger turns to one of surprise as you just smile, and then begin chuckling, bilding up to full blown laughter. \"Why are you laughing?\" She says \"You're too late.\" you say, smirking. \"Ramona beat you to it.\" \"What!?\"\" Eileen gives you several quick sniffs, inhaling Ramona's unmistakable scent. \"NO!\" She slams her fist into the locker, leaving a large dent. \"HE WAS MINE!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen releases you and just stands there, clenching her fists and grinding her teeth. The crowd of students that had gathered just stood there, waiting for something to happen next. \"what's going on?\" Said Ramona as she pushed her way through the crowd. \"YOU!\" Says Eileen, turning to Ramona on hearing her voice. \"He was supposed to be mine! How could you have gotten him first!?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamona smiles from ear to ear. \"Well Eileen, there are two simple reasons for that. Number one being, I'm his legal mate, and two, I just plain hotter than you are.\" The surrounding girls immediately oohed and ahhed at the serious burn Ramona had given to Eileen's ego. \"That's right!\" She said to the surrounding crowd. \"I fucked him!\" The girls cheered and applauded as Ramona takes you by the hand and walks with you down the hall as Eileen just stands there, humiliated and angry, her face burning red with fury. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the incident in the hall, Ramona lmost instantly replaced Eileen as the most popular girl in school. Your usual lunch table wiuth her and chloe was so crowded by other girls, you had to sit with Luke and Collin. \"She certainly seems to be enjoying herself.\" Said Luke as he watched Ramona talking with her newfound friends. \"I'm happy for her.\" Says Collin. \"Mostly because it's nice to see my sister knocked down a notch.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school, You, Chloe and Ramona were all chatting in your room. \"So get this, some of them asked we they could have a sleepover here!\" \"Ooh, that sounds like fun!\" Said Chloe. They decided to have the sleep ov er this coming Friday. Of course, a sleepover meant girls only, so you would have to find some other way to spend your evening that night. The day before the sleepover, you were having a video chat with collin and Luke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey guys,\" You asked. \"Do you want to get together Friday night? Ramona nd Chloe are having a sleepov er, so they're kicking me out of the house for the night.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, for real?\" Asked Collin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, can you believe it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean this is perfect!

The next day after school, you hid the camera that collin gave you on the bookshelf in the livingroom where the sleepover would be held. At seven o'clcok, you told your mates you were going out with your friends, but what you were really doing was going to Luke's house where you had agreed to meet Luke and Collin in the attic. \"You guys are sure about this?\" You ask. \"Dude, haven't you ever wondered what girls do at sleepovers?\" Said Luke. \"Not really.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard that girls often tell one another personal secrets at sleepovers.\" Said Collin as he set up his laptop. \"Maybe we can use what we record to blackmail them.\" He says with a smirk. even though this was against your better judgement, especially if Chloe and Ramona ever found out, you couldn't help but want to see what they were up to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of you gather around Collin's laptop as the other gilrs start to arrive, with sleepingbags under their arms. Chloe and Ramona had only invited four other girls, none of whom you had met before. Lola the Husky, Maria the raccoon, Angela the fox, and Cleo, a red and yellow dragoness. They gathered in the livingroom and lay their sleepingbags out in a circle, pushing the furniture aside. \"So, shall we get into our...hehehe...sleepware?\" Says Ramona with a smrik. The girlsz nod and begin removing their clothes. It was then that you noticed that none of them had brought pajamas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holly shit!\" Said Luke as the six girls unknowingly put on one hell of a show for the three of you. \"Are they really....?\" All three of you stared transfixed at the screen, unable to look away. The girls were going to sleep naked! \"I told you this would be worth it!\" Says Collin, nudging you in the ribs. \"You didn't reply, but deep down, you couldn't help but enjoy the view. After they finished stripping, the girls sat in a circle deciding what their first activity for the night would be. \"Any suggestions?\" Says Chloe.</span></div></div>",

All the other girls were just as eager to play. Colin and Luke high-five each other. \"Dude! That is the best game humans have ever invented!\" Luke exclaims. \"I don't think the creators of this game had this situation in mind when they invented it.\" you say. \"Besides, there are many cases where nobody gets twisted up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well there's gonna be five of them on one mat while one of them spins the wheel. Plus, they're furries, so their tails will get all tangled and stuff.\" Colin says. You know he's a smart guy, but you wish he'd use his intelligence for other things once in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCleo volunteered to spin the wheel this round. Some of the girls gave sighs of relief because this meant that Cleo's scales wouldn't be scratching anyone. You, Colin, and Luke were amazed at all the awkward positions the girls ended up in. \"This is gold.\" Colin says. \"When this is over, I'm gonna watch this again just for the sake of watching it again.\" \"Same here.\" you and Luke say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you guys doing up there?\" someone from downstairs says. It sounded like a female, so the three of you were screwed because you can't lie. Luke didn't seem worried, though. \"Nothing, Lynette!\" he says. \"We're just fooling around on Colin's computer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay.\" says Luke's sister, and you hear her walking away from the staircase leading to the attic. \"How did she not suspect anything?\" you ask in amazement. \"Because I told her the truth,\" he says, \"but not the whole truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy did you not think of that before?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring one of the rounds, Maria say something that takes everyone, including you and your friends, by surprise. \"You know who I'd like to play this game with?\" she says. \"Who?\" asks Lola. \"That cute little mouse boy in my math class.\" she says, blushing. \"Wait, you mean Colin?\" asks Cleo. Maria blushes even harder. \"Looks like you have a secret admirer.\" you say, nudging Colin with your elbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, at ten minutes past midnight, the girls get tired and go to sleep. \"Well, that's the end of that.\" says Luke. \"Not entirely. We should still keep the camera rolling in case the girls try any pranks.\" says Colin. With that, he plugs in the charger so his computer doesn't run out of power, and the three of you fall asleep in the attic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, the three of you wake up and look at the computer screen. All the girls were fully clothed and Lola, Maria, Angela, and Cleo were just getting ready to leave. Once they're gone, Chloe pulls out her cell phone and starts dialing a number. A few seconds later, your cell phone rings. \"Hello?\" you say. \"Hey, you can come back home, now.\" she says. So Colin shuts off the camera and his computer, and the two of you leave Luke's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you get home, you go up to your room to see Ramona and Chloe listening to a record player. \"I didn't know you guys were into old music.\" you say. \"Not really.\" Ramona says. \"Chloe was just showing me some tracks from one particular artist.\" \"Really? Who?\" you ask. Chloe tosses you the case for the record, and you look at the singer on the cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a lady, and a cat furry as well. She had long blonde hair, and light orange fur. You look at the singer's name. \"Olivia Lockheart?\" you say, confused that she looked like she was related to Chloe. \"Wait a sec.\" you say. \"Yep. That's my grandma.\" she says with a smile. This explains Chloe's knack for singing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what were you doing last night?\" Ramona asks. You decide to try out the trick that Luke showed you. \"Oh, me and Colin just crashed at Luke's house and used Colin's laptop.\" you say. \"They probably watched stupid YouTube videos all night long.\" Chloe says to her co-mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was somewhat right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, after you remove the hidden camera from the bookshelf, you pass by Chloe's mother's bedroom door and over hear her talking to her daughter. She was saying something about a family member coming to visit for the winter break. Who's coming to visit?</span></div></div>",

I'll help you out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you go home, you tell Chloe and Ramona about Colin's date. \"Heh, I never knew the guy had it in him.\" Ramona says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I just can't get over the fact that Natasha's older sisters would tell her to dress like that.\" Chloe says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think they told her that to make her look bad?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no other reasonable explanation.\" she answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, all we have to do is make sure that Colin doesn't fuck this up.\" says Ramona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or that nobody else fucks it up for him.\" you say. \"Eileen may be out of the picture, for now, but Natasha's sisters might sabotage this date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following night, you, Chloe, and Ramona go to the movies. The three of you were going to keep an eye on Colin and Natasha without Colin knowing. Natasha looked especially beautiful tonight. she had on a purple blouse and a navy blue skirt. So far, the date seemed to go well, but once Colin and Natasha got their snacks, someone shows up, looking for troublr.</span></div></div>",

Before I get started, I have a treat for you! I'm not gonna be singing alone today. I want you all do give a warm welcome to my granddaughter, Chloe Benson!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe, apprehensively steps out onto the stage at first, but after hearing how loud the crowd is cheering, she gets more comfortable.

The door opens and you see Chloe, Claire and a brown cat furry.This must be Missy. Part of her face is cream colored, as well as her chest and stomach fur. You can tell because she has on a top that shows her midsection. She has long, brown hair and a long tail. Her arms, legs, ears, and tail have stripes of a darker brown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Chloe!\" she says. \"You never told me that you had a mate!\"<br>\r\n                        <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and for good reason.\" Chloe mumbles to herself.

Missy, I don't want you talking to Chloe, or either of her friends for the rest of the night, understand?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe was grateful for that, and the rest of the evening was rather quiet. \"Now you see why I don't like her.\" Says Chloe later that night in your room. \"Yeah, she's really an insensitive bitch.\" Says Ramona \"I think we need to teach her a lesson.\" They both look over to you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You explain everything to them, and that calms them down. \"So you were just jealous of us the whole time?\" Chloe asks. Missy nods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, if you're going on your first date, we need to get you ready!\" Says Chloe excitedly, eager to get Missy to leave the three of you alone. The three girls head to the mall to prepare Missy for her date, while you wait at home. That night, you all sit in the living room, as Missy paces back and forth in her new dress, waiting for look to arrive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what's this guy like?\" Missy asks \"To tell you truth, he used to be a real dick to me and Ramona, but he started respecting me after I kicked a girl in the stomach.\" \"You hit a girl?\" Missy asks, shocked \"Hey, it was self defense! She was gonna rape me. You would have done the same.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the doorbell rings. \"That must be him!\"Squeals Missy excitedly. You get up to answer the door, and you are surprised to see Luke, wearing a tuxedo! \"Wow, Luke.

As you, your mates, Lynette and Josh sit around a table waiting your orders, you got to talking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Lynette, what do you think of Josh?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So far so good. He seems like a nice enough guy, and that accent of his I find kind of cute.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosh tries to hide it, but you could swear you saw him blush. He stands and heads toward the bathroom. \"I think you embarrassed hi.\" Says Chloe, smirking. Just then, your heart drops into your stomach as you see Eileen, who had been sitting at a booth in the corner, watching you the whole time. She gets up and follows Josh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit! Eileen's here!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant you say that, Ramona, Chloe and Lynette shot up from the table and go to confront her. \"I'll handle this.\" Says Lynette \"We'll come with. She can't handle all of us.\" Says Ramona.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After a few moments, Eileen came flying out the door like a frisbee, crashing into a vacant table. She was followed by Lynette, with Josh by her side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, the commotion caused quite a scene. Everyone in the restaurant was watching. \"Keep your hands off my boyfriend!\" Says Lynette as Chloe and Ramona pin Eileen's arms to the ground. As Eileen struggles to get back up, cursing at the three other females, you ask Josh if he's alright. \"I'm okay, mate.\" He says I was just washing my hands when this mouse lassy comes in and start flirting with me. Then Lynette came and sucker punched her upside the head.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn and look down at Eileen. \"You just never give up, do you?

Now here she is, pinned under the combined force of Chloe, Ramona, and Lynette, with you talking down to her. There's no way she's gonna let you talk down to her like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go to hell, [your name],\" she says, pouring every bit of hate that she had into that brief statement.

With Eileen unconscious, the vixen turns to Josh, with a warm smile on her face. \"Sorry about that interruption,\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No harm done, lassie,\" he says. \"We can have a go at this date another time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who says it has to end now, sweetheart,\" she says with a seductive look in her eyes. \"The night's not over yet, and I want to take you back to my place.

Colin made sure to look casual, but at the same time look his best. His breath was extra fresh, and he had a pack of mints in his pocket just in case. \"You ready?\" you ask him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe takes a deep breath and looks at the door. \"As ready as I'll ever be,\" he says before ringing the doorbell. A few moments later, the door opens, and Lynette looks down at you two with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! Hey, guys! Luke didn't tell me you were coming. Come on in.

I was wondering if I could take you out on a date sometime. Wherever you want to go, I'll try to make it happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynette is practically speechless at this point.

We also help do maintenance on our tanks too, so if we break it, we fix it\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter driving for a few minutes you arrive at the nearby military base and pass through the checkpoint at the entrance, he pulls up to a small hanger like building and parks. He gets out and the four of you follow him inside, inside the hanger was a Abrams battle tank with the turret pointing to the rear. Besides Mark, there was no one in sight, \"Paul you still here?\" Marks yells, \"in here\" you hear a voice come from the turret. \"Well get out here\" says Mark, you hear some clanking and faint swearing emanating from the turret followed by a head popping out of one of the hatches. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man in soiled coveralls with machine grease smeared on his hands and face climbs out, he sees the four of you and pauses, \"I didn't realize you brought company\" he says, Mark walks over and introduces Paul to everyone, you notice Paul seemed a little more interested in Missy than everyone else \"I'd shake your hands, but I'm a little covered in grease right now\" he says. He looks over at Mark, \"so where we going for lunch?\", \"same place as usual\" says Mark. \"Ok I'm going to go get cleaned up, I can meet you there\" he says, he leaves toward the parking lot, \"do you guys have a hotel yet?\" asks Mark, \"no we just got here when I bumped into you\" you tell him. \"Well I have a guest room that you can use if you want and I can help get you a decent hotel room too\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for helping us\" says Chloe, \"its the least I could do, come on lets go drop your bags off at my house for now\" says Mark. The four of you get back in the jeep and leave the base, after ten minutes you arrive at Mark's house, as you get out of the jeep a female fox furry opens the front door and peeks out from the door way. Mark waves her over and she walks over to him, \"guys this is Sheila, my wife. Sheila this is Chloe, Ramona, Missy, and *<u>your name here</u>* my brother\" says Mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter introductions are made and the jeep unloaded everyone heads inside to stow bags and wait for Paul to call saying he was ready. Half an hour later Mark's phone vibrates, \"Paul just texted my he's on his way to the restaurant so we should leave now\"he says. The four of you get back in the jeep and head to the restaurant, just as Mark parks, Paul was walking into the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the restaurant and find a table for the six of you with Missy sitting next to Paul. The whole time you were enjoying your lunch, Missy and Paul were having their own conversation. As you get up to leave you overhear some of their conversation, \"so 8:00?\" asks Paul, \"8 is fine\" says Missy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*skip to that evening*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor today all four of you are staying at Mark's house and you'll get a hotel tomorrow, you are in the living room with every one else , \"so Sheila how did you and Mark meet?\" asks Ramona, \"I volunteer as a nurse down at the infirmary and one day he came in with some type of injury and we started talking and one thing led to another\" says Sheila. Suddenly there's a knock on the door, Missy gets up from the couch and walks over to the door and opens it to Paul standing there, \"you ready to go?\" he asks, \"yeah let me go grab my coat\" she says, \"So where are you guys going?\" asks Chloe. \"We're going to see a movie \" says Paul, \"ok lets go\" says Missy with her coat on, they leave and you hear them drive away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope the date goes well\" says Chloe</span></div></div>",

Which is exactly what happens when one of Cleo's swings hits Maria in the chest, sending her across the room into the sofa, knocking it and Maria over backwards. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first the girls stopped fighting as they stared in awe at what just happened. But Maria gets back on her feet, a little disoriented, but no injuries.

The other girls  woot and  say things like \"You go girl!\" while Luke and Collin were laughing like hyenas. \"I guess you like the big girls, huh?\" Collin says jokingly, nudging you with his elbow. \"Oh shut up.\" You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls continue talking, the show starts to get kind of boring, until.......</span></div></div>",

I've been watching [your name] in my art class and he's really good. Does he have a sketchbook around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think so...\" she answers. \"It might be on the bookshelf.\" This worries you; not because the camera is on the bookshelf, but you have some.... \"suggestive\" drawings in your sketchbook. It was at this point that you decide to enforce a \"don't touch my stuff\" rule from now on. You're train of thought gets derailed as you hear Chloe shriek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell!\" she yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, shit!\" the three of you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong, Chloe?\" Ramona asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's a camera on the bookshelf!\" she yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT!?\" all the other girls say in unison. Colin quickly takes a bottle out of his pocket. He twists the cap off and pours three pills into his hand, handing one to you, and one to Luke. \"Take these, quick.\" Assuming that he knows what he's doing, you and Luke take the pills as Colin takes his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the girls were clamoring over who planted the camera. Chloe silences the girls and whips out her phone and dials a number, then puts it on speaker. Your phone vibrates in your pocket, and your blood freezes. \"Don't worry, just lie.\" says Colin. You look at him as if he were crazy, and so does Luke. \"Trust me.\" says Colin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly answer the phone. \"Hey, sweetie.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't 'Hey, sweetie' me!\" yells Chloe. \"We found your camera!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What camera?\" you ask, although you surprised yourself because you sounded like you were actually telling the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The camera on the bookshelf!\" Ramona yells into the phone. \"You, Luke, and Colin are probably somewhere watching us right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just leaving the movies.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really?\" Ramona says suspiciously. \"What movie did you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amazing Spider-Man.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird...\" says Maria. \"He's not lying.\" this shocked every girl in the room. Out of all the furry species on Bestia, raccoons were the best at sensing dishonesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, okay then...\" Chloe says, completely confused. \"Sorry for accusing you.\" She hangs up the phone and the girls start talking about who could've planted the camera. \"Maybe it was one of those perverted freshman boys.\" suggests Lola. \"That makes sense...\" says Cleo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did they not know I was lying?\" you ask, astonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Female furries can sense dishonesty because their auditory nerves are like lie detectors.\" Colin explains. \"These pills cause our voices to sound like we're telling the truth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, but why did all three of us have to take a pill?\" Luke asks. \"Because I wasn't sure who Chloe was going to call.\" explains Colin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, the girls stop talking about the subject and were about to go to sleep. Before Chloe and Ramona get to bed, you call Chloe's phone. \"Hello?\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chloe, I came across some creep in an alley a block away from the house watching something on his laptop.\" you say. \"When I saw that he was watching all of you on his laptop, I snatched it from him and deleted the file. He ran away before I could get a good look at his face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well at least the tape is gone.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna crash at Luke's tonight. I'll see ya tomorrow.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I love you.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you too, bye.\" you say, before hanging up the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome.\" says Luke. Colin pours three more pills and splits them among the three of you. \"Just in case they ask us anything tomorrow.\"</span></div></div>",

You duck behind a bush just in case they were still suspicous from last night. You quickly swallow the pill Collin gave you before heading inside. Chloe is waiting for you in the living room. \"Hey (your name). Can we talk?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this is about last night, I already told you....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's not about that.

Oh shit, you think, now I'm fucked. \"I found this after discovering that camera last night.\" Says Chloe \"I couldn't help but take a look through it, and I saw some rather...interesting sketches.\" You start to sweat as she flips through the book, wishing this would just end. She stops at a page. \"Particularly this one.\" She shows you a sketch you made of Chloe lounging naked on a beach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I can explain...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax, I'm not mad.

Perfect, your least favorite class with your least favorite furry. The boys' locker room was smaller in comparison to the girls' (for obvious reasons), and you and Luke were the only boys in the class, according to the list. As the two of you were changing, (on opposite sides of the room to avoid confrontation) you see someone come into the room. You couldn't see who the furry was, but you automatically assume it was a girl trying to sneak in, but then you recognize the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, [your name].\" the furry said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Colin? Is that you?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who were you expecting?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, no one in particular. Besides, I didn't even know you were in this class.\" you say. \"Your name wasn't on the list.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Typo.\" Colin briefly explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, look who's here.\" a certain fox furry says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that's our cue to leave.\" you say, rolling your eyes as you and Colin leave the locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't tell you two asswipes to go anywhere!\" Luke calls out to the two of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not my boss.\" you answer back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you exit the locker room, you see all the girls sitting on the bleachers. Some were staring at you, others were staring at Colin. The two of you take your seats where nobody else was sitting, then you see the teacher walk out of her office. She was a badger furry. She was wearing a school t-shirt, shorts, and a red cap. She then took a look at you and walked over to where you were sitting. \"Well,\" she says. \"You must be the Earth student the other teachers were talking about. My name is Miss Oliver, and I'm the gym teacher.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure of what to say, you just tell her \"Umm... Nice to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well at least I know you have manners.\" Miss Oliver says with a chuckle. \"Okay kids, today we're playing dodgeball!\" All the girls cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, they play dodgeball on this planet?\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Colin says. \"It's the most popular sport since females have more physical strength than males. This sport makes it easy for them to show off that strength.\" Your head sinks. Wonderful, it's your first day, and already you're at risk of getting injured. What next?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luckily, males have more flexibility and agility than females, so we can dodge and catch anything that comes our way.\" Colin says. \"So we're not at a total disadvantage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made you feel a little better. Ms. Oliver separates the class into two teams. Unfortunately, Colin was put on the other team with Luke. When the game starts, balls start to fly faster than you've ever seen. You managed to dodge every single one that came your way, and you even hit a few of your opponents. After a while it was down to Colin and Luke on one side, and you and a leopard furry on the other. Luke has been trying to knock you out for the entire game, and now he had a clear shot. He sees Colin with a ball in his hand, the only ball on their side of the field, so he snatches the ball and pushes Colin to the ground, allowing him to get hit with a ball. Luke then throws the ball at you. You duck and the ball hits the leopard furry on your side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one ball on each side of the field. Sudden death. You pick up the ball on your side, while Luke picks up the one on his. Then you realized: Luke gets agitated easily, so you can use that to your advantage. An evil smile forms on your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like you're not as good as you think,\" you say. \"Does that mean all that talk was for nothing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke is real mad now. He puts all his strength into one last throw, but he was so agitated, he forgot to aim and misses you badly. You then throw the ball in your hand at him and it hits him in the chest, knocking him to the ground. The entire class cheered, Colin cheering the loudest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter class ends, Miss Oliver dismisses the class to the locker rooms. You were the last one to get to them, so there was steam obscuring your vision. You open a door and walk in. Then you see all of the girls taking showers and changing. They all squeal in delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, my god! It's [your name]!\" one of them says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw shit!\" you think to yourself. One of the girls hugs you and starts kissing your neck, moaning. You get her off of you and exit the locker room. Then you go to the correct one. After you change into your regular clothes, you look in the mirror to make sure that you don't have a hickey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLATER..................<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school day ends and you were about to leave with Ramona and Colin (you found out that Colin actually live across the street from you) when Chloe approaches you. Your friends tell you that they'll wait for you outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you're [your name]?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you say. \"How did you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard about what happened in gym.\" she says. \"So, I thought you were pretty cool and was wondering if you wanted to hang out with me on Saturday.\" You thought about it for a second. You were supposed to hang out with Ramona on Saturday, but Chloe was your dream girl (despite you only knew her for a day) and you didn't want to miss out on a chance to go out with her. But Ramona is the closest friend you have on Bestia, perhaps the closest friend you've <b>ever</b> had.  What do you do?</span></div></div>",

The days pass, and you and Chloe become good friends, while you also hang out with Ramona and Colin. However, it was weird that whenever you were with Chloe, Ramona wasn't around, and vise-versa. Saturday night had arrived, and you walked over to Ramona's house. You see her waiting for you by her front porch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long were you waiting?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only two minutes.\" she replies before the two of you head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why did you pick Saturday of all days to hang out with me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's 'cause my mom planned on bringing her boyfriend over and I was not gonna be around <b>that</b>.\" she says with a shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever since my parents got divorced, Mom's been trying to 'fill the void' if you get what I mean.\" Unfortunately, you did get it. \"I feel more sorry for her than I am disgusted by her.\" she adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's your dad?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He moved to another town. I basically switch between Mom and Dad's houses every two weeks.\" Ramona explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.\" was all you could say. \"By the way, where are we going?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To the park, I want to show you something.\" she answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you arrive at the park and Ramona leads you to a small path through the woods. At the end of the path was a big lake lit up by the stars. You both sit at the edge of the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this what you wanted to show me?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" she answers. \"My dad always told me that one day, I would find someone that I felt would be really close to me, and if I found that person, I should bring them here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" you say. \"Well, it is true that we're best friends.\" That was the first time you actually admitted it. Ramona was your best friend. She was there for you since the day she met you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"[Your name],\" Ramona says, \"Did you ever wonder why I was always so nice to you?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because we're friends.\" you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's true,\" she says. \"But I.....\" she trailed off, not knowing what to say.

Instead, he punches her square in the stomach. That really did it! You grab a baseball bat sticking out of a nearby trash can, and quietly approach Luke from behind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mighty swing, you bring your bat  crashing into to the side of Luke\u2019s head. WHAM! Luke was knocked out before he hit the ground, falling sideways in a heap, a large red lump on his temple. \u201cHome run.\u201d You say with a grin. For a moment Chloe stood there in shock. Then she grabs you in a bear hug, planting multiple kisses all over your face, saying \u201cThank you!\u201d over again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe finally releases you, giggling. I guess I get carried away a little?\u201d Now it was your turn to stand there in shock.

This was the most eventful Saturday of your life, and to make up for it, Sunday was a total bore. On Monday morning, you walk outside your souse and see Ramona waiting where she usually does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ramona.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi.\" she says back. As you were about to head off to school, you see Colin come out of his house to join you two. \"Hey, you guys!\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fancy seeing you walking to school today.\" Ramona says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sister, Eileen usually drives me to school, since she has her own car.\" Colin answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamona grunts in frustration. \"I need <b>my</b> own car.\" You and Colin laugh when you hear a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up, guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all turn and see Chloe walking towards you. Your heart jumped in surprise and joy, while Ramona's demeanor took a nose dive. When the four of you got to school, Chloe stops you before you go in. \"Maybe you should hold my hand, so the other girls will back off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not a two-year-old.\" Ramona quietly mutters to herself. When you and Chloe walk in, a group of girls was about to rush you, but the sight of you and Chloe holding hands stopped them in their tracks. Chloe turns to you and smiles. \"Come on,\" she says. \"I have an idea.\" She pulls you to the main hallway, where most of the students were. The two of you stand in the middle of the hall and Chloe looks deep into your eyes. You never thought that Chloe would kiss you, right then and there. You eventually close your eyes and kiss her back. When Chloe breaks the kiss, she says that she'll see you later, and walks off to her locker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you go to your locker, you faintly hear the sound of crying. You turn around and see Colin comforting Ramona. \"It's okay, Ramona.\" he says. \"These things happen. I promise that you'll feel better soon.\" <i>Aw shit.</i> you think yo yourself. <i>Ramona must've seen Chloe kissing me.</i> When Ramona gets up and leaves, you go over to Colin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she okay?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid not.\" he says gloomily. \"I just wish there was a way that I could make her feel better.\" You stop and think for a second. Why would Colin word that last sentence like that. Is it possible that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Colin,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like Ramona, don't you.\" you say, with a smile on your  face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin looks at you in shock and...</span></div></div>",

You could tell that her normal personality was back, hopefully your plan would work out. You and Ramona head of to the local diner, and you look around for a place to sit. While Ramona has her back turned, you quickly text Colin that you got to the diner. The plan was that Colin would show up fifteen minutes after you and Ramona arrived at the diner, then Chloe would show up ten minutes after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Ramona get seated, but it takes a while for the waitress to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the deal with customer service?

Ramona laughs. \"I didn't know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight on cue, Colin shows up. \"Hey, guys!\" he says. \"Hi, Colin.\" says Ramona. \"Wanna join us.\" This took both you and Colin by surprise. Neither of you were expecting her to actually invite Colin to join you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure.\" Colin says, going with the flow. \"Mind if I sit next to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not at all.\" she says. This was going better than expected. Ten minutes later, Chloe shows up. This was a major hurdle. You were afraid that Ramona wouldn't want to stick around if Chloe showed up. Fortunately takes a seat next to you and the four of you start talking. The waitress finally shows up and takes your orders, too. Everything was going so perfectly. Colin was even able to put his arm around Ramona without her objecting to it. Just then, somebody shows up that makes things difficult. </span></div></div>",

Your mom crack you over the head with another whiskey bottle?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe, Ramona and Colin laugh at your remark, while Luke just growls. \u201cI know it was you that hit me from behind, like the pussy you are. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a good thing you have that thick skull of yours to protect what little of a brain you have.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another round of laughter, you look Luke in the eyes and say \u201cCan you prove it was me that gave you that lump?\u201d \u201cWho else would come to the rescue of this little skank?\u201d Luke gestured to Chloe.

You twist his arm even further as he cries out in pain. \u201cI should have warned you,\u201d you say \u201cI took some self defense classes back on earth. Now, if you ever do anything to harass me or my friends again, I will personally rip your balls off and feed them to you, understand?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, Luke didn\u2019t understand, because his only response was \u201cFuck you, stupid ape.\u201d Before you could retaliate, luke was knocked out for the second time in a week, this time by Chloe, who had come up behind you and whacked luke over the head with a trashcan lid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t let you have all the fun, could I?\u201d She says with a smile.

You were both excited, Collin because he was finally going on a date with Ramona (more or less), and you because you would get to spend time with Chloe. Amazingly, for the entire week leading up to Saturday, you didn\u2019t see Luke at all. Maybe that last whack on the head from Chloe finally knocked some sense into him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaturday night finally arrives. You tell your parent you\u2019ll be back around eleven. As you step outside, you reach into your pocket to make sure your can of pepper spray is still there. If you\u2019ve learned one thing from living on Bestia, it\u2019s always be prepared. You didn\u2019t want to be attacked by Luke, or worse, some stalker girl from school, especially while walking alone at night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approach Chloe\u2019s front door, you decide to try the old charming routine. Granted, you\u2019ve never had anyone to use it on before, but no time like the present. You ring the doorbell and quickly try to think of something smooth to say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Chloe answers the door, you put on your best gentleman act. \u201cGood evening, Chloe. May I say you look absolutely ravishing tonight?\u201d You gently take her hand and kiss it. Chloe giggles before saying, \u201cI\u2019m afraid you are mistaken.\u201d That\u2019s when you see the real Chloe coming down the stairs behind the one in front of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you think you are seeing double, before the second Chloe says \u201cYou see mom? I told you he was a sweet guy.\u201d MOM!? You were just hitting on Chloe\u2019s mother! They both burst out laughing as they let you inside, blushing furiously. Chloe explained how she and her mother look exactly alike, and they are often mistaken for twins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d Her mother says placing a hand on your shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019re not the first one to make that mistake, and you won\u2019t be the last. Besides, it\u2019s so good to see my Chloe has such a nice boy like you. Unlike that thug, Luke.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn to Chloe in surprise. \u201cYou had Luke as a boyfriend?\u201d \u201cOnly briefly.\u201d She says. \u201cI dumped him a few weeks before I met you, but he didn\u2019t seem to get that fact through his thick skull. That\u2019s probably why he assaulted me in the alley.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich reminds me,\u201d Chloe\u2019s mother says as she suddenly hugs you. \u201cI just have to reward the boy who rescued my daughter from that degenerate.\u201d You told her that wasn\u2019t necessary, but she insisted. \u201cYou two go on and hang out or whatever you want to do, and I\u2019ll order pizza for us. It\u2019s the least I can do to thank you, (your name). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Chloe spent most of the evening playing her favorite card game, Kritz. It was basically the Bestian version of Uno, except the loser owes the winner of each round a prize of their choosing. In Chloe\u2019s case, she wanted kisses, which you were more than happy to provide. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, you just sat around chatting. Eventually, the subject turned to Collin\u2019s date with Ramona. \u201cDo you really think Ramona was that oblivious when Collin asked her out?\u201d You asked. Chloe shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe she was just acting ignorant so as not to embarrass him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour cell phone rings and, speak of the devil, it\u2019s Collin.

Firstly, they had to walk to the theater because neither of them owned a car, or had  the money for a taxi. That wouldn't have been so bad, if the theater wasn't on the other side of town. Well, you really should have thought of that beforehand, you think to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext, Collin didn't have enough money for them to get into the theater, they had raised the prices apparently, and Ramona had to use her credit card. She didn't seem to mind, but it embarrassed Collin. While they were watching, Collin was so nervous he didn't try to make his move until three quarters through the movie. So far everything Collin had told you seemed like rather minor ordeals, until he gets to the worst part. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then, when I finally worked up the never to kiss her, before I could even ask her she starts itching and scratching like crazy. It was my cologne! She must have been allergic to something in it and broke out in hives!\" That would definitely ruin any date. \"Where is she now?\" You ask \" At home, probably scratching herself bald. I really fucked up on this. What can I do?\" You really didn't think you were the one Collin should be asking for advice, seeing as you've never been on a real date. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, is Ramona mad at you?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" No, she said it wasn't my fault because I didn't know she was allergic.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you still have a chance with her.

At the head of the group was a furry that wore a blank, plain white mask over his face, but you could tell by the shape of the mask he was a feline.

You were even more hesitant than before now that you knew your crush was the girl you were holding at gunpoint. Your grip on the gun was now very loose. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing, boy!?\u201d X shouted. \u201cSHOOT HER!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Please don\u2019t!\u201d Chloe said. \u201cI fell into the tunnel and I couldn\u2019t find my way out! I swear!\u201d You desperately wished that this was some cruel idea of a joke. This was NOT what you signed up for. \u201cWould you really trust the words of a female?\u201d X says, trying to coerce you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait a second, X!\u201d Luke says. \u201cI never had to do something this serious when I was initiated last month! You told me that we wouldn\u2019t be hurting anyone!\u201d Luke turns to you. \u201cDon\u2019t do it, man. I\u2019m sorry I got you into this.\u201d Needless to say, X was furious. \u201cSHOOT HER BEFORE I KILL ALL THREE OF YOU!\u201d he roared. You and Luke look at each other. He mouths the words \u201cLet\u2019s grab Chloe and go.\u201d to you.  You nod in agreement. You raise your gun as if you were going to shoot Chloe, then you suddenly dash towards her and grab her, heading out the exit with Luke following you. Chloe gets on her feet and quickly helps to guide you out of the cave, while you give your gun to Luke so that he can cover your back. The three of you make it outside and dash towards the school, hoping to lose the ten furries that were sent to pursue you. You find a hiding spot in the tool shed, and stay there for at least an hour to make sure that they were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you leave the tool shed, giving sighs of relief. \u201cThank you guys so much!\u201d Chloe says happily. \u201cI thought that I was done for.\u201d \u201cNo problem,\u201d you say. Your parents were expecting you to be home at eleven, so you hoped that Ramona didn\u2019t mind some extra guests. You knock on her door and Ramona answers. \u201cLuke? Chloe? [your name]? What are you guys doing here?\u201d she asks. \u201cCan we come in, then explain?\u201d you ask. \u201cSure,\u201d she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamona takes the three of you up to her room. When you walk in, you see a grey mouse furry with short, brown hair. \u201c[Your name], this is my friend Colin.\u201d Ramona said. We were studying together when you guys show up. Colin seemed like a trustworthy guy, so you decide to tell him and Ramona about what happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you guys weren\u2019t found?\u201d Colin asks in disbelief. \u201cThat is so badass!\u201d Ramona says. \u201cBut all jokes aside, we need to stop the UMA.\u201d \u201cI have an idea.\u201d Chloe said. \u201cWe know that the UMA is fighting for male rights, right? They have a good idea, but they\u2019re going about it the wrong way. So what if we made our own organization for equality between the sexes?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a good idea.\u201d you say. \u201cWe can gather members, boys and girls, and settle the issues nonviolently. I\u2019m in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUs, too!\u201d Ramona, Colin, and Luke say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat, we can scout for members tomorrow at school.\u201d Chloe says, and then she turns to you. \u201cCan I talk to you outside for a second?\u201d When you two left the room, Chloe started talking. \u201cI think it was really heroic of you to save me, even though we barely know each other.\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s no problem.\u201d you say. Chloe gives you a warm hug, then she looks up at you and stares into your eyes. She then puts her lips upon yours, giving you a kiss. It wasn\u2019t a forceful kiss, but a soft, romantic one. You almost passed out. You and Chloe go back into Ramona\u2019s room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you chicken out?\u201d Luke asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you puke?\u201d Colin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa! I knew he wouldn\u2019t choke!\u201d Ramona said. \u201cYou two owe me ten bucks, each!\u201d</span></div></div>",

You had all started up a petition, and had so far gotten thrity-seven signatures for it. The problem is, thirty-five of those signatures were all the other males in the school, and the reaming two were Chloe's and Ramona's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like human women, it turns out furry females are reluctant to share power. Even though X was clearly a complete psychopath, you were beginning to see his perspective of things. He wanted to bring power to the males of Bestia, which was understandable, but clearly he was willing to kill anyone who stood in his way, innocent or not. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Luke had reported what had happened last night to the police, but when they had gone to check out X's lair, it had been abandoned. Luke had told you that X and his lackeys were planning their first major strike, but he didn't say what exactly they were going to do. Apparently, X hadn't told him, because when questioned on what is was they were planning, Luke said he didn't know. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turns out, you were about to get your answer, because as you watched the news, an emergency broadcast pops up on the screen. The anchorwoman on the screen is visibly shockwed as she reads the report. \"This just in, the Senatorial Palace had just been bombed! We now go live to Felicia Drays on the scene.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBestia was not governed by a single ruler. Itwas ruled by a council of senators, all female of course. The screen cuts to a scene of utter pandamonium, the Senatorial Palace up in flames as Felica Drays, a female skunk, stood on the scene live.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just minutes ago, chaos erupted as the Senatorial Palace suddenly exploded, with all the senators in the middle of their annual meeting. Firefighters are desperatley trying to put out the flames, no word yet as to how the explosion was caused, but...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the screen turns to static for a moment, before you see the blank, white mask of X on screen. \"Males of Bestia, for too long have we suffered under the foot of the corrupt female regime. IT was we who destroyed the symbol of oppression you call the Senatorial Palace, and that was only the first step in our grand plan of liberation. Soon, it will be us who rule over this world, while the females tremble beneath our boots, in their rightful place. We may be few in number, but rest assured, that will matter little, when the next phase of our plan is complete. As for you acursed females, you can look forward to being assimilated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe screen cuts back to the news station, needless to say, you couldn't believe what you just saw. X had only aboput fifty other accomplices in his so called \"Spectre\" group. How could they have been able tio assassinate the senators of Bestia, and Hijack the news station, all on their own? Your cell phone rings in your pocket, and you look at the caller ID to see it is...</span></div></div>",

You nod <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have a seat.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit beside Luke, and the two felines infront of you get straight to business. \"We are agents for SIREN.\" Said the leopard, indicating their uniforms. \"We understand to two lof you were recently involved with the terrorist organization known as Spectre. We are goibng to ask you some questions, and don't even try to lie to us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor over an hour, they interrogated the two of you. They asked if you had known about Spectre's plans, or where their current location was, and how long Luke had been with them. You had no choice but to tell them the truth, since they would know if you were lying, so you told them you had no idea what Spectre was planning or where they are, or the names of it's members. when they finally finished, the two officers look at each other, then back to you and say...</span></div></div>",

That was enough to shut you and Luke up for the rest of the ride. You finally arrive in some kind of garage, and you and Luke are escorted into some sort of office.

We  handle the really big situations the government and police can't, from drug runners to terrorists. Speaking of which, I understand that you and your friend were involved with the organization responsible for the bombing of the Senatorial Palace, and assassination of the entire council just today.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time that day, you and Luke explain how you had no idea of Specter's plans. \"I see. It has also come to my attention that all of you have been trying to form a group for equal rights for males, akin to Specter, but peacefully?\" You all nod. \" Well then, here's the plan. We have no doubt that Specter will be llooking for you two.\" He indicated you and Luke \"Therefore we believe you may be our only lead to the location of Specter, and its leader, this so called X. The two of you are going to be temporarily recruited as undercover SIREN agents. We place a tracer and a wire on each of you, and allow Specter to capture you. Then we''ll know where to find them, and put an end to all this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriggs now spoke to the whole group. \"Perhaps when this whole mess is over, SIREN will be able to back you little rights group. You ,of course, may refuse my offer, but if you accept, and we pull this off, Bestia would be forever in your debt, and you all will receive special commendations for your service.\" Briggs stood up and went to leave the room to give you all time to discuss the situation, but just before he left, he turned to Chloe and said \"Buy the way, your name wouldn't happen to be Benson, would it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBriggs paused for a moment, then said \"I knew your father.

They are exempt from the laws and regulations of normal government agencies, and are free to deal with their targets as they see fit. My father was the first male to join them.

Your mission was to wait for Spectr to try and abduct you, and let yourselves be captured. SIREN would then follow the tracer signal they had planted on you, and come to your rescue. For nearly three hours, the two of you wandered the streets of the city, with no results. You started chatting, just to kill the boredom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what made you join Specter in the first place?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke hesitated. \"I don't really know.

I joined Specter because I wanted to fight their oppression, but I never wanted to exterminate them.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could reply, your are cut off by a sudden surge of electricity through your body.

You remember Hugo, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke's eyes widen with fear, and you could swear you heard him let out a small whimper. \"Home-run Hugo?\" He asks, his voice trembling. \"That's right. He's just been itching to get some batting practice, if you get my meaning. I hear he's ever put nails in it now. Now, I'm gonna ask you one last time, and if you refuse, I'm calling Hugo over.

After half an hour of trying, the only thing they got out of him was that his name wad Victor.

She wore a short red dress that stopped half way down her thighs, and hugged her body rather tightly, showing off her curves, yet covering them at the same time. On her feet, she wore a pair of dark purple high heels, making her about five inches taller than you. You also notice that her tail was much bushier than usual, and slowly swayed back and forth behind her with an almost hypnotizing effect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't realize you had been staring until Lynette snaps her fingers infront of your face. \"Like what you see?\" She says with a small smirk. You quickly regain your senses and stutter. \"Well...you look...ravishing tonight.\" Lynette giggles at awkwardness of your comment. \"I like to look my best when I go out. You wou.ldn't happen to have a car, would you?\" You shake your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's alright, the theater isn't too far away, and it's a nice night, so we can walk.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you both walk down the start lit streets, you can't help but admire the way Lynette's hips swayed from side to side as she walked, not to mention...her rather lovely rear. (Not that you would ever say that out loud) You wonder if she would miond if you were to wrap your arm around her waist, but to your surprise, she wraps her arm around you instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better stick close. Don't need us getting seperated in the dark.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rather enjoyed the feeling of her fur, plus the silk of her dress rubbing aginst you, so needless to say, you didn't complain.When you reach the theater, you were going to buy tickets for the both of you, but lynette insisted on paying for her own. \"You don't have to act like such a gentleman around me.\" She said \" I can get my own stuff.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two of yoiu watched the movie you wonder if this would be a good time to try and sneak a kiss from Lynette. PArt of you thought now would be the best timew to try, while your other half thought it was only the first date (if you could call it that) and trying it now would be going too far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to you, a mysterious figure in a large trenchcoat, hat, and glasses sits directly behind you and Lynette. Who is this suspicious character?</span></div></div>",

This is your date he trying to ruin!!! You jerk your thumb to get him to leave, but he hands you a piece of paper with a note.<br>\r\n\"Tell my sis that you need to use the restroom and we'll settle this outside. If you don't, I'll force your head near her shoulder and I drool on her making it seem like you did it.\"<br>\r\nYou glare at Luke, but are unsure of what you should do.

When you step inside her room, she locks the door behind you. \"I bet you didn't know we vixens give off a pheromone that hypnotizes any males who breathe it, even human ones.\" She sits down on her bed and motions for you to join her. As you do so, she continues \"I know Ms. T assigned us together to study, but i can't help myself. I mean, here i have the new human boy all to myself, and i know you're a virgin too, I can smell it on you.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe takes your hand and places it on her chest. \"Can you feel my heart racing?\" You nod, but you're really more focused on the softness of her breasts. \"Forgive me for being so forward, but pretty much what I'm trying to say is...wanna do me?\" </span></div></div>",

While I do want this, I don't want to make you do something you don't want to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat last statement eases your nerves a little, but right when you're about to answer, you hear a knock on the door. \"Lynette?\" a female voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fox quickly jumps out of the bed and rushes to unlock her bedroom door. \"Coming!\" she answered. She opened the door, revealing a red vixen with long hair that was the same jet black as Luke's. Judging from what she was wearing, she seemed to be a nurse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was work, Mom?\" Lynette asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same old, same old,\" the older fox answered. She then looked behind your daughter and saw you sitting quietly on the bed. \"Oh? Is this the new human student I've heard about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynette nodded. \"Yeah, Ms. T asked me to help tutor him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you, Ms...\" you say, forgetting Luke and Lynette's last name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just call me Liane, dear,\" she chuckles with a dismissive wave. \"No need for formalities. Well, I'll leave you kids to it,\" she looks at her daughter one last time before leaving, \"and don't forget our rule, Lynette.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, mother,\" the young vixen says dejectedly as her mother leaves, and she shuts the door once she's gone. \"Sorry about that. I didn't know my mom would be home early.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't mind my asking,\" you say, \"what's this 'rule' she mentioned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, my parents are pretty open-minded about sex, but the only rule they have is that I can't do it while either of them are in the house. It's not bad, considering my mom works late as a nurse, and my dad travels frequently, but when plans change, it kinda sucks when I have things planned.\" She looks back at you. \"I guess we'll have to do this some other time, assuming you were going to say yes, of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give her a nod of understanding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... sorry for using my pheromone on you,\" she sighed. \"I kinda got caught up in the fact that I had you to myself, and I thought that using it would be the best way to get you up here and listen to my offer. Just know that I had no intention of taking things further if you said no. As much as I wanted you to say yes, I still wanted the decision to be yours at the end of it all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckle. \"Well, thanks for letting me have that,\" you say gratefully. \"I was afraid that you'd be the type that would still try to take me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynette shakes her head. \"Trust me, I respect a male's free will. Although, I feel I should at least give you something to make up for the lost opportunity.\" She leans in and plants a soft kiss on your lips that lasted for a few seconds. \"Still, since Ms. T wanted us to use these days for studying, so we should set our own separate date so you can still learn what you need to learn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're saying that you're willing to give me a shot?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod. \"Yeah. I mean, you seem to be really nice, so why not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynette smiles and gives you a warm hug. \"Thanks. We have Friday night off, so I was thinking...\"</span></div></div>",

Plus when you're on a planet that's mAden of of mostly rabid females, having a girlfriend can come in handy. \"Alright, let's do it.\" Lynette smiles and kisses you on the forehead. \"Meet me here Friday night at seven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCome the end of the week, you and Lynette are driving into town in her car. You pull up to a hotel with a large neon sign shaped like a heart.

The two of you check in and head to your room. The instant you walk inside, Lynette picks you up bridal style, tosses you onto the bed, pounces on top of you, and latches your wrists to the bedposts with handcuffs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn!

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You're just a regular human boy, aged 16, eleventh grade. When you were 13, a faraway planet of anthropomorphic animals came into contact with Earth and formed an alliance. Eventually, humans started taking vacations to the furry planet of Bestia and furries started vacations to Earth. Your family actually moved to Bestia two days ago, and that's where our story begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore we begin, there's something you should know about Bestia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know that on Earth, the females outnumber the males, right? Well it's the same situation on Bestia, only to a bigger extreme. The planet's population is about the same as Earth's, but the ratio of females to males on Bestia is so large that males are pretty rare on the planet. Males on Bestia have the ability to enhance any of their five senses to extreme levels while the females have the ability to grow up to four times their size. Since males are rare on Bestia, sometimes girls end up fighting over a guy and they can be extremely aggressive. The school system on Bestia is the same as Earth's so you'll have no problem adapting to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are quite a few people you'll come across in your new neighborhood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRamona Barks: 16 years old. A golden retriever furry. Ramona's your next-door neighbor and took it upon herself to be your first friend, and as such, she is very loyal to you. She has thick, blonde hair reaching past her shoulders and she's a bit thick in her body and curvy, but not fat. God help you if you call her fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke Morgan: 17 years old. A red fox furry with short black hair. You and Luke... aren't on the best of terms. The guy has a bit of a superiority complex, and he's not too fond of humans... or maybe it's just you specifically, but who knows? Maybe you two could look past your differences and become friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChloe Benson: 16 years old. A light orange cat furry with blonde hair. You have a bit of a crush on her, but who could blame you? She's cute, smart, and is a pretty nice girl. Chloe values honesty above all else, and has little patience for liars. She also has a talent for singing, a talent that she inherited from her grandmother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin Gray: 16 years old. A grey mouse furry. Colin is another friend of yours that you meet through Ramona. A whiz with mechanics, Colin is quite the smart guy, but he is a little bit of a wimp, and most girls consider other options before going after him. Poor guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEileen Gray: 18 years old. Colin's older sister. A white mouse furry with red hair. Eileen is the second most popular girl in your school's senior class. She takes pride in the large number of guys she's seduced and slept with, and she sees each guy as another prize. The only things she hasn't managed to do was claim a virgin, and claim a human. Unfortunately for you, you happen to be both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCora Benson: 13 years old. Chloe's little sister, who is practically a mini version of Chloe. She's quite the mischievous troublemaker, and she's taken quite a liking to you, despite the age gap. (Only exists in some storylines)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClaire Benson: 32 years old. Chloe's mother. Despite her age, she looks quite young, so much so that she and Chloe are often mistaken for twins. Claire had Chloe when she was 16, and was left by her boyfriend to raise the little kitten on her own. Despite her hardship, she's still a loving mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLynette Morgan: 18 years old. Luke's older sister. Lynette is the most popular girl in the senior class, and is the only person that Luke is afraid of. Despite her popularity and good looks, Lynette is still very smart with impeccable grades. She's basically the Chloe of the senior class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucy Morgan: 17 years old. Luke and Lynette's cousin. A fox furry with gold fur and purple hair. Unlike Luke, Lucy is really fascinated by humans and human culture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, here are the rules of this interactive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease make the chapters coherent and easy to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeep the story going unless it's necessary to end it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSex is allowed, and you can be descriptive if you want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVore.... well, while this used to be allowed, since it hasn't really been used in the story and I don't have much of a taste for it anyway, I've decided to disallow it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you love the story, add a chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you think the story is good, but needs improvement, add!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you hate the story, add and make it something you'd like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you would like, you can send messages to me about how this story is, and check out my portfolio for more stories!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nENJOY!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDIT: 8/20/12: As of today, this story has reached 100 chapters and reached its first anniversary on this site!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEDIT: 9/13/12: As of this edit, this story has reached over 2000 views!
