You nest was located near a beach, which meant you came across some fishermen time to time. A lot of them think you look cute, some may even say pretty or beautiful, but that was before you got close enough for them to get a whiff of your horrible smell. Right now, a fisherman was sitting on a dock connected to the beach with a bored look on his face and sitting next to him was a bait bucket. You fly down towards him and land right next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's th...\" He starts to say as he looks at you, but then he groans and covers his face as soon as his nose catches your scent. You pick up the bait bucket and look into it. You were right. There were worms in it. You start gulping them down as the disgusted human watches you. After you finish, you let out a sigh, glad to get something you like to eat. After putting the bucket down, you look where the fisherman is.</span></div></div>",

Nature would take you; this was truly it for you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden screeching noise could be heard above you, making you look up to see a dark silhouette of a vulture harpy circling above you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to run, but it was no use. In one fell swoop she grabbed your shoulders with her talons, raising you above the ground and up into the air, making you fell a suction inside your stomach and wind rushing through your hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou looked up at the harpy.

Stunned by her beauty, you do not resist her grasp.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon she arrived to a cave with you, throwing you inside it and making you fall to its rocky floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScared and beaten you looked up at her massive size, this time you could get a good look at your captor. <br>\r\nAnd a look was giving back, a slanting, primitive look, so predatory and dominant, from her sharp and angular face. Her skin was bare below her white, feathered throat, showing you her endowed chest, confirming to you that she was indeed a female. <br>\r\nWalking towards you on her giant chicken legs, each attached to a pair of scaley, big talons, placing one of them on your panting chest and digging them into your shirt, starting to pull the fabric off of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to take her talon off you but got immediately slapped across the face by one of her wings, leaving a red mark and stopped your resistance for now as you covered your face. The stingy slap making you breath heavily, as she snared at you, trying to make you understand that she had you now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tore off your shirt and once again you complained, sending another slap your way, then another, as she screeched at you. You tried to fight her, but she was too strong, and soon she had you on your back lightly sobbing, finally submitting to her will, letting her do whatever she wanted with you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt so weak and restricted by her strength, as she placed a talon on you bare back, lightly clawing into your skin, as she stepped up on top of you. Feeling her weight and her feathers grace your naked flesh, allowing her to so as you softly cried. Shaking from fear and your cold stomach pressed against the rock hard and icy floor. All your senses were on high alert, as the predator kept walking on you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began using you, slowly clawing your back like a doormat, staring at you with her predatory eyes, as red lines covered your back more and more, making you whimper and cry out. Dominating you, as she lowered her head down, lightly screeching into your ear, and biting into your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain slowly building up as more and more blood spilled out of your wounds, making you feel so warm, like you were covered in a cloth soaked in warm water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pushes your over again, so you laid down on your bleeding back. Tear wet eyes looking up at her sinister, smiling ones, realising she was enjoying this very much so.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Every day she came back with food between her talons. Usually raw meat from rabbits or foxes, which she chewed little pieces off, serving some of them to you. The first times were tough, as you could not get yourself to eat raw meat, but your new mistress would wait and watch, not satisfied until you had stuffed some of it inside your crying face. Your stomach groaned and complained, but luckily, she also brought fruit and veggies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were just grateful that she kept you alive, and you always looked up at her with gratitude, as you laid there on your knees with hands filled with food she just dropped. Kissing her talons to prove it, since words were gibberish to her, there was no other way to communicate with her than actions and body language. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd you watched her body language carefully. The second she came home; all your attention was directed towards her. Watching her so very carefully and listening patiently on everything she emitted, making sure she was happy with your movement, just so you could avoid displeasing her and get scratched to a bloody pulp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew she liked hearing you whimper, as she often would dominate you at random times, placing herself on you wherever you were laying at the moment, gentle digging her talons into your nude flesh, while you laid perfectly still like the trapped animal you were. Using you as a doormat, while you softly sniffled beneath her, bowing down your head in pain, hiding it in the ground, as she bit your shoulder and mildly screeched into your ear, trying not to react, allowing her to do whatever she pleased, soon leaving you bleeding on the cold ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first times you softly cried and curdle up into a ball after she had done that to you, but these days you struggled to get yourself up and sobbingly crawl to her side, licking her blood-soaked talons as If it was your fault they got messy in the first place, while hoping she would lick your wounds in return as she sometimes did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did not last long before your entire body was filled with scares. Feeling so defeated and broken, as your entire body was a reminder of her. She liked it. She liked how her little pet was branded and marked, caressing your wounds to remind you of the time she gave you them. Those painful memories being deeply inserted into your brain, making your body shiver softly as she touched them, stroked them, so proud of her doings, and her little trophy pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just tried to live. There was no reasoning with her, and you could not stop her. You were naked and vulnerable to her sharp claws and threating size; your life was in her hands and she knew it. Treating you as a harmless animal, letting you lay so close to her in her nest, and leaves you alone in the cave for hours without fear of you leaving. You were too scared to leave, so you just stayed, and waited on her to come back, greeting her with leg kisses, as she fed you and did to you whatever her instincts wanted. Being such a loyal, faithful, and submissive pet to her, scared, weak and quivering. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only comfort you had was her. At night you would snuggle into her body, her soft feathers keeping you warm at night, and her breathing and heartbeat a soothing lullaby for your sniffling, scared and cold body. You felt weirdly safe when you laid in her embrace, as you convinced yourself you were under her protection.<br>\r\nIt felt also more caring the times where she cleaned you with her tongue, licking your wounds after she had scratched you silly or when she had mated with you. You felt loved in those moments, which might have made you want to stay even more in this abusive relationship.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One day, lying in her nest, you saw her flying home in the distance with a little pack of other harpies following her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou became scared and alert, lying perfectly still as you watched your mistress land with an azure blue, a crimson red and golden-brown feathered harpy, all of which had their eyes laid on you, making you even more uncomfortable.<br>\r\nYour breathing was getting faster, but you tried to keep it quiet, as if being silence would save you. You began slowly crawling backwards as they made their predatory steps towards you, keeping your eyes on them while backing off to show you wanted none of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut your mistress made a well familiar sound; a clacking noise which immediately made you freeze. She had trained you well. She couldn\u2019t speak, so you always had to guess what she wanted from you, and each time she had made this noise, she had almost immediately slashed your skin, leaving you confused of what the reason was for the punishment. It almost came naturally, as you expected pain each time you heard that clacking noise, making you freeze and cower, and finally found out the noise\u2019s meaning when you did not get hatched on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you laid still like the good pet you were, watching as the harpies surrounded the nest you were in, looking so intrigued and curious on you. Your mistress in her beautiful black coat was standing on the edge of it, looking at you satisfied for obeying her orders, as you helplessly looked back with a pleading stare, looking for answers of what was about to happen. You did not like these strangers at all, and would rather seek refugee at your mistress, but she did not allow it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yelped as the golden-brown harpy placed a talon on your face, turning it from side to side to get a good at you. The azure blue pecked at your stomach, feeling how vulnerable and soft it was, while the crimson red circled around the nest staring, all of them inspecting this strange creature that their sister owned. <br>\r\nThe crimson red mildly screeched at you, as she placed herself on top of your chest, perhaps threatening you not to move, as she slowly moved her angry, snarling head towards your throat, keeping her eyes on yours all the way down until she finally could bite your neck.<br>\r\nThe pain made your twitch and groan, which made her immediately slap you with her wings, perhaps in surprise of my reaction and screeched into your face once again for scaring her like that. You closed your eyes and tried to turn your head away, as she slapped you once again.<br>\r\nThe others were busy with their investigation; one tried to bite one of your nipples while the other were scratching your arm. During all of this torture, your messed-up mind could not help itself but making you pop a boner, making you feel even more embarrassed as you tried to make it go away.<br>\r\nBut your mistress noticed, and she stopped her sister\u2019s plight on your body, as she was going to demonstrate the reason, she was keeping you alive, fed and warm. Not only were you a bleeding, responsive scratching post, you could also be used for fucking, and slowly she walked over your nude body, keeping her eyes on you as you stared back up to her. Like a chicken roosting, she placed herself down on your poor twitching dick, making you gasp by the sensation of her soft and comforting embrace, as you only had gotten used to stinging slashes and painful rending towards your bleeding broken body. So cold, moist and merciful as she slid it in and out slowly, looking down at your softly moaning body, filled with scares and wounds from her claws, proving that I was hers to toy with. <br>\r\nThe other harpies watched in wonder, looking closely at your face and their sister\u2019s, who was mating right in front of them. The azure blue had begun preening your mistress\u2019s black feathers, perhaps to get a try herself, by giving a favor for a favor.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
