A lot of them think you look cute, some may even say pretty or beautiful, but that was before you got close enough for them to get a whiff of your horrible smell. Right now, a fisherman was sitting on a dock connected to the beach with a bored look on his face and sitting next to him was a bait bucket. You fly down towards him and land right next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's th...\" He starts to say as he looks at you, but then he groans and covers his face as soon as his nose catches your scent. You pick up the bait bucket and look into it. You were right. There were worms in it. You start gulping them down as the disgusted human watches you. After you finish, you let out a sigh, glad to get something you like to eat. After putting the bucket down, you look where the fisherman is.</span></div></div>",
