Someone from the household had ordered them and asked it to be hand delivered to the home, and Ino did as the person asked. Upon walking up the front steps of the home, she noticed that the front door wasn\u2019t locked. She found this out when she knocked on the door, only for it to open up a little as she hit the door. Worried about a possible intruder, Ino laid the bouquet on the first step and snuck inside the home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought maybe a break in was occurring or maybe some for of vandalization, but no traces of such acts could be found around the downstairs portion of the house. Although she did notice a couple weird things. One was that in the kitchen, seated at the head of the table, there was a white highchair. But the highchair looked to big for a baby and probably could have fit herself if she got in it. There was also a play area set up filled with stuffed animals, soft fabric toys, and rattles. But what was strange was that Ino had never recalled Naruto or Hinata ever mentioning they had a new baby, or were possibly babysitting someone. So what was with all of this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno has jolted a bit when she heard some movement upstairs and quietly crept up the steps. She looked in the kids rooms first. She didn\u2019t see anything out of the ordinary and everything checked out as untouched. But then she took a look in Hinata and Naruto\u2019s room, and saw two things off the bat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly, the room was a nursery. A nursery fit for a big baby. The room\u2019s floor was decorated with spruce wood and foam mats with baby letters on them. Also, there was a big changing table that was stocked with adult diapers and changing supplies such as baby powder and baby oil. Ino had saw something out of the corner of her eye and saw a closet full of onesies and cute little outfits that would probably fit on Ino if she tried to get in them. But what explained everything was what she had seen next. She saw a white crib that had carved designs of foxes on it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she walked over and peered inside the crib she saw the explanation to all of this nursery and babyish furniture. Inside the crib was....</span></div></div>",

She believed everyone deserved some modicum of privacy including their lives, and what Ino was doing was violating that privacy. But she couldn\u2019t stop that nagging feeling in her head. The feeling to go talk to Naruto about it. Obviously she didn\u2019t want to bring it up to him as her beliefs would be contradicted by her actions, but she also wanted to know why Naruto acted like a baby. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts were immediately disrupted when she heard some crying in the distance. She didn\u2019t hear it at first, but as she got closer to the alleys, which she was going to pass by, she heard a soft, but faint, crying noise. As she crept through the alleys, she found the source of the crying. It was Naruto! She didn\u2019t know if he recognized her or not, so she knelt down to his eye level, as Naruto was curled up into a ball, hugging his knees with his hands and crying on said knees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNaruto?\u201d Sakura whispered calmly. But he whisper wasn\u2019t calming for Naruto, who began trembling as his friend was a foot away from him. The Alley that Sakura was in was pretty dark, despite it being midday, and she couldn\u2019t make out Naruto\u2019s exact clothes or injuries, if he had any of the latter. She could only make out the silhouette of her friend. In order for her to make sure he was okay, they would have to go into the light, although Naruto didn\u2019t seem like he was in the mood to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, Wait here, I\u2019m going to go get someone to help.\u201d Sakura said as she went to enlist the help of....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Obviously, when Tsunade and Naruto were being asked about what they were doing by Sakura, they were surprised Naruto was the first one to react, as he began to sport a major blush and tried to hide himself in between Tsunade\u2019s breasts, burying his head into them. Tsunade however, wasn\u2019t entirely shocked. Yes, her expression was one of surprise, but she didn\u2019t try to hide what she was doing. \u201cWhy hello Sakura! What brings you here.\u201d Tsunade asked, trying to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t try and change the subject here, what are you two doing? Why is Naruto in a diaper? Why were you breastfeeding him?\u201d Sakura questioned. Tsunade had sighed and began explaining everything to Sakura about what she and Naruto were doing, seeing as there wasn\u2019t an easy way out of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I know you are aware of Naruto\u2019s life as a little kid. He was bullied, beaten, and used as a scapegoat for the village. He had to grow up and adapt to an environment that wanted him crippled or dead. As he got older and as his life was driven into a dangerous zone from The Akatsuki and Madara, he had to grow up again and adapt. However, now that his life is at peace, he wants to relive something he never got to experience. A childhood. More specifically, a babyhood. He never got to be a kid with his life in danger all the time, but now that it is not, he can try to give himself a childhood.\u201d Tsunade explained, trying to put it in simpler terms so Sakura could understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura took all the information in and let it soak before she spoke again. It was at this point that Naruto began to come out of his \u2018hiding spot\u2019 and began to feed from Tsunade\u2019s breasts once more. Sakura saw this of course, and slightly giggled. \u201cSo how did this involve you?\u201d Sakura asked, not seeing the correlation between Tsunade and Naruto\u2019s attempt to create a childhood for himself. Tsunade had cleared her throat before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, Naruto came to me about this problem first. He wanted me to be his caregiver, essentially. Someone to care for him in a motherly way and to treat him like a baby. I agreed, but I was a little skeptical at first, thinking this may have been one of his pranks, but as you can see, it wasn\u2019t. He was genuinely trying to recreate a moment in time that was rudely snatched away from him.\u201d Tsunade explained. Naruto had stopped suckling and resigned himself to resting his head on Tsunade\u2019s breasts. Sakura was about to ask another question, but Tsunade answered Sakura\u2019s question before she could ask. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this with him for a few months now. Hinata and his kids don\u2019t know about this, and I\u2019m afraid that now that you\u2019ve seen him like this, maybe you will endanger him to the scrutiny of his wife and children.\u201d Tsunade explained as she began to fix her bra and her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI promise that I\u2019m not going to spread this information to anyone. I\u2019m glad that you are doing this, and maybe if you would allow me, I would like....\u201d</span></div></div>",

You can be his Babysitter~\u201d Tsunade spoke softly as she picked up Naruto and cradled him in her arms. \u201cHowever, I will mainly be caring for him so I will only call you up when I cannot give him any attention. Whether it be that I\u2019m busy or.....yeah. Just when I\u2019m busy.\u201d Tsunade explained. Sakura chuckled at Tsunade\u2019s train of thought coming to a halt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the conversation was only about Sakura\u2019s new shipment of medical equipment, which would be arriving shortly after 5:00 pm. Sakura sighed as that was too long of a wait, but it would all be worth it. She retreated back to the Hospital to continue working. Throughout the day, however, she couldn\u2019t stop thinking about Naruto. It may have been excitement or maybe just genuine curiosity, but she was so intrigued about Naruto\u2019s lifestyle. She couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it even when the shipment arrived. She was still lost in thought and imagination of the things that she would do with Naruto. Feeding him, changing him, reading him stories, maybe even taking him out for a stroll~! The possibilities seemed endless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter around a week, Tsunade and Sakura talked with one another about Naruto. He was much more behaved then Sakura had previously thought. She expected a babyish Naruto to be rambunctious and unruly, but he proved to be quite the opposite. He was well-behaved, but could be quite emotional when it came to his \u2018mommy\u2019 (Tsunade) leaving him. He was also extremely cuddly and affectionate towards anything while in this headspace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, Tsunade and Sakura were calling again, but this time, it was a call asking Sakura to babysit. Tsunade had promised to go out with a couple of friends today and she completely forgot about it. It wasn\u2019t until one of her friends called and asked her if the plans to go out were \u2018still on\u2019. Sakura had obviously agreed to watch Naruto, but Tsunade would be dropping Naruto off at Sakura\u2019s house, as Tsunade\u2019s friends were going to be at her house doing things that young babies shouldn\u2019t have to witness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, here we are. Sakura was now waiting for Naruto and Tsunade. Sakura had told her daughter about Naruto\u2019s lifestyle, so that when she came home and found her mother playing, feeding, or even changing Naruto, she would know why and wouldn\u2019t question anything. Oh an if she told anyone she would be grounded for life. Sarada obviously agreed to those terms of agreement and didn\u2019t say a word to anyone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura heard a knock on the door and got up. She walked over and opened the door and saw Tsunade with Naruto, who had a massive blush spotted on his face. He was wearing a blue onesie with white, letter blocks patterned all over. He was also wearing a diaper underneath the onesie, which was noticeable as it mad a large bulge around his waste. Tsunade was simply wearing Her normal attire and smiled when she saw Sakura. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello! So sorry we were late! It\u2019s just that the little one had put up a little fuss about what to wear today, right Naruto~\u201d Tsunade turned her head to ask Naruto, who hung his head lower and hid his face in his hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMama~! Stop it! You\u2019re embawwassing me..\u201d Naruto spoke in a lisp. Sakura couldn\u2019t help but squeal in delight as she let Naruto inside, where he sat on the couch and hid his face in one of the pillows on the couch. Sakura couldn\u2019t help but awe over Naruto\u2019s cuteness and turned her attention to Tsunade, who gave her a diaper bag and a few things to note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, make sure he takes a nap around noon, as he tends to get cranky if he doesn\u2019t. If he asks to go outside, let him go out in your backyard, I don\u2019t want the village to see their leader in public in a diaper and acting like a baby, and make sure he uses his diaper, he has a tendency to think he\u2019s a big boy sometimes.\u201d Tsunade explained. Sakura took in all the information before sharing their goodbyes, but before Tsunade could leave, Naruto began to....</span></div></div>",

The toys were made for babies and mainly had to do with the five senses. Like \u2018touch\u2019 and \u2018feel\u2019, while other toys were educational and helped babies learn their shapes and colors. Before Sakura even got halfway to the playpen, Naruto began to cry once again. Sakura sighed and bounced Naruto in her arms gently. \u201cIt\u2019s okay little one~ Your mommy will be back~ It\u2019s okay~ It\u2019s okay~\u201d Sakura spoke in a soft and motherly tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the voice and the bouncing seemed to calm Naruto down just a little bit, he was still upset. \u201cBuh I wan mama!!\u201d Naruto bawled, trying to push his way out of Sakura\u2019s arms. However, Sakura held onto Naruto so he wouldn\u2019t fall, even though Naruto began to wriggle and squirm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis continued for a little while longer before Naruto tired himself out. He didn\u2019t fall asleep, but he gave up on trying to squirm his way out of Sakura\u2019s hold and his cries were reduced to sniffles. He had exhausted all of his energy for now and used the remaining bits of his energy to hold onto Sakura. \u201cI\u2019m sowwy Aunty...\u201d Naruto whispered softly, sniffling shortly after. Sakura smiled and slightly blushed when Naruto had referred to her as \u2018Aunty\u2019, but felt happy that she was considered as part of Naruto\u2019s family. At least his regression family, so to speak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay baby. I understand that you want your mommy and that you you love her very much, but you need to remember that she has friends and family as well. And she needs to spend some time with them. It\u2019s like you with Hinata and your kids. Wouldn\u2019t you want to spend time with them if you hadn\u2019t seen them in a while?\u201d Sakura explained, trying to get Naruto to further understand where Tsunade was coming from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMhm..\u201d Naruto replied as he began to yawn. Sakura giggles when she heard the yawn and laid Naruto on the couch. There was a cover on the couch to prevent any messes that Naruto may make. She got a soft, red, wooly blanket and draped it over Naruto\u2019s body, tucking him in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe same is with Tsunade. So don\u2019t take it personally, honey. She still loves you.\u201d Sakura said as she knelt down to put a pacifier in Naruto\u2019s mouth. It was a plain, orange pacifier and kissed his forehead. \u201cNow go to sleep. If you need Aunty for anything, just call.\u201d Sakura said as she got up and turned on a baby monitor. Naruto had suckled on the pacifier for a couple minutes before falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring his nap, Sakura was doing chores around the house, like the laundry and tidying up her and Sarada\u2019s rooms.

Sakura's attention then came to Naruto, who at this point was a giggling mess, thinking that what he had done was hilarious to both him and Sakura. Well, Sakura did not share that hilarity. \"What did you do?!\" Sakura yelled, which made Naruto jump a little in fear. He was about to speak, but Sakura had interrupted him. \"How did- Why did you- When did-\" Sakura was trampling over her own thoughts, her mind cluttered with questions that had no answers to them. Naruto looked down and the weight of the situation began to materialize.

At first it wasn\u2019t easy trying to get Naruto to cooperate with Tsunade, but after a lot of coaxing and after some examples of care, Naruto became the baby that he is today. You see, Naruto stayed a baby, even when Tsunade offered him the choice to stop. Today, Naruto has scheduled naps, he eats mostly pur\u00e9ed food and formula, if not, then just regular milk. He constantly gets changed at least several times a day and he even goes to a nursery. Many of his female friends supported his decision and even babysit him at times, while his male friends are not firm supporters of it, they do respect Naruto\u2019s decision.

The task that he was given was to find a way to put Sasuke Uchiha in his place. This was given to him by his daughter, who surprisingly wanted her father to be punished. You see, Sakura and Sarada we\u2019re struggling. While Sakura ran the hospital, it wasn\u2019t enough to cover the house payments and were on the verge of being evicted. This happened because the money was being stolen by someone who had access to the Uchiha\u2019s bank account. Luckily the money was tracked outside the village and was assumed to be Sasuke\u2019s doing. Not only was he stealing from his family, but when he rarely came home, he would act aggressive and abusive towards Sakura for the simplest things. Maybe if dinner was a little late, she would be slapped. If she was wearing a \u2018skimpy\u2019 dress, she would have her clothes thrown in the trash and burned. If she was out late, Sasuke would lock her out of the house and wouldn\u2019t let her in for the rest of the night. Sarada tried to stop it, but she would always be treated the same way, if not, harsher. If she spoke up about the abuse, her father threatened her with her own life! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Sarada spoke to Naruto about this, he was not only shocked, but outraged at Sasuke\u2019s behavior, although he had no idea what to do. He could banish Sasuke from leaving the village, but that wouldn\u2019t work as he technically lives outside the village already! He could force Sasuke to divorce his wife, but there\u2019s the possibility he may take his anger out on his wife and possibly kill her. As Naruto was devising his plan, his wife had called. Apparently Himawari had an accident at school and \u201cneeded diapers as a punishment\u201d. That sentence that left Hinata\u2019s mouth turned a lightbulb on in Naruto\u2019s head. That would be Sasuke\u2019s punishment! To be diapered and treated as a baby! He wanted to act all tough, bratty, and immature, then he would be treated as such. All that was needed was the council\u2019s approval and a plan to be initiated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe council had approved of Naruto\u2019s actions against Sasuke and a plan was drawn. Sasuke would be immediately restrained and sedated as soon as he entered the village next time, and would be barred from using his chakra to prevent any escape attempts. Then, he would be placed in Sakura and Sarada\u2019s care, but they would get the help of friends and family to help establish Sasuke\u2019s new place in life. As the Village\u2019s biggest baby. All that was needed now, was patience. </span></div></div>",

She than heard Ino pulling something out from her dresser and lad on her bed. Sakura than heard the sound of a vibrator start up and moans soon followed from Ino. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Ino POV) <br>\r\nAs I started my vibrator I felt completely relaxed and happy from my hard day, if only my beautiful girlfriend was here. I wish she knew about my feithes but I'm to scared to tell her. She would make a great mommy. <br>\r\n(Back to both POVs) <br>\r\nSakura blushed as she heard her girlfriend masterbation overhearing what Ino said about her made her feel strangely turned on.

Sakura than got on top of Ino and placed the diaper on Ino's chest. \"So you want me to be your mommy uh.\" Sakura said making Ino blush \"Sak-Sakura?\" Ino said only to have Sakura kiss her still felling turned on she lend over and started to undo the diaper and lefted Ino's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura then grabbed the baby powder Ino had next to her bed and applied that and taped up the diaper. Ino on the other hand was speechless but allowed Sakura to do what she wanted with her. After the diaper was snagged in place Sakura then reached under the bed to grab another one. \"So Ino would you like me to just be your mommy or do you went me to be your daipered mommy?\" As Ino thought she than said </span></div></div>",
