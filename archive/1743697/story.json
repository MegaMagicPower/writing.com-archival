The initial blast killed dozens but the announcer says in a grim tone that some of the survivors have been acting erratically, attacking the first responders and swarming the ambulances. Those poor people, you shake your head. You know some of the other rig drivers who came back from the war with PTSD, this seems to be an extreme version of that. You click the radio off and focus again on the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInsomnia is wrecking your life. You could barely look at the road without your eyelids feeling extremely heavy and your thoughts beginning to fade off with every blink.

You are fumbling around with one hand and holding the steering wheel when you see something up on the road ahead. At first it looks like some people gathered around roadkill but as the truck gets closer, you see there is the burning wreckage of a sedan and groups of people crowded by the side of the road. <i>Shit!</i> You hold onto the steering wheel and drop the caffeine pills all over the driver's seat.

Surprisingly you do not see the people even flinch as the truck flips upside down, sliding on the road at them like a deadly projectile. Some of them don't even lift their up or watch. You don't have much time to think about it because suddenly you are hanging upside down, gasping for air and feeling just a little bruised from what looked like a pretty bad accident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dangle from the roof o the truck spinning around, feeling like your head has been split in two. Meanwhile the witnesses outside haven't even come to see if you were okay or reacted at all. What is wrong with people these days? You unclasp the seat belt and feebly try to leave the wrecked truck.

They better be staring at Bigfoot's corpse or something extraordinary to not even... Then you realize something is wrong with these people. You are catching up to them and with their bodies still looking away, you notice how limp their arms look, and how leathery and sick their skin appears. You reach down to hold the spot where your gun is holstered. Are they on some sort of drug, maybe? You really don't want to have to use your gun but if they start attacking you in their crazed, violent high... what choice do you have?

The faces of the multiple men and women are focusing directly at you by the wreckage of your truck. A few of them watch the smoke puffing out from the crash site with a sort of amusement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's not do anything we're going to regret...\" You say much more calmly to the crowd of ill-looking people with hanging limbs and sinister blank expressions. There don't seem to be a lot of choices here. Your gun has limited ammunition so it's not like you can blast your way out of this one. But maybe if you mow down a few, the rest of them will fall back in fear? If they can even feel such a thing in their state. You can also run back down towards the woods surrounding the road. It is getting pretty dark so it might not be the safest place to be but it is better than dealing with this mob. You hold your gun tightly and walk back the mound. Their eyes follow you and you can see them begin to follow you. They shuffle around, as if walking around is a huge ordeal. The looks on their faces do not blink and look craving, as if they are more bestial than human. At least they can't move too quickly, you think to yourself.
