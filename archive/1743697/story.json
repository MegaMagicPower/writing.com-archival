HQ hasn't contacted you back if the shipment is canceled but since you need to get paid, you're continuing to your destination as if there wasn't a problem. The radio crackles with another news flash of an attack in a major city. The initial blast killed dozens but the announcer says in a grim tone that some of the survivors have been acting erratically, attacking the first responders and swarming the ambulances. Those poor people, you shake your head. You know some of the other rig drivers who came back from the war with PTSD, this seems to be an extreme version of that. You click the radio off and focus again on the road. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInsomnia is wrecking your life. You could barely look at the road without your eyelids feeling extremely heavy and your thoughts beginning to fade off with every blink. With one eye still on the road, you look in the glove compartment for the bottle of No-Doz. God, this stuff must be wrecking my liver, you think as you pop the capsules open. You are fumbling around with one hand and holding the steering wheel when you see something up on the road ahead. At first it looks like some people gathered around roadkill but as the truck gets closer, you see there is the burning wreckage of a sedan and groups of people crowded by the side of the road. <i>Shit!</i> You hold onto the steering wheel and drop the caffeine pills all over the driver's seat. You make a quick move to...</span></div></div>",

This proves to be a much more dangerous move because of the weight of the truck and all of the cargo. Anticipating that at worst, you end up dying, you grab onto the steering wheel and turn it all the way so that the heavy vehicle creaks weakly and all of the weight begins to shift towards the side. Surprisingly you do not see the people even flinch as the truck flips upside down, sliding on the road at them like a deadly projectile. Some of them don't even lift their up or watch. You don't have much time to think about it because suddenly you are hanging upside down, gasping for air and feeling just a little bruised from what looked like a pretty bad accident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dangle from the roof o the truck spinning around, feeling like your head has been split in two. Meanwhile the witnesses outside haven't even come to see if you were okay or reacted at all. What is wrong with people these days? You unclasp the seat belt and feebly try to leave the wrecked truck. Your company is going to charge you for this and fire you, what a day...<br>\r\nBefore you exit the vehicle, you look into the glove compartment.
