Not that he has many friends.  All the kids at school make fun of the way he talks.  He is always talking in cliches.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He decides to explore the attic of his new house.  His parents got it at a steal.  He didn't mind moving, since it is still in the same town.  When he climbs the stairs, he chokes on all the dust flying around.  There are boxes all over the place with cobwebs on them.  The only place that is clean is a small end table in a corner.  There is some kind of old fashion lamp sitting on top of it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tommy walks over and picks up the lamp.  \"Wouldn't it be nice if it was magicial\" he mutters to himself.  Just for kicks he decides to rub it.  He drops it to the ground as a black stream of smoke streams from the tip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A huge muscled genie forms out of the smoke.   \"Ok kid, you get one wish and make it snappy, I'm missing Martha Stewart for this.  And don't try to wish for more wishes, it doesn't work that way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tommy's shock lasts for only a second.  He knows a way to get more than one wish.  \"Here's what I want.\"  he says.  \"I wish everything I say comes true.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Granted.\"  chuckles the Genie.  \"However you might soon wish I didn't grant it, but you'd be out of luck since I don't have to take your orders anymore.  You see, my magic has been on the fritz so your wish will only work part of the time.  Looks like the commercials are over but I'll check in on you from time to time.\"  With that he becomes smoke once agian and flows back into the lamp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tommy is excited that he tricked the genie into giving him all the wishes he wanted.  He doesn't mind that it won't work all the time, he'll just keep wishing it till it comes true.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0To try it out he shouts \"I wish my friends were here.\"  Nothing happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Perhaps if he makes a statement instead of a wish.  \"My friends are here\"  Still nothing happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Disgusted, he stomps down the stairs.  His 15 year old sister sees him as he passes her room.  He doesn't get along with her because she is always calling him names.  \"Whats wrong, chump?  Why do you look so down?  Did you pee your pants agian?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Tommy glares at her.  \"NO!!!  I'm mad because...\"</span></div></div>",

There were scratching sounds coming from the roof of the house, followed by more loud thuds. Tommy ran over to the nearest window and looked outside and was shocked at what he saw.

She gazes at him, afraid, wondering what happened to her voice. She puts up her hand to feel her face, and she and Tommy both realise together - instead of ears, she now has pebbles growing out the side of her head. Her mouth opens to scream - again, a scraping sound, high pitched, like chalk squeaking against the blackboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy's sister is frantic, and so is Tommy. What she says usually doesn't make any sense, but to have her making scraping sounds is more than he can bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy is distracted from his sister's problems by a loud noise near the window. The cats and dogs, having no place to go, have started spilling inside. Soon, the house is full of curs, hounds, mongrels and whelps of every shape and size. Not to mention scores of meowing monsters, kicking kitten and their kin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tommy rushes to do something - anything - he gets bitten by a boxer, and promptly falls over a Siamese.

There, parked in the street out front was a chrome-plated tour bus. On the side it read \"The Music\". With a hissing noise, the entire side of the bus folded out like a mattress to reveal a small stage, complete with AV equipment and instruments. As the billowing smoke cleared, a man with long hair, skintight jeans and a pair of little black glasses walked forward. By some miraculous coincidence, Ozzy Ozbourne had arrived in the vicinity.<br>\r\n\"ARE YOU READY???!!!\"<br>\r\nThe cats and dogs fell silent. By now it had stopped raining, and the only sound for miles was a far-off car alarm, presumably triggered by some unfortunate falling feline. They all turned to face the stage.<br>\r\nOzzy then proceeded to launch into a deafening, guitar-heavy song that was so loud it knocked Tommy back several feet. The cats and dogs barked in tune with the song's rhythm, swaying back and forth in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing all of this, Tommy remarked...</span></div></div>",

Suspecting that unwishing something was going to be the hard part, he said, \"I wish something good would come of my wishes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, two of the rain dogs, a German Shepard and a Saint Bernard, burst through the windows.  The Shepard goes for Marta and the Saint Bernard grabs Tommy.  The dogs pull them through the house and out to safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Tommy and Marta are laying out on the lawn coughing out smoke, and dodging more falling cats and dogs, their parents struggle to walk up the drive.  Their father says, \"We had to abandon the car.  Road's clogged with cats and dogs.  What's going on and where's all that smoke coming from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The Genie (AKA Miss Universe) also catches on real quick and anticipating what Jenny (AKA Genie) is thinking about doing starts laughing his head off. He (SHE) starts laughing so loud his (her) eyes begin tearing up and within minutes he (she) faints. This was because he laughed so loud and fast he (she) hyper-ventilated. By that time Jenny had gone into her windup and when she tries blasting Tommy nothing happens. This just makes her more angry &amp; frustrated. When \"Miss Universe\" faints Tommy decides to put an end to this and he orders Jenny (AKA Genie) back into the lamp which she resists with all her might but fails. From inside the lamp Jenny is now yelling a blue streak of invectives that fortunately for Tommy, he can't hear.  When \"Miss Universe\" wakes up Tommy tells her (him) where Jenny is and she (he) says, \"Well, it serves her right. Now on to MY wish. You know Tommy, in all of the Centuries that I've existed I''ve never enjoyed things more than right now. It's to bad you can't have another wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy says that he thinks that \"Miss Universe\" should think very carefully about the wish. \"After all, Miss Universe you really wouldn't want to end up with a clunker like I have. The Genie agrees that he has a good suggestion. Tommy then reminds him about what the wish was. That Jenny his former sister would be as beautiful as Miss Universe. Right now, she is a 5' 11\" Hindu Princess from India. In a few weeks a new \"Miss Universe\" will be crowned. Don't you want to at least wait and see what you'll turn into? Tommy asked. Miss Universe pauses and after considering it for several minutes he agrees, he can wait. With this body, I can probably have a whole lot of fun with no real consequences. Since he is 12 years old Tommy does not realize the full implications of what \"Miss Universe\" meant about {a whole lot of fun}. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince the \"Miss Universe is going to wait to make the wish. Tommy says that he'll also wait for his wish. Miss Universe then says,\" What wish? Gee don't you remember. I said one per customer. Tommy says, \"Yes I know, but since there is now a NEW Genie in the lamp don't I get another wish? He (she) replies, you know what you're right. Why you lucky son of a gun. And, its your own sister too. Boy, she must really be steamed by now. So until one of us lets her out for a wish she's going nowhere. Tommy then wonders how am I going to explain my house. Miss Universe says, \"Simple you weren't here when it was destroyed. So let's leave before anyone comes around asking questions and we might as well take the lamp with us. It really wouldn't be very good for us if someone else let her out before we do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they leave and more than a couple hours later, when Tommy returns home his parents are so happy to see him they don't yell at him for not being home. Hiding in the shadows across the street stands \"Miss Universe\". While they were gone they figured out how and where she (he) was going to spend the next few weeks until the next Miss Universe pageant picks THIS years winner. She (he) of course, didn't tell Tommy about ALL of the things he planned on doing until the pageant. Because Tommy's sister Jenny can't be found everyone thinks she was killed and her body destroyed by whatever had destroyed the house. Tommy doesn't dare contradict them at that time. He'll need to come up with a real good explanation if Jenny becomes human again someday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the next Miss Universe is chosen, how do things work out for Tommy and the Genie?<br>\r\nRemember, before that happens Tommy is bound to say some more metaphors and such by accident.<br>\r\nSo there can still be some interesting problems waiting to occur for him and \"Miss Universe\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

(Smith was Tommy's last name). Happy to oblige!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Of all the times for the magic to fail!</i>, thought Tommy. <i>I hope this works.</i>  Aloud, he said, \"Bring it on, I'm twice as fast as you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, the magic worked this time, as Buckley suddenly seemed to be moving very  slowly. Tommy punched him twice in the nose before he could even respond. Then, Tommy decided to not push his luck, and  took off as fast a she could.

He stopped just before he bumped into his classmate, Cindy Wilson, a pretty blonde girl. He liked Cindy, and she seemed to like him. She was very smart, too.

Cindy didn't even seem to notice the difference, but new memories starting coming into his head, of a life in which both he and Cindy had been born nine years earlier, had been childhood sweethearts, and had gotten married recently, right after they had graduated from college.  Tommy had recently started his new job at the company his father worked for, while Cindy - who had always dreamed of being a writer, had recently had her first novel published. Both sets of parents had chipped in to help them finance a house.  Even as he watched, Cindy's belly began to expand and her breasts began to grow, too,and he suddenly realized why they had gotten married so soon after graduating. Cindy was three months pregnant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oops!</i>, thought Tommy. <i>It's going to be interesting when the kid figures out how to do math.</i> As they walked along, he considered the changes he had inadvertently made in his life.  Did he want to leave things this way? He liked the idea of being through with school, and Cindy had \"matured\" into a beautiful young woman. She was still a bit of a nag, but he was older and more mature now, too, so he realized that much of what he'd thought of as \"nagging\" was just her trying to give him the motivation that he had to admit he sometimes needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for parenthood - well, he probably would have waited a little later to have kids, but he was confident that he and Cindy could handle it.  He decided to leave things as they were, if nothing else, if was funny having Anne be his little sister, now.  He'd have to be really careful about what he said in the future.  <i>Geez</i>, he thought. <i>I'm going to have to be careful what I say for the rest of my life!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they came around the corner onto the street that his house ( or what had been his house), he saw Buckley walking towards them.  The part of him that still remembered being twelve year-old Tommy panicked for a moment, but of course, Buckley paid no attention to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they approached the house, Cindy asked him, \"Do you think your parents will be home yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not yet\", said Tommy. \"I think it'll be just Anne and her pals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh\", said Cindy. \"Those four are inseparable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", said Tommy, \"It's like they're sisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second later, he slapped his hand over his mouth when he realized what he'd said. Sure enough, when they entered the house, he saw Anne, Jen, Samantha and Britney sitting in the living room watching TV.  Anne was the same, but the other three had changed so that the all looked almost identical to her, with only different clothing and hairstyles making it easy to tell them apart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four girls leapt up and said \"Big Brother! Big Sister!\", and smothered Tommy and Cindy with hugs and kisses. More new memories entered Tommy's mind, as he now remembered having the quadruplets as little sisters. Fortunately, none of the changes affected his relationship with Cindy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>After all, I don't live in this house anymore. They're a lot cuter when you can go home without them. I wonder how Jen, Sam and Brit's \"old\" families turned out without them?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy and Cindy sat down and listened to his eagerly chattering little sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His memories changed further - now it wasn't both sets of parents who'd financed his and Cindy's home, it had been his parents who'd bought them their home on a more or less \"pay us back if and when you feel like it\" basis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>Wow, that worked out well, now they have plenty of room</u>, he thought.  He now remembered living in this house before he left to get married.  He and his sisters had each had two rooms - a bedroom and a study!  His parents'  property now took up what had been five lots.  He wondered what had happened to the people who'd lived in the houses that had stood on those lots before he'd changed things. Well, probably they were all just living somewhere else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wandered back into the living room, which was twice as hard as it had been.  <i>Hmm, this place is pretty big for my parents to take care of by themselves. But who would be a good person to help them out?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a thought struck him.  Elma Gorpp! She was a rich snob who'd been at school with his mother, and had always looked down on her.  It would be amusing to have her be his mother's servant.

She was dressed in riding clothes, which was appropriate, as she was riding her mare, Strider.  Tiffany was a high-powered corporate executive, but spent as much of her free time as she could riding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Tiff\", said Cindy. \"How goes it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, the usual\", said Tiffany. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's Strider today?\", asked Tommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's OK\", said Tiffany. \"She's in a good mood, I can tell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm always impressed by you expert equestrians\", said Tommy. \"It's like each of you reaches a point in your life where you become one with your horse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrider's head and neck disappeared, as did Tiffany's body from the waist down.

Oops, sorry, didn't mean to go on like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy and Tiffany chatted for a while longer. <i>I guess people merging with their horses to become centaurs is just a thing that happens now.

Soon, Tommy could hear her tapping away on her keyboard.  New memories came into his head. Cindy had been noted as a great writer since she'd been a little.  Her first book - a children's book - had been published when she was eight.  Since then, she had gone from triumph to triumph, wining a Pulitzer Prize when she was twelve and  the Nobel Prize in Literature when she was sixteen.  \"What's frightening\", one commentator had said, \"is that she just keeps getting better and better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she'd been interviewed after she'd graduated from college, she'd thanked Professor Jenkins, her English teacher, for everything that she'd learned from her. When she'd been informed of this, Professor Jenkins had replied, \"It's nice of her to say, but it's utter nonsense.

His hair was replaced by a rainbow-colored fright wig. His suit was now garish and over-sized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe finished the story he was  presenting, and said. \"Over to you, Anna, hyuk-hyuk-hyuk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna's skin had hardened, becoming plastic. Her facial features were rigid, and her head swiveled as if on a pivot .  When she spoke it was kind of eerie to hear her voice coming from her motionless face. At the end of the broadcast, she raised her unbending arm in farewell. Her fingers were as rigid as the rest of her.  Bill helped her out of her chair, and she walked stiff-legged out of the studio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of curiosity, Tommy looked Anna up on-line. Apparently, in the newly re-written world. she'd been created by a local scientist to be used in a display at a local fashion house. When it had been discovered that her AI had human-level intelligence, she had sued for her independence and in a landmark court case, had been granted the same rights as a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow</i>, thought Tommy. <i>That's nuts.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>On Sunday morning,  Tommy and Cindy got up early and went to church.  Tommy mostly went out of habit, he wasn't really all that devout. During the service, Tommy thought about the fact that he knew now that magic was real.  Did that mean that he ought to take religion more seriously? The choir began to sing a hymn and the lead singer caught his attention. She was a small, dark-haired woman named Anastasia Johnson who taught at the local elementary school.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\", whispered Cindy, \"She's got a great singing voice, hasn't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", said Tommy, whispering back, \"She looks and sounds like a angel.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnastasia didn't miss a note as large white-feathered wings sprouted from her back and a halo appeared over her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Guess I should have seen that coming</i>, thought Tommy.  When the service was over and they were leaving the church, Cindy stopped to to talk with one of their neighbors, Agnes McDonough.  Tommy stood aside and sighed. Agnes wasn't evil. really, but she was a terrible gossip, and Tommy just couldn't stand gossips. Another neighbor, Joe Philips, seeing Tommy's predicament, came over and smiled, and said, \"Looks like you're going to be waiting a while, Smith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", said Tommy. \"I don't know how Cindy can stand listening to her.  I can take someone who's a chatterbox, but these hardcore gossips I just cannot take. Listening to them cluck away, it's like they're all at least half chicken.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lower half of Agnes' body blurred and changed, her feet and legs re-shaping themselves into chicken legs, and a chicken's tail pushing out form her butt. Tail feathers pushed out through a hole in her pants.  The upper half of her body remained mostly human, except for a comb that parted her hair, wattles which dropped from the sides  her face and the beak that replaced her nose and mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Agnes paused for breath, and then said. \"Well,b'gawk, I'd buck-buck-buck-better get going, b'gawk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they left the church parking lot, Tommy saw a few other chicken people, men, women and children.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Did I just turn every gossip on Earth into a chicken person?</i>, thought Tommy. <i>I guess I did</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNew memories came into his mind.  Unlike with centaurs, where some people became centaurs under the right conditions (although their children were born centaurs, of course), chicken people were all born that way - at least, in the re-written world they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Just how powerful is Dusty, that his magic can re-write the whole world just like that?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy and Cindy went home and ate lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, hon\", said Cindy, \"I feels me writing coming on, do you mind amusing yourself this afternoon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, babe\", said Tommy.  \"I'll see you at supper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy decided to ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Although he'd been over that way the day before, but he hadn't had a chance to go to the park when he'd been there.  He took his leave of Cindy, hopped in his car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis drive was uneventful until he was almost at the park. He got stuck at a crosswalk as an old man and his wife <i><b>s-l-o-w-l-y</b></i> crossed the street in front of his car. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. come on, you two\", he said to himself. \"You're both as slow as molasses.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elderly couple dissolves into pools of dark brown liquid which continued to flow across the street.  He watched, nonplussed, as another older couple greeted them with, \"Hello, George, Martha, how are you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blurrrp, blorp bup-bup!\", the two pools of liquid replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA honk from behind him brought Tommy's attention back to his driving.  He parked his car and went to his favorite bench. A young couple was sitting on the bench, getting extremely familiar with one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, man\", Tommy muttered to himself, \"If you two wanna breed like rabbits, go do it somewhere else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the couple grew long, rabbit-like  ears and cotton tails. Their feet grew long as their legs re-shaped themselves.  The woman whispered something in the man's ear which made him smile. Looking up, he saw Tommy and winked at him. Then the pair of them hopped away into the bushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I don't want to know</i>, thought Tommy as he sat on the bench. He enjoyed watching people as they walked by.  Another rabbit woman dressed in jogging sweats hopped by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's not the same woman as before</i>, thought Tommy. <i>How does that work?  Was she a relative of the other woman?  Or does making two random rabbit people somehow mean that rabbit people are just a thing that exists now?  Does that mean that molasses people are a thing now, too? I'll have to ask Dusty if and when he shows up again.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around, and saw another old man walking along.  \"This guy is more like a turtle than like molasses\", said Tommy, but nothing happened.  <i>Guess that one didn't work</i>, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy looked around some more, and saw Jimmy Fitzgerald walking towards him, probably on his way to the ball filed, judging by the glove he was holding.. Jimmy had been his best friend back before Tommy had \"aged\" himself and Cindy. Now, Jimmy didn't even recognize him. In this re-written life, Tommy was just another adult Jimmy didn't know.   Tommy had new friends in his new life, but he still missed being friends with Jimmy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I wonder if I could \"age\" him?</i>, thought Tommy. <i>Hmm. To be fair, I should \"age\" one of Cindy's pre-change friends, too. I know! I'll do Dawn Nakamura!</i>  Dawn had been a good friend of Cindy's, after all. the only problem was that she and Jimmy had really disliked each other...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ho-ho</i>, thought Tommy, <i>I'll fix that...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAloud, he said:  \"Jimmy and Dawn are like a married couple that squabble all the time but really love each other!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her skin turned green, although it was a lighter green than the witch girl's. Her feet morphed into a mass of roots, and her fingers turned into branches with leaves on the ends.  Her hair turned into grass, and eeriest of all, her teeth became like the spines of a Venus Fly-Trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it true that you sleep at night by planting yourself in the ground?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right\" said Gladys. \"I sink my roots into the ground at night and retract them in the morning. This flower bed really is my bed!\" She laughed. \"But of course, when a plant person reaches my age,  there's a danger that when we plant ourselves, we'll take root permanently and be unable to leave whatever spot we're in.  It doesn't meant the end of us, of course, we live on for centuries after we take root, but we're only mobile when we're young.  That's why I never leave this garden anymore. When I take root I want it to be here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three friends spoke to the plant-woman for a little while, and then took their leave of her. Jimmy was suddenly besieged by the two sisters from earlier who wanted the Great Wizard's autograph.

Her whole team has some really talented swimmers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure they all swim like mermaids\", said Tommy. All across town, the members of Dawn's niece's swim team's legs fused into fish tails and they all grew gills. New info flashed into Tommy's mind. Girls who were excellent swimmers magically turned into mermaids at a certain age.No one - even wizards like Jimmy -  knew why, it was just a thing that happened.

She was wearing one of the anti-grav belts that Dawn had invented. They had really revolutionized the lives of mermaids, allowing them to move around more easily.  In the past, many people had forbidden their daughters to learn how to swim.  Nowadays, mermaids could go just about anywhere. They could survive outside the water for hours at a time, although they typically slept in beds that were like large fishtanks. They followed pretty much all the professions that land-dwellers did, but they were heavily recruited by navies and coast guards.  As there were no mermen, they didn't reproduce, and didn't pair off romantically with landsmen.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down on a bench, and an older, Asian-looking couple sat down on a bench across from him, speaking to one another in a language he didn't recognize.

Many they were speaking Chinese.  He magically learned Mandarin and Cantonese, but still didn't understand them. He magically learned Korean, Cambodian, Vietnamese, Thai, Filipino, Indonesian, Malaysian, Mongolian, Laotian, and even Maori, to no effect., before suddenly having a revelation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>What a dummy I am! Why am I doing this the hard way?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I speak whatever language they're speaking as fluently as I do English\". he said, but the spell didn't work. He still couldn't understand them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the Hmong couple got up and left, feeling a little wary  of the strange man sitting across from them, muttering to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy sat on the bench, absorbing new memories of a life in which he was born with a gift for learning languages. He decided to :teach\" himself several more.  On the way back to his car, he \"learned\" Spanish, German, Portuguese, French, Italian, Russian, Icelandic, Irish Gaelic, Welsh, Turkish, and Polish.  Once he was driving home, he added Arabic, Hindi, Cherokee, Navaho and Quechua.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I should \"learn\" some African languages, too</i>, he thought, so he \"taught\" himself Somali, Yoruba, Kikongo, Umbundu, Kimbundu and Chokwe.

Finally, as he arrived home and pulled into his driveway, he decided to \"learn\" some \"classical\" languages, so he picked up Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Old English and Sanskrit.  He tried to add a few more, but the spells began to fail repeatedly, so he took it as a sign that enough was enough, for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis life had been re-written again - he was now world-famous as a master of language, and worked as a highly-translator for a major publishing firm, the more so as he was the only person that Cindy would allow to translate her books. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went into the house, and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Tommy left his car to go into the house, he noticed another car parked in front of the house. He recognized it as belonging to Erica Perez, a friend of theirs from college who was probably Cindy's best female friend after Dawn.  Tommy had always felt that she'd had a bit of a crush on him, but she'd never said anything, and he knew it might be just his own ego. Erica worked at a daycare center - she just loved children, and couldn't wait to have children of her own some day. She was a frequent visitor. Tommy didn't mind, he liked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, he saw another of their neighbors, Jill Ridgeway, walking up the street with her daughter Ginny beside her. Ginny was a mermaid, and she was \"swimming\" in circles around her mother and was wearing a new antigrav belt.  Since Ginny hadn't been a mermaid when Tommy had last seen her two days ago, he assumed that she must have just transformed yesterday. He waved to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny \"swam\" over to him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Mr. Smith\", she said. \"Notice anything new?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you change your hair?\", he asked, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that, too\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do you like it?\", he asked, as her mother came to stand beside them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's strange\", said Ginny. \"It feels weird, and like what I was born to be, all at the same time. It's neat being able to breathe underwater, though. Is is true that people used to not let girls learn how to swim s they wouldn't change into mermaids?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes\", said Tommy. \"In some places, they still do. Of course, in ancient Greece, mermaids were considered sacred to the sea goddess Amphitrite, and it was considered a great honor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\", said Ginny, who began \"swimming\" in circles through the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how are you doing, Jill?\", asked Tommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm still a bit dazed\", said Jill. \"It happened during her swim practice yesterday. We had to go out and buy an antigrav belt, and arrange to have a new bed put in for her. She had to sleep in the bathtub last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill looked a bit uncertain to Tommy. Ginny was her only child, and this transformation meant big changes in her life, too. They chatted for a while, and then Tommy went into the house.  It looked a little different - the furniture was somewhat fancier, and there were a lot more books, many of them in different languages.  He found Cindy and Erica sitting in the front parlor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, ladies\", he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Tom\", said Erica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, hon\", said Cindy, as he leaned down to kiss her. \"How was the park?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK\", he said. \"Ran into to Jimmy and Dawn, and we went to the flower show. Say, I ran into Jill and Ginny Ridgeway out front. Ginny's a mermaid, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh\", said Cindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'd better start dinner\", said Tommy. \"Erica, will you eat with us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure\", said Erica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, by the way, Tommy\", said Cindy, \"Your Aunt Margaret's birthday is coming up soon, so remember to send her something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And remember her allergies\", added Erica, \"So don't send her flowers again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I only did that once!\", said Tommy. \"Geez, stereo nagging! It's like I have two wives!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, no</i>, he thought. <i>Did I just - ?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn engagement ring and wedding band appeared on her left hand. Her black hair - always worn short - grew to shoulder length. Her belly expanded, and her breasts grew, so that she looked just a pregnant as Cindy did. Her clothing changed to fit her altered body.  Tommy looked at the wedding portrait on the mantelpiece over the fireplace. Sure enough, in the picture, he had a bride on  either side of him, Cindy and Erica!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sighed as he acquired new memories. Polygamy was something that had always been accepted and legal. When he'd started dating Cindy, she had insisted he date Erica, too. \"We always share everything\", she'd said. And so he had dated them both, gotten engaged to them both, married them both, and honeymooned (!) with them both, and they had both gotten pregnant around the same time. Their married life had been surprisingly harmonious so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a daze, Tommy went out to the kitchen, and got dinner ready. After dinner., Cindy said, \"Guys, I wanna do some more writing. Erica,sweetie, do you think you and Tommy can occupy yourselves without me for a while?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I think so\", said Erica, leading Tommy out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night, lying in bed with a sleeping wife on either side of him, Tommy thought to himself: <i>This isn't so bad at all!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tommy got up Monday morning, made breakfast for himself and his wives, and then went off to work.  The first person he met when he arrived at work was his co-worker, Phil Anders, a friendly fellow who always seemed to be smiling. Today was no exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Phil\", said Tommy. \"You sure look like a happy little elf this morning!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure am\", said Phil, as he shrank one foot in height, grew points on his ears, and  developed \"elfin\" features on his face.  \"I had a great weekend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPhil told Tommy about his weekend as they went into the building. The next person he saw was Sam, the security guard, who had been working for the company since the day it was founded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sam, you old dinosaur, are you still here?\", joked Tommy, who then sighed as Sam turned into a velociraptor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesss, sssstill here\", said Sam. \"You know me, I'll ssssit in thissss chair forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy next turned to the receptionist, Stella, who was obsessive about having everything neat and in order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Stella\", he said, \"Still picture-perfect, as always.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn ornate picture frame materialized in front of Stella. the parts of her body outside the frame vanished, and the parts within  it flattened out, becoming an oil painting. the picture hung itself on the wall, and cords ran form it to robot arms that enable Stella to operate her computer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Mr. Smith\", she said. Nothing could induce her to speak with anything other than an icy formality<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went up to his office. His intern, Grace Jiang, was already hard at work.  Grace was another good friend from college, and Tommy had helped her get her job.  It wasn't pure nepotism - she was very good at her job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two greeted one another, and then Tommy asked, \"Have the proofs come back from Random on the Vitelli book?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're supposed to be here today\", said Grace, \"But I haven't seen them yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, Wanda from the mail room entered Tommy's office carrying the morning mail.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Ah, here's the mail fairy now\", said Tommy. Wanda shrank to six inches tall and sprouted delicate wings. Tommy guessed it had to be magic that enabled her to carry around mail several times her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn mid-morning, Tommy went to the break room to get a snack. He sighed when he saw that Chris Castle was there.  Chris was an old-fashioned sexist lech who was always going on about the kinds of women he liked. Chris was just smart enough not to say anything objectionable in front of women, but it didn't seem to occur to him that not all men liked to hear about that sort of thing, either.  Chris started going on to Tommy about the big-busted, big-haired blonde bimbo that he'd met at a bar over the weekend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy muttered under his breath, \"Chris, you <i>are</i> a big-busted, big-haired blonde bimbo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe watched as huge breasts erupted on Chris's chest, blonde hair  exploded from his head, and his clothing changed into a dress that barely covered Chris's new hyper-sexualized feminine curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, see you later, Tommy, tee-hee\", she said in her high-pitched voice.  <i>Was that a good thing or a bad thing that I just did?</i>, wondered Tommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy went back to his office, where Grace said, \"Ms. Davis wants to see you.\"  Ms. Davis was the company's CEO.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess I'd better go see what the  -\", Tommy began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't let her hear you call her the 'the old dragon'\", warned Grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine\", said Tommy, \"I'll go see what the young dragon wants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy went up to Ms. Davis' office and discovered - as he had expected - that she had been transformed into a twenty foot long dragon. there wasn't that much difference as far as Tommy was concerned. He gave her a report on his progress on various projects, and then went back to his office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt lunchtime, he went out to run a quick errand.He was distracted and nearly stepped in front of a passing car, but was pulled back just in time by a passing meter maid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\", he said to her. \"You saved my life! You're a real super-hero!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer uniform morphed into a garish costume with a stylized \"H\" in the middle of her chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, citizen!\", she said.  \"All in a day's work for Captain Helpful! Now be careful in future, won't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she leapt into the air and flew away.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Captain Helpful\"?</i>, he thought. <i>Well, I guess all the good names were taken.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went back to the office and entered the cafeteria. He spotted Ellen Francis, one of his co-workers who was heavily into mountain climbing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Ellen\", he said. \"Go mountain climbing again this weekend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure did\", she did. \"Brad and the kids came, too. There's nothing my family likes more than clambering over rocks together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's like you're all half mountain goat\", said Tommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right\" said Ellen. Horns curved back from her forehead, her ears grew longer and pointed than even Phil's, and a short beard sprouted from her chin. A tail grew from her backside, her feet turned into hooves, and her legs grew fur as they re-shaped into goat legs.  As they spoke, another woman bumped into them. It was Anita Arvanitakis, an older woman who was Ms. Davis' secretary.  Anita was always looking at her phone, which activity had led her to bump into Tommy and Ellen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry you two\", she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatcha looking at, Anita?\", asked Tommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnita showed them her phone, which was displaying  a picture of two tweens, one dark-haired and one red-haired, dressed in karate outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my daughter Alice and her BFF, Ingrid\", she explained. \"They're both very heavily into martial arts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\", said Tommy, \"It's like looking at an Amazon and a Valkyrie. I'm sure they're the two greatest martial artists ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a school across town, Alice and Ingrid both grew six inches taller and added considerable muscle mass. New info came into Tommy's mind. The two girls were world famous - they'd already won just about every honor a martial artist could.  They were only thirteen and there was no one on Earth who could last five minutes in a fight with either of them except each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy finished his lunch.  As he left the cafeteria, he ran into to more colleagues, Becky Hanson and Bobby Mehta.  The pair were inseparable, and as usual, were complaining about their workload.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you two grousing about now?\", he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, just all this work the dragon wants us to have done by this afternoon\", said Bobby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, what are you complaining about?\", asked Tommy. \"Bobby, you're a machine, and Becky, you'll be all over work like this like a swarm of bees on honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy watched as Bobby turned into a robot and Becky's body dissolved into a swarm of bees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU. ARE. CORRECT\", said Bobby, in an echoing mechanical voice. \"THE. ASSIGNMENT. WILL. BE. COMPLETED. ON. SCHEDULE..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yezzzz\", buzzed Becky the Swarm.  It zzzzhall be be done in zzzeeee zzzervizzzze of Mzzzzz. Davizzzz...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy went back up to his office, and managed to get through the rest of the workday without turning anyone else into anything inhuman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he went to leave  for the day, Grace said to him, \"Don't forget your Aunt Margaret's birthday, Tommy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, good grief\", he said. \"Have you been talking to Cindy and Erica? It's  like having a third wife!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bit his lip as an engagement ring and wedding band appeared on Grace's left ring finger, and her clothing altered to fit her now-pregnant belly.  New memories came into Tommy's mind regarding his marriage to three women instead of two.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why are <b>all</b> my wives pregnant?</i>, he wondered. <i>You'd think that with three of them one of them might not be.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tommy and Grace of them walked out to their car, a heavyset woman pushed rudely past them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it, Broadzilla!\", he said. \"You should be on Monster Island with all the other <i>kaiju</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman vanished, and new info came into Tommy's head - all of the monsters form those old Toho monster movies were real, and were living on an island in the Pacific.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wow, I sure have changed the world a <b>lot</b> today</i>, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At least, not all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTuesday morning, Tommy went to work. He had a quiet morning, and he and Grace decided to go out for lunch at a nearby diner.  The food there was good, and the service was prompt and efficient, even during the lunch rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm always amazed at what waitresses can do\", said Tommy.  \"It's like they're part of a special race of women who have six arms and can teleport.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery waitress on Earth - and every  woman who had worked as a waitress in the past, now had six arms and could teleport.

Centaurs, mermaids, sentient bee swarms, plant-people, robots, chicken people, capriforms, angels...Actually, he'd only turned Anastasia into an angel, hadn't he? It seemed as though when he brought a new type of person into the world, they became another sort of person that existed. (Of course, the people called \"angels\" weren't actually celestial being, that was just what they were called. It seemed that their \"halos\" were actually some sort of bioluminescence.) He'd have to ask Dusty how that worked if he saw him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walked along, he noticed an attractive, skimpily-dressed young woman - maybe about eighteen years old - with prodigious curves and long blonde hair. Grace caught him looking and said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, horndog, aren't the three beauties you've got at home enough for you? Anyway, I think it's a shame the way young girls dress these days!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy laughed: \"Are you practicing talking like someone's mother? It seems to me that it's not that long ago you were wearing skimpy outfits yourself, back when you were auditioning to be a part of my harem!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Harem'?\", scoffed Grace. \"You were just an amusing toy that the three of us decided to share!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy had to laugh at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, though, I suppose\", he said. \"She'll definitely be a devil in a blue dress for some young guy...or girl, I suppose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind them, the girl's skin turned a fiery red, her eyes an eerie yellow, and her hair became as black as night.  Short horns grew from her forehead, and  her ears and canine teeth grew sharp points.  A long tail with an arrowhead-shaped barb on the end grew from above her rear end. Her feet turned into obsidian hooves, and her leg re-shaped to become goat-like, although unlike capriforms, her legs were long, lanky and hairless. As her body changed, her outfit turned into a skimpy little blue dress. As with \"angels\", \"devils\" were now a kind of people that existed in the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy and Grace continued walking back into the office, gossiping about their workmates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Like all people, Tommy and Grace liked a little gossip, but like all chicken-people, Henrietta specialized in it.  After a perfunctory greeting, she said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you two heard, b'gawk? That sleaze bag Larry Higgins is going out with Theresa Biltmore in accounting. She she watch out for him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he's a total snake, alright\", said Tommy.  Larry, who at that moment was at Theresa's desk giving her his best \"Mr. Smooth\" act dropped to the ground as his clothing disappeared and he transformed into a king cobra.  \"But\", Tommy continued,\"Don't worry about her. If he's a snake, then she's a snake charmer. She'll have him slithering along to whatever tune she decides to play. A <i>murli</i> appeared in Theresa's hands and she began playing it. Instantly helpless under his control,  Larry slithered obediently into the basket which had materialized next to her desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meanwhile, buck-buck-buck\", said Henrietta, \"Jill Peters has that bum Ted Winters pretty much living off her, b'gawk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", said Tommy. \"He's like a human version of - what's that fish where the male attaches himself to the female, and basically fuses to her and never does anything again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anglerfish\", said Grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right\", said Tommy. \"He's like a human version of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Jenny's desk, Ted bit into Jill's belly, fusing to her body.  Within minutes, his body had withered to a fraction of its former size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio watched as another couple appeared.  Andy Jenkins and Emiko O'Halloran walked along with their arms around each other, making kissy faces at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm all for true love\", said Grace, \"But that's a bit much for the work place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah\", said Tommy, \"Those two are joined at the hips.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy and Emiko's bodies fused from the waits down, leaving them Y-shaped, one pair of legs with one torso. New info came into Tommy's mind. This fusion was a new trend among young couples. Any qualified magic-user could do it, but the vast majority of the time, the couple ended up having themselves separated a few months later.  Tommy, Cindy, Erica and Grace all loved each other, but they all knew how important it was to have alone time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And did you hear, b'gawk\", said Henrietta. \"Joe Buck-buck-buckley almost got himself fire, arguing with the dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a stubborn clown\", said Grace.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're all bullheaded in that family\", said Tommy, remembering his old, pre-change nemesis Chris Buckley,  Joe's nephew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even the women?\", asked Grace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess the women would all be cow-headed\", said Tommy. Wherever they were, the members of the Buckley family now had horned, bovine heads.  Tommy laughed at the thought of what Chris must look like now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Probably hasn't changed his personality much</i>, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext...</span></div></div>",

He was something of a mystery - he didn't seem to have a job or a home or anything, but he was always clean and well-dressed.

All these crimes were merely to be decoys, distractions (hopefully keeping the police and any meddling super-heroes busy) from the main crime, which she herself would commit. Sometimes she stole for profit, gems which could be re-sold to maintain her organization and equipment and pay the Cygnets, and to generally supplement her lifestyle. Other times she stole gems which were far too well-known to be re-sold. These she stole for her private collection, for the thrill of knowing that she and she alone would own them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis job would be one such. She would be stealing the infamous Worthington Emerald. As always before a job, she psyched herself up by thinking of everything she had going for her:  Her superior intellect, physical strength equal to any ten women, her elite fighting skills, her ability to fly at near the speed of sound, her lightweight and flexible but also bulletproof costume and last but not least, what she called her \"Swansong\" - a sonic cry which could blast through six-inch steel-plated armor.

As a consequence, she had created a special employment niche for herself, doing hazardous jobs which would otherwise require expensive protective equipment. She never wanted for work, and was already extremely wealthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only other change that day was that evening, when Cindy was talking about her mother's bridge club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, those women\", said Tommy. \"I love your mother, but the rest of them are all a bunch of harpies.\"  Across town, all the members of the bridge club except for Cindy's mother transformed into beings with the heads, necks and breasts of women, and the bodies of large birds of prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext:</span></div></div>",

A scaffolding holding a workstation where she could get at it was now attached to the dock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hailed him, and then they got down to business.

Sous-chef Roberta had the day off, so he got breakfast ready on his own. Today at 10:37, the wish Dusty had granted him would run out.

All he had to do now was not say anything to mess it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter breakfast, he did a Skype session with his mother.

Sure enough, their bellies were all bigger, since they were all now carrying twins - the babies they had been carrying, and one each of the quadruplets. As his mother continued to chat about her vacation, new memories came into Tommy's mind of his life as an only child.  When he finally finished talking with (i.e., listening to) his mother, he realized it was nearly 10:30.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Almost time, now</i>, he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say\", said Cindy, \"Tommy, could you and one of the ladies help me with this play I've been working on?

Now she was Stephanie Smith Jiang, wife of Cindy, Erica, Charlotte and Harold. (Tommy had remembered his mother once telling him that if he'd been born a girl, he might have been named Stephanie. Now, Stephanie remembered being told that if she'd been born a girl, she might have been named Thomas.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked where Grace had been sitting. Now \"Grace\" was \"Harold\", a handsome young man that she, Cindy, Erica and Charlotte had married.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I-I've got to do something about this</i>, thought Stephanie.  <i>I need to be alone to think.</i>  Fortunately, no one would question a pregnant woman's need to suddenly go to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you OK,hon?\" asked Cindy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just gotta go\", said Stephanie.  Struggling to get out of the chair, she said, \"Ooof! It's like I'm carrying all eight babies by myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer already enormous belly became gigantic, as she was new carrying octuplets.  <i>Oh, no!</i>, she thought.  She looked at her wives. Cindy, Erica and Charlotte's bellies were all flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy moved to help her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, babe\", she said.  \"we all had plenty of 'fun', but you ended up having the babies for all of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was on her feet, Stephanie said, \"I'm OK, I'll be back in a minute.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut even as she reached the bathroom, she felt a sudden absence, as if something she hadn't known was there had suddenly left. she looked at her phone.  It was 10:37, too late for her to change anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she sat down on the toilet, she was somehow not surprised to see Dusty the Djinn sitting on the edge of the bathtub.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, kiddo\", he said, \"Just wanted to check in one last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dusty, please\", said Stephanie,\"Please can you do something about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, kid, not part of the bargain\",  he said. \"This is the world you made for yourself, now you have to live in it. But before I go, I will tell you the real reason this all happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\", asked Stephanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you a story\", said dusty. \"Don't worry, I've stopped time for a moment, the others won't wonder why you're in here for so long.  Anyway,  a long time ago, about thirty thousand years ago, there was another civilization on this world.  This civilization was dominated by magic.  All of the magical creatures and powers from your myths and legends were real. It got more and more powerful, but then one day, the great powers of that world fought the magical equivalent of an all-out nuclear war. Most of the magical beings were either wiped out, or fled to what you would call 'other dimensions'.   Magical energies were released that were toxic to all magical beings - and to anyone else who tried to use magic. these energies had what you would call a long half-life, sort of like what you call Strontium-90.  Non-magical beings - your ancestors - survived OK, but their world was thrown into chaos.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come there's no records of this civilization?\", asked Stephanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The destruction was pretty thorough, and the few bits and pieces of it that survived have been largely misinterpreted by your historians and archaeologists.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are you still here?\", asked Stephanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The object you found me in was a sort of prototype of what you would call a 'fallout shelter', and it worked just fine. I slept for millennia, and woke up about ten years ago. from inside my shelter, I scanned your world, and found a civilization based on science rather than magic, but it, too , was one the verge of destroying itself, just as the old civilization had.  I decided to do something about it. If a world based on magic had failed, and a world based n science was failing, I decided to make a world with both magic and science in it.  So, I made sure you found me.and put it into your head to make the wish you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And then you just sat back and watched the fun?\", asked Stephanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not exactly\", said Dusty. \"I meddled with your mind a bit.  I made sure that you didn't say anything that destroyed either the world or you - no 'It looks like World War Three in here' or 'I'm dead on my feet'.  Also, I made sure that you didn't stop to think about what you were doing to people or how they might feel about it. Finally, I made sure that you didn't try to undo the major changes that you made. Oh, yeah, and I loosened your tongue a bit, so you'd say things that wouldn't normally occur to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow\", said Stephanie. \"Say, if you're so powerful, what did you need me for? why not just do it yourself\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because one weakness we magical beings tend to have is lack of imagination. It's why we're always granting wishes to mortals, they come up with things we can't. Plus, I don't really get science. You understood its potential more than I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you think this new world  that I've helped you make has a better chance to survive than the old ones did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I <b>hope</b> so\", said Dusty.  \"You're spread out over more planets than we were, and when your friend Dawn finises inventing that 'warp drive' of hers, you'll spread out to other stars, as well. Maybe that means you have a better chance of survival.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will you do now?\" asked Stephanie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to move to another dimension and just observe what happens here. Best I not interfere here anymore, I'm too much of the old world. Oh, and once I start time up, your memories of your old life will fade.  Sorry, but you'll be better off. really.  Anyway, time for me to go! So long, kiddo!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bye\", said Stephanie, as Dusty vanished and time started up again.  <i>Was I talking to myself again?</i>  She shook her head, finished what she had to do. pulled herself to her feet, washed up, and waddled out to rejoin her husband and wives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Tommy let out a wordless gurgle and suddenly felt very warm and sleepy in the giant's embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny, now a mature angelic being, simply smiled down at the two newborns in her arms. They were beautiful, as was befitting the children of God. With a small, light kiss on the heads of her babies, the angel was bathed in a pillar of light and ascended back to the realm of heaven, where her former brother and mother, now her newborns, would grow in peace before becoming cherubs, and then angels themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer little baby boy would be especially powerful, her little Thomas who God himself had said would weild the power of words over the Kingdom of Man and combat the Legions of Hell when the Seals were broken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the magic, the Genie and Tommy's wish, as reality's changed status cemented itself, the Genie simply shook his head and waited for the next foolish mortal to find and use his vessel.</span></div></div>",

The shark, the salesmen, his sister, his house...  He would cry, but he was too busy dodging the hand-baskets.
