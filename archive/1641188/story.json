Again.Jack was mad as usual, but there was nothing he could do about. He was just too weak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was a 16 year old fox anthro. He always got A's and did well in school. However, he was sly and clever like most foxes, but that left him without a lot of muscle. Or any muscle. He had no friends at school and the teachers were too lazy to see that he was getting beat up pretty much every day. It was a hard life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack walked into the back of his house and slammed the door angrily. He set his backpack down and yelled out \"Mom! I'm home!\". No reply. Suddenly, Jack noticed a not on the fridge. It said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDear Jack,<br>\r\nYour father and I are going away for the week. We trust that you will be responsible, get your homework done, and go to bed on time. See you in a week!<br>\r\nMom<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack sighed and set the note down. At least he could relax alone. Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. Jack groaned and went to go answer. When he opened the door, the only thing there was a small package. He raised an eyebrow, but picked it up and set it on the counter and opened it. All that was in there was a small blue rock with a slight glow and a note. The note read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Destiny<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack thought that was weird.Destiny? What the heck did that mean? Jack shrugged and picked it up. He thought about everyone beating him up and got mad all over again. He silently wished he were stronger, like those bodybuilders in magazines. That would teach those bullies a lesson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jack felt a warm tingling all over his body......<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much muscle does Jack gain?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>At first, Jack didn't pay a whole lot of attention to the small, blue rock that was wrapped inside of the little, square, cardboard box. After all, to Jack, sending him a small box in the mail containing nothing more than a little blue rock almost seemed like nothing more than a stupid, practical joke. The timing of this whole thing was horrible, mailing him this rock on a day when his parents were out of town, after a horrible day at school when Jack had gotten into three fights at school and ended up hobbling his way home with a bruised leg and a black eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack walked into the bathroom and examined his eye. He looked bad, and the skin around his eye was all swollen. He was lucky that mom and dad weren't home, or else he would have been grounded by them too. Now, all he had to do is try to recover from all the scars and wounds which he had gotten at school, and hope that he could just defend himself from the bullies during the rest of the week so that he wouldn't get banged up even more! Going to school was no longer a matter of getting an education, it was a matter of surviving and staying alive and getting home in one piece!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack grabbed a cloth with some soap and gently rubbed his long, furry nose around his eye. It stung, but at least it seemed like it was healing. Then, he looked down and saw the bruises on his left leg. He had gotten kicked and stomped on a few times, since two thugs tried to beat him up. Cowards! So easy when two guys try to beat up on one lonely anthro fox. It was two against one, so the single guy is always the loser. Jack wished he could become stronger so he could defend himself and others better from these thugs who were making life miserable for him and his friends at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after having spent a few minutes nursing his wounds, Jack walked back to the kitchen counter and sat down in front of the little, square box. He took the blue rock out of the box and placed it in his right paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what the heck is this thing for?\" Jack sighed. \"Why would someone mail me a rock?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, while he was holding the rock in his paw, he noticed that the rock began to let off a bright, blue glow of nice, blue light. The light was surrounding the rock on all sides, like it was some sort of precious metal. It was shining like it was some sort of diamond or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! Maybe this thing is worth a lot of money?\" Jack wondered, as the glow intensified even more, the longer he held the rock in his paw. \"How pretty!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the intense blue glow continued to grow, and Jack saw that his paw, then his arm, and then his chest, and finally his entire body began to glow from the same blue light!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh man! Now I'm glowing, too! What is this? It doesn't hurt or anything... It feels nice and soothing to me...\" Jack wondered to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tingling sensation concentrated in Jack's muscles and around his wounds. Jack suddenly felt the healing powers of the rock, and the wound on his leg began to heal, and the swelling in his eye began to diminish quickly. In fact, Jack quickly got up and walked over to the bathroom, where he noticed that the black eye was gone, and his leg was no longer hurting as he was walking on it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool! I'm feeling fine again! The wounds and scars are gone! I like this!\" Jack grinned, as he looked down at the rock in his paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, he saw something else in the reflection of the bathroom mirror: His muscles were slowly inflating all over his body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heyyyy! Arrgmmm! I'm... getting... stronger!!!!\" Jack growled as he flexed his arms. He must have gained about 20 pounds of muscle already, and he was still growing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis chest was pushing out slowly as his pectorals grew bigger and rounder, making his shoulders ever wider. His biceps continued to increase in size while mighty abs popped up over his torso. His quads were much bigger than before and his calves were already bulging out of the back of his legs!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! This rock is making my muscles grow! I wonder how big I'm gonna get?\" Jack wondered, as his muscles continued to increase in size as he slowly gained 30 pounds... 40 pounds... 50 pounds of muscle...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack just stood there, holding the rock in his paw until the growth stopped...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack opened his eyes. Upon opening them, he realizes he had gained about 100 pounds of muscle. Staring down his body, he was able to see just how much more his muscles protruded out on his body. His pecs, abs, and quads were sticking out exceptionally as he stared down to his feet. Jack looked back up at the mirror, which was in view of a hunky and lean-muscled fox with muscles all over that made him look like a model, or a kick-boxer even. Jack smirked at this, and then turns around to take a look at his back. The muscles all over his back were pretty shredded and rippling. They sure made his back look hard and powerful, that's for sure. Upon turning back around, the next thing he notices was his shirt, which is a size M but is now stretching out on his upper body and revealing a few of his lower washboard abs. Not worrying too much about it, Jack merely raises up his right arm to give his pumped bicep a flex, which plumped out very well in return. Suddenly, Jack hears a rip from his shirt, and then three-quarters of his shirt ends up ripping apart from his collar down. \"Oops! ... Ah well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack grabs his shirt and tears apart what was left right off of his body with ease. Looking back at the mirror, Jack places his hands against his hips and spreads out his large chest and lats. It wasn't much, but it was still an impressive sight. Jack never looked and felt so strong before, and it was all thanks to the strange rock that was given to him, which he looks at in his hand. \"I still don't know what this is, or who gave it to me, but I'm thankful for it.\" While staring down at the rock, he takes notice of his shorts, which were also a size M but were more stretchable than his shirt. \"Whoa...\" Jack tosses out the remnants of his shirt in the trash as he walks out of his bathroom and heads into his room. He sets the cardboard box with the rock inside of it on a small drawer and then he sits himself down on his bed. He pulls up his right pant leg to give his thigh a good feel. He even flexes it a few times to get a feel of what he was dealing with. He was impressed. He even stretches his left leg out to watch his quad and calf flex in motion. Jack begins feeling his stretched leg, \"Wow... I have <b>got</b> to show someone the new me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack gets up to ready himself to head outside, but not before taking a good long look at himself in front of a full-length mirror that was in his room. He starts doing a few long bodybuilding poses, watching certain muscle groups he flexed tense and bulge with each different pose. Feeling them pump up even made him feel really good about himself. After his posing routine, he begins to think to himself about where he should go.</span></div></div>",

Everyone was probably out enjoying it. Jack then came up with a great idea: the beach. Jack looked back to the mirror. As he looked at his muscular form, he pictured himself with girls surrounding him and admiring his muscles. Jack then imagined befriending other muscular guys who would challenge him to use his muscles. Jack knew he had to go there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack ran upstairs to get his swim trunks from his closet; they were elastic so fitting them on was not a problem for him. He loved how tight they felt against his waist and legs. Jack went back to the mirror and smiled to still see definition in his thighs. He pressed his hands against his thighs and they were still bulgy and strong, just like the way he liked it. Jack grabbed a towel and was about to go until he glanced at the stone again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was really thankful for the rock, even though he had no idea what it is or where it came from. Looking at the stone gave Jack an idea: could the stone do it again? Make him bigger? Jack didn't know but was too excited about the beach to try. What if it could? Jack had to take the rock with him to the beach just in case. He found a pair of his old shoes near the door, pulled out the shoelace, wrapped the rock around the lace, and the lace around the neck. Jack grinned to see the rock resting nicely between his pecs. With his mind at ease, Jack opened the door to the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack felt euphoric when he arrived at the beach. The sun was shining on his fur and warming his muscles, the air was crisp enough to puff up his ripped chest to breath it in, and the sand under his feet energized him to do anything. Jack tensed up when he saw his fun options completely open; there was a group of girls on one side and a group of other muscular guys on the opposite side. At first, Jack didn't know where to start. He then looked out into the ocean. Jack felt mesmerized by its deep blue shade and curling waters. Jack pressed against the sand towards the ocean impulsively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack dived and water felt great, not to hot or cold. He kicked and waved the water around vigorously while enjoying the sense of water flowing by his face. Jack swam what felt like a long time and wasn't tired yet. He figured his new muscles gave him new stamina as well. Jack went up the surface and the shore was about a mile in front of him. He was amazed and thrilled. \"Man, I love my muscles!\" Jack screamed. He then swam back at the same fast speeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack walked back to shore completely wet. He looked around to see the girls and guys were still here.</span></div></div>",

He stomped to their direction as the girls saw a handsome titan coming their way. Jack could see smiles on their faces and smiled back. \"Hey ladies,\" he greeted flirtingly. The girls giggled. \"My,\" said one in the group, \"you're one big fox, aren't you?\" \"What makes you say that?\" asks Jack as he tenses and shreds his arms, chest, and legs to the admiring group. \"Is it because I'm that good looking?\" The girls loved Jack's poses and how he was talking to them. \"Come lie down with us!\" another girl said. Jack didn't hesitate following her command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was having a party with his new fans. The girls talked and giggled while feeling his strong muscles. Jack tensed his bicep as one girl was feeling it. She was surprised. It felt harder than iron! The girls felt every muscle they could find from Jack's neck to his legs. Jack felt so relaxed that he could fall asleep under the girls' admiration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look...and feel amazing!\" said one girl to Jack. Jack's ears perked. \"If you think so,\" said Jack standing up, \"Check this out!\" He then began to swell all his power into his muscles making them larger. The girls loved every pose Jack did. He flexed his arms both upward and downward, rippled his pecs and abs making them bounce, and pushed his legs to look like tree trunks. The girls clapped and cheered for Jack and Jack loved every minute of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother idea came to Jack. \"Who wants a ride on the 'Hot Fox Express'?\" The girls instantly ran to him. Jack picked up the first two girls he saw and placed them on his mountainous shoulders. Other still cheered and rubbed his muscles. Jack thought he could get use to this.</span></div></div>",

I'll still be around.\" Jack walked off, waving back to them. Jack decided to scour the beach some more. Not much was going on around him. Just some kids playing in the sand, adults lying on the sand, and a few other people having fun out in the water. Suddenly, Jack overhears a loud grunt. Jack turns his attention towards one part of the beach. \"Whoa...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking out on the beach were three good-looking weight-trainers. Lying on a bench-pressing equipment was a well-muscled bear, who was the biggest of the group and wearing a pair of black and yellow shorts. He was pumping his arms and chest up and down as they flexed up and down with strength. He was also grunting to himself after each rep. Working out next to him was a deer, who was on the ground doing push-ups with only one hand in a pair of red gym shorts. The last and smallest of the group was a white-furred rabbit. He was wearing a black tank-top and a pair of black shorts while doing arm-ups with what looked like 75-pound weights. He was still impressively muscled though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a pretty astounding sight. Jack joined a small group of people that formed around the three. Looking at Jack's self and at the three, he appeared to be just about as big as the deer. Jack stood there and crossed his arms, watching as the three just continued their workouts. After a few minutes, the bear sets the 500-pound barbell back in its resting place. Jack's eyes widen as he thought to himself, \"Holy cow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear sits up on the equipment. He grabs a towel from out of his gym bag and wipes some of the sweat from his forehead. He sets his towel back in his bag, and then looks up at the small crowd. \"Howdy folks.\" He went ahead and raised his arms in a flexing motion and tensed them up with his pecs. \"Seein' anything ya like?\" The crowd started cheering and a applauding to the stunning sight. Jack was really impressed with the bear's pose too. Only tensing his arm muscles, and he still looked rippling and shredded all over. The bear suddenly cocks an eyebrow up at Jack. \"Hm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\"</span></div></div>",

Despite his new size and strength, Jack knew he didn't stand a chance against this giant bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" said the bear to Jack, \"I never seen a muscled fox like you around here before.\" Jack didn't know what he meant by that. \"You look pretty good!\" the bear continued, \"What's your name?\" \"Uhh..umm Jack?\" The bear chuckled and grabbed Jack's meaty shoulder. \"Relax man, I'm not gonna hurt you! I'm a good bear!\" This made Jack feel more at ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let me show you my friends.\" The bear guided Jack to the deer and rabbit, who stopped their workout to meet the new muscle fox. \"This is Randy,\" said the bear pointing to the deer, \"And Davis.\" to the rabbit. \"I'm Max by the way.\" \"Nice to meet you all.\" said Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Randy circled around Jack observing his muscles. \"He looks pretty strong to me.\" said the deer. \"I'd say he is.\" said Davis. Jack playfully flexed his arm and Max sqeezed it with his hands. \"Yep, this guy's a powerhouse!\" replied Max. Jack blushed a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack noticed the bench Max was using earlier. \"Can I try something?\" Jack asked the trio. Max slammed Jack's back. \"Sure! Knock yourself out!\" Jack walked over to the bench. He knew he couldn't press 500 lbs. like Max so Jack adjusted the weight to 100 lbs. He lied down under the bar to press. Jack was pumping himself easily. He quickly did 20 reps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n He and his knew friends knew the weight was too easy so Jack got up and added another 50 lbs. The bar was more challenging but still not enough. Jack tried again at 200 lbs. After the first rep, Jack knew this was right weight. It was heavy enough to tense definition in his muscles. Jack loved the sight of his muscles tensing and pumping while feeling energized. He finally rested at 10 reps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack huffed for air. Max, Randy, and Davis clapped for him. \"That was impressive!\" said Randy. \"We're about the same size and I can't lift 200 lbs!\" \"I'm sure you could, Randy,\" said Max. \"You just need the right motivation!\" Max then flexed his arms as if making a point. \"Screw you!\" said Randy jokingly as Jack and other laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis raised his arms and stretched his back, rippling his chest in the process. \"Well,\" he said, \"What now?\"</span></div></div>",

It all began five years ago. Davis was the youngest of 4 brothers and they all picked on him. Davis's brothers played \"keep away\" with his stuff, lock him in the closet, and throw him in a headlock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSchool wasn't so generous to Davis either. Jocks picked on him too. They would throw Davis in a trash can, throw him in a locker, and pushed his head in a toilet for swirlies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis had enough. He wasn't going to let himself get bullied any longer. The small rabbit would head to the gym during the weekends hoping to change himself. He motivated himself with a mental picture of a giant muscular rabbit towering his brothers and the jocks. Davis kept on pushing his body to its limit despite the tough exercise he edured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Davis was jogging to strengthen his legs. He was already feeling exhausted from lifting weights and several sit up reps. During his regular jogging routine, Davis stumbled across another jogger, a lean yet tough looking deer. \"Good morning!\" said the deer to the rabbit. Davis was too tired to respond. The deer could see in Davis's face that he didn't look so good. All of a sudden, Davis tripped on his feet and collasped. The deer stopped and pulled him into the shade of a nearby tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis regained consciousness after a few minutes. \"Are you okay?\" asked the deer. \"Yeah,\" said Davis in hollow breaths, \"I'm fine.\" Davis just wanted to shake off the event by getting up and continue jogging. He tried standing up but doing so made him dizzy. \"Are you crazy? You're not well enough to get up!\" the deer exclaimed. Davis still breathed shallowly. \"I have to. I need to.. I need to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to rest!\"<br>\r\n\"You don't under..\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, I do! Just shut up and take deep breaths.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavis realized he couldn't convince the deer that he was all right. He did what he was told and breathed deeply. He began to feel better after a few minutes of deep breathing. \"I feel better.\" Davis told the deer. \"Here.\" The deer handed him a bottled water. Not knowing he was that thirsty, Davis grabbed it and gulped it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happened back there?\" the deer asked Davis. Davis explained his routine and the deer told him that nonstop exercise was very unhealthy and he needed rest. Davis then told his story and desire for muscle. \"Look,\" the deer started, \"I'm trying to put on some muscle too. How about you and  I train together? It's more fun AND healthy.\" Davis agreed. \"I'm Davis, by the way.\" \"Randy.\" replied the deer.</span></div></div>",

His mind was too confused to think of a logical conclusion to this, or anything at all really. He saw that he had now gained at least 100 pounds of muscle and didn't seem to be stopping!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis pecs grew to the size of large dinner plater implanted into his chest, bulging out menacingly. His abs, previously a six-pack, expanded into an eight-pack, each curve deep enough to hide a dime in. His biceps swelled out to bowling ball sized, and seemed to weigh as much as one too! His calves and quads inflated and lengthened, giving Jack the height of a basketball player. Finally, Jack felt a tugging in front of what was left of his pants as his endowment bulked and grew to match his new muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the growth came to an end, and Jack immediately tried to get a measure of his new body. He seemed to be about 7'3 (give or take an inch or two), and though he wasn't sure of his exact weight, he figured he was 300 pounds of pure muscle AT LEAST.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack suddenly realized just what had happened to him. He had finally gotten the muscle he had dreamed of, and them some. Extremely joyful, he began to flex every muscle he could think of, watching each muscle ripple with newfound strength. Jack wondered how much he could lift... he felt like he could shatter world records, and he probably could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack decided that he wanted to go out and show off his new muscles. He didn't have a set plan on where to go, he just wanted to get outside. So, without realizing that all that was left of his clothes were his underwear and shreds of his shirt and pants, he bounded outside and down the street, flexing for passing bystanders as they stared in awe at the hulking fox.</span></div></div>",

He realized that it was kind of vain, but he figured he deserved it after all of the teasing he went through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack was walking past the local gym, he suddenly stopped and looked through the glass windows. He saw big muscle men pumping their bodies and trying to get bigger. It made him want to go in there and workout, too, and he even out-muscled the strongest bodybuilders he could see. He pushed open the double doors and entered the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack walked through the many machines and looked for a place to start, the other men working out stopped and gazed at him in envy. They all started talking about this huge newcomer, and many of them were jealous of his muscles and his bulge. However, they eventually settled down and went back to their routines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack eyed a bench press and wondered what weight to start with, someone spoke from behind him. \"Need any help?\" the person said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack turned around and saw the man behind him. It was a very muscular orca whale, probable the largest man in  the gym besides Jack. His face looked mature and tough, but not really mean looking. He stood about 6' 6\", and while he wasn't nearly as tall as Jack, his muscles were still ripped to an insane measure. Jack stared in awe at his monstrous biceps and pecs clearly outlined by his sweaty tank top, not to mention his thick calves that stretched his shorts to the limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I've seen you around here, you must be new. Hi, I'm Edward,\" the orca said, extending his hand. Jack, still feeling confident, grasped Edward's hand firmly and shook it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Jack, and no, I haven't been here before,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I've been working out here for 10 years. I'll show you around,\" Edward said. \"But first, let's get some clothes on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked down and blushed, only now realizing that all that was left of his clothes were his straining underwear. Luckily, Edward had an oversized blue Speedo with him, and it fit Jack well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdward showed Jack how to work all of the machines there. Jack learned that he could lift a lot more weight then even Edward could; he might have even been close to a world record! Edward was astounded, but still exercised next to Jack with confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey also talked a bit, and Jack learned about Edward. Edwards was 30 years old, and was a top bodybuilder a while back. Now, though, he mainly stuck to working out in the gym, only entering a competition every once in a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a rigorous workout session, Jack and Edward finally called it a day. Jack decided to start making a routine of working out with Edward, hoping to become even bigger and stronger to enter competitions. Jack left the gym and headed home, quickly falling asleep in his bed and dreaming about how big he could become.</span></div></div>",

It read 10:00 on it. Jack remembered that he had agreed to meet Edward at the gym at noon, so he decided to get up and begin to get ready.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJack walked downstairs and started making himself a bowl of cereal. His parents were still away, so he had the house all to himself (though he was still wondering how he was going to explain his growth to his parents).<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs he ate his breakfast, Jack noticed that the boxers he was wearing seemed tighter than the day before, even though they were XXL to fit his new body. He shrugged it off and finished off his cereal in no time.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJack walked back upstairs and into the bathroom to take a shower. However, as he was preparing to undress, he caught sight of the mirror and gasped. At first he thought he was just groggy, but he realized that what he was seeing was real.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAmazingly, Jack had grown even larger overnight! Jack was barely able to see into the mirror, standing tall at over 8'. His muscles had also grown in proportion to his new height. His pecs were huge and beefy, sticking out like truck tires and blocking Jack's sight below. His abs, while still an 8-pack, were cut incredibly thick and powerful. He moved his arms around a bit, feeling the new weight of his biceps the size of exercise balls.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nOf course, Jack's lower body grew to help keep him up. His thighs nearly pushed up against each other, and his calves were thickened out below to complete his ultra-sculpted legs. He felt his bubble butt and private parts bulging out, explaining the tightness of his boxers.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nJack gazed in astonishment. He was excited that he was now even stronger and manlier, but how did it happen? He wasn't even holding the rock, so why did he grow? Jack wanted some answers, but then he remembered that Edward would be waiting for him at the gym. Jack didn't know what to do!</span></div></div>",

It was exactly where he  had left it, so no one moved it onto him. It seemed possibly a little  shinier then when he last saw it, but that didn't necessarily mean  anything. Jack still had no idea what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack  sat down on his couch (which seemed to get closer to breaking every  time he sat on it) and thought about the situation. He found it possible  that the rock might have formed some kind of connection with him when he first touched it, but that was just speculation, and it still didn't explain why he grew when he didn't do anything. Dismayed, Jack stood up and began to walk back to his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he plodded down the hall, Jack passed by a full length mirror hanging on the wall. Jack stopped and stared at his reflection a bit. While he definitely was utterly confused about this, he was also really excited. More muscle just meant more strength, and he loved the feeling of power his muscles gave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack began to flex a bit for himself in the mirror. Just moving each muscle made him feel good, like he was on top of the world. He had a whole future ahead of him! He could get into bodybuilding or weightlifting, get an athletic scholarship to college, maybe go pro...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, as Jack continued to flex and think to himself, something strange happened...</span></div></div>",

There was a mysterious man standing in front of him. It was a dragon who was wearing long purple robes. It was hard to tell with the robes on, but Jack could see that the man was athletically muscular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How... how do you know my name? And who are you?\" Jack asked, also secretly wondering how the man had just appeared behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are asking many questions, and I shall answer them,\" the dragon said, his voice calm and mysterious. \"My name is Ryoto, and I know many things about you Jack. In fact, I'm the one who gave you the rock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was stunned. Ryoto knew about the rock! Jack had no doubt that he was telling the truth. \"Why did you send me the orb?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That will take some explaining,\" Ryoto replied. \"I come from a universe different from yours, where knights and magic from your fairy tales are quite real. I myself am a wizard, which is how I was able to appear before you. I am part of an elite group of wizards sworn to protect our universe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, there was a large stone that was kept hidden from the public. It had extraordinary power beyond our comprehension. One wizard is always assigned to guard the stone, and I was honored to be the wizard chosen to do it. However, one day an evil wizard killed many people and blasted the stone with powerful magic, hoping to destroy the only thing between him and world domination. Instead of disappearing like it should have, however, the stone was split into 7 smaller rocks and the wizard fled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After some testing, I discovered the rocks had the power to grant ordinary men and women with incredible strength anytime they wished. I knew this power had to be used for good, so I set out to form a team of 7 anthros who could wield the rock well and use it to fight evil creatures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I quickly found 6 people worthy enough to use the power of the rocks. However, I became stuck when trying to find a rightful 7th owner, so I decided to look into your universe. I searched for the man with the purest heart, and I found you, so I sent the rock to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack thought about it for a moment. He was the man with the purest heart? He considered himself a pretty good guy, but he still slipped up sometimes. However, considering his new muscles, he wasn't complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what you're saying is that you want me to join your team?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyoto nodded. \"Yes, Jack I do. I know that you don't feel confident about yourself, but you can do this. I can see into your heart, and I see that you will make a fine warrior.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack smiled. \"Thanks. Let me go grab the rock.\" he said. He quickly ran and grabbed the rock before sprinting back to Ryoto. \"So, how exactly are we going to get there?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyoto smiled. \"Like this.\" He grabbed onto Jack's large hand and mumbled something before snapping his fingers. In the blink of an eye, the two were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing Jack knew, he was in a completely different place. Looking around, he saw that Ryoto was right when he said the place was medieval. There were castles and barren land all around. Ryoto and Jack seemed to be standing in front of some sort of stone fortress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is our team headquarters, where the other 6 and I live and train. Speaking of which, I think you should go meet them now.\"</span></div></div>",

Immediately, the 6 line up in a line waiting to hear what Ryoto had to say. \"Everybody,\" Ryoto started, \"I would like for you all to meet Jack.

He had thought he was big before, but Iaru was huge. He must have been a foot taller than Jack and had a lot bigger muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be Jack.

Master Ryoto did mention that you came from another universe. Your clothing is rather odd also,\" Iaru said. While everyone else was dressed in bulky armor, basic fabrics and even loincloths, Jack was still wearing his t-shirt and shorts. Jack knew that he was going to stick out for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like to meet with some of the others?\" Iaru asked. Jack quickly nodded his head, happy that at least Iaru was being nice to him. Iaru led him over to Irina, who was lifting weights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack got his first close up look of Irina. He realized how beautiful she really was. Her silver fur shimmered with sweat as she completed countless reps with heavy weights. She was even bigger than Jack, but Jack didn't really mind. Also, Irina's breasts were humongous! Jack figured the same type of growth happened with her breasts as with his package.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIrina noticed Jack and Iaru and set the large weights down with a thud. \"Hello Jack. I'd like to cordially say welcome to the team,\" Irina said, extending her hand for a handshake. Jack got a close look at her monster biceps and became flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm.... thank you,\" Jack spat out, accepting Irina's handshake.

You're very handsome,\" she said, scratching Jack's chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was at a loss for words. \"Um, uh... thanks.\" He felt himself blush and quickly turned away as Irina went back to her lifting. However, he immediately ran into some giant coyote pecs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked up at the face attached to the chest and saw Rodust scowling at him. It was hard to tell since everyone was so big, but Rodust seemed like the most muscular of all the team, especially now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodust leaned down and pressed his face against Jack's. \"Listen, fox. Irina is mine, is that clear? I don't want to see you talking to her again,\" Rodust said before stalking off to train again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was thanking his lucky stars that he hadn't been pulverized when Iaru walked up to him. \"Don't mind Rodust. He can get a bit unpleasant at times,\" Iaru said. Jack stared at Rodust angrily training, still shaking from fear. How well was he going to fit in here?</span></div></div>",

Jack does and is amazed with the layout of the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a corridor that led to a kitchen and dining hall and another towards a library. There was also a lounge in front of ongoing fireplace. On top, there was a second floor with 7 doors. Jack assumes that's where his and everyone else's bedrooms are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIaru walks upstairs to the bedrooms and Jack follows. As they make it to the top, the stop at a door 3 door to the right. \"This will be your bedroom.\" Said Iaru. He opens the door for Jack and Jack observes how simple and small it was. There was a bed, dresser, desk, and chair. That was all. Jack couldn't really complain about it because he was thankful to at least have a bedroom. Jack notices something on his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack moves towards the bed to see clothes layed out ready to wear but they looked to big for him even with his muscles. \"We thought we find you bigger.\" Iaru confessed. \"No problem,\" Said Jack, \"Do you by any chance have clothes smaller?\" Iaru then smiled and chuckled. \"Why get smaller clothes when you can grow into them?\" He asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Said Jack. \"You still have your rock right?\" Asked Iaru. Jack looked into his pants pocket and got the rock out. Iaru then explained. \"Just use that to grow.

As you look at the rock, Iaru closes the squeaky door. \"I'll go ahead and wait outside your door.\" He said. \"Growth can be a private process if you know what I mean.\" Iaru left Jack alone with a magical rock and huge clothes in his new room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack places the rock on his desk. He then takes off his clothes leaving his boxers because he didn't want his clothes to rip during the growth. Jack then advances towards the rock and holds it in his hand. Jack thought how big the others were. He then thought on how big Rodust was. He thinks about being as big as he was in case he gives him more trouble. Jack decides to grow to his standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack holds the rock tightly and feels the familar warmth in his hands then to his muscles. Jack simply stares with his jaw open as he watches his biceps triple in size and his height increased as well. His chest expands from a 6 to an 8 pack and his calves grow as thick as tree truncks. While the growth occured his boxers still remained intact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth was complete and Jack was thrilled with the results. He flexes a bicep and was amazed how it swelled up with power to the size of basketball. Jack is happy in his new body. He changes into the clothes on the bed. The clothes felt tight against his skin but Jack didn't mind. With new confidence, Jack stepped out of the room to meet Iaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIaru smiles as he sees Jack with bigger muscles and with the height of 9 foot 4. \"You look awesome!\" Said Iaru, \"And those clothes fit you perfectly or should I say barely.\" Jack smiles shyly and says \"Don't worry, I'm fine. So what now?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"How about we go see how the others are doing?\" Iaru asked. Jack nodded, eager to see how strong he was now. Not knowing the way back, Jack followed Iaru back to the training area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two hulks got there, the other five stopped what they were doing and stared. Now that Jack had grown more, he was taller and bigger than all of them. He only hoped that they wouldn't be jealous or hate him for growing bigger than them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, that didn't seem to be the case, as everyone gathered around Jack to talk with him (all except Rodust, who was looking angrily at Jack from a distance). They all wanted to talk with him about his new muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you certainly got bigger,\" Etzos remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack shrugged. \"Well, the clothes were too big for me, so I had to grow to fit into them.\" Jack noted how different he looked in his medieval clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that doesn't necessarily mean that you're the strongest,\" Bygus said. Jack raised an eyebrow. \"What do you mean?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Ryoto told us that the rock bonds with your heart and grows accordingly,\" said Bygus. \"Your strength depends on how pure of a heart you have. If a mean-spirited person grew 20 feet tall, we'd still be stronger than him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack thought that was interesting. He wondered how strong he really was now. Did he really have that pure of a heart?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why don't you try some lifting?\" Risis asked, pointing over to the crude dumbbells Jack had seen Irina using before. He nodded and walked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack knew he could lift more than 150 lbs. before, so he figured he would be able to lift it. He grasped the rusty metal and started lifting. The dumbbells were weightless to him. He continued pumping while the others looked on slightly impressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack set the dumbbells down. \"Why don't I try something harder?\" he asked. Bygus nodded and pointed over at some larger dumbbells. Jack saw that they were each 1000 lbs.! Jack was nervous, but he didn't want to appear so in front of the others. He walked over and carefully picked them up, pulling with all his strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was shocked as the weights were surprisingly light. He pumped them up and down, his biceps pulsing with each rep. Jack grinned. He was lifting one ton total and he was barely trying! Just how strong was he?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack put the weights down, Irina ran over to him. \"Oh Jack, that was wonderful! We're glad to have you on the team,\" Irina said. She hugged you, her large body pushing up against Jack's. He returned the hug, happy to finally feel truly accepted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe happiness of the moment was broken as Rodust ran over, shoving everyone else out of the way. He looked extremely angry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!\" Rodust yelled. \"This newcomer just walks in and we're supposed to just bow down to him? No way! I bet he wouldn't even be able to beat me in anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stepped up to Rodust, confident after his last heavy lift. \"And how would you like to prove that?\" Jack asked, having to look down at Rodust now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I challenge you to a wrestling match,\" Rodust said. The other five stepped back, forming a ring for Jack and Rodust to use. Jack crouched and prepared for the match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodust made the first move, running up and trying to lunge at Jack. Luckily, Jack retained the agility he had before he got the rock. He quickly sidestepped Rodust, causing Rodust to fly past him and land on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngrier than ever, Rodust got up and turned to Jack. Jack noticed he was a little dazed and distracted, so he decided to use this as an opportunity. Before Rodust could react, he ran up at lightning speeds, grabbing Rodust by the shirt and lifting him up in the air effortlessly. Then, in one swift movement, Jack plunged him into the ground, creating cracks in the brick courtyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack held Rodust down with one hand for three seconds, making him the winner. Everyone cheered and crowded around Jack, congratulating him on his victory. Rodust just laid on the groound, tired and beaten. Jack was finally fully accepted, and he was looking forward to his life saving this world.</span></div></div>",

He believes he can work with these people to save this mysterious world. He was also happy with his new body. Jack feels great on how everything is starting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jack could start anything else, he noticed his teammates getting in line again. He remembers seeing this before when he came with Ryoto. This must've meant Ryoto returned. Jack ran in the line between Risis and Etzos. The gates of the castles quickly opened to the familar cloaked figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello again, everyone.\" Said Ryoto. \"Hello, master.\" The team replied. Ryoto turned his face to Jack. \"Jack,\" he began, \"I informed the other wizards of your arrival and they would like to meet with you to see who you truly are.\" Jack felt a little scared about this news. He didn't feel comfortable about strangers quickly jumping into judgemental conclusions. With nothing else to say, Jack says, \"OK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The wizards would like to see you immediately,\" Said Ryoto, \"Come with me.\" Ryoto started walking towards the gate assuming Jack was following. Jack left his spot in the line and ran to be alongside with Ryoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and Ryoto were walking through a dirt road in the middle of a forest until they started talking. \"So,\" began Ryoto, \"What do you think of your teammates?\" \"I like them okay,\" Said Jack, \"But I think I got on the wrong foot with the big coyote guy.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, you mean Rodust. Yes, he can be difficult but I can assure you that you will need him in upcoming battles. Who knows? Maybe you two will learn to get along.\"<br>\r\nAfter his match with him, Jack didn't think so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack then asks Ryoto a question. \"Iaru told me we can use these rocks to help us grow stronger right?\" \"He speaks the truth.\" Said Ryoto. \"Well then, why do they all train if it's not necessary?\"<br>\r\n\"Because it is necessary. Training is to teach them not to be dependant towards the rocks. What if something were to happen to them and they could only stay strong at a particular level?\" This made sense to Jack but before he could ask Ryoto another question, Ryoto points to the wizards' castle in the horizon.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Jack and Ryoto walked up to the castle, Jack gasped at how huge it was. He had thought that the team's fortress was big, but this place was HUMONGOUS. It was probably bigger than ten mansions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and Ryoto walked up to a gate where two guards in full body armor stood. When the guards saw Ryoto, they nodded at each other and opened the gate, allowing Jack and Ryoto to enter through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and Ryoto walked through the empty halls of the castle, their footsteps echoing throughout the huge chambers. Jack couldn't help but be amazed at the size and grandness of everything. It by far outclassed any movie he had seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyoto pushed open two large wooden doors and led Jack into a room. The room was a large hall with a table in an arch shape going around it. At the table sat about 20 people wearing the same robes as Ryoto. Jack guessed that this was the society of wizards Ryoto was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard at the head of the table stood up. He sat in the largest chair and wore the most impressive robes, so Jack figured he was the leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you've brought us your latest warrior Ryoto?\" the head wizard, a thin fox with glaring eyes, asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I have,\" Ryoto said. \"Master, this is Jack.\" Ryoto turned to Jack. \"Jack, this is the head of the wizard society, Master Corenith.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack bowed respectctfully. \"It is an honor to meet you,\" he said, trying to hide his nervousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorenith's expression didn't change. \"You told us you brought him from another world?\" Corenith asked Ryoto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Master. I could not find a suitable candidate from our realm, so I looked into his,\" Ryoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorenith scratched his chin thoughtfully, then turned his head to Jack. \"So, boy, what makes you think you have a pure heart?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack froze up and looked around. What was he going to say? He didn't want to make a fool of himself in front of everyone. He turned to Ryoto, looking at him with pleading eyes. Ryoto simply nodded at him and turned back to face Corenith. Somehow, this made Jack feel that he could do it, so he too turned to face the society's leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack cleared his throat. \"H-honestly, I'm not completely sure why I was chosen. I don't really feel like I'm the purest of heart. But now I'm here and I see that you people need my help. I swear to protect this world the best I can, with or without the rock, even though I do not think I am the best choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack finished and stepped back next to Ryoto, who was smiling ever so slightly. The room was completely silent, making Jack very unsure about whether his speech had compelled them or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Corenith stood up from his large chair. \"Ryoto... I believe you have chosen a good warrior, just like the person in the prophecy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other wizards also stood up and began clapping. Jack beamed with pride. He couldn't believe that had worked! But then he thought about what Corenith had said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute... what was that prophecy you mentioned?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster Corenith raised his hand and the entire society immediately went silent. \"Well, instead of telling you about it, why don't I just show you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorenith stepped aside and thrust his hand to show Jack what was behind him. It was a large stone tablet, with words carved into it so large that Jack could read them from where he was standing. It read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hero shall rise above all<br>\r\nto rid evils small and tall<br>\r\nThe shards are wise and true<br>\r\nto choose one worthy to pursue<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't make much sense to Jack, but then again, prophecies never really made that much sense. \"So, who is the hero described in the prophecy?\" Jack asked Corenith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not entirely sure, but we believe it to be... Rodust,\" Corenith said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodust?! Jack was amazed. How could a jerk like that be a hero? He was about to speak up about it when he realized it would probably be better to keep his mouth shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for bringing him to us,\" Corenith told Ryoto. \"Now he can continue his training.\" Jack sighed with the relief of not having to speak in front of a crowd anymore as he and Ryoto left the castle.</span></div></div>",

For someone who needed to be pure of heart, Rodust didn't seem that kind of character to Jack. \"Maybe there's more to him than meets the eye.\" Jack thought to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack jumped when the doors behind him swung open. Bygus appeared between to open doors and seemed distressed about something. \"Master Ryoto!\" He yelled, \"We're under attack! Golems threaten our fortress!\" Ryoto also became distressed after hearing the news. Golems were known to be destructive, powerful, and invulnerable. Before he could say anything, Corenith spoke over the murmur of the of other wizards. \"So,\" He said, \"Drache seeks war.\" Corenith turned to Jack. \"Jack, prove yourself by putting your words into actions. Go!\" Immidiately, Jack ran with Bygus and Ryoto out of the castle to get to the warriors' fortress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at the fortress, the other warriors were using their incredible strength to defend their home from colossal clay beings. Golems were commonly 20 feet tall with gray skin and black eyes. They had no will or soul within them. They were merely moving clay figures. If they have no soul, someone must be leading them with his own soul.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEtzos tried tripping one of the golems by swinging his axe against its legs to no avail. Irina shot an arrow at another hoping to blind it. That too had no effect. Risis flew over the golems' heads to strike his mace at them; he was swatted down like a gnat in the face. Iaru jumped onto a golems shoulder and sliced its arm of with his spear. He saw the severed arm dry and crumble. However, his victory was short when he was grabbed and thrown to the ground. To make matters worse, the golem regenerated his lost arm. Victory was out of their reach and Jack, Bygus, Ryoto, and Rodust were no where to be found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed to be forever, Jack, Bygus, and Ryoto saw the castle slowly crumbling to the ground by clay toys. \"What are those things?\" Jack asked. \"Golems.\" Said Ryoto, \"Beings that exist with no sole purpose but the ones they were given. Quickly, we must join the others!\" The three of them continued their hasty quest to the castle and made it within the hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they arrived, the damage was worse than the ones they saw from afar. They ran through the gate to find the warriors lying in pain. Ryoto came to Irina's aid. \"Master Ryoto,\" she said softly. \"Careful,\" Ryoto pleaded, \"Don't strain yourself. Where are the others?\" <br>\r\n\"I don't know. They're probably in the same situation as I am; but I haven't seen Rodust since the golems arrived.\" <br>\r\n\"Relax, Child. I'm here.\" Ryoto stood to face Bygus and Jack.<br>\r\n\"Bygus, take Jack to the armory and prepare yourselves for battle!\" He commanded, \"I'll stall these piles of dirt as long as I can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBygus did exactly what he was told by grabbing Jack by the arm and pulling him into the collapsing building itself. \"Is Ryoto going to be alright against those things?\" Jack asked. \"Don't worry,\" assured Bygus, \"He can take care of himself. Let's go!\"</span></div></div>",

Jack was stunned at the size of it and the amount of weapons, but he didn't have time for sightseeing. He could still hear the battle raging outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you haven't had any training, but this is a crisis situation. Grab a weapon quickly!\" Bygus yelled quickly, pulling a war hammer off of a nearby shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack quickly looked around, trying to find a weapon that caught his eye. Finally, he saw it. It was a broadsword, its helm gleaming with gold symbols. Jack grabbed it and ran out of the room with Bygus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack and Bygus returned to the fight, they saw Ryoto fending off the three golems with magical blasts. They looked extremely powerful, but it was clear that Ryoto would soon be overwhelmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBygus turned to Jack. \"You take the one on the right, I'll take the one on the left,\" he said before charging up to attack with his hammer. Jack followed suit, rushing up to his assigned golem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey stone face!\" Jack cried out. It wasn't the best insult, but the beast did turn around, so the quip managed to get his attention. Jack could now really see how big the golems were. Next to them, he looked like a midget!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack struck the golem's leg with his sword, hoping to make him lose his balance. The blade cut in, but only slightly. It would take many more hits to cut off the limb. Where was Rodust when Jack needed him?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe golem, looking more annoyed than injured, reached down and used a powerful fist to strike Jack full force. The next thing Jack knew, he had slammed against a brick wall, pain coursing through his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a daze, Jack managed to catch sight of the rock strung around his neck. He didn't want to overuse it, but this was an emergency. He really needed a strength boost if he was going to make it through this (or even walk).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack really hoped his pure heart would help his strength as he focused on how big he would get...</span></div></div>",

He then saw a blue light seeping through the fingers around the rock and an enormous surge of power surged through him once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue light grew brighter and consumed Jack. Not only were his muscles growing; other parts of his body were as well! He felt all of his bones stretching and thickening. He also felt a strange sensation as if he was being pulled up from the ground. Jack wasn't sure what was happening to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the light diminished, everyone including Jack was amazed of what it revealed. Jack stood at 20 feet with muscle the size of rolling hills! He also noticed that his sword grew along with him in his hand. Before he could understand what happened to him, Jack was interrupted by a charging golem. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe golem rose its hand to strike but to no avail. Jack parried it with his sword and plunged it into its chest before it could attack again. The golem's muddy skin dried up and it crumbled into dust. Jack was very proud of himself after realzing what he did. He then ran to the other golems and sliced them into perfect vertical halves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the castle was practically in ruins, it didn't matter to Jack's comrades.

He was proud be the savior instead of the person being saved. As he was looking down, Jack looked at the rock again. It was still around his neck. He gripped it tightly thinking what to do now. He thought it was safe to shrink to his normal size but he really like being this big. Jack gripped the rock tightly as he pondered.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

While he was busy putting the right books into his backpack, he heard several students getting into a big discussing behind his back, just a few feet away from where he was standing. Once he was done sorting out his books in his locker, he closed the door, set the combination lock so that his locker was all locked up, and turned around so he could see what the commotion was about. Before him, he saw that Gus, one of the bigger boys in his class, was having an argument with Christina, one of the other anthro fox girls in his history class and chemistry classes. The discussion didn't exactly sound like it was going all too well for Christina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, Christina!\" Gus growled at her. \"I don't want to see you going out with Dave, with Mike, with Jake, or with Steven anymore!

You're.... hurting... me...\" the poor girl could barely get out from her mouth as she was about to scream in pain as Gus was squeezing her arm extremely hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack saw that Gus was hurting her and he decided that he had seen enough. It was time for him to intervene. He couldn't accept that the big bully was treating the poor girl like this. Normally, Jack would have stayed out of things like this, but now that he had gained over a hundred pounds of muscle himself, he didn't fear bullies like Gus anymore and he realized that he was strong enough to take on guys like him, in case he needed to use his strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" Jack shouted, as he walked up to Gus and Christina. \"Let her go! That's no way to treat a girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind your own business, Jack!\" Gus grumbled back, before he turned to face Christina. \"Now, where were we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go! Let me gooooo!!!\" Christina cried even louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you hear her?\" Jack shouted angrily. \"LET HER GO! NOW!\" he said, as he grabbed hold of Gus' arm and pulled it off of Christina's arm. Christina broke free and she then ran over to where the lockers were, as far away from Gus as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't I tell you to mind your own business, you little PUNK?\" Gus shouted angrily at Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A girl who cries for help IS my business!\" Jack replied, as he folded his arms before his muscular chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you interfered in MY business and you're gonna PAY for that, you little twerp!\" Gus roared, as he ran towards Jack with his fists clenched as he pulled his right first back, ready to punch Jack in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack then raised up his right leg and spun around at lightning speed, delivering a mighty kick to Gus' stomach, moments before Gus was able to come close enough to punch him in the face!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBLAMMM!!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aauuuooowwwauuuwwww.....\" Gus groaned, as he cringed for a moment, bending forward and almost falling to the ground in excruciating pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is for being such a JERK to a cute girl like Christina!\" Jack said angrily, as he made two fists.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPOWW!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth fists struck Gus in the face, knocking him out cold and sending him straight to the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the students, who witnessed the exchange, began to applaud as the big bully was down on the floor, completely unconscious, while Jack slowly walked back to the row of lockers where Christina stood, trembling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please stop fighting... Please... Please stop...\" she said with a trembling voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you alright?\" Jack said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-y-yes... Ohh... Thank... thank you.... He was soooo mean to me! I... He was such...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay... He won't hurt you anymore...\" Jack said as he gave the poor girl a gentle hug. \"Come, let's go to class...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and Christina held hands as they walked to class together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGus finally got up and went to the nurse's station, where he had to get his black eye checked...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jack didn't notice the others, as he was too busy thinking about Christina. She was downright gorgeous, and extremely nice and caring from what Jack had seen and heard. Jack simply felt good being around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and Christina sat next to each other during Chemistry, their first period class. \"You're so big and hot, how come I haven't noticed you before?\" Christina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was flustered by Christina's compliments. \"Uhhh... I'm not sure,\" he said, trying not to reveal his secret. He couldn't help thinking about Christina calling him hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout Chemistry, Jack noticed that Christina kept looking at him flirtasiously. It made him blush, but he smiled back and tried to look flirtatious back. Christina giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when the two didn't have classes together, Jack couldn't stop thinking about her. He had never felt before how he did with Christina. He had a hard time concentrating on his work, but he didn't mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the end of the day rolled around, and Jack looked for Christina among the various students talking about what they were doing after school. He finally spotted her chatting with a group of her friends. Christina noticed him, and Jack waved at her. She blushed, quickly said good-bye to her friends, and rushed over to meet Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jack... I've been meaning to ask you something...\" Christina said shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's this big party as Jessica's mansion tonight, and now that Gus and I broke up, I don't have anyone to go with so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack raised up a large paw. \"Say no more,\" he replied, \"I'd love to go to the party with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina blushed. \"Thanks Jack. Can you pick me up 7?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure,\" Jack replied. He still couldn't believe his luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpontaneously, Christina lurched forward and wrapped her arms around Jack in a loving embrace. Jack was surprised at first, but he wrapped his muscular arms around Christina, pushing her slightly against his large abdomen. It felt really good and warm for Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina finally let go and waved good-bye to Jack before running back to her friends, who were undoubtebly chatting about Jack's large muscles. Jack smiled before sprinting back home (which didn't take long, due to Jack's super-powerful legs).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt 7 o'clock sharp, Jack walked up to Christina's house in a large black t-shirt and tight fitting jeans. Right on time, Christina walked out of the house to join him. Jack's jaw nearly hit the ground. Christina was wearing a stunningly beautiful dress, giving her the look of a model or movie star. Jack felt embarrased at being underdressed compared to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristina clamped her arm around Jack's left bicep. \"Looking good, handsome,\" she remarked seductively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack felt his heart beat get faster. \"Thanks. You look amazing in that dress,\" he replied. Christina blushed and they headed down the street to the party.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There was a large BBQ grill, there was also a pool, and there were plenty of dishes laid out on this huge table, surrounded by dozens of bottles of soda, water and juice. They were serving chicken, steak and fish, along with veggies and fries for all the guests, and everybody was getting in line and scooping up food from the big dining table. As more couples were pouring in, people were gathering around the large table and enjoying the food which was provided, thanks to the large potluck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Christina and Jack had gotten plates and scooped up some delicious food, they sat down at one of the large wooden picnic tables in the corner, when Christina suddenly gasped at the sight of an unwelcomed guest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh NO! Jack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What's wrong?\" Jack said to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look! Over there, in the corner. It's HIM!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Where? Who?\" Jack wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohmygosh! It's GUS!\" she cried. \"What's HE doing here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stared at the big, ugly jock with an angry expression on his face. Then, he turned to face his date and wrapped his muscular arms around her. \"You're MY date and there is NOTHING he will be able to do to ruin this evening for us! I will gaurantee it! And if he does, then I will kick him out of here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, Jack... You... You're so sweet...\" Christina sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, Christina... He won't touch you... I'll protect you!\" Jack assured her, as he looked over and watched Gus like a hawk...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGus walked over to the food table and grabbed a plate. He filled it with food and sat down at a table in the far corner. While he was eating his drumstick, the table where Jack was sitting had caught his eye. He returned an evil grin on his face as he chewed away at his chicken, making Jack feel a bit uncomfortable...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Gus finished off his drumstick, dropping the bone down onto his plate and stood up. He marched towards Jack and Christina's table, causing Jack to stand up and meet him. Christina noticed too, so she stopped talking and gripped Jack's muscular arm nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGus got right up in Jack's face, giving Jack a full view of the black eye from their early encounter. Jack tensed up, not knowing what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think you can steal my girl and get away with it, punk?!\" Gus yelled, causing Christina to become more nervous and hold Jack closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't just treat girls like that, and I wasn't going to just sit there and watch! I'm here to protect Christina, so get out of here!\" Jack yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGus became furious at being told off, and he gave Jack a hard shove in the chest. It caught Jack off guard, and he stumble backwards a bit, causing Christina to let go of him. By this point, the commotion had attracted a lot of people's attention, and most of the party-goers were sitting there silent to watch the ensuing fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack barely had time to react before Gus ran up to him and threw his fist forwards. Jack dodged the blow, having increased agility, and delivered a solid fist into Gus' gut. Gus stumble backwards and fell, only getting up after he had regained his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't just push me around like that! YOU'RE DEAD, PUNK!\" Gus yelled, charging forward for one last attack. Jack drew his arm back and put all his force into it, delivering one last mighty blow to Gus' jaw. Jack was sure he heard bones cracking as Gus flew backwards, seriously injured. As Gus lay on the ground and the others looked on with astonishment, Christina ran up and hugged Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jack! Thank you for protecting me again!\" Christina said, her muzzle buried happily in Jack's warm fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack blushed. \"It's nothing. Like I said, nothing can ruin our night together,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Jack and Christina sat back down at the table.

Jack knew that all kinds of random thoughts about him was going through his friend's mind right now. \"Heheh, wanna find out what happened?\" Mike just nodded and followed Jack back to the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack showed him the small rock and the note next to it. \"So, you're telling me that this little thing just turned you into...That!?\" Mike gestured his entire body. \"Yup! Pretty impressive, right?\" Jack flexed a bicep and saw how his friend was completely lost for words. \"Uh...Who sent it to you?\" \"Does it really matter right now?\" Jack was flexing some more of his muscles. Mike, however, looked at the note again. 'Your destiny.' it read. \"Jack?\" \"Hmm?\" Jack stopped flexing his muscles and looked at his friend. \"Do you think that this could be some kind of asteroid shard, or maybe even a lab experiment gone missing or something?\" \"I don't think so. I was holding it in my hand, then it started glowing. After that, I grew to this size!\" \"Then what do you think this could be?\" Both Jack and Mike started thinking for a little bit. After a while, Jack noticed something weird. \"Hey Mike, you've been holding on to that rock and you're still the same!\" \"What?\" Mike looked at the rock in his paw and saw that he was still as skinny as ever. \"Hey, you're right!\" \"Let me see that thing.\" Mike gave the rock to Jack, which started glowing slight when it reached his paw. \"Hey look, it's glowing!\" \"Yeah...\" Jack could suddenly feel the very same sensation he first felt before. His muscles were growing! Slowly, his muscles were increasing in size, and Mike took a step back in awe. \"Whoa...\" \"Oh cool! I'm getting bigger!\" His already over sized biceps were growing to the great sizes. His pecs were pushing out even more, and his leg muscles were pumping up too! He was growing taller as well. \"Heheh, so cool...\" Jack was feeling the power flowing inside him. He set the rock down on a table, and examined his still growing body...Which comes to an abrupt halt! As quickly as it came, the growth stopped and left Jack in nothing more than his underwear. \"Huh. I guess it only works for you...\" Mark said, feeling a bit disappointed. \"Don't worry Mike, I'm sure that it'll work for you somehow.\" Jack flexed his arms, which bulged out bigger than it did before! \"You might wanna get something to wear first.\" Mike said, turning his back on his friend. Jack looked down and saw that the only piece of clothing left on him was starting to strain...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with the stretchiest sweater and jogging pants he could find (and still stretching the fabric to the limit a bit), He returns with Mike who was holding the stone and examining the note again. \"Hey Mike, what are you doing?\" \"I'm trying to see if there's some kind of hidden message here. Magical muscle growing rocks in presents don't just appear in anyone's doorstep.\" Jack could see the concentration on the cat's face. \"Tell me, did you see anyone deliver this to you when you got it?\" Mike asked, not even looking up at his friend. \"Nope. I just heard a knock on the door and there it was.\" Jack sat on the couch, which groaned to his new weight. \"Interesting...\" Mike was fumbling with the rock now. Jack was starting to wonder if Mike was getting jealous of him. The only reason they were friends is because they both get beat up by the school bullies everyday. Not as much as him, of course, but it was one way to start a friendship. \"You wanna get big as me, don't you?\" Jack said, deciding to tease him a little. Mike looked at his friend and sat down next to him. \"Well, maybe, but not until I'm going around on the street in my underwear, I'm sure.\" Mike gave his friend a sideways glance and a smile. \"Do you think this responds to touch? Or the wish to grow?\" \"I dunno. But I was sure that I wanted to get bigger when I was holding it.\" \"Wanna do an experiment?\" \"Like what?\" Mike gave him a smile and held out the rock. \"How about this. You touch the rock, but you have to say to yourself that you don't wanna grow bigger. This way, we'll find out if it only works when you touch it or when you want to grow.\" Jack gace it some thought. The clothes he's wearing can still handle a few more pounds of fox muscle. And, if it only works when he wants it to, then he can carry it around and use it only if he needs to! \"Alright then. Let's try it!\" Jack took the stone and held it in his paw.</span></div></div>",

For a minute, he just stared at the mirror, not really being able to comprehend what had just occurred. When his brain finally began to work again, he was able to marvel over just how big he was. His pecs jutted noticeably out of his chest, right above his hard six-pack. He rubbed his calves, feeling how hard and bulky they were. He noticed that his waist had shrunk down, giving him a v-taper to die for. Finally, he flexed his bicep, watching his new baseball sized peak rise up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack grinned. He figured the rock had caused it, but he wasn't complaining. He had the strength he had always wanted, in addition to a great new body. Plus, he felt even stronger than he looked! He thought about how the bullies at school would now be powerless against him. School... maybe that was where he should go first! Settling on this new idea, he slipped on some new clothes (his old ones were ripping under his new bulk) and headed towards the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking down the street towards the school, Jack had time to think. With his new muscles, there was a lot he could do, and he was having trouble deciding what he wanted to do most. Sports wouldn't be a problem, and there were a lot of occupations where his strength could come in handy. Jack focused on some certain ideas that he like, but couldn't really decide on the best ones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Jack saw the front gate of the school in sight, and he began to plan out the best way to show his new body. However, his thinking was interrupted by an odd sight. It seemed that the students that had stayed after school and some of the teachers were crowding around the main gate in a crowd of about 50, talking to one another. Jack walked briskly up to the other side of the gate, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what seems to be the problem?\" Jack asked, getting the students' attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other students saw him and began to talk more rapidly to one another about the muscular fox on the other side of the gate. Some thought they recognized him, some didn't, but none of them could figure out that it was really Jack, the school punching bag, standing right in front of them! Finally, a student near the front got up the courage to answer Jack's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The gate was jammed! We can't get out!\" The student cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack frowned, thinking hard. There had to be some way that he could free the students with his new muscles! He looked around and noticed the steel bars that lined the gate at even intervals, which really got the wheels in his brain churning. What if he could pull the bars apart to make a hole big enough so that the students could get out. Jack was unsure, as he wasn't completely sure of the limit of his strength, but he had to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack walked over to a section of the gate as the students looked on questioningly, whispering to one another to try and figure out what Jack was trying to do. Jack, trying not to pay attention to their stares, rubbed his hands together in preparation before grasping the metal bars. Using all of his strength, he pulled outwards, groaning under the pressure. It was hard work, but the bars quickly bent enough so that the hole was wide enough for the students and teachers to go free!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the students filed through the hole one by one, they thanked Jack for letting them out and saving them. Some girls wanted to feel his muscles, and he let them, feeling proud of himself. His day had certainly began to turn around.</span></div></div>",

Everybody had been talking around the schoolyard about the new addition to the weight room, which was about to be completed that week, and Jack was certainly one of the first boys who wanted to be in line to be using the new facility the minute it opened up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he arrived at school, he walked towards the weight room, where a large crowd had formed already. For the last three weeks, the electricians, plumbers and other carpenters had been working vigorously on getting the new facility ready for use by the students at the school. A large delivery truck had parked outside to deliver a container with all the latest exercise equipment, but everything was still packed up and wrapped in boxes and crates and pallets. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral coaches were standing by the entrance to the room, talking to the Principal, when Jack arrived at the scene. Jack soon figured out what the problem was this time around: the electrical work and all the plumbing work had been done in the new room. The new carpet had been installed and all the lights and electrical outlets had been wired and activated as well. However, the men weren't there to unpack, move, and install the new exercise equipment for the gym!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack quickly walked up to the Coach and decided to ask if he could help out, since he was most likely the strongest student at the whole school and the only one capable of unpacking, carrying, assembling, and installing all the machines in the shortest amount of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coach! Can I help out?\" he asked Coach Jones, the Football Coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you can handle it, Jack? A lot of heavy lifting is involved!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Sir! I can do it!\" Jack replied, as he flexed his fox-biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty, then! Have at it! Here is the dolly and here is another metal cart in case you may need it. Have at it!\" the Coach replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack immediately ran over to the large truck and opened the large, steel back door. Then, he raised up the back elevator from the back of the truck, and then he rolled the dolly on to the bed of the truck itself. He pulled the first two pallets on to the dolly and then rolled them down the elevator until he got to the ground. He then lifted them up with his bare hands and carried the pallets containing the heavy exercise equipment into the training room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack made several trips from the truck to the new weight room, hauling the huge crates, boxes, and pallets until the new weight room, until the truck was completely empty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Jack started opening and unpacking all the pallets, boxes and crates, until all the machines, weights, and parts were uncovered. Everything consisted of weights, parts, chains, machines, and padded parts fit so that people could sit or lay on or in the machines during their workouts. Jack grabbed a screwdriver and a wrench, and he ran down all the machines and assembled everything one-by-one!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, after everything was put together, he removed all the packaging, plastic, bubble-wrap, and scotch tape, and threw everything in the dumpster! The entire weight room was done! All the students were extremely excited and Jack was the hero of the day once again!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you guys can use the weight room... All thanks to Jack! I guess Jack should be the first to work out in here!\" the Coach said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack didn't mind that.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After most of the students had left, Jack decided to take a look around the school. Maybe he could show his muscles off to some more people or help someone. Jack walked through the schoolyard and into the school building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Jack began to look around, but he found that the school was pretty much deserted. There wasn't much going on in terms of extracurricular activities. Suddenly, Jack hear grunts, yells, and slams coming from somewhere else. Curious, Jack followed the noises until he found himself in front of the school gymnasium. There was a sign on the door that read \"Wrestling Tryouts Today!\". Interested, Jack pushed the door open and walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stench of manly sweat hit Jack's nose as he spotted the wrestling mat on the far side of the gym. Most of the biggest guys in school were crowded around the mat, waiting for their chance to show off their moves. Even though he had never wrestled before, Jack clearly outmatched the wrestlers in both muscle and height (the new muscle in his legs had brought his height up to an intimidating 6'). Thinking that wrestling might be something he would be good at, Jack headed towards the mat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the wrestlers ignored Jack, as they were too focused on the action in the center of the ring as a tiger and a lion were going at it, so Jack went to talk to Coach Jenkins, the wrestling coach. Coach Jenkins was a rather muscular boar who knew everything there was to know about wrestling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack walked up to Coach Jenkins and tapped him on the shoulder. Coach Jenkins turned around and saw Jack making his eyes nearly bug out of his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you certainly are big, kid!\" Coach Jenkins explained. Jack figured Coach Jenkins had never really seen him before, as he had never done anything wrestling related. \"Have you come to tryout?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Jack said nervously. He was beginning to have second thoughts about wrestling, now realizing that being big might not be the only thing necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, put this on, and be back out here in five minutes,\" Coach Jenkins said as he tossed a wrestling singlet at Jack. Jack caught it in midair and went into the boys locker room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, Jack walked back into the gymnasium wearing the wrestling singlet. It was a little uncomfortable, but he knew he looked good in it, as the elastic material clearly defined his huge muscles even when he was standing still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack walked back up to Coach Jenkins. \"I'm ready to wrestle,\" Jack said, having found a new spark of confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach smiled. \"Good. You'll be wrestling Will over there,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack walked onto the mat and faced his opponent. Will was an extremely muscular bull (probably the second-most muscular there, besides Jack) who was known for his short temper. He was the best wrestler on the team, having led their school to the state finals the previous year, and he bullied Jack on occasion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach Jenkins blew his whistle, signaling the match to begin. Will charged blindly at Jack, putting in as much power as possible. Jack, using his lightning fast reflexes, dodged the charge and caused Will to barrel past him. Coach and the other wrestlers were astonished that someone as big as Jack could move that gracefully!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack quickly turned around, and before Will could react, he jumped onto Will's back, sending the bull plowing to the ground with great force. Jack held Will to the ground with his mighty grip until Will tapped the ground. Coach blew his whistle again. \"Jack is the winner!\" he shouted. The other wrestlers all cheered wildly for Jack. He had taken down their best wrestler in one move! Jack blushed slightly, but felt proud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOthers wrestled for a bit until Coach Jenkins told them that the tryouts were over. He read over the list of names and, not surprisingly, Jack made the wrestling team. Coach told them all of the usual stuff like eating right before dismissing them all so they could go home. Jack felt good as the other praised his wrestling moves. He felt like he was finally being accepted.</span></div></div>",

There was a big message posted on colored paper, stating that Coach Torres was looking for one or two more boys who wanted to play on the Boys Under 14 years old soccer team. Not a lot of boys wanted to play soccer, since it wasn't as popular in school as football or baseball, but practice was only held once a week and the matches were only held on saturday mornings, so for Jack it was very easy to participate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack walked up to Coach Torres' office and asked him if he could play. The Coach told him that it was fine, and he handed the muscular student a sheet outlining the uniform colors and where he had to buy the shin guards and the cleats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack went home and told his mom that he joined the soccer team. He told her that he needed to go to the sports store to buy a uniform so he could play. His mom noticed that Jack looked a little more muscular than before, but Jack just replied that he had been working out lately. Jack went out with his mom that afternoon and picked up his jersey, his shorts, his cleats and socks. When he showed up for practice that day, he made sure he was ready to show his stuff!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight away, Jack showed superior footwork and ball control. When other players tried to take the ball away from him, Jack managed to kick the ball around them, and still maintain possession. He was also a dangerous attacker on the goal, for he knew how to charge the goal with great speed and how to attack with so much speed and at such an angle, that he could fool the goalie every time and kick the ball into the net with amazing accuracy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the game, Jack kicked three goals and he helped the team win their first victory! This made him an instant hero on the team, and Coach Torres was very happy that he accepted Jack on the team so easily! Jack had joined the team and he played for the team for the rest of the semester, and the kids quickly made him the best player in the group!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack's life was going great. Ever since he had gotten his new muscular body, his life had turned around. He was a great wrestler as well as a soccer player, in which he had easily won the team their first game. He was the undisputed most popular guy in school, as he hung out with all of the jocks and popular kids but was very nice to the other kids. He also retained his high grades from before the growth, scoring all A's on his report card. His parents, after getting over the initial shock of his new muscle, seemed to be nicer to him and paid more attention to him. His life was somewhat busy, what with wrestling, soccer, school, and homework, but he still managed to have a good amount of free time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was walking down the hallway and talking to some of his wrestling buddies when suddenly the bell rung, signaling the start of the next class. Jack's two friends left for their own classes, while Jack went in the opposite direction for his. He was walking down the hall when he noticed a flyer on the billboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt told about the tryouts for swim team that were going on that afternoon. Jack thought about swimming for a second. His new bulk hadn't seemed to slow him down yet (in fact, it almost definitely sped him up!), and he figured that it shouldn't be much different in the water. Plus, their school swim team hadn't won anything in over fifteen years, so he thought he might be able to help the program out. His mind set on swimming, Jack suddenly realized that he needed to be in class, so he turned and sprinted down the hallway, loose papers flying around from the wind created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat afternoon after school, many swimmers stood around the indoor pool, waiting for tryouts to begin. Suddenly, the doors flew open, and Jack stepped in. Many of the girls there giggled in excitement, as Jack was wearing only an XL blue Speedo, leaving his glorious muscles uncovered and his bulge clearly outlined. Jack noticed the stares and giggles, but he didn't care, as he figured he deserved a little vanity as long as he didn't get too arrogant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Coach Clayson, a dolphin, emerged from his office, and tryouts began. They started by taking a few warm-up laps, which gave Jack a chance to relax a little bit and stretch out his muscles. Finally, Coach called them in and said that they should line up in the lanes and do 25 yard freestyle races.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack lined up, being the third person in line, and watched as the first two groups went ahead of him. He focused his mind on swimming as hard as he could, and he was ready and focused as he stepped onto the block for his race. \"On your mark... get set...\" Jack crouched down into position, as did everyone else in the other lanes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTWEEEEET!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whistle blew, causing all eight swimmers to dive into the pool, including Jack, who's superior leg muscles, allowed him to get more distance than everyone else. Jack started moving furiously, trying his hardest to impress the coach. Jack quickly smacked his hand on the pool wall and jumped out, still full of energy. He turned back to the pool and saw that none of the other swimmers had even finished yet. He had beaten them by a quarter of the pool, and he wasn't even remotely tired yet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoach Clayson walked up to Jack and patted him on the back. \"If you keep swimming like that, you'll break state records!\" Coach exclaimed before turning back to watch the others swim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the practice went great, with Jack clearly outclassing everyone, no matter what the stroke or length of the race. Finally, tryouts ended, and Jack once again made the team. Jack slipped on some shorts and a tank top before stepping out of the school, being surrounded by awestruck swimmers and fangirls before they dispersed. Jack began his short walk towards home feeling like the world was him. If he kept this up, he couldn't even imagine what his life would be like!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack was walking back to his house, trying to figure out how he was going to juggle all three sports with his school work. After some thinking, he came to the conclusion that his brainpower would allow him to play all of his sports and still have free time left over. With that thought stored in his mind, Jack began to think about his upcoming wrestling match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jack began to feel a warm sensation spreading through his body. He stopped walking, confused as to what was going on. Little did he know, if Jack's muscles were used enough, the magic of the orb made them grow bigger to compensate for the exertion. Jack was having another growth spurt!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing what was going on, Jack quickly looked around, and seeing no one, he ducked into a nearby alleyway. He couldn't figure out what was going on, but he didn't mind it. Being stronger had gotten him everything he had ever wanted, so he figured more muscle could only help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe warm sensation finally became strong enough and Jack watched in excitement as his muscles began to grow again. His meaty pecs pushed out more against his shirt, ripping it in places. His abs hardened and separated, forming an eight-pack. Jack flexed his calves and watched as they inflated to soccer ball size. Jack's eyes moved up to his favorite muscles: the biceps. They inflated from their impressive baseball size to monstrous basketballs, causing his forearms to thicken and his arm to look like an orange pipe. Finally, Jack felt himself shoot upward to make room for his new muscle, stopping at a towering 6' 6\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stood and breathed heavily, the growth taking energy out of him. Once he had regained his composure, he was able to marvel at the sheer size of his muscles. Before, he could have matched up with any bodybuilder: now, he surely outclassed all of them. However, as he flexed his giant bicep, he realized that the growth had torn through even his XL clothes, leaving him without a shirt and with only the Speedo to cover his massive crotch. Blushing, Jack raced out of the alley, wondering how he was going to explain this to his mom.</span></div></div>",

Jack simply stated that he had been working out more lately, and that he was going shopping for new clothes. His parents accepted the explanation, not exactly being the brightest foxes out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack went to school the next day, wearing a super tight black t-shirt and shorts which were clenched tightly to his calves: it had taken him a while, but he had manage to find a store that sold XXXL clothes to fit his new physique. Jack noticed that he was REALLY turning heads now: many people were coming up to him to compliment his new muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like someone's been working out lately,\" Brett, one of Jack's wrestling buddies, said as Jack walked past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attention didn't stop throughou the day, with even teachers stopping to compliment his muscles. Jack enjoyed the attention, and he realized that he was right when he had thought that his muscle would only benefit his life more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Jack reached the end of the school day, which meant soccer practice. Jack squeezed into his tight (but sexy looking) soccer uniform and ran out onto the field with the rest of the team. He felt somewhat out of place, dwarfing every player by at least a foot and outmuscling them by far. Coach Torres announced a scrimmage and Jack was in the game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack recieved a pass, he looked up and saw three defenders coming towards him, knowing about his incredible soccer ability. Jack began to doubt that the new muscle would help with soccer, but he had to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack dribbled towards the defenders and started doing fancy footwork to get around them. Surprisingly, he moved even quicker than he had before and he easily sidestepped the flabbergasted defenders. New confidence rising, Jack started sprinting towards the goal, noting that he even seemed a lot faster as he flew down the field. He got around a few more defenders until he had a clear shot at the goal. Pushing all of his power into his leg, he kicked the ball with great force as it sped towards the goal, the goalie diving to try to save it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGOAL!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and his teammates cheered as the ball easily sailed into the net. Jack didn't know how, but his muscles had actually sped him up and made him better at sports! He reminded himself to check out the orb, but he was also caught up in the celebration of his goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack went on to play an amazing game, scoring four more goals and shutting the other team out before practice ended. Coach Torres gathered everyone around, looking extremely excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With Jack on our team, we can't lose!\" he exclaimed. The rest of the team cheered in agreement, patting Jack on the back and congratulating him as they all left for home. Jack couldn't even think of how his life could be better.</span></div></div>",

He turned and smiled as he saw it was Tommy, another fox on the soccer team. Tommy was another fox anthro that Jack had become great friends with ever since he joined the team. Tommy wasn't as shrimpy as Jack was before his growth, but he still had little muscle on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jack, great game back there!!\" Tommy said excitedly. Jack blushed a little. \"Oh, it wasn't that great,\" he said shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me? You rocked out there!\" Tommy exclaimed. Jack smiled and continued the conversation as the two foxes walked down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the two were standing in front of Jack's house. Jack was about to say good-bye to Tommy when he noticed Tommy looked a bit nervous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jack, I've been meaning to ask you something...\" Tommy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Tommy?\" Jack asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... I've seen you around school before, and I don't even remember seeing you with any muscle at all! Then you show up like this and well... I'm just kind of confused,\" Tommy spurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack thought for a second and considered lying to Tommy. But he knew Tommy was a good friend, and it felt wrong lying to him. Jack decided to tell Tommy the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Tommy, can you keep a secret?\" Jack asked, lowering his voice. Tommy nodded, perplexed. \"Good, then follow me,\" Jack said, leading Tommy into his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, neither of Jack's parents were home yet, leaving Jack and Tommy with the house all to themselves. Jack motioned for Tommy to follow him upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce upstairs, the two friends stepped into Jack's room. Jack's room was pretty ordinary, except for the stuff he now had for his musculature. He had acquired a weight bench and some heavy dumbbells, along with posters hung on the walls showing top bodybuilders posing and flexing their muscles. Jack went over to his drawer and pulled out the rock, turning back to Tommy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy looked at Jack, confused. \"A rock? What does that have to do with anything?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this may seem hard to believe...\" Jack paused to consider things before continuing. \"... but this rock showed up at my doorstep, and it made me grow big! Then, yesterday, I had another growth spurt, and I ended up like this!\" Jack exclaimed flexing a bicep which strained against his super tight soccer uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy paused for a moment, not knowing how to respond. \"... I think I believe you,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was actually shocked at Tommy's answer. \"Really? You believe me?\" he asked in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy shrugged. \"Yeah. Well, it's not like there's any other explanation. Plus you're a really great friend and I trust you.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack smiled. \"Well, thanks Tommy.\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jack, could I possibly hold the rock?\" Tommy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack nodded and handed the rock to Tommy. Suddenly, a bright light came out of the rock and enveloped Tommy. Jack realized that the rock was going to make Tommy grow!</span></div></div>",

Those kids are going awfully fast, don't you think?\" Tommy remarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either they're in a big hurry, or...\" Jack pondered out loud. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or, what?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their brakes just went out! Quick! Run after that car!\" Jack shouted, as he began to run after the small red convertable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy quickly followed Jack and the two boys were quickly catching up to the runaway car. Jack realized that his hunch was correct as he seemed to be getting closer to the car: Both passengers, a boy and a girl anthro wolf, were both screaming at the top of their lungs since the brakes were no longer working!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make matters worse, the car was approaching a steep hairpin turn, which was taking them towards a bridge over a field. Since the boy had lost control over the vehicle, the car had smashed through the barrier and went airborne, flying through the air before it started to plunge towards the grassy field below, with both passengers screaming as the soaring car spun out of control!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tommy! RUN! We need to get to the field so we can catch that falling car!\" Jack shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha!\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the girl's seat belt broke loose during the spin, and the girl was hurled from the spinning car. Obviously, she was screaming from the top of her lungs as she was soaring to the ground, realizing she was moments away from smashing into the ground, what would be a certain death!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GET THE GIRL!\" Jack shouted at Tommy. \"I'll get the car!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack then ran towards the field and extended his muscular arms towards the sky, positioning himself right under the falling car by running at the same speed as the falling vehicle. As the car came down, he caught it with his arms like a football, holding a firm grip on the chassis of the car as he slowed down the speed until he was able to come to a standstill. He then set the car down and checked up on the teen, who was trembling with fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Tommy ran down the other end of the field and held out his arm, ready to catch the falling female anthro fox. She came soaring through the air, but he was fast enough to catch her in his muscular arms as well. As he held her in his arms, he quickly turned around and raced her back to the car, where Jack was already waiting for them to get back in one piece and... alive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and Tommy brought the boy and the girl together, after a very scary experience. The front fender of the car was damaged, but the couple was very happy to be alive and well, all thanks to the heroic efforts of Jack and Tommy!

He quickly hobbled over to them and tapped on their shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, you two! We're playing the Cavaliers in soccer tomorrow! Be ready! These guys are very fast!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries, Coach!\" Tommy replied. \"We'll be even faster!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack just grinned, as the coach walked off. He loved the fact that he now had a friend who was super strong, just like him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe following day, the boys gathered on the soccer field, and they were all ready to start the match. The Cavaliers seemed all bigger and taller than the Knights, but Jack and Tommy weren't scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can handle them... Don't worry!\" Jack said to Tommy. \"Just pass the ball over between us, and score when you can!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the referee blew the whistle, Jack immediately raced after the ball, and dribbled the ball towards the Cavaliers' goal using some clever footwork. Three defenders immediately tried to take the ball away from him, but Jack was able to keep possession of the ball. During the second wave of attack, he passed the ball to Tommy, he got even closer to the goal, before passing it back to Jack. They alternated passing the ball back and forth, before Tommy was close enough to score! he fired the ball straight into the goal, totally catching the goalie off-guard! GOALLLL!!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout ten minutes later, Jack and Tommy started a second wave of attacks, and they approached the Cavaliers' goal again. This time, Jack passed the ball to Tommy, who sent it back to Conner, who returned it to Parker, who launched it back to Jack. They kept the ball moving in a big circle until Jack had the right opportunity, and he scored another goal in the right corner of the net! GOALLLLL!!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the Knights beat them 4-0 when the match was over, and Tommy and Jack scored all four goals! They realized that when they worked together, they were truly unstoppable!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As soon as practice got started, the coach noticed that Tommy and Jack stood out as being faster and stronger than the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the first game, when Jack was at bat, he had struck his very first home run of the season on his first pitch! The crowd went wild and the other players were completely awestruck by this amazing feat! The crowd screamed as they saw the ball sail over the highest point of the wall, at the outfield, as the players from the opposing field could do nothing more but stand on the field, in total helplessness, and watch as the ball was smashed out of the ballpark as soon as it was pitched to Jack. Jack casually ran around the three bases before making it over home plate, much to the delight of his teammates!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy didn't want to be outdone by Jack, and he nearly repeated Jack's feat on the first pitch. However, he hit a double right off the bat and made it to second base, paving the way for the other players to assist in the victory. The third player at bat, Jason, scored a run to first base, allowing Tommy to run to third. Finally, Peter came up, and hit the ball to the outfield, which allowed for Tommy to run home!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, the Knights won the baseball game by a final score of 13-0. It was a blowout, all thanks to Jack and Tommy, but they also allowed for the other players to help out as well.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were great out there on the soccer field! You're really fast, you know that?\" Tommy said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, thanks dude!\" Jack grinned, as he took a sip from his water bottle. \"I appreciate that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, mate... I was wondering... Coach Jones had asked me to sign up for the track and field team as well, since he needed a few new guys to fill in some positions. Since you're pretty fast and quick, why don't you try out for that? I think you'd be pretty good!\" Tommy suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I can certainly run! I mean, if that is all I need to do...\" Jack shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely! You go to the track, you line up and you wait for the gun shot and then you run as fast as possible! You stay in your lane and you blast past all the other guys until you see the Finish line! You cross the line and you check your time! That's all there is to it!\" Tommy explained. \"Plus, I'll be running, too! We only got two guys on the team and we need a fox like you! Why don't you come to the try-outs, which are tomorrow afternoon at the track?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will!\" Jack decided. \"I'll be there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack left the soccer field and went home right away. he had some soup for dinner and then he did his homework before he went to bed. The next morning, he got up early and worked out using the snall weght bench in his basement before he showered and got dressed so he could catch the school bus to school. As soon as he arrived at school, he put his books in the locker and he went to class. After class was over, he went to the track, which was just outside the large football stadium. The large track actually circled around the large football field and ran just outside where all the bleachers were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTommy was there waiting for Jack, wearing just his shirt and shorts and his running shoes, and he introduced Jack to Coach Jones. Then, the coach took his whistle and told the five boys to get in the start blocks and to line up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blew the whistle and the boys were off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack ran as hard as he could, blasting out of the start block with a roar! He raced down the track in a burst of power, cruising down the tracks as the people in the bleachers were looking on. Jack was already passing the 100 meters... 200 meters... 300 meters... And the distance between him and Tommy, who was the next person behind him, was increasing even more, while the other three boys were much farther behind him. At 400 meters, Jack was almost 10 seconds ahead of Tommy and when he crossed the finish line, he was 16 seconds in the lead over Tommy and the other three boys!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very good, Jack!\" Coach Jones smiled, as Jack crossed the finish line. \"Your time is 36.71 seconds! Breautiful time! Tommy is second behind you! I'm proud of you guys!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and Tommy both smiled, knowing that they had both qualified for the top two positions on the track team for sure! He was glad that he made the team, with his friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and Tommy then went to the snack bar to get some cold water to drink, before they walked back to the locker room to change. Their first track meet with another school would be in one week!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Remember, we gotta get up at 5 tomorrow to meet at Wakulla Springs at 6 for the race in the woods! It's the 5K race against the boys from River View High School!\" Tommy said over the phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah! Well, I'll go to bed early so I'm well-rested for the 5K tomorrow!\" Jack said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack went to bed and set his alarm, which woke him up promptly at 5 so he jumped out of bed and slipped into his running shoes and jersey. he then got on his bike and biked over to the park, where he met Tommy. The boys lined up and the flag pole, along with fifty other kids from several other schools, all ready to run in the 5K run in the woods!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe referee shot a gun into the air, and they were off!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack and Tommy dashed ahead of the rest as they ran over rocks and into the woods, where they had to run over tree branches, wooden sticks, rough gravel, paved roads, grass, and dirt. They ran uphill and then on a steep downhill incline, going up a mountain and then by the edge of a lake. They ran into the woods and then through a small forrest, surrounded by tons of tall trees and bushes everywhere. They had to follow trees and marked signs, indicating which way to turn and where to go. The worst part was running uphill over a long stretch of rocks, since the road was slippery and didn't allow for anyone to run very fast at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks to their teamwork, their perseverence and discipline, Jack and Tommy worked together and remained ahead of the pack! They were numbers 1 and 2 the whole time, beating out runners from all the other schools!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about thirty minutes, Tommy and jack crossed the finish line! They won! They were greeted by the scorekeeper and the referee who awarded them a certificate and gave them something to drink. They also received a ranking for their efforts in the race!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude! We won!\" Tommy said to Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... we can now look forward to the next one!\" Jack smiled.

Baseball was always one of his favorite sports, but he never got the chance to play. But now he could be a great baseball player thanks to his muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter school, Jack walked onto the baseball field where all of the other players were. Most of them stared at him in astonishment, and they started to whisper to each other what they thought his chance was of making the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jack began to stretch, he heard a shrill whistle blow. Turning towards the sound, he saw that it was Coach O'Neil, the lion who was the varsity baseball coach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, we're going to start out with some conditioning, then we'll see how good you are at baseball, and I'll make my decisions. Everyone start running!\" barked Coach O'Neil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack soon found out that his sculpted legs gave him insane running speed, and he easily overtook everyone and was way ahead when the running was finished. Jack walked over to Coach O'Neil, who was in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright kid, let's see if you can bat,\" he said, regaining his composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack went up to the plate and tapped the ground with his aluminum bat. The pitcher was the starting varsity pitcher, but Jack wasn't afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pitcher wound up and threw the ball. It was a fastball, straight down the middle. Jack timed it perfectly and swung with all of his might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCRACK!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball flew at high speeds, going over the fence and way beyond. It was a home run! The other players cheered wildly as Jack blushed and stretched out his muscles a bit. Coach O'Neil told the pitcher to keep pitching to Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pitcher kept pitching and Jack kept hitting home runs. No matter what kind of ball it was, fastball, curve-ball, or change-up, Jack smacked it out of the park. He always connected with the ball and rarely didn't hit a home run, and those times it still went over to the outfield. After that, Jack also showed off his unreal skills in fielding and pitching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Coach O'Neil called them in and told them who had made the team, which, of course, included Jack. Jack received his jersey (which was XXL) and went home, thinking about how great it was going to be to play.</span></div></div>",

Jack was pitching, and no matter how hard he threw, the Titans always had fast enough reflexes to hit it. Jack's team saw that the Titans were living up to the hype.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as Jack came up to bat in the final inning, his team was only down 7-6 and there was a runner on first base. Jack had been up to bat three times before, hitting a solo home run, another home run to score two points, and a long triple that drove in two other players. Jack could see that the opposing pitcher was nervous, and that was exactly what he wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pitcher wound up and the first pitch was thrown. It looked like it was going in the strike zone, but just barely. Jack didn't want to swing at it, so he let it fly into the catcher's glove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strike one!\" the umpire called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe catcher threw the ball back to the pitcher as Jack prepared for the next swing, stretching out his glorious muscles (which caused some chatter by the female fans watching). However the next ball came in way too high, so Jack avoided hitting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ball one!\" the ump yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked at the pitcher, sure that he was going to throw a strike. Sure enough, the pitcher wound up and threw a fastball straight down the middle. Jack was in perfect position, so he swung the bat forward with all his might to meet the ball dead center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSMACK!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the bat hitting the ball echoed through the baseball diamond as the baseball soared incredibly fast outwards. It quickly passed the infield and went into the outfield, before sailing over the fence for an easy home run. Jack jogged around the bases as the fans cheered wildly. The rest of the team ran out and mobbed Jack at home plate. They had just beat one of the best teams in the country! With Jack, they were unstoppable!</span></div></div>",

There seemed to be more people here than a professional game. It was a little nerve racking for everyone, even Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe regular season ended with Jack's team going undefeated, putting them in the top seed for the state tournament. Through the team's hard work and Jack's leadership, they had won the state championship fairly easily. They moved onto the regional championships, which were a lot harder, but Jack's team still came out on top. Now they were in the national championship game against a top team from across the country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the team's victories were helped a lot by Jack. He almost always got a base hit, and he hit home runs half of the time or more. His speed was that of an Olympic track star and he could catch practically any ball. However, Jack was also known as a fantastic pitcher. Through long hours of practice, Jack had mastered his pitching, throwing heat that only the top teams in the country could hope to hit. He had also put on some more muscle (not by the rock, but by hard training in the gym) and was truly an intimidating beast. Despite only being in high school, sports reporters were already discussing his success as a major league player.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd roared wildly as the game started and the first batter came up. Jack noticed that he was fairly muscular, especially for a high school student. In fact, Jack looked over at their dugout and saw that all of their players seemed to be big. They weren't anywhere near Jack's level of muscularity, but they could still pose a threat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter throwing two strikes and two balls, Jack wound up for a fastball and fired. It seemed to go 100 MPH straight down the middle of the strike zone. The batter wound up and swung quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball rocketed over Jack's head and into the outfield as the player sprinted down the base path. The center fielder scooped up the ball and threw it back into the infield. He managed to stop the batter from going any further, but it was still a double. Jack caught the ball thrown to him and turned to face the next batter. He knew this was going to be a long game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Jack's team managed to get the three outs, but not without giving up two runs first. The team ran back into the dugout to prepare to bat. Jack was dripping with sweat from the humid night and hard exertion, so he gulped down what seemed like a gallon of water to cool himself off. He knew he had to go quickly because he was the fourth batter up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the team wasn't as good at pitching as they were batting, so two out of the three first batter managed to make it onto base. Jack stepped up to the base, tapped his bat on the ground, and looked at the pitcher. The pitcher seemed especially determined to get Jack out and prove that he was a good pitcher. Jack wasn't going to let that happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, the first pitch was exactly what Jack wanted. It was fairly slow and right down the middle. Jack tensed up in anticipation and let loose on the ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ball curved up and out in a high arc way over the players' heads. Jack jogged to first base, watching the ball closely. The outfielder ran back to try and catch it, but it was no use. The ball sailed far over the fence for a home run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered as Jack rounded the base and headed to home plate. He had put the team up 3-2. They could really win the championship game! Of course, it was still going to be a long game...</span></div></div>",

If his face hadn't stayed the same, he wouldn't be at all recognizable. At first, he considered calling a doctor.... but he decided against it. He realized that he didn't have to worry about being picked on anymore. He could take down those bullies with one paw behind his back. The thought made him smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack decided to head toward the school, as some of the bullies might be working out in the school gym. He walked out the door (nearly breaking the door off of its hinges) and headed toward the school. People look at him in shock. Jack was one of the largest anthros they had ever seen, and it was especially shocking because he was a fox, which are usually scrawny! Jack smirked, liking the new attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack finally arrived at the school and found his way to the school weight room. He noticed the biggest bully, a large and muscular (but nowhere near as big as Jack was now) bull, who was doing bench presses with his two cronies, who were twin muscular lions, stood by. The bull was doing a 100 lb. bench press, but he gave up after six reps. He held the bar up and dropped it onto the rack... but he didn't hear it hit the metal. Confused, he looked up and gasped as he saw a giant muscular fox holding it aloft with just one paw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who... who are you?\" the bull questioned, understandably terrified. Jack dropped the metal bar with a loud clang. \"Don't you remember? I'm Jack, the guy you beat up a few hours ago,\" he said, glaring at the bull menacingly. \"But... what about...\" the bull didn't even have to finish the question, as he noticed the two lions sprawled out on the floor, nearly unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bull looked scared to death now as Jack towered over him. Jack stuck a finger in the bull's muscled chest. \"Look,\" Jack threatened, \"I don't want you picking on anyone here anymore, got it?\" The bull slowly nodded. \"Now get out of here!\" Jack yelled. The bull leaped up and took off right out of the gym. Jack laughed and flexed a mighty bicep, extremely glad that he now had a lot of power.</span></div></div>",

He was the strongest anthro alive, and he was saving peoples' lives! He was practically a superhero!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Jack noticed something in the distance. It looked a thin trickle of smoke. Suddenly, the smoke grew larger and thicker, and Jack realized what was happening. A building was on fire!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActing quickly, Jack dashed towards the smoke, which was only a few blocks away. Upon reaching the scene, Jack gasped. The building was a large apartment complex, but it was completely engulfed in flames. Anthros were getting out of the building as fast as they could. The fire department had arrived, but the fire was putting up a good fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jack heard a sudden cry from the firefighters. \"Someone's still in there!\" the fireman shouted. The firefighters were trying to get in, but the flames were too strong for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack knew he had to help. He sprinted towards the entrance, sidestepping firefighters as he dashed through the door. Jack frantically looked around the level for the victim as the flames grew stronger. Suddenly, Jack heard a cry from the second floor. Intent on saving the person, he sprinted up the crumbling stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he went up, the flames grew stronger, but Jack knew he couldn't give up, and his muscles gave him better resistance to the fire. After a small time of searching, he heard the cry coming from a room down the hallway. Sprinting and jumping over fallen objects, Jack made it to the room. However, he was annoyed to find a pile of fallen wood blocking the entire doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCracking his knuckles, Jack pulled back and threw a punch that shattered the wood and sent it flying everywhere, opening a pathway. Jack made his way into the room and spotted the person crying for help. It was a young dog anthro, trapped under a large refrigerator. He was yelling loudly, but it was apparent he was about to go unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack squatted down and grasped the refrigerator, bending the metal in the process. With a grunt, he picked up the refrigerator and casually tossed it aside, then going to pick up the young dog, who had finally gone unconscious. Jack headed back towards the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Jack was disdained to find that the stairs had been blocked off by roaring flames that even Jack knew he couldn't get through, much less the dog in his muscular arms. Jack needed another way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Jack spotted the open window on the other end of the hall. He knew it was risky, as he was on the second floor, but it was his only option at that point. Taking a deep breath, he sprinted down the hall and jumped out the window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack tried to position himself so that he would land in a way that wouldn't injure him or the dog. As he landed on the ground, he felt a small shock, but he was surprised as he felt no pain. He laid the dog on the ground as the ambulance pulled up. The firefighters and others came around to congratulate and admire him. Jack was happy for all the attention, but he knew he should leave in case another emergency should pop up.</span></div></div>",

He was directly below a heavy weight on a weight bench. On the other side of the weight bench, two friends were chatting while one of them casually leaned on the bar. Jack saw the metal bar shifting slightly in the other direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the anthro leaning on the bar slipped, and the bar shot off of the other edge of the rack. The heavy weight was about to fall on the wolf! The wolf heard the noise and looked up just in time to see the weight..... stop in midair. Jack had quickly rushed over with superhuman speed and caught the falling weight, which felt like paper in his hands. The wolf was astonished as Jack set the weight down and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was finally ready to work out when he heard a voice behind him. \"Jack, is that you?\" the person asked.

Jack and Uncle Gary talked as if nothing was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack dropped off (literally) Uncle Gary's car at the repair shop and left. He figured it probably wasn't the best move to keep his identity as Muscle Man secret, but he felt he needed to help those who needed help, especially family members.

He decided that maybe if he focused like he did to take off the suit, then maybe that would cause another power to happen. Content with this decision, he closed his eyes and focused as hard as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jack felt a little odd. He opened his eyes and gasped as he saw himself changing. His fur started turning gray and lengthening. His snout also lengthened and his teeth got sharper. Jack realized what was happening. He was turning into a wolf!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 5 seconds, the transformation ended. Jack's muscles, voice, and suit had remained unchanged, but he was a full wolf. Jack realized that he could change his species at will. Wanting to test out other species, he thought of the first one that came to his mind. Sure enough, soon Jack's fur was changing into hard scales and turning red, he was growing horns on the top of his head, and large, powerful wings shot out of his back. Jack had turned into a muscle dragon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited about his new power, Jack started changing into every species he could think of. He discovered that he would gain some attributes from whatever species he turned into (for example, he was a little stronger as a gorilla and faster when he was a cheetah) and that some species looked kind of ridiculous (ever seen a muscular poodle before?). Finally, Jack couldn't think of anymore species to turn into, so he transformed back into his old fox self, which he felt most comfortable in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack thought that this power could come in handy, and it could be fun. There was just the question of what to do next.</span></div></div>",

He didn't even have to move before he could hear the sound of a car horn screeching on the next block, which was a hilly road. Using his superstrong legs, Jack quickly dashed to the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large delivery van was careening down the hill at a high rate of speed. It seemed the brakes had given out and the emergency brake wasn't working on the steep incline. The driver was desperately trying to steer the vehicle away from oncoming traffic, but if it went into an intersection there's no telling what accident might happen. Jack sees the truck screech past him, and he runs after it, catching up to it in moments. Trying to time himself right, he reaches his hands out to try and grab the bumper from the bottom up. If he could bust out a wall, maybe he could pick up the truck's tail end and stop it from moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick grunt, he reaches down, out and up, grasping the metal under the bumper in his hands. With a mighty heave, he hoists the truck's rear end upwards, lifting it as as high as his head. The metal creaks and bends a little in his grasp, as if it's made of wet clay. He steadily slows down from a sprint to a jog to a walk, finally pushing the vehicle onto the sidewalk. The driver, white with fear, stumbles out of the disabled truck and onto the concrete, thankful to be alive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack flashed the weary driver a toothy grin. \"No need to thank me,\" he says, with a powerful flex of his right bicep. Jack felt like he could bench press a battleship and cut gemstones on his impossibly-hard abs. This was great!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack strolled up the hilly road, passerby gawking at his massive frame. Deciding to test his legs a little more, he begins to sprint, covering five miles in five minutes. He finds himself in a rocky mountainous area outside of the city. The road has been closed off; it seems a cliff above the side of the road has given way, causing a landslide which blocked the road. A police car is stationed in front to warn drivers. The policeman, a middle-aged Alsatian, sees Jack walk up and nearly wets himself. He cautiously asks, \"Can I help you sir?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looks at the massive rock pile. \"Where are these rocks going?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nowhere at the moment. We need to get them off to the roadside so the road can reopen.\" Jack clasps his large, dexterous hands together. \"No problem.\" Walking up to a boulder the size of him, he sticks his hand underneath, pulverizing the rock's bottom, and tosses it in a graceful arc, where it lands off to the side several tens of feet away, a small earthquake resulting from its impact. \"Oops...I'll be a little less forceful.\" Using his mighty muscles, he punches the larger rocks, and they shatter into rubble. Then, he walks over to the side of the road, and rips a large tree out of the ground. Using the trunk as a bulldozer, he lays it on the ground and pushes it across the road, splintering the wood somewhat but managing to clear the road of several tons of rock before the trunk breaks down. The police officer is astounded. Jack smirks, says \"road's clear\", and heads on his way.</span></div></div>",

Helping people out had felt good, but Jack was really itching to use his strength more in private. He just needed to think of a place with some heavy objects. Suddenly, Jack had a lightbulb moment and began sprinting towards his destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter running for a bit, Jack finally reached the place he was thinking of. It was an area right in the middle of the forest, about an acre, and it was filled with rocks. The rocks varied in size, from being able to fit in your hand to the size of a minivan. Some probably weighed 20 tons, maybe even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Jack didn't start with the rocks. Deciding he needed a warmup, Jack walked over to the trees surrounding the rocks. He ripped two of them out of the ground and started using them for bicep curls. Jack enjoyed seeing his bicep contract, feeling the raw power flow through his veins. However, the weight of the large trees, which was astoundingly light to Jack, soon bored him, so he dropped them on the ground with a loud thud and moved on to the stones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack chose some rocks that looked to weigh about 5 tons and started some more bicep curls. That gave him a little more of a pump, but Jack's powerful body was going to need much more of a challenge then that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack found a rock that weighed about 12 or 13 tons by the look of it. He picked it up and lay down on the ground, his large, meaty hands making imprints in them even though he was barely applying any pressure. He started pumping the stone up and down, going as fast as his body could. However, even that couldn't satisfy Jack's needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that he wasn't getting much of a challenge, Jack decided he was going to go to the maximum. He found the largest rock in the entire area, a large 25 ton slab much bigger than Jack. Jack squatted down and rubbed his hand together in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack slipped his hands under the rock and began to heave. The rock slowly rose up off the ground, but it gained speed as it rose. Finally, Jack pushed up enough and the full 25 tons was held above Jack's head. Jack posed in triumph, barely feeling any fatigue at all, but adrenaline was pumping through him at a speed he never knew before. Just to show off, Jack took one hand out from under the rock, still not feeling much resistance, and used his free hand to flex his bicep, which seemed to have swelled from the lift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Jack put both hands under the rock and threw it as far as he could. It traveled surprisingly far, smashing into the ground and crumbling into bits. Jack stood there smiling and wiped the dust off of his hands, like his marvelous feat was nothing at all. While the workout did give Jack a good pump, he was going to need a LOT more weight to push Jack to his limit. He was practically superhuman now! Jack left the forest, heading in no particular direction looking for something else to do.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, the large dam was old and worn out, due to erosion, wear and tear, and due to the harsh weather of the wilderness over the many years. Cracks started to develop in the large, tall walls of the dam and water began to leak through some of the thick wooden boards which were pushing the water back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the river which led to the dam had reached a serious flooding stage due to three weeks of non-stop rain. The residents of the small village had mostly evacuated, except for the Mayor and his family. While Jack was walking through the quiet village, he met the Mayor and his family out on the street in front of City Hall, and they were all very concerned about the strength of the dam as the river continued to flood the area with water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good day, Mister Mayor! Is everything okay?\" Jack asked Mayor Thompson, who was also a fox athro.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, my young friend!

The whole place will be flooded and we will all loose our homes!\" the Mayor exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have no fear, Mayor! I will save your village!\" Jack said, as he raced back to the edge of the mountain and, using his awesome strength, he began hurling large boulders from the foot of the mountain range over the entire length of the village, so they landed right before the foot of the dam. Jack continued hurling the boulders so they stacked up neatly, forming a new layer of rock to protect the dam in case it would burst!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour, a wall of rock had piled up in front of the dam, just in time, for several leaks had sprung and the dam appeared to burst!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack then ran over to the dam and squeezed smaller rocks between the larger ones, filling in all the gaps very tight, so that no water could get through.

The wind felt great rushing through his bright orange fur, but he knew that he woould have to keep an eye out for any danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he ran, Jack saw a large ship sailing in the middle of the river. It wasn't too large, but it looked like it was hard to steer. Jack saw that there was a large rock right near the ship.

The boat was beginning to sink!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack, knowing he was needed, jumped into the water and began swimming towards the ship as fast as he could. Using his super-powered legs and arms, he reached the ship in no time. It was sinking fast, and Jack needed to think of an idea to get the ship to shore. He knew that the ship weighed too much for even him to pick it.

Jack also grabbed a few other branches, which he used to paddle his way down the river.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs jack made his way down the river, floating on a few large branches that were tied together with seaweed, he passed several beaches.

His flesh erupted from his sleeves. They slowly transformed into the size of small boulders. His chest then exploded revealing an 8-pack coexiting with giant pecs. Jack's legs rippled into tree trucks as they shredded the lower part of his pants. His bones were also stretching to a remarkable 6'7\" stature. At what seemed to be forever to Jack, the warmth vanished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack couldn't explain to himself what just happened to him. As he stood up, he felt the floor creaking under his new weight.

He then rushed to the bathroom to see his new form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack couldn't believe what he saw in the mirror. He saw a giant muscle fox reflecting himself! He flexed a massive bicep to see if what he was seeing was real and it grew to the size of a beachball! He placed a meaty hand on it to find out that it was hard as steel! He also loved the sensation of power that his chest gave to his fingers as he stroked them across it.Jack then made several bodybuilding poses. His smile growing bigger with his muscles as each pose was performed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa!\" Jack said to himself. \"This is unbelievable! I wonder how much I weigh now?\" Jack walks to the bathroom scale nearly crushing it. He gained about 400 lbs. of muscle. Jack dropped his jaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack went out of the bathroom still trying to digest his new transformation. As he made to the living room, Jack noticed the sofa in the corner. He had to see how strong he really was he thought. He went to its side and placed his hands underneath it. As he tried pushing upward, he found that it barely weighed a thing to him! Jack lifted it to his chest then over his head!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack carefully placed the sofa down as not to damage it and pondered what to do next. Now that he had just gained 400 lbs. of muscle, the world seemed to be opening up to him. He could always go to school and get revenge on the bullies for all their taunting, but people might raise questions on how he got big so fast, and it's a little hard to explain that a magic rock suddenly made you a bodybuilder. Plus, Jack felt like having some fun with his muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when it hit him like a ton of bricks: the beach. Hot girls, fun activities, and a seemingly endless blue ocean. Also, the lack of clothing needed gave Jack an opportunity to really show off his muscles in all their glory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stomped over to his closet where he dug through piles of clothes trying to find a swimsuit. However, he couldn't find any that fit him. None of the swimsuits could even get up past his calves due to his increased bulk. He was going to have to find something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a half-hour of searching, Jack finally managed to find a swimsuit that fit him. His dad had gone through what he called \"the fat days\" during college and still had a lot of oversized clothing to show for it. The swimsuit would have been comically large on anyone else, but it fit Jack like a glove, perfectly shwoing off his sculpted thighs and monster bulge. Muscles and sexiness showing, Jack left for the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother advantage Jack noticed was that although he now had bulky muscles, his speed seemed to have increased somehow. Even walking, Jack arrived at the beach in half the time he usually did. He stood in the parking lot, smelling the salty water and thinking about the good times he could have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stood there admiring the view, Jack noticed a dragon getting out of his car, also ready for a day in the sun. He was carrying a lot of loose change in his hand, presumably for snacks. However, he took one step and hit a bump with his foot, smacking into the ground and letting the loose change fly out of his hand and under the car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsually being one for good deeds, Jack walked up to the dragon, who was still scrambling to get back on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, need any help?\" Jack asked, noting his voice seemed slightly deeper than it was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon turned to look at the speaker and nearly fell on the ground again. He seemed amazed that someone could be that muscular, much less talking to him and offering help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-w-well, I-I guess, if-if you can,\" the dragon stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack put his hand on the dragon's shoulder, causing the dragon to flinch. \"It's OK, I'm not gonna hurt you,\" Jack said, preceding to walk to the back end of the car, closest to where the change was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack rubbed his hands together and placed his hands under the bumper of the car. He was going to try and lift the car up a little so the dragon could get his coins. Hey, if he could lift a sofa with ease, why should lifting a truck a few inches off the ground be that hard?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack began pulling upward and found that like the sofa, the truck was surprisingly easy to lift. He closed his eyes and concentrated really hard. After a few seconds of straining and lifting, Jack decided to open his eyes and see if the dragon could get his money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he opened his eyes, Jack's chin dropped onto his pecs in shock. The car was completely over his head! Without even trying, Jack had completed a strength feat the world's top bodybuilders would break bones attempting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack noticed that the dragon was standing there with a similar expression to his own, so Jack calmly took one hand off of the bumper, scooped up the change, and gave it to the dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now people had begun to notice the giant fox holding a car over his head and a small crowd formed. Jack put the car down and faced the people, wondering what they were thinking. Some people were whispering to one another, but most seemed amazed. Jack smiled. With his strength, anything seemed possible!</span></div></div>",

He didn't really feel like doing anything but walk around a bit to show off to others. It worked amazingly. Almost everyone turned their heads to see a massive fox walking around the beach and admiring his size. They could only imagine how strong he really was. After smiling and blushing from all the attention, Jack decided to stomp on home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack walked home with more stares towards him but he didn't mind. He finally reached home to find nobody home yet. Which is good for him. How in the world would be able to tell his parents about his new look? Jack decided to go to his room to lie down for a while. As he opened the door, he found a scruffy package similar to the one the rock was in. It must have been another gift from the mystrious benefactor!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, there was another note attached to it. Jack opened it and it read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack,<br>\r\nI'm glad that you've decided to use your gift to help people. I know that you have enjoyed it along the way. Please accept this second gift for it will be helpful into achieving your destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack unwraps the package to find a wooden box. It looked ordinary to him. No artworks or damage was on the box at all. It was completely plain. Jack assumes that the true gift was inside the box. He reached for the lid thinking on how this would assist him in helping others. He then thought back how he helped that dragon before. Jack really wanted to experience something like that again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he opened the box, a giant light erupted out of it like a volcano. Jack was scared and had no idea what was going on. The light was so bright he had to shield his eyes from it with his arm. After a few seconds, the light disappeared. Jack lowered his arm to see what happened. It seemed as if nothing out of the ordinary came out of the box. At first he thought the box was made to create a fancy light show but that thought changed when he saw his full bedroom mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was shocked to what he saw. He was a muscular orange dragon take Jack's place! He made movements in the mirror and the reflection was doing the same thing. The orange dragon was Jack! He felt his body and it was scaly but still incredibly strong. Jack made a few poses again and loved them more as a dragon than a fox. He couldn't explain but he loved how his veins pushed against his new scaly skin. After a few poses, he finally notices the gigantic wings behind him. He loved how they look with him and thought they were perfect for flying. Now Jack can be graceful and intimidating at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack roars in excitement. \"This is INCREDIBLE!\" He said. He felt like he could do ANYTHING now. Jack made one giant pose while exhaling a bit of smoke through his nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked at the box once more wanting to thank it for giving him this power but a thought came upon him. He became a dragon after thinking about the dragon he helped. What would happen if he thought of another species? Jack decided to give it a try. This time he thought of a lion. As he had that mental picture in his head, Jack opened the box. The familiar flash of light emerged once more nearly blinding him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again, the light dimished and Jack immediately looked at himself agiain. He found himself covered in fur again but it was blonde. He went back to the mirror to see he became a muscle lion! He growled to himself in joy. He finally figured out what that box can do. If he thought of a species and open the box, he can become it! Jack simply loved this new gift. The possibilities were literally limitless for him now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack did a few more poses as a lion, loving the way his soft, golden fur mixed with his hard ripped muscles. With the ability to change species, Jack had a lot of new options. He could do anything he wanted and no one would ever know it was him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack went back to the box and held it in his strong hands. He was about to change back into a fox when he stopped himself. For some reason, he had a special affinity to being a dragon. His scales felt rock hard, he could fly, and he was really hot in both ways! Somehow, it felt like Jack should have been a dragon his entire life. So Jack opened the box and imagined looking exactly like he did as a dragon. The flash erupted from the box again, and before he knew it Jack was back to being an orange dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack immediately ran over to the mirror and started posing again. He couldn't help it; it felt so natural to it. After a while, though, he didn't feel like just posing in front of a mirror. He wanted to share his new body with other people. Jack decided on the first place for people to show off that popped into his head: the pool. The transformation had kept the same clothes on Jack, so he was still wearing the bathing suit from before. Excitement rising with every second, Jack pushed open a window and jumped out, soaring through the skies at amazing speeds towards the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a few minutes later, Jack landed outside of the pool with a loud THUMP, shaking the ground and causing quite a few heads to turn. Jack smirked, the attention more than making up for his years in his old fox body. Flexing subconsciously as he walked, Jack walked through the metal gate into the pool area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack looked at the people running around, laughing, and having a good time. It made him want to do the same thing. He walked over to the deep end, noticing how cool and crisp the water looked. Not being able to resist the temptation, Jack folded up his wings and made a graceful dive into the pool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to test something out, Jack started swimming up and down the pool as fast as he could. Sure enough, his surprising speed translated over to water too. He was practically a blur and making huge splashes just by stroking. Once again, the onlookers were astonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth also appeared to give Jack incredible endurance, as he kept at his full speed swim for a half hour. Finally though, he realized he was a little tired and decided to take a break, so he slowed down and swam slowly to the edge of the pool to pull himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a group of three hot young dragons that happened to be chatting away at a table near the pool when Jack got out. The huge splash of water caused them to turn their heads, which in turn caused their jaws to drop at the huge sexy hunk climbing out of the pool. Jack, noticing their stares, walked over to their table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack casually leaned on the metal fence while the girls watched every huge muscle of his move along with him. \"Well, hello ladies,\" Jack said in a suave voice, his new muscles and form giving him a lot of new confidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a while for one of the dragons to get the courage to speak up. \"...Wow, you're... big,\" the girl said, notable for having some toned muscles showing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you like?\" Jack replied, proceeding to flex his bicep harder than he ever had, watching it swell up to sizes no bodybuilder could match. The girls nearly fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how strong are you?\" one of the female dragons, the only blonde one, managed to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why don't you see for yourselves?\" Jack responded. His mind quickly raced through what he could do to show off his strength, and he decided to go with what was closest to him: the fence. Moving with the grace of a track star, he grabbed the fence and yanked hard, easily pulling off a small piece of metal. Then, with minimal effort, he clasped it with two hands and swiftly snapped it in half. The girls watched, astounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack was probably happier than he ever was before. Just a day ago, he had been a wimp fox who had no friends at school and was beat up everyday. Now he was the strongest dragon in the world chatting with three hot girls who would practically throw themselves at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen a thought hit him: why go back? He loved being a dragon, more than he loved being a fox even when he was a muscular fox. He could start life over, use his muscles for great things, and very few people would probably miss the old Jack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Jack's thoughts were interrupted by a question. \"What's your name?\" asked one of the dragons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack said the first name that came to his mind. \"Skylar. Skylar Armstrong.\" The more he said it in his head, the better it felt. Skylar wasn't just a fake name or a disguise: he WAS Skylar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a couple hours, Jack, now Skylar, talked with the girls, who seemed to love him more with every word he said. Finally, though Skylar had to leave, and though all four were sad, he left with three phone numbers and a smile on his face.</span></div></div>",

What was so great about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf guideded Skylar to the parking lot where he landed. There were two foot indentations deep in the concrete! Skylar's jaw dropped at the site. He didn't even notice that when he got there. \"You are an incredible being, my friend,\" Said the wolf, \"I would love to see you around more!\" \"What do you mean?\" Skylar asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a supporter for this year's Mr. Gigantic bodybuilding competition and I want you in there!\" Skylar couldn't believe his ears! Someone actually wanted to see his great body! Skylar was automatically full of confidence. There was no doubt in his mind that his he would win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sign me up mister!\" He said holding out his giant hand. \"Fantasitic!\" Said the wolf shaking his hand, \"the competition begins in about a month so be ready for anything. I mean ANYTHING!\" Skylar didn't know what he meant by that but was still determined to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will be!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome! See you in a month Mr...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skylar,\" He said still loving the sound of his new name, \"Skylar Armstrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Skylar, I am really looking forward to seeing you there! I'll give more info later on. How about we meet at the gym and talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Sounds great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar's self-esteem was skyrocketing! Not only was he invited to one of the most major bodybuilding competitions but somebody wanted to work out with him! Skylar's new life was making a great start.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next day, Skylar was walking into a gym, wearing only tight shorts and a  sleevelss shirt to better accentuate his muscles. He was meeting the  wolf at the Golden Guns Gym, a local gym for bodybuilders, to discuss  the competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore,  Skylar would have been a nervous wreck having to come in here, and he  had even sprinted past it when he had to walk near it before. However,  looking around, he saw that he might even be the biggest man in the gym.  However, that didn't mean that the bodybuilders here weren't big. In  fact, it was the most muscular group of people he had seen. Huge lions,  bulky  horses, gigantic dogs, all working out with weights in the tonnage.  There were even a few female bodybuilders, and they were probably bigger  than some of the men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar  noticed the muscular wolf waving at him from a large table. Skylar  walked up and sat down with him, creaking the chair a little even though they were made for large people like him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf quickly began describing Mr. Gigantic to Skylar. It was a huge competition that would attract the best bodybuilders around. The bodybuilders would be put through a round of posing and strength first. Then, the pool would be cut down to only a select few, who would then participate in a strength obstacle course for the title. The winner would recieve a large trophy, a full weight room set capable of giving him a challenge, and enough money to supposedly set Skylar for life, not to mention the fame that winning a major bodybuilding competition would bring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar was very intrigued by everything the wolf said, but he couldn't stop glancing at all the gym patrons working out. Sweat running down their face, muscles flex in hard concentration... Skylar wanted to be out there with them, testing and showing off his strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt one point, the wolf caught Skylar's eye and looked where he was looking. \"Oh, I get it, your muscles want a little exertion, eh? Why don't you show me what you got?\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited, Skylar practically leaped up and ran over to the weights, the wolf calmly following him. Skylar decided to start by curling some dumbbells. Since the gym was built for people with insane strength, there were weights there that could satisfy Skylar's needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to start off light, Skylar grabbed a pair of 200 lb. dumbbells off of the rack and started pumping. They were as light as paper to him! Excited, Skylar started pumping faster and faster, enjoying the rush using his muscles gave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar put them down and tried 500 lb. dumbbells. He felt a little resistance, but it still wasn't enough, so he set them down and grabbed 1000 lb. dumbbells, which even to this gym were more there to show how heavy it was than actually for someone to use. However, that wasn't stopping Skylar, who quickly pumped out some fairly easy reps before dropping them with a loud BANG. Skylar decided to move on to the weight bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barbell weights were even more eye-popping than the dumbells, but Skylar wasted no time in loading up a bar with 3 tons of weight, attracting a few looks. Skylar was more unsure about this, as the most he had lifted so far was about 2 tons, but he would never know unless he tried. He gathered up all his strength and pushed up, finding, not so surprisingly anymore, he could lift it easily. He set it down with a clank and went to look for more weights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, Skylar was in the same position only with 5 tons of weight and a couple of interested onlookers waiting to see if he could do it. Some were even taking bets. If Skylar lifted this, he would have broken the gym record.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mighty heave, Skylar started pumping the bar up and down, the crowd's cheers invigorating him more. Even this wasn't all that heavy to him. Finally, after 20 reps or so, Skylar decided to put the bar down on the rack and stand up, immdeiately being flooded by bodybuilders giving approval and congratulations, including the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing!\" the wolf said. \"Those were some heavy weights you were lifting! Even the bodybuilders will be intimidated by you, and you'll tear right through them... kind of like a storm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A storm, huh?\" Skylar replied. He kind of liked that idea, and it made him sound really cool. Might even make a good stage name...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar then gathered up his things, said good-bye to the wolf, and left the Golden Guns Gym. He was proud of his accomplishment, and wondering how far he could go. He could only hope that Mr. Gigantic would give him a bigger challenge!</span></div></div>",

He felt pumped about the competion and confident that he would win. Skylar wished that a month would just go by now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar squeezed through his front door and went to his room once more. He smiled once again for he found yet another package from his mysterious friend! He rushed to his bed to pick up a small bag with yet another note tied to it. Skylar opened it and it said:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack, I mean Skylar,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI've heard about your bodybuilding competiton and I'm so proud of you! I have no doubt that you'll win! With this you'll win for sure. Have fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar closed the note and unwrapped the package with no hesitation. When he opened it, there was a blue flash of light coming out of it! It wasn't as blinding as the previous one but enough to conver his eyes. The light vanished and Skylar went to see what was inside the package. Nothing! The box was empty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar was disappointed to see that his new gift supposedly didn't exist. He went to his mirror to see if there was any change to his body but there wasn't anything new. Skylar was saddened by no changes to his body but his sadness was short lived as he began to admire his body. He couldn't refuse another posing session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe made all the poses he could think of and loved them all. Skylar loved how his muscles thicked and bulged as he posed. He even tensed his leg muscles and loved how they looked. But nothing surprised him as to what happened next. As he relaxed his muscles, they stayed at that size! Skylar noticed how his arms looked a bit bigger and he began to think that he received his gift after all. But he had to make sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his shirt still on, Skylar started to tense his chest to test his theory. As he flexed, he felt his shirt getting tighter and tighter. Eventually his shirt ripped revealling a 10-pack! He was right! Every time he flexed his muscles, they would grow! \"I think I can get use to this!\" Said Skylar as he exhaled more smoke from his nostrils.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A month later, Skylar was once again walking up to the Golden Guns Gym, but for a different reason. Today was finally the day of Mr. Gigantic! Skylar was psyched as he walked through the entrance, ducking a little to keep his head from hitting the door frame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since Skylar had recieved his mysterious flexing power, he had been growing bigger. He didn't want to grow too big all at once, but that didn't stop him from flexing in the mirror every once in a while. Now his bulk was even more impressive. Thanks to flexing his leg muscles, he was now a few inches taller, standing at 6' 10\". His biceps were now closer to car tire size, and his 10-pack of abs was even harder than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of searching, Skylar managed to find the wolf, who immediately ran up to him. \"How's my superstar!\" the wolf exclaimed. \"I must say, you certainly have gotten bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar blushed and rubbed the back of his head. \"I've just been working out a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, good for you!\" the wolf replied. \"The competition doesn't start for a while, so you can hang out for a bit, warm up, do whatever you want. See you on stage!\" the wolf then walked off, presumably to attend to other business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar decided to head over to the designated training area and maybe talk to some people. There seemed to be hundreds of bodybuilders, all spread around the one area. Even being bigger than everyone else, Skylar knew that beating out everyone wouldn't be a walk in the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking for someone to talk to, Skylar finally noticed two bodybuilders talking by a water cooler. One, a dalmatian, was leaning up against a wall, not making his height of 7' 3\" any less intimidating. The other one seemed to be the opposite: he was a badger, and while short for a bodybuilder at 5' 10, his ripped upper body still made him built like a tank. Skylar walked over to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, hello,\" Skylar said, getting the pair's attention. They turned towards the voice and gasped silently. While being bodybuilders had made them more used to seeing incredibly muscled men than other people, Skylar was the biggest they had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dalmatian smiled. \"Wow. You're probably the biggest we've seen today. What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skylar Armstrong,\" Skylar replied. \"And I've just been working out a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe badger, though clearly enjoying Skylar's company and smiling, snorted. \"Yeah right. Just working out doesn't give you biceps the size of the moon. What's your story, and why the heck haven't we seen you at competitions before?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar took a deep breath. Luckily, he had thought ahead and created a backstory for his new identity. \"I grew up in a really rough neighborhood. It was one of those beat or get beaten situations. I was afraid, so from an early age I started lifting whatever I could get my hands on. My father was a pretty big guy, so his genetics let me grow a little faster than normal. By the time I was 16 I was the toughest guy around and no one messed with me or my family. However, at 18, I decided I'd had enough of my trashy life and moved close to here. I lived pretty quietly at first, pretty much only going out to work out, but a little while ago I decided to use my muscles for more than just self-defense. So here I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were speechless. \"Wow, that's amazing. How old are you?\" the badger asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"21,\" Skylar said. He had decided to make his new identity 21 to give him more privileges and make him an adult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three talked for a while about workouts, nutrients, and other things. Both the dalmatian and the badger agreed that Skylar stood a pretty good chance at winning the entire thing. However, Jack felt like there was more to do around the area, so he said good-bye to the two and headed off in a random direction.</span></div></div>",

He thought that he could make some really good friends in the competition. A voice appeared overhead. \"Attention all competitors, the Mr. Gigantic bodybuilding compeition is about to begin. Please Be prepared and make your way to your positions.\" Skylar slammed his hands together and said to himself, \"Let's get this party started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar and the other competitors made their way to a well-made stage in the indoor basketball court. They went behind a corner to find private stall for each of them to change. Skylar squeezed into his stall and found a blue speedo laying on the bench. He smirked and put it on. It was a tight fit but he loved how he looked in it. He flexed a little but not enough to make him grow. He stepped out of the stall to see everyone else ready to start. Skylar then heard the host from the other side talking to the audience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" Said the announcer, \"Welcome to the Mr. Gigantic Bodybuilding competition! Let the games begin!!\" The audience cheered and calmed as the announcer continued. \"The first round will consist of a posing session. The judges will rank the poses, the size of their muscles, and their effort. Without furthur ado, let's begin!\" The audience cheered again while Skylar pictures them aweing at the site of him growing as he poses!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe competitors went down a runway one by one as their names were called. Skylar creeped through the line in anxiety. At long last, Skylar heard the announcer say, \"Skylar Armstrong!\" Skylar stomped through the runway triumphantly as the crowd cheered for his size. He opened his massive wings to show off his entire body and began to pose. The crowd was awestruck to see the size of his muscles double with veins running down everywhere. They enjoyed every site of him from his arms to his legs. Skylar made his way backstage to find out that he grew a little bit but not enough for anyone to notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar stood on the side of backstage seeing everyone else take their turn. He then decided to rest his eyes until the first round was done.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He rubbed his eyes, and when the blurriness cleared, he saw it was the wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The first round is over; they're about to announce who's going to the next round!\" he exclaimed excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar immediately bolted upwards, both excited and nervous. He was sure nobody could beat his flexing, but he still doubted himself. He barely had time to think about it before the intercom buzzed on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention everyone, the judges have turned in their scores and we are about to announce the top 50 competitors who will move on to the next round. They are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone sat in silence as the list of names was read. Skylar waited nervously, but his name wasn't in the first 10. Or the first 20.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally though, in the middle of the list, he heard \"...Skylar Armstrong.\" He practically leaped out of his chair in excitement and relief. He was getting closer to his goal of being a bodybuilding champion!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar waited for the list of names to end, and was happy to find out that the dalmatian and badger also made it in. He was about to go congratualte them when he heard: \"Would the remaining competitors please come backstage, the next round is about to begin.\" Happy his rest had refilled him with energy so quickly, Skylar went backstage to wait for his turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Skylar sat backstage, the second round started as they called up a fairly muscular bear and the crowd cheered loudly. The competitors were sitting behind a curtain and those who had already gone didn't go to the same place, so no one would know what the challenge was until they were up there doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar was far down the list of competitors, so he entertained himself by wondering what the strength challenge could be. Was it lifting something? Pulling something? He couldn't get his mind off of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few competitors before Skylar, they called up the badger he had talked to before. As he walked up to the curtain, he turned to give Skylar a thumbs-up before pushing away the curtain and sauntering onto the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Skylar was called, so he stood up and stretched his wings to their full length, feeling more powerful than ever. He practically charged through the curtain to greet the adoring fans, who screamed for the huge muscle dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar then turned his head to the right and gasped. Sitting on the stage was a huge monster truck, probably weighing 5 or 6 tons. He realized it was his job to lift it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to waste time, Skylar walked over to the monster truck and gripped the bumper with his large hands. He grinned when he felt the steel crumble under his hands. Slowly, he began to lift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long before Skylar was standing on the stage with a monster truck over his head, only using some effort. The crowd went into hysterics over it, so Skylar flexed his legs, making them grow ever so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds of showing off, Skylar put the truck down and walked off the stage so the next competitor could go on. He was fairly certain no one could match his feat, and he knew he would be in the finals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That much closer...\" Skylar thought as he sat down and waited for the round to end and the finalists to be announced.</span></div></div>",

The finalists are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar closed his in hopes that would give him good luck. He heard the dalmation and the badger's called. Although he was happy for them, he really wanted to hear his name called. He then heard, \"Skylar Armstrong.\" He jumped for joy. Even though he knew he was going to the finals, he couldn't contain his excitement because it overpowered his expectation. He went deaf after hearing his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe intercom continued after the names were called. \"Finalists, please make your way to the front for the final round.\" It then disconnected. Skylar cracked his knuckles and neck and made his way to the final round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made to his destination, Skylar saw the dalmation, the badger, a bear, and lion. They looked tough but not nearly as intimidating as him. The finalists heard the announcer once more. \"Alright ladies and gentlemen, the moment we all been waiting for: the final round!\" The crowd went crazy in response to him. First he called out the dalmation first to perform. Once again, Skylar had to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour and a half, the announcer called out, \"Skylar Armstrong!!\" Skylar went through the curtains flexing and waving to the crowd and cheering following. Skylar then noticed what lied beyond him: an obstacle course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe announcer came to Skylar's side. \"All right Skylar,\" He said, \"Here's what you have to do: First, you need break those giant rocks in front of you. Then, climb the rock wall and finally lift those heavy duty gates to reach the red button at the finish line. You have to be fast though for you will be timed on this! Are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Heck, yeah!\" Said Skylar excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Start the countdown!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar bent over in running position hearing the crowd countdown. \"3...2...1..GO! He ran in lightning speed once he heard those magic words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran to the giant rocks. Skylar curled his hands into fists and started shattering them after one swing. He smirks while the crowd starts to get impressed. He then found himself in front of the rock wall. It looked pretty high and time consuming. He had to think fast as to how to climb it quickly. It came to him instantly. Skylar squatted down and rose above the wall without breaking a sweat. The audience were amazed by the jump; especially since he didn't use his wings. Finally, he came to gates. Skylar grabbed the handles with one hand and made through each of them after pushing them to give space to squeeze through. After what seemed to be an instant for Skylar, he slammed the button nearly breaking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn alarm followed the button pressing and crowd went wild for Skylar. Skylar looked around to see his fans. He absolutely loved the attention. He played around by flexing a little and made his way backstage. All that's left for him is the judges who will determine his fate in the competition.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The dalmation crossed his arms tightly, the badger put his hands to his lips, the bear paced around the room, and the lion sat in his chair rocking back and forth. The room was quiet but filled with intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe energy of the room changed when they heard the intercom again.

Skylar and the finalists walked on stage in a line while the audience cheered for them. In front of the finalists was a huge trophy that was about the size of Skylar with a golden and muscular figurine on top doing a pose. Skylar felt envy in his blood. He had to restrain his arms from reaching for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn envelope was given to the announcer. \"For third place we have...\" The badger smiled as he heard his name called. He posed and walked forward to claim his prize: a check for $10,000. \"And for second place...\" The announcer continued. Skylar smiled for the dalmatian when his friend won second place. The dalmation walked came forth  and received a check for $30,000.

Skylar practically ran to the announcer to shake his hand (doing his best not to break it). \"Congratulations Skylar!\" Said the announcer, \"Not only did you win this year's title of Mr. Gigantic but you are also the biggest and youngest competitor to have a mile long of sponsors who would love to share some fame and glory with you!\" Skylar was more than awestruck when he heard that! Someone wanted to do stuff with him and to get paid for it! Skylar couldn't see any flaw in this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all the excitement, Skylar grabbed his trophy by its colorful side bars and raised it above his head without thinking. The crowd went CRAZY at the site of this titan. \"I must say,\" Said the announcer, \"You certainly know how to cook up a storm.\" There was that word again: Storm. Skylar didn't know why but he loved the sound of that word. He wanted it to be more than a word; he wanted it to be an identity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar put his trophy down and grabbed the microphone out of the announcer's hand. \"Thank you all for your support,\" Said Skylar, \"Since I have my whole life ahead of me, I think it's time for a change. For now on, don't know me as Skylar; call me STORM!\" Skylar went crazy with the attention he was getting as the crowd began chanting, \"Storm, Storm, Storm.\" In all of the excitement, Skylar raised his head and opened his mouth to let out a stream of fire from his jaws. Everyone, including Skylar, was surprised yet enjoyed the site of glorious flames leaving from a glorious body.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He enjoyed everyone talking about him and referring to him as \"Storm.\" Skylar thought he could get use to it. \"I gotta say,\" Said the Dalmatian, \"you were unbelievable back there! You did things I didn't even know were possible like the jump over the rock wall. You are amazing!\" \"Thanks.\" Said Skylar for the thousandth time after several praises before. \"I'll say...\" The comment came from behind Skylar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Skylar turned around, he saw an average sized fox where the voice came from. \"Nice to meet you Mr. Armstrong,\" Said the fox, \"My name is Mr. Wentcroft and I have a proposition for you.\" \"Let me guess,\" Skylar asked, \"Another bodybuilding competition or modeling career?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, nothing like that. I have a more unique opportunity to present you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two words: Bachelor. Auction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar's ears perked at those words. That truly was a unique opportunity. The entire night Skylar was surrounded by people who wanted him to do one activity or another. They were good opportunities but they didn't strike Skylar's interest. But this was different because he would be able to do his favorite activity: Show off in front of beautiful women. He could picture it: A group of radiant women spending their money just to throw themselves on him. He had to be part of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sign me up Mr. Wentcroft; you got yourself a deal!\" Said Skylar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent!\" Said Mr. Wentcroft enthusiastically, \"The event is tomorrow night so make sure you look your best!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will! See you tomorrow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Wentcroft went his way with a grin on his face. Skylar was overwhelmed with joy over his next day of fame. He couldn't wait to see the women there and how much money they would be willing to give up for him. Skylar got back into his street clothes and ran out of the lobby to get ready for the euphemistic event.</span></div></div>",

He went to his room to see his best friend: the mirror. His reflection showed an incredibly sexy dragon that could get away with anything in just a wink. Skylar loved his new body and couldn't wait for the event.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he admired himself, Skylar came up with a thought: If he was sexy now, he would be HOT if he grew some more. That thought consumed him from the inside out. His body was literally shaking in enthusiasm. Skylar had to get bigger for all people to see. He then decided to go into an emergency posing session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar started with his biceps. He flexed them in all ways he could think of. As he flexed, he enjoyed the tingling sensation that was creeping in them and the feeling of his shirt sleeves getting tighter. He then moved to his chest. Skylar crouched and squatted so he could get the sensation from his arms to his chest. It worked. He saw more definition in his shirt and an additonal to his abs. Skylar loved how the session was going. He was getting hotter and hotter by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo his height would match his muscles, he flexed his legs to grow in stature. As he did, not only was he getting taller his legs were thickening. He finally reached a pleasant height of 7'0\". Skylar even flexed the frames of his wings so he could get a bigger wingspan. The flexing session was finished and Skylar couldn't take his eyes off of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar returned to the mirror and saw his muscles look and feel like mountains! He truly thought he was big, hot, and unstoppable. He smirked to his reflection and said, \"Look out ladies, 'cus a storm is brewin'.\"</span></div></div>",

He ran out of the door and flew without putting another shirt on before he left. Skylar landed in front of the gym and met with Mr. Wentworth at the front door. \"Skylar,\" he said, \"so glad you could make it!\" \"Wouldn't miss this for the world!\" Said Skylar shaking Mr. Wentworth's hand as lightly as he could. \"Let's not keep those girls waiting.\" Said Mr. Wentworth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the next hour, Skylar found himself in a huge tuxedo behind a large curtain on stage. He was so antsy with excitement he could barely control himself. With the tuxedo so tight against his body, he did his best not to shred it (yet). Skylar heard Mr. Wentworth's voice on the other side of the curtain. \"Ladies,\" he began, \"Welcome to this year's bachelor auction. We have fine samples of men for you today and all the money spent will go towards charity. Once you bought a man, you and he are together for an entire week! So, without further ado, let's begin!\" The girls began with an applause and cheer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our first bachelor is Skylar Armstrong!\" Skylar opened the curtains and stomped his way to the front of the stage. In front of him were the most beautiful women he ever saw and based by their fancy clothing, they were also rich. Skylar held his head up high leaving an outline of his chest on his jacket and shirt. Mr. Wentworth continued, \"Mr. Armstrong truly lives up to his name! He is the winner of this year's Mr. Gigantic bodybuilding competition. He loves to keep in shape and to find that special girl! May we start the bidding at $1,000?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"$1,000!\" Yelled a lioness. \"$3,000!\" Screamed a vixen. Skylar began to feel overwhelmed. People were spending thousands of dollars just to be with him for a week! Without thinking, he began to flex and pose. It was as if his muscles were controlling him. The sleeves of his tux ripped after giving the biggest flex Skylar could make for the girls. He tore of the remnants so the girls could see his bare and massive arms. The bidding went bigger after his performance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"$15,000!\" Everyone turned in surpise to see a fine looking wolf with a checkbook at hand. \"$15,000 going once, twice, sold!\" Said Mr. Wentworth. Skylar jumped down with a large thump and speed-walked towards the wolf girl. \"Looks like I'm yours, gorgeous.\" Skylar says smoothly to her. The wolf giggled and squeezed his bicep. \"Yes you are.\"</span></div></div>",

They stopped in front of her car. \"So, what do you have in mind for our first day together?\" asked Skylar. \"Well,\" replied the wolf, \"I hope this doesn't sound like me coming on too strong, but I was thinking maybe we could have a picnic dinner on the beach.\" Skylar's ears perked at the thought. That would be a great place for he and her to have a great time he thought. \"That sounds like a wonderful idea!\" He said. \"Ok great!\" said the wolf.<br>\r\n\"How about you pick me at 8 tomorrow?\"<br>\r\n\"Sounds good.\"<br>\r\nThe wolf drove away while Skylar carried a piece of paper with an address on it. He flies away with a grin on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar ransacked his closet for a bathing suit. He thought about wearing a speedo but he thought to himself that would send to wrong message to his date. He looked effortlessly for a suit with legs. After 10 minutes of searching, Skylar found a blue bathing suit that might work. He put them on and looked at himself in his mirror. He looked great! Although they felt tight, they outlined his thighs very well and filled them perfectly. Skylar made another pose and telling himself, \"Someone is going to have a lot of fun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next night, Skylar flew himself to the address according to the paper the wolf gave her. He approached the door in his bathing suit, a towel over his monstrous shoulder, and a smile on his face. He knocked on the door with one knuckle gently as he could. Skylar was surprised to see who answered it. His date was in a binkini with a picnic basket in one hand. She looked like a super model! Skylar's heart missed a beat. The wolf girl was just as surprised to see him. With his muscles and smile, she felt like she was going out with a god. <br>\r\n\"Wow,\" said Skylar, \"you looked nice.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Said the wolf, \"So do you.\"<br>\r\n\"Ready to go?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"<br>\r\nAfter they walked off the porch of the house, Skylar picked up the wolf and held her against his chest. \"What are you doing?\" She asked. Skylar smiled and said, \"Traveling with style.\" He squatted down and spread his wings. The next thing the girl knew she and Skylar were flying towards the beach. She felt scared at first but the view from below amazed her and the sight of Skylar made her feel safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a minute, Skylar and the wolf made it to the beach. The beach was perfect for the two of them. It was completely deserted of people. All that was there were soothing waves and a bright full moon over it. Skylar thought that the beach was nice during the day but not as nice at night. He and the wolf walked on the cool sand and made a spot. Skylar placed the towel down and they both settled down. Skylar noticed some driftwood near them and wanted to surprise his date. He collected and placed them in front their spot. \"Now, what are you doing?\" The wolf asked. Skylar took a breath and directed it toward the woodpile. Fire slipped from his lips and caught the wood. The warmth of the fire charmed the wolf immensely. \"You're just full of surprises.\" She remarked. Skylar turned his attention to her. \"Good surprises I hope.\" Some smoke then escaped from his mouth.</span></div></div>",

Although the wealth was nice, Skylar enjoyed knowing her personally. He began to love her, not the money. Skylar made a big sigh after eating his picnic dinner. \"Man, that was good!\" He said. \"I'm glad you enjoyed it,\" Said Christen. \"So did I.\" All of a sudden a chill breeze struck them both. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristen crossed her arms for warmth. \"Wow, it got cold all of a sudden.\" Skylar let out a friendly smirk. \"Here.\" He said simply. Skylar walked behind her, sat down, and placed Christen in his lap. He then wrapped his wings around Christen. His wings were a blanket to her. She felt warm instantaneously. Christen lay her head against Skylar's rippling chest and began to relax by the thumping of his racing heart. \"That feels much better,\" She said. \"Thank you. You're very sweet.\" Skylar looked down at her with a little blush in his scaly cheeks. \"You're welcome.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent the rest of their date looking up at the stars in that cozy position. With no lights within miles, they could see all the stars shine with all their brightness. \"So,\" Said Skylar breaking the silence, \"What do want to do for our next date?\" Christen thought for a few minutes in silence. \"I know.\" She said finally. \"I have a cabin in the forest outside of town. I was thinking maybe I could call a couple of friends and spend the weekend there.\" Yet another wonderful idea to Skylar. \"That sounds awesome! Looking forward to it!\" \"Great!\" She replied smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was getting really cold so Skylar and Christen packed up and flew back to Christen's place. \"Thank you,\" Christen said at the front door. \"That was delightful.\" \"Thank you.\" Said Skylar. Christen gave Skylar a peck on the cheek and closed the door of her house in front of him. Skylar then grinned from ear to ear and flexed both biceps out of euphoria.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Two days to go.  Let's see.\"  Skylar said to himself.  He was excited to go.  Since his last date with Christen, he pumped up a bit more, mainly due to all the working out he had done since.  He bought a home gym with the money he had gotten from the competition.  Plus, he made sure that there was enough weight to challenge him.  However, challenging Skylar \"Storm\" Armstrong was not an easy task.  He'd finally found his max bench at 15 tons, the weight of a medium sized truck.  He also made a friend since the competition.  Greg, the dalmatian that won second place.  Christen let Skylar bring him up to the cabin.  Mainly because he was nice, hot and single.  One of her friends has been looking for a boyfriend, and he thought Greg would be the perfect fit.  In fact, Skylar was planing on working out with Greg today.  Greg was on his way to Skylar's house.  He moved out of his parent's house after explaining what happened to him.  His parents were unsurprisingly okay with it, mainly because who could say no to Skylar's muscles.  Only Greg, the next strongest guy he knew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDing Dong!  The doorbell rang.  Already in his gym shorts, Skylar opened the door.  Sure enough, it was Greg, also only in his gym shorts.  Although a bit taller than Skylar, Greg's muscles were smaller than Skylar's.  Greg was much more lean than Skylar.  However, his muscles were not small by any definition of the word.  His biceps were 30\" the last time he measured them, and his 10 pack was harder than rock.  However, Skylar was still bigger.  (He had 33\" arms for scale).  \"Ready to work out?\"  \"Of course Sky.\"  Greg called Skylar \"Sky\" as a nickname.  Skylar liked it.  The duo went to Skylar's basement, where the exercise equipment was.  \"What are you doing today?\"  Skylar inquired.  \"Abs and cardio.  You?\"  \"Same.  Let's have a competition for our warm-up.\"  \"Sure.  What o you have in mind Sky?\"  \"The abs machines, set them to 4 tons, and first to 500 reps wins.\"  \"Okay.  You're going down Sky!\"  Greg was excited.  \"Let's do this.\"  4 tons for any other person would be too much to crunch, but Skylar and Greg's abs were unmatched by anyone else.  In fact, a bull once tried to convince them that he was stronger than the duo.  They accepted the challenge.  After destroying the bull, he was not happy.  He took his extremely muscular arm, and punched Greg as hard as he could.  It connected with Greg's abs, which was not good...  for the bull.  The bull broke his hand on the granite abs of Greg.  That's why his show name is Granite Greg.  The bull then took his other arm, and punched Skylar.  That punch connected with the abs too, causing the other hand to break.  The duo laughed as they told the bull the hilarious truth.  They were not flexing their abs.  They were rock hard on their own.  The duo have speculated that when flexed, their abs were bulletproof, but they don't want to try. (For obvious reasons.)  \"3...  2...  1...  GO!\"  The duo sat up and down at unfathomable speeds, getting each sit up out in seconds.  After 10 minutes, Skylar yelled, \"Done!\"  He won.  \"Damn, I had 470.  Next time, I will beat you.\"  They were contest rivals, until they made a truce that they would never partake in the same contest at the same time.  \"I win, my prize is bragging rights.\"  \"Okay, but what to do now.  I barely feel warmed up.\"  \"How about a jog, for the cardio.\"  \"Perfect Sky.  Where?\"  \"How about around the city.  I know of a good pathway to take.\"  \"How many miles?\"  \"150.\"  That's it?\"  \"We're still warming up Greg!\"  \"Oh yeah, I forgot.\"  The duo raced up the stairs and out the door.  150 miles is quite long.  However, Skylar and Greg's legs were monstrous.  They could keep a constant 100mph without breaking a sweat.  The duo decided to jog together.  They already had their contest.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter around an hour of light jogging (for them...), they returned to Skylar's house.  \"That was a good warm up.  I feel pumped.\"  Skylar said.  His calves agreed to.  The diamond shaped muscles were the size of soccer balls, and hard as rock.  Greg's were too.  \"Now, let's make this workout worthwhile.\"  Greg said.  \"Let's indeed.\"  The duo descended into Skylar's gym, and dispersed.  Skylar went to the push up rack to do vertical sit ups while Greg went to the treadmill.  They agreed that after an hour, they would switch.  Skylar grabbed a barbell, loaded it with 8 tons, and vertically sat up, with the extra weight.  Again, this was pretty easy.  However, what was not easy was doing it for an hour straight.  Greg, on the other hand, set the treadmill to 250 mph, a challenge even for Granite Greg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n250 miles later, Greg stepped off of the treadmill, legs bulging and heart pounding.  \"Skylar, it's been an hour.  i can't do this forever.\"  \"One minute, I'm almost done!\"  Skylar yelled.  \"I beat my record!  I pulled off 3600 reps!\"  \"What was it before?\"  \"3000 in an hour.\"  \"Nice.  I was able to maintain 250mph for a full hour.  That is not easy.\"  \"Nice.\"  The two switched positions.  Because Greg can't fly onto the bar, he has to do a (very easy) pull up to get into vertical sit up position.  What is not easy is getting the bar.  Skylar handed him the 8 ton barbell.  Then, he got on the treadmill, and ran his heart out.  (Get it?  Cardio joke.  Bad puns are bad.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne more hour flew by, and Skylar saw what his friend meant.  250 mph for a full hour was not easy at all.  As Skylar stepped off the treadmill, Greg got down from the pull up bar.  \"3500 reps.  Record for me too.\"  \"Nice Greg.  that was a good workout!  Shower time.  We'll take turns.\"  As Greg was showering, Skylar noticed a new box on his desk.  He unwrapped it, and saw a note, and another wooden box, similar to the one that turned him into a dragon.  The note said;<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Skylar,<br>\r\nI noticed that you've made a friend.  Share your secret with him, and show him this.  Don't worry, he won't accuse you of cheating.  He will like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar then looked at the wooden box.  He had no idea what it could do.  The first gift made his muscles grow, then he got a species changing box, and finally, the flash that made his muscles grow after a flex.  Skylar hesitated to open it.  5 minutes later, he heard Greg open his bedroom door.  \"Sky, the shower's free.  It's your turn.\"  \"Greg, there's something I need to tell you.  A couple of months ago, I was a skinny 16 year old fox.  Then, I got a rock in the mail.  When I touched it, it made my muscles grow.  Then, I got another package.  That one had a box that lets me change into any species.  I chose dragon because I like flying around.\"  Skylar showed him the older box.  \"Then, I got a third one.  This time, when I opened it, a bright blue light flashed around me.  At first, I thought nothing happened.  However, when I flexed my biceps, they got bigger.  I could grow by flexing.  Now, I just got this one, and I don't know what it does.  Since you're here, and the note in it said for me to do this, let's see what it does together.\"  \"Okay.  That's really cool.  So you can grow?\"  Skylar flexed his legs, and grew to Greg's height, with the rest of his body growing to proportion.  (Skylar's arms were now 35\")  \"Cool.  Maybe this will let me do that too.\"  \"We'll see.\"  Skylar and Greg grabbed the lid of the new box, opened it, and saw a bright flash of light.  \"What happened Sky?\"  \"I don't know, but I feel weird.\"  All of the sudden, all of Skylar's muscles contracted.  \"Aarg!\"  He yelled.  After a minute, Skylar regained control of his body.  Greg was standing there awestruck.  \"What?\"  Skylar asked.  \"Flex your arm, but don't make it grow.\"  Greg said.  Skylar did just that.  Then, Skylar felt the 35\" ball.  It was as hard as a diamond.  \"It seems to have hardened and strengthened my muscles.\"  Then, Greg's muscles contracted and grew.  Soon, they were Skylar's size.  \"Whoa.  That was weird.\"  \"Come with me to my gym.  I want to see something.\"  Skylar walked to the barbells, and loaded it with as much as he could put on.  50 tons.  He then tried to bench it.  It was easy as pie.  \"That box made us much stronger!\"  A note suddenly appeared.  It said, \"5 times stronger to be exact.  Also, to answer your question.  Yes, your muscles are bulletproof.  Now you don't need to flex them to make that true.\"  \"So Sky, if this note is saying what I think it's saying, our muscles are bulletproof when unflexed, and we're five times stronger then when you were after growing?\"  \"It seems so.  Grab that other barbell, and put 50 tons on it.  Greg did, handed it to Skylar, and he benched the two bars.  He found his new max.  100 tons.  \"Sky, this is awesome.  Anyway, see you Friday!\"  \"Bye Greg.\"  The dalmatian left, and Skylar took his long overdue shower.</span></div></div>",

After all, Skylar was the current definition of big and tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Skylar searched for clothes in the store, he ran into a familiar face.  \"Hey Greg.  Long time no see.\"  Skylar said jokingly.  Greg was only wearing his gym shorts, because none of his shirts fit.  The store let him in because he explained what happened to them.  \"Hey Sky.  After that workout, none of my clothes fit, so here I am.\"  \"Same.\"  The muscular duo spoke for a while, and decided to look for clothes together, seeing how they were both the same size.  After much searching, the duo found the largest clothing the store had.  \"Wow, I didn't know you could fit that many X's onto a shirt tag!\"  Greg said as he picked up an XXXXXXXL shirt and put it on.  \"How do I look?\"  The shirt was pretty snug around Greg's enormous pecs, but it held together.  \"You look good.\"  \"Yeah, but it feels tight.  Oh well.  Do they have any bigger sizes?\"  \"I'll look.\"  Skylar walked over to the stand with the biggest sizes, where he saw another note.  \"I've been getting a lot of these lately.  Greg, come here!  Another note.\"  \"What does it say?\"  Skylar cleared his throat.  \"Dear Skylar and Greg.  Don't worry about the clothing.  Check your closets, and you will find everything you will need.\"  \"Well Sky, that's convenient.\"  \"Hang on, wait here for a minute, I'll be back.\"  Skylar rushed out of the store, and flew home to check his closet.  Sure enough, new clothes filed the small room.  He put on a T-shirt and shorts which thankfully fit perfectly, and flew back.  \"Greg, these appeared in my closet.  And I have the feeling that they will grow whenever we do.  That's nice.\"  \"But, I like flexing out of clothes.\"  \"There's more on the note.  'Don't worry Greg, if that is your intention with some articles, they will tear, and be replaced in your closet.\"  \"Perfect.  I get to show off my muscles without wasting clothes for once.  Anyway, it seems that our work here is done.  Bye Sky!\"  \"Bye Greg.\"  Skylar flew back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then spent the next half hour posing in front of his mirror.  He loved his vascular muscles.  They were as ripped as possible, seeing how he had exactly 0 grams of fat on his 700 pound frame.  Then, Skylar thought of something he'd never done.  Measure himself.  He wondered how big his muscles actually were.  He worked out all of his muscles a bit to get them pumped, and then measured.  He found very pleasing results.  35\" arms, 25\" forearms, 80\" chest, 42\" waist, 48\" thighs, and 34\" calves.  On top of that, each muscle was as hard as diamond.  Skylar loved his body, almost as much as he loved Christen.  Skylar smiled as he bounced his vascular, striated pecs.  Then he tensed his arms, looking at the striated, vascular horseshoe shaped triceps.  There was not a single muscle on his body that did not have veins popping out at some time.  Even without flexing, all of his muscles were perfectly defined and vascular.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrumble Grumble.  Skylar felt his stomach groan.  He was hungry.  \"Hmm, I have not had eggs in a while.\"  Skylar walked to his fridge, got out some onions, cheese, sausage, bacon, and eggs.  He then took all 12 eggs, a pound of bacon, cheese and sausage, and some chopped onion, and mixed them into the super omelet.  A big guy like Skylar needs a lot of food.  On top of that, all the cholesterol and fat in it would go away because of Skylar's metabolism.  It is as fast as light.  Doctors said that it was physically impossible for Skylar not to be in perfect health, unless he was killed in some sort of explosion.  No matter what he ate, his heart would be fine, and his bodyfat would stay 0.  Another perk of being a muscle monster he guessed.  The only issue was the amount of money it cost to offset his appetite.  Thankfully, his sponsors and contest wins made him rich.  Skylar's life was perfect in his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing noteworthy happened for the rest of the day.  Skylar just jacked his suitcase, and left to meet Greg and Christen.  \"Hey Skylar.\"  Christen said.  \"Hey Christen!  It's been a while.\"  \"I know.  I was just getting stuff together in the cabin itself.  You look different.\"  \"Yeah, I'll tell you about it later.  It's a long story.  But to make it short, magic stuff made me grow and strengthened me, a lot.\"  \"Tell me in the car.  It's a long drive, and I know you don't know where the cabin is, so no flying.  Anyway, where is this friend of your's.\"  All of the sudden, Greg arrived.  \"Hi.  You must be Christen.  Sky told me all about you.  I'm Greg.\"  \"Skylar was right, you are hot.  I have a friend who's dying to meet you.  She's meeting us at the cabin.  Anyway, get your stuff in the car, and let's go.\"  The three walked to Christen's car, put their suitcases in the trunk, and left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what happened since I last saw you?\"  \"Well Christen, here's the scoop.\"  Skylar explained the notes and gifts he'd received over the past months.  \"I see, so a couple of months ago, you were a wimpy fox, and now you are the strongest dragon ever?\"  \"Pretty much.\"  \"This was an interesting year for you so far, wasn't it?\"  \"Yes, but it has been awesome.  Plus, without those notes and gifts, I would have never met you.\"  \"Aww!\"  \"Guys, while you two were gushing at each other, we got a flat tire.\"  \"Oh no!  I don't have a spare.\"  Don't worry, leave it to Greg and me.  The two muscle behemoths got out of the car, and lifted it with Christen still inside it.  \"Where are we going?\"  \"As you run, I'll give directions.  Isn't this heavy Sky?\"  \"To me, this feels like lifting a feather.\"  \"Wow, you are strong.  Which reminds me, we need firewood at the cabin.  Could you get us some when we get there?\"  \"Sure.  Let's go.\"  Skylar ran according to the highway speed limits, which was quite difficult.  It felt like a snail's pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the three made it to the cabin.  \"I'll call car maintenance, you guys get firewood.\"  Christen said.  The duo went into the woods, and tried to find sticks on the ground.  \"Wait a minute.  Greg, I have an idea.\"  \"Oh god, what is it Sky?\"  \"We pull up a tree, bring it to the house, and chop it with our bare hands.  No wonder why Christen wants us to do it, and why she thought about it while I picked up the car.\"  \"OK, let's try this tree.\"  It was huge.  The tree was at least 50 feet fall, and it's trunk was big enough for both of the guys to hug it, and barely reach the other's hand.  \"On three, we lift.  One, two, three.\"  The tree was uprooted.  It then fell down.  The two picked the tree up, and walked over to the cabin.  There, they saw Christen talking to another girl.  \"The tire's fixed now.  I see you guys got some wood.\"  \"Only a little.\"  Skylar said as he put down the heavy tree.  Skylar, I would like you to meet Brittany.  Brittany, this is Skylar Armstrong.\"  \"Nice to meet you Skylar.  \"Nice to meet you too Brittany.\"  Brittany was a 5'10 leopard, and she was gorgeous.  However, after looking at her, Skylar could not figure out why she was single.  Then it hit him, she couldn't find the right guy.  \"So Christen, is this the guy you told me about?\"  \"No, Skylar's mine.  Skylar's friend on the other hand is single too.\"  \"Hi, I'm Greg.\"  Greg said as he shook Brittany's hand.  \"Hi, I'm Brittany.\"  \"Ok, it's been a long day.  Let's have dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Christen and Skylar cooked, Brittany and Greg bonded.  \"It seems operation \"Get Our Friends in Relationships\", or Operation GOFIR worked.\"  Skylar said jokingly to Christen.  \"It sure did.\"  All of the sudden, Skylar heard, \"After dinner, maybe we can show you what these can do.\"  Greg said as he flexed a giant bicep.  Brittany looked excited.  \"It seems that the two of us are going to be putting on a show after dinner.  Do you mind?\"  \"Mind seeing my boyfriend be super strong?  Why would I mind that?\"  \"Good point.\"  A smile appeared on Skylar's face.  Christen called him her boyfriend.  This relationship was officially official.    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"That was delicious Christen!\"  Skylar said, turning to his girlfriend.  \"Thank you.  I'd always wished that I could have become a chef, but it never worked.\"  She replied.  \"Sky!  Don't you think we should prepare for our show?\"  Greg interjected.  \"Yeah.  See you in a bit.\"  Skylar and Greg rushed off into the backyard of the cabin, and began to work on their show.  \"I think out muscles should be a tad bigger for this, don't you think?\"  Skylar asked.  \"I think your right.\"  Greg answered.  The two then used their flex-growth powers.  All of the sudden, a note appeared.  \"Dear Skylar and Greg.  Don't worry about people noticing the size difference.  They will believe you were always the size you grew to.\"  \"That works for me.  Less questions.\"  They both said in unison.  They made each muscle 25% bigger, and grew to a solid 7'7\".  Then, the began working on their show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne hour later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristen and Brittany heard a whistle.  They knew that this meant that their boyfriends were ready.  The two beauties walked outside and sat on some lawn furniture.  \"Hello, and welcome to the first ever 'Muscle Show'!  Featuring Skylar 'Storm' Armstrong and 'Granite' Greg Aberforth.\"  Greg yelled.  He was only wearing posing trunks, showing off every single one of his ripped, vascular muscles.  The show was about to begin.  \"First, we will need one volunteer.  Who will it be.  How about the leopard!\"  Brittany got out of her seat, and approached Greg.  \"Now miss, tell me your name.\"  \"Brittany.\"  Brittany was excited.  \"Brittany, what I want you to do is take the tape measure that I am holding in my hand, and try to circle it around my bicep.  Can you do that for me?\"  \"YES YES YES!\"  Brittany screamed.  She has been waiting for the chance to feel Greg's diamond bicep.  Greg flexed the mountainous arm, and Brittany tried to circle the tape around it.  However, the tape measure was not long enough to encircle the whole muscle.  \"How much is it?\"  \"I don't know, it won't fit.\"  \"Funny, that tape is 3 feet long.  Oh well.  It's pretty useless now.\"  Greg relaxed the muscle, shrinking it down to 30\".  Brittany then circled the tape around it, and Greg flexed, destroying the tape.  \"40\" of bicep right there.  I can guarantee you will never see an arm this big.\"  \"OR CAN YOU!\"  In the blink of an eye, Skylar landed in front of Greg, and flexed his 40\" bicep.  \"I guess you're wrong.  This cabin is only big enough for one muscle man.  Who will win?\"  Brittany sat down, and realized that this show was a mock challenge between the two strongest men in the world.  \"IT IS ON\"  Greg shouted.  He then walked over to the nearest tree, and uprooted it like a weed.  \"Beat that!\"  \"Okay,\" Skylar retorted.  He took the tree from Greg, and held it with one hand.  \"Beat that.\"  \"I think these trees are too light for me.  Where can I find something heavy enough?  I know.\"  Greg ran off at unfathomable speeds.  \"Where do you think your going.\"  Skylar chased after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 minutes later, both of them returned, carrying giant boulders 5 times larger than themselves.  \"I think lifting is out of the question.  These things were 20 miles away.  I don't want to leave the show, again.\"  Skylar said.  \"Then how do we settle this?\"  Greg asked.  \"An arm wrestle.\"  \"Perfect.\"  The two muscle behemoths sat on the ground, set their elbows on a tree stump, and began an arm wrestle.  Their biceps growing to their beautiful 40\" peaks.  After 5 minutes of intense arm wrestling, neither arm budged.  \"It seems we're equal.  Well, this is awkward.  Let's just be friends.\"  \"Okay\"  The two pumped men hugged each other, and left their performing space.  Then, Skylar walked back on.  \"Time for a posing show!  I will begin it.\"  Skylar started to pose, showing off his 40\" biceps, 32\" forearms, 100\" chest, 45\" waist, 60\" thighs, and 43\" calves.  Then, he flexed his prized possession.  His (now) 12 pack abs.  \"Would you girls like to feel the diamonds?\"  Skylar asked.  \"Okay.\"  They said.  The two pushed on the abs as hard as they could, but neither of them could dent them.  \"Hey!  Stop hogging them!\"  Greg yelled.  All of the sudden, he ran into the performing area, loaded a shotgun, and shot Skylar point blank in the abs.  The girls were horrified, until Skylar stepped away unfazed.  \"That tickled!\"  He said.  Greg laughed along.  \"I know.  I just wanted to scare them a bit.  Anyway, my turn.\"  Greg then took center, and posed for the girls.  Greg was just as built as Skylar, same measurements and everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the show, it was time for bed.  Skylar and Christen shared a room, and Greg and Brittany shared one.  \"Christen, I think we have another couple here.\"  Skylar said to his girlfriend.  \"That it does.  At least I have my big dragon.  You are so big and strong.  I do wonder, how strong is my boyfriend?\"  Christen asked.  \"Last I checked, I could bench 100 tons, but that was a long time ago.  Now, probably double that.\"  Skylar estimated.  \"That is a lot.  I love you Skylar.\"  Christen said.  \"I love you too.  Let's go to sleep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, when will your next bodybuilding show be?\"  Brittany inquired.  \"Well, my agent has not contacted me about any gigs yet, but hopefully soon.\"  Greg responded.  \"What about you Skylar?\"  Christen chimed in.  \"In one month.  Ever since Greg and I became friends, we made a pact to never compete in the same show.  I stick to Mr. Humongous and Strongman's Challenge, and Greg sticks to The Great Muscle Show and Professional Mr. Gigantic.  The one that you met me during was the Amateur Mr. Gigantic.  In fact, I met Greg during that one.  The professional version is much more competitive.  However, aside from when I beat Greg that one time, we are both undefeated.  Anyway, Mr. Humongous is in one month, and after this vacation, It'll be gym time for me.\"  \"I can't wait to come.\"  \"Me too.\"  \"Same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened for the rest of the weekend.  The 4 mostly talked, got to know each other more, and grew closer to their significant others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at Skylar's home...  \"I do wonder how much stronger I've become since I grew at the cabin.  To find out, I'll need new equipment.\"  Another note appeared.  \"Weird, this is the fourth one this week.\"  \"Dear Greg and Skylar.  I've fitted both of you with new gym equipment.  And Skylar, Greg got an identical message.  Don't worry about him not knowing.\"  RING RING RING.  Skylar's cell phone began to ring.  It was Greg.  \"Hey Greg.\"  \"Sky, I'm guessing you got the note about the equipment too.\"  \"Yep, I was about to try it out.  You want to try with me?\"  \"Can't.  Going out with Brittany.  Anyway, talk to you later.\"  \"Bye Greg.\"  Beep.  Skylar grinned and flexed a bicep.  \"Let's see what these can really do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkylar descended the staircase into his basement gym, and noticed many differences.  Instead of free weights, there were electronic machines with bars for every exercise.  There was also a new treadmill that looked that it could handle any speed.  On top of that, there was a large tube that read, \"Full Body Measurement Device and 360 Mirror\".  \"I can live with this.\"  Skylar commented.  He then changed into his workout attire, otherwise known as his running shorts and shoes.  He started on the Bench.  Instead of setting a weight, it said to set a percentage, between 1 and 100.  Skylar set it to 100, and started to bench.  It was the first time he could only get one rep in.  \"Strange.  How much weight was that?\"  Skylar looked at the screen, pushed the button that said \"Equivalent Weight\", and read the number.  500 tons.  \"Holy crap.  That's huge.  What else can I do.\"  He then walked over to the squat bar, and repeated the routine.  His 100% weight was 750 tons.  He repeated this for deadlift, curls, tricep extensions and lat pull downs.  He found his max weights were 800 tons, 400 tons, 500 tons and 400 tons respectively.  He then went to the sit up machine, set the weight to 100 tons, and just started.  His goal was to fatigue his abs.    One hour and 4000 sit ups later, his abs barely felt warmed up.  After a total of 6 hours and 24000 sit ups, Skylar felt a burn in his abs.  It took another 1.5 hours and 6000 sit ups to feel truly fatigued.  At 100 tons, it took 30000 sit ups to fatigue him.  That's why Skylar's abs are world famous.  For some reason, Skylar's abs were much stronger than the rest of his muscles.  He did not test it, but he could perform a set of 20 sit ups with the weight set to 10000 tons.  Skylar's final test was running/flying.  He knew that his top speed was the same for both running and flying, but he did not know that speed.  Setting the treadmill to 100%, Skylar ran for 10 minutes.  After getting off, he noted the speed.  Mach 1, the speed of sound.  \"I like this.  I can get used to this.\"  Skylar bragged to himself while flexing his ridiculously pumped muscles.  He stepped into the tube, and checked himself out.  \"Looking as awesome as ever Storm.  Mr. Humongous judges, say hello to the strongest man in the world.\"  He stepped out, and noticed the screen.  It read as follows:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubject:  Skylar 'Storm' Armstrong.<br>\r\nHeight:  7'7\"<br>\r\nWeight:  1 ton.<br>\r\nMuscle Hardness:  Hardest thing known to science.<br>\r\nBiceps:  42\"<br>\r\nForearms:  32\"<br>\r\nChest:  104\"<br>\r\nWaist: 45\"<br>\r\nThighs:  62\"<br>\r\nCalves:  45\"<br>\r\nAbs:  12-pack<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his measurements, it showed the max lifts he just performed.  \"Through my testing, I grew.  I think I am big enough now.\"  Skylar said to himself.  The screen changed its message to this after he said that:  \"Okay, you will stop flex-growing until you change the settings on this machine.\"  \"That works for me.  Anyway, I'm ready for my show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack began to sweat slightly from the heat that seemed to be flowing through his veins. Why did he feel so hot all of a sudden? Figuring his shirt might just be making him sweat, he pulled it up over his face to reveal his bare chest. By coincidence, he happened to be standing in front of a full length mirror, and the reflection he saw caused him to gasp in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of the flat, scrawny chest he was used to seeing whenever his shirt was off, Jack could swear he saw actual... pecs forming two identical mounds on his torso. Curiosity overcoming him, Jack reached up and rubbed his new pectorals, eventually pushing down on them. He was amazed at how soft and fluffy, yet firm they were. He managed to snap out of his daze long enough to notice that his stomach felt a little heavier too. Another quick feeldown revealed a subtle but very much present six-pack of model-like abdominals that had suddenly appeared on the young fox's belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Jack felt another jolt run through his body similar to the previous one. He began to sweat even more. What was going on? And why? However, Jack had no time to even ponder the answers before an intense swelling filled his muscles, nearly causing him to double over in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stared at his reflection in shock. Was it... growing? No, that was impossible, it took years of working out at the gym to get your muscles up to a big enough size... at least, that's what he thought until his pecs bloated out 4 inches in front of his faces, not even stopping there before reaching the size of basketballs and beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was in such shock that he didn't even notice his arms until they started pushing up against his sides. He raised up the right one, giving an involuntary flex of the car tire sized monster. Jack wanted to say something about this, but it was so amazing he was at a loss for words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack wasn't even sure how much time passed, but after a while he began to cool down and the growth slowed to a stop. Though he didn't remember going down, Jack found himself on his knees, panting from exhaustion. Slowly but surely, he stood up, trying his best to keep calm as he turned back to the mirror.<br>\r\nAll thoughts of staying calm were gone once he saw his reflection. He was HUGE! Not just bodybuilder huge or even powerlifter huge, but more like Hercules or Greek god type of insane strength. He had to be at least 8 feet and 700 pounds of muscle by what he could guess. His pecs were so huge they were touching his chin, and the giant valley in between them could probably crush a boulder. Speaking of boulders, that was a good estimate for how big his biceps were, considering he was having trouble even lowering them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack could only grin as the heat and exhaustion was replaced by sheer power and adrenaline. He was probably - no, he WAS - the most powerful creature on the planet. Nothing could stop him. His muscles yearned to be used, to show off their true power. But he still needed to figure out just what was going on.<br>\r\nJack figured that a walk would help him clear his thoughts and figure out the source of this incredible act. By some insane miracle, his pants had managed not to burst off of the rippling calf muscles beneath them, but they were still very small and restricting. Jack picked up his shirt, which was now only as big as his two paws put together, and slipped it back over his head. It took several minutes to squeeze on, and it didn't even cover up his stomach at all, but it was the best he could do for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown confidence running through him, Jack ducked under the doorway and out into the world, wondering what he could do with his new power and, most importantly, why and how he had it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jack took a deep breath and inflated his already massive chest. With his new look, it was going to be a great day. He could feel it. As he took his first step out of the house, he heard a large thump where he place his foot down. When he lifted it, Jack noticed a foot-shaped indentation in the concrete! Jack was amazed by it but he just shrugged at it as if it was nothing and said to himself, \"I guess I don't know my own strength.\" He then walked to the city as if nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack loved the attention he was getting as he walked through the streets. People's mouths literally dropped as they saw a giant fox strolling down without a care in the world. Jack couldn't help but put a smirk on his face. His ears perked up as he looked over a construction site. He saw some bulldogs standing near some demoliton machines looking distressed. \"What do you mean the machines aren't working?\" Said one bulldog. \"I mean they're not working,\" Said the other. \"I tried starting all of them but they're not moving!\" \"This is ridiculous!\" Said the first bulldog. \"We won't get paid if we don't get this done today! What are we going to do?\" Jack looked down at his fist and involuntarily thickened his bicep. Time to see what those muscles can do. Jack thumped to the bulldogs' position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you guys need some help?\" Asked Jack in a new, deep voice. The bulldogs looked up to see a giant fox that looked like he wanted to eat them. They were scared at the sight of him. They were as scared as they were envious of his strength. \"Umm...We're having trouble starting our machines here,\" Said one bulldog. \"If we don't tear this building down, we're not going to get paid.\" Jack instantly knew what to do. He cracked his knuckles and neck and said, \"Leave it to me.\" Before the bulldogs could ask what he was planning, Jack ran in lightning speeds towards the building. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack clenched his fist while running and slammed against the base of the building. A huge chunk of it went flying from Jack's position. Both he and bulldogs were amazed. After seeing how much strength he had, Jack pumped himself with excitement and began to hit faster and harder. The building began to tilt as its support thinned within less than a minute. Jack gave it the final blow and the building came tumbling down towards the bulldogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bulldogs were too scared to move.They couldn't move out of way in time if they could. Jack sprinted once more and, without thinking, he grabbed them and raced to the street. They both watched as the building came tumbling down. \"Thanks,\" Said one bulldog. \"We owe ya.\" Jack grinned and said,\"Don't mention it. Sorry I couldn't be more careful.\" \"That was amazing,\" Said the other bulldog. \"Where did you come from and where did you get muscles like that?\" Jack was reluctant to lie but he didn't know what else to do. \"I just work out a lot.\" He simply implied. \"Well, it looks like you've been working out for several years!\" Jack flexed a giant and veiny bicep and said, \"Thanks.\" </span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Jack is a 16 year old fox anthro that is nerdy and is constantly picked on by everyone. But when a glowing ball of power arrives at his doorstep, a lot can happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n- No sex.<br>\r\n- No bisexual or homosexual characters.<br>\r\n- Keep it pretty much all muscle growth. No weight gain or TG.<br>\r\n- I don't want Jack to go all psycho, so Jack can't turn evil or corrupt. He's a nice guy.<br>\r\n- No macro, keep Jack's size in a somewhat reasonable range (for muscle growth, anyways).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease add on! 300 GPs for your first addition!</td>",
