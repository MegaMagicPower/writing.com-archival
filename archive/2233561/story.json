She didn't want to think about the chill breeze that was blowing across her subtle cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up, made her groan. Feeling her bust move, threatening to fall out of her clothes.

Her face coloured in, as if by a child with a fetish for the gaudy and garish. Even her bust had a dusting of make-up to enhance the shadows, and make her look bustier. She also felt the padding beneath her, that was meant to give her the illusion of further curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroaning and shaking her head. She wondered how to end this nightmare.
