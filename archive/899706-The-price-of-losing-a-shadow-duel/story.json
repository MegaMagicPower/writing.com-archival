Yugi attacks Tea's mysticla elf but she uses wobaku and Yugi ends his turn.  Now tea uses change of heart and she has both monsters on her side of the feild and attack resulting in 3300 life points left.  Yugi looses terribly to Tea!  Now Yugi is in a soul card and Tea is holding him in her hands.  \"Now Yugi, for the past years you have thought that I was the worst duelist ever but I have beaten the king of games now haven't I.

The smell of her sweat permiated the card's borders and yugi caughed and gagged whithin the confines of his soul card.

She sat on her couch, at home. \"I bet it smells pretty bad down there, eh Yugi\" she giggled and Yugi heard a rumble come from above him. \"Well its about to get much worse!\" She lifted her cheek off the couch, and scruched her face in concentration... then suddenly 'PFFFFFFT!' she ripped a huge fart on the card. It smelt so bad that it went through the card and Yugi  almost vommited. \"I hope you smelt that Yugi, cause this is your punishment for always underestimating me!\" Though Tea wasnt done, her cheek was still lifted, she screwed up her face and Yugi heard it coming, he blocked his nose then Tea ripped an even bigger fart 'PFFFFPPPHT!'

You had no idea first off that Mokie had been practicing a lot, and also that he had arranged another sort of match. You had made a good start, but a chain of lucky moves, it had to be luck, on Mokuba's part had put you in a tough spot. The little boy grinned as he announced his move. \"And to finish off, I attack your life points directly with Armored Lizard!\" Immediatly you glance to your spells and traps, but there's nothing. The brat got you cornered just right. You have no choice but to sigh as you see your life points plummet to zero. You wave your hand as you look at the younger Kaiba brother. \"Yeah yeah, you got me, no need to rub it in.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMokuba crosses his arms as your lifepoints touch zero, and immediatly a shadow surrounds you. \"Oh, I need to rub something in.\" Mokuba laughs as he holds out his hand. To your absolute disbelief the shadow swallows you up, and in a flash you find yourself trapped within a card, that's the only explination. You've seen it happen before, and it's very much like you feared it would be. Taking the card in hand, Mokuba grins at you, before bringing the card right up to his jeans, and letting a fart in your face. \"How's that Joey, stinks huh? I stuffed myself on beans and eggs before the duel, your gonna spend all of eternity smelling my farts, cool huh?\" Mokuba laughs as he sticks the card in his back pocket, relaxing in his chair as he continues to casually torture you with his awful farts. You never imagined the kid could have gas this bad, it's the worst thing you've ever smelled in your life, and theres no end to it! Finally, after a half hour of awful little boy farts, Mokuba pulls you back out with a smile. \"Man you smell now Joey, I should stick you up my butt, that's where it smells like you belong.\" He laughs again as he sets you down on the table. \"Now what to do...\"</span></div></div>",

Before Joey could even attempt to voice any kind of sarcastic thanks Mokuba clarified \u201cbut you will be coming out of it\u201d. \u201cNormally I wouldn\u2019t do this to a card, but you\u2019re a completely worthless one and thank\u2019s to the shadow magic you\u2019ll come out fine, well in one piece at least, you probably won\u2019t enjoy it very much\u201d Mokuba explained as he licked his lips. He opened his mouth wide before suddenly closing it, \u201cno I can\u2019t eat you like this\u201d Mokuba said solemnly. But before Joey could breathe a sigh of relief Mokuba began to fold the card in half. As the card bent Joey groaned in pain and Mokuba merely grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s better, now you\u2019re a good size\u201d he told the transformed blonde as he held the card to his open mouth. Lines of saliba dripped down and his hot breath washed over the card. Without a second thought Mokuba popped the card in his mouth and began to swirl it around his mouth, coating it in drool for a smoother ride down. Despite lacking a body Joey could feel the spittle as if it was soaking his skin and smell the foul air rising from Mokuba\u2019s gut. His fun had and his victim properly lubricated, Mokuba tilted his head back and sent the crumpled card containing Joey Wheelers essence to the back of his throat, \u201cGULP\u201d. With a silent scream the Joey card was pulled down Mokuba\u2019s oesophagus disappearing beneath the raven haired kids neckline before landing with a splash in his belly. Mokuba paused, before relasing a hearty belch, the crass noise seemd quite unfitting for his slim build and usual demear. He patted his gut and sighed, \u201cHope you have fun Joey, I\u2019ll see ya in a few hours\u201d and with that statement Mokuba set off.</span></div></div>",

While you didn't like his harsh tone you were quite glad he was at least helping you. As before Seto activated his set trap and countered your own, as well as destroying your Armored Lizard. With no other option you simply slooped back and allowed your brother to take his turn. Seto had excluded many of his strongest monsters from his deck, as this was only to help your train for your tournament debut, but still he was leading by 700 life points. As your turn began, Seto simply set a facedown card, a glimmer of hope filled your eyes. You were fairly certain that Seto saw it, though he remained stoic, and you could not hide your slight grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll play the spell card, Shadow Spectrum!\" Immediatly your brothers eyes widened in shock, he had apparently never heard of the card. A great roar filled the air as each of your monsters gained a 2000 ATK bonus, and the air began to darken. At first you simply thought it a part of the card effect but soon the darkness became all too family, you were in a Shadow Duel! With a low growl Seto looked down upon you with an unblinking stare. \"Mokuba, what have you done?!\" Shaking your head slightly you began a tad unnerved. \"They told me it was just a rare card... I didn't think it would do anything like this...\" While the thought of defeating your own brother in a Shadow Duel was dishearting you knew you had a chance to win. With no thought for his set card you ordered an all out attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeto's monsters were cut down instantly by the might of your boosted creatures, and his life points dwindeled. As they hit zero Seto collapsed to a knee. Dark energy began to swirl around your brother as he coughed, and the shadows began to retract. Light pierced the great darkness at last and it melted into the earth once more, yet now you were all alone. Laying on the floor across from you was what appeared to be a Duel Monsters card, identical to the one Pegasus once trapped you withen. However the face it now bore was none other than that of Seto!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a few moments you simply stare at the card in amazement. Afterall Seto has protected you for as long as you could remember, no one cared more for him than you did. However as you plucked up the thin piece of paper that was your brother your mind began to wander. In it's eye you could see back to Death-T and the cruel punishment which Yugi had saved you from. Seto, your own brother, had left you to be tortured in there. Seeing your brothers face always aleviated your anger yet now he was only a card. Years of repressed resentment began to well to the surface, and your grin grew larger. Opening your fingers you let Seto tumble back to the steel floor, he seemed to fall quite quickly for a card, and turned your back. Removing the strap from your duel disc you sat down to relax a while. The card fully vanished beneath your bottom as you set your equipment aside to rest. Seto had done a lot for you but you still owed him for Death-T. While you couldn't generate holographic beasts to torment him you were certain that he would be equally displeased by this choice. A slight warmth continually emited from the card which felt very pleasant. Smiling you softly spoke, unsure if he could really even hear you. \"Thinks a lot big brother, your even better than a heated seat.\" Quite relaxed by the warmth you softly wiggled on top of him as you pondered the best course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about fifteen minutes you grew rather bored if sitting in the same place and finally lifted from the card. From your own experience within a card you knew that Seto had no shortage of air but you would still have made it quite stuffy; he would be greatful for the relief. The entire matter was a bit strange to you. On one side you felt little real guilt from this, it felt very much like it was simply a peace of paper; not your brother, yet you also didn't take as much satisfaction as you could. Aside from the warmth you recieved no sort of reaction from the card, torturing him was kind of boring! Suddenly a moment of inspiration arose and you scooped up the card in a rush. As you had won a Shadow Duel it was your privalige to keep Seto however you liked. You had turned him into a card by accident, probably a momentary though of what Pegasus did to you, but it was your right to alter that. Rather than turn him back however you decided that it would be better to make him capable of talking from the card, that would make your games a whole lot more interesting.</span></div></div>",
