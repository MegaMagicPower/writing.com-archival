However, His high intelligence combined with increased strengths from his intense training allows him to be on par with other superheroes. Outsmarting Villains and Punching the thug's face at the same time [or the other way around]. However as smart as he is his capabilities is still limited which might be his big weakness against the villains<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Martial arts:</b> Being an apprentice of the ancient martial arts school The protagonist had learned the way of the Ki [or Chi, depend on localization] Combining with arts of kung-fu to increase their capabilities. From leaping a wall in a single jump, Shattering rocks with his palm, or even mending his wound with his Ki. However, due to spending so much time practicing ancient arts, he will have problems adapting with the current world's technologies.</span></div></div>",
