The two had been best friends ever since Greg moved in next door 5 years ago. Almost right away they both found they were interested in practically the same things, writing, video games, and baseball. Greg was a good looking guy at 5' 8\" with a lean enough build and shoulder length strawberry blond hair that had an annoying habit of falling over his face. In comparison, Chris was a little more homely with short brown hair and brown eyes.<br>\r\n\"Damn straight man. Say, where's your car?\"<br>\r\n\"Mom backed into it this morning trying as she was leaving so she had me take it to the shop.\"<br>\r\n\"Typical\" Greg laughed. \"Your mom's always in such a hurry that she has tunnel vision.\"<br>\r\n\"You're telling me.\u201d Chris laughed and ran smack into Greg who had come to a stop in the middle of the sidewalk. \u201cWhat the hell dude, move!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cCheck it out Chris!\u201d They were now standing in front of two massive iron gates that closed off a road that lead to a huge mansion. It was known locally as the Devlin Mansion. It was built over a hundred years ago by Augustus Devlin, one of the founders of the town, for his wife and five sons. Unfortunately, shortly after completion, Augustus and four of his sons died in a shipwreck that left his wife almost penniless with a large house and a two year old son named Cloyster to take care of. She shut the two of them inside the mansion and was not seen again till her death almost 80 years later. Her son was rumored to be into some weird voodoo like rituals meant to make her live forever but instead ended up poisoning her with one of his \u201ctonics\u201d. When he died a few years later the mansion was boarded up and had quickly fallen into a sorry state on neglect. Greg pointed to a large sign that now hung on the gates.<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like they\u2019re finally gonna tear this place down.\u201d He said.<br>\r\n\u201cBought time\u201d Chris replied as he tried to push Greg along. \u201cNow come on man, I wanna get home.\u201d<br>\r\nAs he pushed, Greg suddenly shifted his weight, causing Chris to collapse onto the ground, spilling his stuff everywhere.<br>\r\n\u201cDammit man! Look what you made me do!\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did I do?\u201d Greg said, feigning innocence.<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re an asshole, you know that?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe one and only.\u201d Greg gave a little bow and started walking off.<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Chris yelled after him.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to your place; I can\u2019t wait for slow pokes like you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFuck you!\u201d Chris scrambled to gather his stuff when a glint of light caught his eye. Picking it up he saw it was a pen. It looked old and expensive with sliver inlays in the shape of a dragon and several teardrop sapphires. But it was what was engraved on the side that made Chris do a double take. \u201cHey man wait up, take a look at this.\u201d Chris called out as he hurried after his friend.<br>\r\n\tBy the time he caught up to him, Greg was already at Chris\u2019s house.<br>\r\n\u201cTook you long enough.\u201d Greg chided, making a playful swat at Chris.<br>\r\n\u201cHa ha, so funny. Seriously though man look at what I found.\u201d With a theatrical flourish, Chris displayed the pen. \u201cAnd look at what it says on the side, \u2018Property of Cloyster Devlin\u2019.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cNo shit man? That\u2019s so cool!\u201d Greg said as Chris led the way inside and then upstairs to his bedroom. \u201cLooks like it\u2019s worth something.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d sell it. It\u2019s really cool.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYou think it still works?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOnly one way to find out.\u201d Chris pulled a sheet of paper out of his binder. \u201cWhat should I write?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThe fuck should I know? Write whatever the hell you want.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously man.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cFine write out a goal, your fondest wish.\u201d<br>\r\nChris thought for a second then began to write.</span></div></div>",
