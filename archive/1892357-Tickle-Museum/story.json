( Mrs. Frezno's group went a little bit behind yours. The rest of your group decides to join Mrs. Frezno's group. It is only you and Miss Morris left. \"We have now reached the interactive portion of our tour!\" Jamee says with a smile. \"What?!\" you and Miss Morris say at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't you read the brocheure?\" she says. \"Tours end with an interactive portion! One of you will tickle the other!\" she says with a small giggle. \"Please pick a number between one and twenty.\" <br>\r\n\"Fifteen!\" you say<br>\r\n\"Ten!\" says Miss Morris.<br>\r\n\"Miss Morris, you have chosen the closest number. You are the one to be tickled!\" says Jamee with a giggle. \"Please step inside this room. To be prepped.

When it was announced weeks before the were moans and curses heard, anticipating another boring day out looking for strange plants or being lectured about some odd technical equipment. What was strange about this time was that the teachers kept the location as a secret. They just announced that it would be \"mostly indoors\". In the days before the event the rumors about the whereabouts grew wild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarly in the morning your class met at the gates of the school. It consisted of 18 girls and 13 boys, eleven to thirteen years of age. The tension rose when the bus left, but still the two attending teachers and the bus driver knew the direction. In the first row the teacher for history, a charming male in his early forties, and the teacher for biology, a young and energetical girl in her late twenties, were chatting. Just one row before you Cheyenne was talking to her friend. She liked to be the center of attention. Her parents had money and equipped her with stylish clothes and all sorts of gadgets. She did cheerleading and dancing. Her body already had the shapes of a young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 45 minutes, the bus stopped before an old warehouse on the outskirts. A big sign above the entrance said \"Tickle Museum\" and outlined that it was a moving exposition which would go from town to town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to shake with excitement. Tickling had become a secret passion for you. Only your best friends in the class know this. One of them passes by and shoots you a knowing glance. Upon entering the museum..</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The group waited at the entrance until one of the teachers waived them through the gates. At the passage to the first room a beautiful tall woman in black clothes, not older than maybe thirty years, silently waited for them. When the class had assembled the woman spoke. \"Welcome to the Tickle Museum and Exhibition Center. My name is Cathy. I am sure that all of you, or at least most of you, will consider this later to have been a great choice for a field trip. You will learn by multimedia and hands-on experience how body, mind and skin react to certain actions and situations. You will see and find out how to block out ticklishness to a certain level, and on the other hand to enhance it. In this first part I will lead you through the part which will explain the basics and the background of tickling. Later on we will split up the group when we move on through the museum. We will travel back in time and tour around the globe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman went to the center of the room and started to explain the theory of ticklishness. She outlined the typical reactions of human beings and even some animals, like shrieking, laughing, withdrawal, goosebumps or sudden spasm of the body when exposed to the physical type of tickling of either Knismesis or Gargalesis. The former was described as a light teasing of the skin, while the latter would be a firmer, sometimes close to being painful pressing on sensitive parts of the body. Parts of a human brain were displayed in oversized plastic models, where scientists suspected the tickling would be concluded from the signals of the nerves. Tickling by Gargalesis was limited to human beings and other primates. Today scientists assume that the cerebellum was the main element in the brain to interpret tickling as such, supported by the Somatosensotory Cortex <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the class started to pay less attention and to chat. Sensing this, Cathy moved to a multimedia device which had two large vertical screens about the size of a human being next to each other. Assembling the class in front of the screens she switched the device on. On one screen appeared a young white man in his early twenties. The other one started with an asian looking woman who was slightly older. Each device had a control which one of the kids got into his hands. Cathy explained that the kids had three chances to bet where on their body the persons would be ticklish. If they pointed at maybe the feet, a closeup fifteen second video would play where that part of the body was tickled, followed by another fifteen seconds where the person would tell later how it felt.</span></div></div>",
