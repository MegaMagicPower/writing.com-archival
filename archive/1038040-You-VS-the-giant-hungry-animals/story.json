You realize he wants to eat you, so you jump from your twig back to the leaf. The frog pursues you in hope of eating you and digesting you quickly. You know you take on the frog by yourself, but you don't know where to go. You quickly jump down into the swamp water and hold your breath as long as you can, hoping the frog will just leave you alone. You can hold your breath for a very long time, but it really gets put to the test when the frog doesn't go away. You run out of breath and resurface. To your advantage the frog has turned around, and you have time to catch your breath. You wonder what has happened to you and why you are only one inch tall. At that moment, you set out on a journey to get back to your normal size before something either eats you or even kills you. Where do you from here?</span></div></div>",

So you stick your head out of the water a bit to make sure the frog still has its back turned towards you. Then you leap out of the water and onto the frog's back. The frog isn't too happy about this and tries to shake you off by jumping wildly all over the place. You do your best to try and keep your grip on the frog, but it is difficult to do because of how slimey the frog's skin is. The two of are on land when the frog finally shakes you off. You go flying through the air and land on the ground with a hard thud. Dazed, you quickly sit up and see the frog stareing at you. It hadn't forgotten that it wanted to eat you, and you watch frozen in fear as the frog opens its moutn and shoots its long sticky tongue out at you. Then tongue hits you in the chest, and before you can do anything the tongue pulls you into the hungry frog's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the mouth you become drenched from head to toe in the frog's sticky saliva. You struggle as much as you can, but you now it's in vain, you're done for now. You wonder why the frog hasn't swallowed you yet though. It was probably savoring your flavor as the tongue licked and wraped around you. The frog continues to savor your delicious flavor for several minutes. Then the throat muscles flex and you scream as, like a great many insects before, the frog easily swallows you whole. The muscles slowly massage you down the short esophagus and into the stomach, which opens up to accept you as food. Inside the cramped stomach you continue your futile struggles, but you barely move since the stomach is so cramped and you're drenched in the frog's sticky saliva. Eventually, you pass out from exhaustion just as the digestive jucies begin to flow.</span></div></div>",

You do realize that you had been shrunken to an inch tall for some reason but the trees in the area were so big that they would make you look like you were an inch tall even if you were normal-sized. You then hear shaking and look up to see several dragonflies fly overhead. From the looks of it they were as big as aircraft carriers. You paddle ferociously as you see fish swimming under head and you definitely don't want to end up as a meal. But to your surprise, it isn't just fish that are swimming under the water but trilobites as well. \"Trilobites?\" you ask. \"Those have been extinct for millions of years. \"Just where am...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you gasp because you see a continent-sized skeleton of what looked like a plesiosaurus in the water and from the looks of it, it was fresh and had just finished rotting. That made you realize something. Not only were you shrunk to an inch tall in a swamp but you were shrunk to an inch tall in a swamp that seemed to be leftover from the prehistoric past. You were now visibly afraid because where there was one plesiosaurus corpse, there were likely to be actual dinosaurs nearby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour suspicions were about to be confirmed because you soon hear the sound of thunderous stomping and realize that there is in fact a dinosaur nearby and a rather inhumanly large one, even if you were only an inch tall.

You are pushed under the stomach slime and flinch, expecting to be broken down by the acid, but for some strange reason, the stomach acid has no effect on you. It was just like in the frog. Though, it could be explained that hippopotami are herbivores, but then you remember that hippos sometimes do actually eat me. But then you gag and hold your neck and decide to swim up. You may not be in any danger of being digested by the hippo's gastrointestinal slime, but you could still drown in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou surface from the slime and then take a deep breath. But then you regret it and cough loudly. \"Ugh.\" You groan. There was no way around it. It stunk in the hippo's belly. It smelled worse than any sewer. The smell burns your nose and lungs and you cough intensely. However, you have worse problems because the hippo's movements in the water were making the stomach shake and the juice was forming waves. You realize that you couldn't float forever in the stomach slime and look around for anything to rest upon. However, that's easier said than done because it's pitch dark in the hippo's gut and you can't even see your own hand in front of your face. You keep on moving through the gastric juices until you finally come across a half digested mushroom and climb atop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, the hippopotamus moves through the water and climbs up onto shore, unaware that she had swallowed you. The gluttonous giant grunts as she begins to eat a few pieces of grass. The bits of grass plop into the stomach and some of them land on top of you, nearly burying you and pushing you back into the stomach juices. The hippo then walks by a fellow female hippo and they grunt to each other. You hear the grunting and you could almost swear that the hippo was having a conversation but you couldn't understand animal talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you remember, you're inside a hippo's big, fat and smelly stomach. You needed to find some way to get out of here, but how? You didn't really like your options. Perhaps you could wait for the hippo to fall asleep and climb up the throat and leave out her mouth or nose or maybe her ear. But before you could think about what move to make next, the hippopotamus that swallowed you...</span></div></div>",

You then hear a grunting sound and look forward to see that the creature whose back you were standing on was an enormous hippopotamus who was chewing on grass that was floating in the water. You were less than an ant to this titanic beast and you knew it and stepped back out of fear. Right behind you, there is an eruption of bubbles in the water right in front of the hippo's massive behind that was hundreds of times bigger than you. You shiver because you remembered that hippopotami were one of the most hostile animals in Africa and were notoriously territorial.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide that it was too dangerous to be near the hippo's rear end so you walk on the hippo's back as the creature is too busy with its meal to notice you. The hippo snorts a few times and then grunts in curiosity. The beast felt you stepping closer and closer to its head. The hippo turned and you had to hide behind the massive beast's head. You definitely didn't want to be spotted by a hippopotamus. Then you realize something. \"What am I worried about. I'm less than the size of an insect to that hippopotamus. It would never see me and even if it did, it's an herbivore. What do I have to...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you remember something. Hippos will eat carrion and insects if there's no other option for food. They were technically herbivorous but on rare occasions they will eat meat. You could just imagine the hippopotamus looking down on you and licking its lips. You definitely did not want to end up in a fat titan's belly. Suddenly, you feel your feet getting wet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look ahead and scream because the hippo's butt is underwater and its back is following. You were going to end up in the water again and with such a huge animal moving about in the river, the motions would push you around and you'd risk drowning or being torn apart. In desperation you further climb the hippo's neck and head. The hippo grunts and shakes its head and you yell as you fall down and slide right down the hippo's face, between its eyes and on the tip of its nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo grunts and then focuses its beady eyes on you and then the eyes pop out in surprise. You shiver as you wonder what the hippo will do next. Then the hippo does something that really startles you; it speaks. \"A 1/4 an inch high human? I haven't seen a creature this small in years.\" The hippo spoke in a surprising feminine yet still somewhat deep voice. It was a girl hippo. \"Y-Y-You can talk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo decides to walk out of the water so she can get a good look at you. As she walks onto the dry land you are shocked as she appears to be as tall as the trees, if not taller. This was no ordinary hippo. She stood 20 feet high, meaning that she would be much bigger than you even if you weren't shrunken. But at 1/4 of an inch tall, you were barely more than a microbe to this gargantuan beast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo stares down at you as you shiver. \"I am Hippolyta,\" said the hippopotamus. \"The hippo queen.\"</span></div></div>",

The skunk started backing up, sweeping you off your feet.

Getting your mouth coated in spray would keep almost anything mouth closed for at least ten minutes if the creature was big, but for you, it was just a treat for your services, and a Que to sit back and sniff up all of the stink that a skunk produces. After being sprayed, the skunk pulled it's glands out of your mouth, preparing to rest them under your nose, but when you noticed your hand was loose, you decided to make the skunk toy with you some more first before delivering the killer blow. You got loose and out from under the skunk, running to another wall. The skunk quickly jumped after you, leaving you Cornered and at the skunk's mercy. \"I was just gunna make you smell what little spray remained from your mouth for a while\" said the skunk \"but now...\".

With still twenty-five minutes left on the clock, the skunk flipped you onto your back and sat down on your face, letting you only smell the ungodly stench of the spray and the putrid air from its hole, forcing you to sit still, silently sniffing and thinking of the consequences of running.</span></div></div>",

With the skunk's butthole basically inside your mouth, you felt the heat from a fresh turd entering you mouth. After a few minutes, the shit started to pile up in your mouth, the skunk getting off. \"eat it, loudly, I want to hear chewing\". Obeying the skunk, you happily started munching on your 'food', sucking out anything liquidy as well as getting a good taste of the skunk stool. After five minutes of chewing and swallowing to the skunk's satisfaction, the skunk laughs at you. \"Heheh, if you think eating my shit stinks, wait until you're wearing it. But first, suck on this, don't swallow!\". The skunk once again lowers down, you opening your mouth for it. The skunk let's a good sized log slide out before getting up again. \"Now we start the fun\" said the skunk as you greedily sucked up the flavour from his 'gift'. The skunk hovered over your head as it started to squeeze out a new load much bigger than what rested in your mouth. You saw the skunk's anal glands shoot out with the poop, spraying it all over as it slides out. The turd fell out, landing right on your face from nose to neck. You sat the, sucking on one turd, and sniffing another spray coated turd while the skunk laughed. The skunk re-adjusted again and again, covering you from nose to toe in sprayed shit until you could no longer move. The skunk got a devious look, saying \"I don't think that on your face is fresh enough\". Staying in character, your eyes grew in fear and sorrow as the skunk wiped the shit from your face, only to turnn around and start replacing it with a newly sprayed, fresh turd, forming a very wet mound over your nose. With a smirk, the skunk got up and left, satisfied with its work. As you realized you were actually stuck, you just sat there, sucking on shit, while sniffing the stink from a fresh, sprayed, and left to rot on your nose. Someone will get you soon, just enjoy the pure stink.

You scream and try to swim but the seaweed tangles you and it becomes a chore just to stay afloat under all this mess. By the time that you finally manage to pull yourself free of the seaweed, you are halfway into the manatee's throat.

It's so dark that you can't even see your hand in front of your face and the smell of half-digested seaweed fills the air. The raft of seaweed you're standing on begins to break down and you fall into the stomach juice. However, for some reason, you aren't digested. Probably has to do with the fact that manatees are mostly herbivores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment a large belch fills the air and you are reminded of your horrifying predicament.

He gazes at you for a moment longer then turns his head towards his mate. an unspoken conversation seemed to take place between the two, she must have told him how he got there for he seemed to shake his head in frustration and let out a soft sigh. He turned to look down at you again, and taking a step forward he leaned his muzzle down towards your little body, and opens his mouth.</span></div></div>",

It had been a long time since he had eaten something that had filled his hungry stomach so much and, of course, even if you had not been a match for him, it was the first time since he was taken to the zoo that he had managed to \"hunt\" a living prey. Normally, he would have torn you to pieces with his sharp teeth and devoured your guts, but you're the first prey he had seen in years. He don\u2019t want to share you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou settle in his soft stomach and think.You are an inch tall and you have been swallowed alive by a lion. And for some strange reason, its gastric juices don't affect you. Look on the bright side: his belly is quite comfortable and you will also have food and water that will be provided by the same lion. Of course it would only be water and raw meat, chewed and full of saliva, but it is always healthier than McDonald's burgers, right?. Besides... here you will be very safe. After all, is a lion! Who would mess with him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven if, on second thought, being trapped in the stomach of a predator is not so bad there is a problem: the air. While you were pondering, the lion had been burping the gas he accidentally swallowed. That means less oxygen for you! You panic and desperately seek a way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lion, after circling for a few minutes, looking for more of those strange but delicious morsels, yawned, showing his big, sharp teeth. His favorite time of day had come: time to take a nap and digest his food quietly. When he wakes up, his stomach would be empty again, and that would be the perfect excuse to hunt more snacks such as the one that now was (supposedly) digesting in his belly. He walks up to his lair and lazily lies down slowly next to his mate, his stomach swinging with each step. The lioness looks surprised by the size of his belly and sniffs and licks it a few times before falling asleep again. The lion burps one last time, licks his lips and sleeps, enjoying the squirming of the little animal inside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to open the sphincter you came from and go up the esophagus. Now that he's asleep, it is very easy. His mouth is open, so you get away without problems. Now you need to find a safe place. If the lion wakes up, he\u2019d probably swallow you again. But if the lioness does, you would be ripped apart!</span></div></div>",

You are gently flattened against his soft palate as his tongue undulates beneath you, taking in your flavor. He is taking his time this go-around, which surprises you. A low rumbling emanates from his throat - it might've been his stomach grumbling, but strangely enough it sounded almost like a purr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlick with lion saliva, you slide down the tongue head-first into the open throat. The lion's jaws open just a crack, allowing light to refract against his pink uvula and the red flesh of his throat, before it seals around you in a powerful swallow. You glide down the warm, constricting tube, enjoying the sensation of pressure all around your body, before you are pushed through a tight sphincter and tumble into the belly of the lion for the second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is still as warm and cozy as ever inside, though air seems both stale and scarce, as it did before.

It relentlessly continues to blow until you can hold on no longer and let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once you feel yourself being pulled out of the crack by the invisible arms of the wind and starting to fall. The falling does not last though, as apparently the wind is so strong and you are so small that it slows you down, maybe even lifts you a little. You feel a sense of vertigo as your world is turned upside-down several times and you lose all sense of direction as the wind blows you about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt all comes to an end quickly though, as the wind dies down and you really begin to fall.

It looks sturdy enough, so you go over to it and look down to see if it reaches the bottom. Lucky for you, you can see the vine sticking out from bottom of the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll things are clear for go, so go you do. Climbing down the vine is tiresome as you need to keep a continuous grip on it all the time except when it curves at which point you can lean into the vine for rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the climb down, you can't help but surveying the den from where you are. You can see that after the wall rises again at the other end of the pit that a grassy area stretches on for a bit before a small pond comes to view. Beyond the pond you can see the rocky cliff-like area housing the caves where the bears sleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continue down the vine, a problem arises. You weren't decieved when you saw the vine lying on the floor of the pit, but you failed to notice that it was a parallel vine which extended to the bottom and not yours. At the end of your line, so to speak, you only saw one way to get further down outside of some lethal skydiving. The only way you can see is to somehow swing or jump to the other vine from the end of your own. So,you gather your courage and start to give the thin elastic end of the vine some momentum. It swings back and forth, closer and closer to the other vine before get so close you can almost touch it, at that point you make the jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wind rushes by you and the whole thing is over in an instant, but you caught it all in your eyes.  As you let go of the vine you were in free-fall for a second, you flew across the tiny gap and began to doubt your plan, but you had no time to think before colliding with the other vine. You didn't immediately catch hold of the vine, but after a short and nerve-wrackIng slide down it, you got a good grip on one of the  leaflets sprouting from the vine. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter catching your breath you continued to climb the rest of the way down uneventfully. Your next mission now is to find a way up the smaller wall across the pit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're sure you could probably find another vine or something to climb up the wall, but looking around you, you see the pit extending far to each side. Perhaps there is a ramp on one end that you can just walk up?</span></div></div>",

You have no idea what to do: behind you, the pussy lips are firmly shut, condemning any hope to escape. In front of you, the huge gallery that the vagina is at your size extends into infinite darkness. You have only two options: stay here or explore inward, and find well, at best a potential other exit, otherwise anything useful to survive.<br>\r\nHonestly, after this whole high-speed chase, you are absolutely exhausted, starving and thirsting. And in a way, this place is not that worst. Outside, there are only the wild and hungry predators waiting for you, whereas in there, you are relatively safe, even from the hippo which at less can\u2019t eat you now. Besides, as the part of the anatomy designed to receive the male\u2019s genitals, the vagina is probably the only entree in a beast that is not per se dangerous. Of course, there is still the risk that inopportune vaginal contractions crushed you, but seriously, you don\u2019t see how a tiny speck like you could arouse her. For the first time, you can sit and take a rest, enjoying the soothing melody of her organic sounds: heartbeat, breath and digestive noises, the latter sounding dangerously close but inoffensive from where you are.<br>\r\nYou notice small pools of pussy juices bathing the floor next to you. You plunge your hand in one and note that some of the liquid stick to your hand because of its viscosity. You bring the juices to your mouth to get a taste, but spit it out immediately. This thing is awfully salty you think; there is no way to sustain on this. But you need to find water uppermost, food in the second time. If only you had the jawbone of a carnivore, the whole place would be like an open buffet, with blood and meat at will to satiate; and you wouldn\u2019t mind to scorch a little this devilish beast. But you must do with the teeth you have. You think it\u2019s time to hit the road again, and seek for whatever lies in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom outside, the hippo was looking for you attentively in the area. She finds it suspiciously surprising that you could disappear just like that, in a flash. But suddenly, she feels a strange tickle very low in her body, in her \u2026 privates!! What the f\u2026 was the bug doing in there. She supposes this darn little speck couldn\u2019t flee her, so it found shelter inside her body, in the safer place it could unearth (or rather, unflesh). Not daft, but it underestimates her control upon her own body. For many years, since she\u2019s in age to reproduce, she has always refused to let her dominated and possessed by one of these dumb male hippos. So, for lack of cock from her fellows, she managed to pass her heats by clenching her cunt on itself. After months of training, she had acquired a good control of her vaginal muscles, so that a good session of auto-clenching could easily substitute for the quick mating by egoist males only interested by ejaculation and insemination. Besides, even out of heat, she likes to entertain herself in the evening, before to sleep, and thus she trained assiduously this part of her anatomy.  Probably a human who would try to put his hand inside her would have it grinded, so you guess for something tiny like you. This little bug will learn at its expenses that her whole body is made of fat and muscle, and her vagina is no exception; she smiles in a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour steps sank in the spongy floor as you progress slowly. The vagina must be long at your scale, and this damned elastic environment doesn\u2019t help you, either that oppressive heat coming from the body. Besides, it must be the explanation to the fact you are able to see inside her: she is so hot that her flesh emits light. You sit a moment to recover, totally in a sweat. You are very dehydrated; and though you can make do with the juices flowing around on the walls, it is so salty that you doubt that it is healthy, a bit like the sea water: it gives a reprieve, but is not a solution for long term. You need to find true water quickly if you don\u2019t want to explode your kidneys. Suddenly, you feel a twitch from a part of the floor nearby your position. You find it really strange because the place had been perfectly still until there, the organ didn\u2019t seem to react to your presence. Then, another twitch appears somewhere else, then another, and another\u2026 Progressively, the whole place is animated by this shuddering. You have difficulty to stand on your position, shaken in every sense. But it is only the beginning: you hear a big rumble, and as you turn around, you are struck by the terrifying sight of the walls meeting together in a tight grasp, the flesh contracting successively toward you like a roller wave. You try yet to flee straight ahead but it is totally futile: in less than three steps, you are already crushed by the flesh. You feel your articulations crack and you are absolutely breath-taken under the pressure. Then, you feel the wall release their grasp, but they give you only a short break before to do it again. You try to go forward between each contraction, crawling miserably like a small worm. The walls grasp is getting stronger and stronger, and you guess you must be badly injured but the adrenaline detracts you from the pain. At this rhythm, you are going to pass out before she even orgasmes. Eventually, you reach the end of the path: the cervix. It is the only way to escape the vaginal contractions. After that, if she is able to get uterine contractions, may God (or Hemen) be with you. You force your way through the tight ring of flesh, desperate to escape this hell of convulsions. The opening is awfully narrow too, but compared to the vagina, it is not that worse, and plus it is not crushing you like the precedent cavity. Remark, you can\u2019t breathe anymore in this confined corridor. You wriggle frenetically, trying to accelerate your progression toward the uterus, hoping there may be some air in there (otherwise, you will die of suffocation instead squash). After an endless laborious squirming throughout the organ, on the verge of suffocating, you eventually come out in a wider space which is indubitably the uterus. As you pleaded for it desperately seconds ago, there was effectively a few breathable air in this place. On the moment, you just lay right where you fell on the fleshy ground, and catch your breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe female hippo was really glad of the little sensation you were giving to her unwillingly. She had never been tickled by a foreign body in this particular place of her anatomy, and this was titillating her deliciously. She grunts and sort of moos heavily to express her joy, closing her eyes to only focus on your little wriggles. Beyond this insignificant tickles, it is the feeling of her omnipotence on you which arouses her. You are an unimportant tiny speck, lost in the immensity of her body, not even big enough to be used as her sex toy, just a toy in the waves of her vaginal muscles.<br>\r\nBut suddenly, something totally unexpected happens. It seems the bug has reached the back of her genitals, but when she was convinced the bug should know his fate here, she feels it manage to wedge deeper in there, causing a really discomforting sensation, like a little sting. The hippo is absolutely outraged. How this pathetic creature dare to just bother her. This will cost its life. She tries to find a muscle to give it the coup de grace, but surprisingly, there is nothing that responds to her command in the place the bug is wriggling. She thinks it is really worrying: she had never felt a part of her body without a muscle corresponding to a sensitive nerve. She focused all her mind on the cervix, groping mentally around the back of her vaginal muscles, until suddenly the bug vanished. It seems it managed to travel through the fleshy ring, and must be now somewhere at the entrance of her womb. The hippo is a bit surprised by this turn of events but still snorts with satisfaction: she is convinced there is no air in there, so the bug will probably die any sooner. But for a moment, she had the terrible thought she might have lost the control. She takes a note for the future: better not let any living being go in a part of her body not armed to destroy it. With this, she goes back to her grazing activity.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since the precedent trick in the vagina, you have become more suspicious toward the cetacean (well, not far, genetically talking). The cavity looks peaceful for the moment, but it is always at the moment you expect it the less that it happens. You step cautiously on the padded floor, looking for any dubious movement below your feet. However, despite all your effort to detect it, nothing betrays a duplicitous intention from your environment. The place is definitely quiet and peaceful, only rhythmed by the organic sounds you\u2019re used to. You jump on your spot, just to confirm your observation, and as nothing reacts, you let your joy come out. You dance and swing, just happy to be there, alive and safe, eventually. You didn\u2019t think you would meet this concept again in the reality. But, as you move and groove, you feel your bones and muscle stab. You have suffered very much from your torment in the vagina, and you think it is better to spare yourself. Then, you recall your thirst, and decide to seek for water or a substitute fluid for it. You walk around, scanning the floor and the wall next to you. You eventually reach the back of the uterus, and find out two other holes on either side. You guess immediately this must be the fallopian tubes, leading even deeper, to the ovaries of the tremendous beast. You continue your walk, but after many rounds, you have to admit the place is totally empty and dry; there\u2019s not even the tiniest fetus to get your teeth into (I know it is a bit cruel, but you would have no scruples toward this monster and its offspring). This place has probably never been used, but it doesn\u2019t surprise you when you think back to the aggressiveness of the hippo. Eventually, you get back in front of one of the fallopian hole, undecided on what to do.</span></div></div>",

The cervix is firmly closed, and even if you managed to wriggle your way through, you would be back at the mercy of the beast. Remain in the sterile uterus is synonym of dying slowly of thirst. This let you the last option: explore even deeper in the body with the hope to find something of use. Maybe you will meet your fate in there, but it is still better than stay on place and wait for death. You prefer to die acting and fighting, even if it means to finish ironically in the place from where life comes usually (maybe a little hope of reincarnation?) and with that, you dive in the threatening darkness of the oviduct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crawl laboriously inside the oviduct: the place is yet wider than the cervix, but it remains unsuited to a bug like you. But you shouldn\u2019t complain: at least you still pass through. In a way, you are lucky to have shrunk right enough to travel inside the beast. If you looked more like a doll, the beast could still crush you as easily, and though, you couldn\u2019t take shelter in her body.<br>\r\nBut maybe you claimed victory too early : the path was getting more constricted and sinuous, each (mili?)meters was a victory. All a sudden, you hear a loud growl from the hippo above, her jaw\u2019s slamming. She sounds really furious, but could it really be against you, in such a lost place in her body. Then, slight contractions from the walls around you confirm it: even in the deepest confines of her body, this monster will not let you in peace. Like if the tightness was not enough, the walls are contracting backward, forcing you to retrace your steps. But you won\u2019t let it happen. You swore you would die fighting and you will keep your word. You punch back the walls, and wriggle strongly to force your way inwards. Sometimes, the walls grasp tighter; and in this case, you strike, claw and bite the walls with all your strength. Apparently, it makes the flesh stop for a while, and you take the occasion to progress. By the way, it seems the hippo has not the force to crush you, so that for the first time, you fight on equal terms. But you should be careful, because the tunnel is getting even tighter, and thus the contraction easier and more painful. You wonder if the end is not near for you, if not for the path, but suddenly, you catch a glimpse of a wall blocking the way in front. You have no doubt it is the entrance to her ovary: this time it is definitively the end of the trip, you\u2019ll find either life or death on the other side. You put your hand on the scar which corresponds to the trace let by the passage of ovulation with each heat, and you push on the wall with your last remaining strengths. The hippo roars above, totally mad at you since the beginning of the fight and her fail to stop you. But you don\u2019t care, you have no choice now: \u201calea jacta est\u201d as they say. Eventually, the partition give way under your pressure and you fall quickly inside the ovary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up after a long slumber, filled of nightmares about pred chasing you. Still a bit worry, you sit straight, staying on your guard, and observe attentively your surroundings.  This place is undoubtedly the smallest you\u2019ve seen, probably the size of a medium bedroom. However, of all the organic rooms you have already traveled into, this one looks surely the most luxury and comfortable. The fleshy wall has the appearance of a delicate drapery covering the totality of the room, and it feels like velvet under your touch. Otherwise, the light coming from the wall is really softer, very relaxing for your nerves. This place looks globally like a deliciously comfortable cocoon.<br>\r\nYou frolic joyfully in the room, a bit delighted because of the relief to have escaped the grasp of the monster and the drop in blood pressure it provokes in consequences. You just lay there and enjoy the fluffy surface you are rubbing on. In the distance, you can still hear the sound of the organism but it sounds like muffled by the walls, which must be the origin of the peaceful atmosphere. And still further, you can hear the furious growling of the hippo. Apparently, she doesn\u2019t appreciate your presence in this place but you don\u2019t see how you could bother, even less threaten, such a Titan. But after all these emotions and gesticulations, you had a dry mouth and you recall your dehydration. You sweep the room quickly and your glance falls on a strange rise in the middle of the room. You come closer and discover a kind of big lump emerging from the flat ground, looking like a small anthill. As you examine closer, you realize a kind of mucus is leaking from the very top of a fluttering bright red orifice. You are a bit skeptic on the nutritive quality of this slime, but this time you have no choice: it is the only source of liquid in the room and you have nowhere to go after that. Thus, you take some on your hand and instantly, you are enthralled by the taste. It is a bit like the condensed milk consistency, but with a taste more bittersweet. Simultaneously satiating and thirst-quenching, what can you ask in addition. Then, you fling yourself on the hill and engulf the top in your mouth, drinking voraciously. However, it seems this place is really sensitive because the whole place shudders violently in reaction and the hippo howls at the limit to burst her lungs, apparently outraged by your touch there. You totter backward, a bit shaken, but you quickly pull yourself together and stare at this strange organ for a while. Then, you grin at the thought of what this strong reaction implies\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You give a curt nod, and a wry half-smirk that communicates, 'I can only WISH I wasn't.' Even so, he grasps at your wrist, as if to confirm by touch that you're actually here, in front of his eyes. Then he seems to relax. \"Y-you got eaten too, huh...\" There's a faint timbre of relief in his voice, of happiness that, at least, he's not alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down next to him in the grime, as the she-hippo vents a powerful belch that shakes the whole stomach and blasts you with vile-smelling wind. \"Yeah...

You stare back into her eyes, each one the size of your head, and shiver despite the warmth of the monkey's fist wrapped around you. You realize how tiny you are, and how much power she has over you. even so, you remain confident: she may be huge, but you're not willing to let her hurt you without putting up a fight. You're not sure how much of a fight you'll be able to put up, though, so you hope you won't have to try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, it seems like you'll have to put up a fight after all, as she begins squeezing you over and over again, seeming to test your squishiness. You grunt in pain, struggling to free your arms that are pinned to your sides. The monkey stops after a few moments, and you aren't able to free your arms. She brings up her other hand and pokes your head a bit, then chatters to herself a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to squirm, but a sudden squeeze from your captress convinces you to stop for the moment.

You squirm more and scream as your captress moves you into her mouth, positioning her hand so that she holds just your legs. Thus your upper body is free and inside her maw completely. You punch and swing your newly freed arms, but to no avail. The giantess monkey places you onto her tongue, and your face and upper body sink slightly into the muscle as she pushes you into it to taste you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe bites down... But very gently, so her teeth don't hurt you at all. Still, you continue to squirm, and even more so once you feel and hear the monkey start to suck on you. She holds your legs so you don't slip into her mouth fully, but she continues to suck on you like a lollipop. The monkey moans as she sucks on you, clearly enjoying your flavor, and you continue to struggle against her, but in no time at all, you fall limp and give up. It isn't helping. You're wasting your energy. Might as well let this giant animal do what she wants to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe monkey stops sucking on you a few seconds after you stop struggling. You wonder if she's already done tasting you, or if she decided to stop once you stopped struggling. Maybe she only enjoyed it because you were struggling?

You can feel his mouth warming up as you are drench in the ape's saliva.  The tongue wraps around your body slowly, and you can feel each taste bud sliding over your skin as the ape murmurs in pleasure to itself.  He lifts his tongue and pins you to the roof of his mouth, playing with your tiny body as you start to flail about in a state of semi-panic.  Your efforts, however, go to complete waste as his tongue overpowers your pathetic attempts to get yourself free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ape opens his mouth again, almost teasing you with freedom as it rolls around your body, sealing you in a fleshy prison as you get a few last moments to look at the world you used to know.  You view is blurred slightly by the copious amounts of saliva running around you.  There realy isn't much to see as the light is mostly refracted from the saliva, just an overwhelming white light from the outside combined with the dark red and black of the ape's mouth.  It closes it's mouth again and presses you against the room of its mouth to swallow, still wanting to suckle on your delicious body for a while yet.  he doesn't give you any peace as his tongue continues to barrage your poor body, seeking out every crack and crevice for full flavor.  This continues on for what feels like days, although it's only been minutes for the ape himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the taste 'torture', it's actually been a pleasant experience inside his mouth.  He obviously didn't want to harm you while he was suckling on your body.  He raises his tongue gently and presses you against the roof of his mouth, making an almost cooing sound before sealing his lips and tilting his head back.  Whatever his intentions were to say, they were lost in translation as your body starts to slide back into the black abyss.  The throat catches you and envelops you as it slowly tugs and pushes your body in peristaltic motions.  You can feel the warm saliva flowing past you as the cooing gets louder.  You can hear his heartbeat getting louder, as well as his steady breathing as you pass deeper in his body.  The ape lays back and simply waits as he feels your tiny body passing deeper into his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what has felt like a day long massage, you bump into the opening to the stomach, which resists your entrance for a moment.  After a little extra pressure from the muscles of the throat, it opens and you find yourself falling into what can only be described as a humid, pitch-black pit.  The \"room\" was large, and there was plenty of room to move around.  You stood up and began to move around, pressed your hand against the wall, almost in disbelief at the fact an ape just ate you.  The ape smiled as he felt your movements in his stomach, pressing a finger against where your hand is.  As you stood there, you realized you were nearly knee-high in liquid already, but strangely enough, it didn't burn.  The cooing and touch made sense; he didn't want to eat you for food, he just wanted to enjoy you as a treat and feel you inside him.  The acids weren't hurting your body in the slightest!  You laid back in the dark room, smiling somewhat as you realized this.  The ape was going to keep you, whether to protect you or as an amusing pet - you weren't sure.  One thing was for sure though: For now, you were inside this magnificent creature and you weren't going anywhere.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ape gently stroked his stomach as he felt your movement cease, knowing that you had simply laid down for a bit.  The ape too began to relax and fell asleep, content at the tiny human in his stomach - his new pet.</span></div></div>",

You laid up against the ape's stomach wall a moment before opening your eyes and running a hand along the lining, \"I guess you did want me as a pet.\"  You sink down and enjoy the moist, warm cavern, listening to the inner workings of your keeper - the powerful beating heart, the deep breathing; it's almost enough to lull you back to sleep.  Your peaceful moment is interrupted as the ape gently presses his hand to his belly as he feels you stir inside him.  He makes a gentle, almost cooing sound as the ape admires his new human pet.  The peaceful darkness is disturbed even more as he starts swinging from tree to tree, throwing you around as if you were nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ape wanted to take good care of his new pet, and all things still need food.  After admiring his human, the ape had taken flight in between the trees, swinging back and forth until reaching a clutch of bananas.  He eagerly devoured them, both out of hunger and also still for concern for his pet.  The human was safe from him eating, but the ape had held out as long as he could from eating out of concern.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as you start to regain your balance, both amused and disoriented from the ride, you can hear familiar, somewhat squelching sounds from above.  Despite it being pitch black inside the ape, you look up only to have a mound of chewed up bananas fall on top of your body.  Not realizing what it is at first, you just and try to fling it off, but the smell soon mixes with the air around to let you know your meal has arrived.  Somewhat awkwardly, you sit down to take a handful of the mashed bananas, the taste not skewed by the ape's saliva.  You begin to enjoy your meal somewhat until another shock comes along; a huge rush of cold water shoots into the stomach and halfway fills it, turning your moist, warm home into a drenched, cold pool.  Shivering slightly due to the sudden temperature change, you 'brace' yourself in the liquid as the ape returns back to his home.  Seemingly hours pass by for you as you're sloshed around inside him, staying at the top of the current before the movement ceases; that familiar hand pressing inward on your home again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied his pet was fed for now, the ape laid back and sighed contently, amused and somewhat shocked at how well this human was taking his new home.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ape drifted off to sleep after a heavy meal, things began to calm down in your stomach home.  You could smell the acids working away at the few chunks of bananas, but they did nothing to your skin, miraculously.  You simply tread water as the levels in the stomach slowly drained, raising the temperature back to nice levels and allowing you to reclaim your shared home.  Shocked by the experience of this, you slunk down, tired, \"I guess this is how I live now.  I guess it's not too bad.  Free bath, food, and rent, haha.\"  The warmth lulled you back to sleep, and for a time, the two of you napped in the afternoon sun, that ape's hand still proudly resting on his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now, you slept deeper than you ever had in your life. Your dreams were as soft and soothing as the wall of the stomach cradling you. You envisioned warm arms encircling you, a cooing laughter, not quite human, that soothed you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awoke, and you perceived from the rocking of the body around you that it was day. In the empty environment of your soft, warm home, you stood shakily and pressed your hands against the stomach wall as though to signal, \"Hey, I'm up!\" In response, the motion around you ceased, and you felt as before the hand of the ape pressing against his stomach, feeling you in your tininess as you felt his massive belly all around you. He was so much larger than you, and yet you felt as one, synced - the animal master sheltering his dear human; a strange reversal, but - not unfitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ape helped himself to a bunch of bananas, you too settled down for your morning meal inside him. You leaned against the stomach wall with your head propped against your arm, and with your free hand helped yourself to handfuls of the mushy food. You could get used to this routine, you thought - and the civilized world certainly wouldn't miss you. Yes, you had made your decision long ago; so long as the ape willed it, you would stay. And the ape was more than willing to shelter and feed his peculiar new pet. His was the only companionship you would ever need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would contently live out the remainder of your life with the ape, your newest and dearest friend, unacknowledged by the world and contained inside his belly.</span></div></div>",

The sack you are in is not much bigger than yourself and you can hardly stand on your feet. You feel pressure, possibly the gorilla rubbing his stomach, and your prison shrinks a little. BURP! you hear. Desperate, you hit the walls. Useless. His breathing and his heartbeat fade. Great, he's asleep. And now you will be digested! Acid oozes from the walls. The smell of vomit fills the stomach. They quickly dissolve your clothes, your skin itches ... but you are still alive. How is it possible? Maybe the acids are not strong enough to break down your skin.</span></div></div>",

Given how much bigger and heavier the creature was, it would surely flatten you, so you just stay perfectly still as the snout of the beast rubs against you.

You scream again and try to scale the large tongue but you slip into the throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis signals for the rhinoceros to turn her head back as a tiny screaming lump (namely you) slides like a pimple down her neck. You land with a splash right into the rhino's stomach and the rhino lets out a thunderous fart to let it be known that her prey was where it belongs.

Your eyes blurred and, as you sat up, you could not help but wonder if something had gone horribly wrong. Fortunatly you seemed well enough, simply disorientated. However as you glanced about your surroundings you quickly found that you were in a massive forest; the trees seemed to rise upward forever. The foliage was huge, but with no animals around you could not be certain wether all the creatures of this world were so huge; it might be hard to communicate with them if they were. It was as you sat down to ponder this that you felt a gradual tapping against your foot. At first you thought it was simply an itch, but as it grew in ferocity you realized something was trying to get your attention. It quickly dawned on you that with such huge trees other things may be out of porportion in the opposite manner; it was possibly an entire tiny race of beings lived here!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing so close to your foot, you had to be very careful not to accidently hit the tiny person. Fortunatly you kept still as you leaned forward to examine the being. To your utter astonishment the creature seemed to be none other than Popka! Your old friend was so tiny that you feared lifting him might inflict too much unintentional damage, and instead you simply layed down with your ear beside him. \"Popka?! How did you get so little?\" The voice in your ear was faint but you managed to make out his words. It appeared that shortly after you had left Lunatea, people began to vanish. It seemed that Popka had likewise been pulled into this strange realm, and had found himself at tiny size. He also reported, grimly enough, that about half of the people were instead magnified to a monumental height. Some tried to be nice to the shrunken creatures, but others had begun to capture and even eat them! It seemed that, having entered on your own, you had maintained your original size. This made you a giant compared to the shrunken half, unfortunatly you were still equally tiny to the giant half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter carefully placing Popka into your pocket, you rose back to your feet and glanced around. It was obvious that something was pulling people into this realm, and you needed to do your best to find out what it was. On the other hand you, with your height, could exist pretty comfortably in this world for a while; perhaps you could try having a bit of fun with it.</span></div></div>",

You look around and see a white wolf, who is obviously female. She has deep crimson markings all over her body, and a flaming disc-like object floats above her back. You realize that the wolf is the sun goddes, Amaterasu. But there's something different about her-she's enormous!

Finally, she notices you and lays on her belly to see you better. You are standing in front of her giant snout. Ammy yawns and exposes her sharp fangs, which are much larger than you. You shudder at the sight, but continue to look down the giant maw. Her mauve, saliva-coated tongue moves with each breath. Deeper in you see her uvula and her enormous throat. You shudder again. She could easily swallow you whole. Ammy stops yawning and closes her maw. You decide to stroke her snout, and she begins to sniff you. The force makes you fear being sucked up her nose. After Ammy gets your scent, she opens her maw so wide, you can see all the  way down her throat. You are too awestruck to move, so you just stand still. Ammy's great tongue ejects from her maw, and she licks you whole body, coating you in slimy saliva. She likes the way you taste, and she uses her toungue to scoop you up into her maw.

Back inside, you're quickly pushed through the small intestine to the large intestine, the smell starts to get a bit musty, and you plug your nose from the scent of ammy's scat, moments later, you're pushed into ammy's colon, right into a large log of wolf shit that she'll soon have to poop out.

The Siberian husky glances over at its food dish and sees that it's empty, and then it stares at you again. It knew you were human from your taste, but you were a rather small one. Also you do smell, look, and taste quite tasty for a human. The Siberian husky thinks about what eating you might be like for a minute, and then it licks its lips at the thought. With that the Siberian husky decides it might as well eat you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou merely stare at the Siberian husky too scared to move. Your worst fears are confirmed when you it lick its lips. You scream in terror as the Siberian husky lowers its head back down to you, opens its jaws, and licks you up into its hungry maw. As it closes its jaws you find yourself lying on its massive tongue in total darkness. You become drenched in saliva as its foul smelling breathe constantly washes over you. Then the Siberian husky starts licking you against its palatte and rolling you around on its tongue. The Siberian husky savors your delicious flavor for a few moments. It just can't figure out why you're so tasty for a human, and neither can you. Eventually, the tongue settles down, and you scream in terror again as it starts to push you towards the back of the throat. Then the Siberian husky tilts its head back and swallows you whole with a loud gulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly travel down the esophagus. It almost feels like you're going down a slimy waterslide as you get covered in mucus and even more saliva. You're terrified though, because you just got eaten by a dog. You never thought in a million years that you would become dog food. Suddenly, you hear a loud thumping sound, and realize you're pasing by the Siberian husky's heart. Unfortunately, this doesn't help you and the muscles continue to massage you down to the stomach. Eventually, your journey comes to an end as you hit a wall of flesh separating you from the stomach. It quickly opens up, accepting you as food, and you land in the stomach with a plop. You look around your new home in horror, and begin to struggle, not wanting to die like this. Soon the digestive jucies begin to flow. You scream and try to back up away from them, but it is futile. Fortunately, you pass out from exhaustion just as the juices start to digest you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the Siberian husky burps and gets your taste back in its mouth for a bit. Then it lays down and goes back to sleep while it digests you. It never knew that humans could be such delicious dog food. The Siberian husky hopes that it'll get to eat more tiny humans as tasty as you some time while dreams about eating its tasty meal, you, over and over again.</span></div></div>",
