What a view! I place my hands on my hips and calmly look around, letting the true implications of my size sink in. I mean, I knew I was big when I grew through the roof and also when was sitting down on the road, but seeing the buildings that line up on both sides of the street barely being able to get up to mid-thigh and getting both a panoramic view of the city and a first view of the people at my feet from up above really bring the true implications of my size home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am huge. And of course, people notice it even more than when I was just sitting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding with your hands on your hips, looking at the world at your feet\u2026 this must be the favorite pose of any giantess! If I ever see my sister again, I need to ask her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the millions of differences that now exist between me and everyone else in the world, height is definitely the most obvious one. And while I\u2019m standing in a commanding pose I know that thousands of people look at me, even if they need to peek over their shoulders from time to time as they try to flee. And they fear me, respect me and admire me at the same time. I don\u2019t need to do much to inspire these feelings. Just be there. Standing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other way around, when I look down at the hundreds of people on the road, none of them bigger than a bug, it\u2019s incredibly obvious to me that I own them. I mean, there is just no question in my mind about that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is the effect that size has both on me and on the people around me. Thirty minutes ago I was a successful young model and now I\u2019m looking at the world as if it were already mine. And very few people around me will dare to deny that truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlong the years I\u2019ve been thinking about what happened to Eileen, I developed a theory. I find out that now that I\u2019m the giantess it applies nicely. Let\u2019s imagine that I would have got the powers of Superman. I would probably be on my own right to consider myself the most powerful being in the world, too. However, no one would have realized by now. And my best guess is that I would be barely starting to find out my powers at this moment. With size things are so obvious, though! My presence is undeniable to the world. But it\u2019s also undeniable to me. It forces me to embrace it; it removes any hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis makes things that much easier! Yeah, size definitely matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, I\u2019m standing up for the first time, admiring my size and scanning the city, feeling more excited than any woman has ever felt before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess that you\u2019ll all have concluded by now that I won\u2019t be wimping out like Eileen did. Let me repeat something, just in case you did not get it yet: I-LOVE-BEING-A-GIANT!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving reached this conclusion, the next one is easy enough: I\u2019m going to take over the city. To me that\u2019s not even a mission, it\u2019s a given. Let\u2019s face it: if I don\u2019t shrink out my own will, which I won\u2019t, there is no way in the world I can be stopped. Eileen already proved that, so I won\u2019t waste my time explaining myself. This city will be mine, as will every other city. This is not what I want to do, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to take over the world. I do. I\u2019ve always been a little megalomaniacal, which blends in really well with being an all-powerful giant. But I don\u2019t want to \u201conly\u201d take over the world. I mean\u2026 how long would I need to take over this city if this was the only thing I wanted to do? An hour? Probably less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m not really interested in this. I\u2019m an incredibly attractive young woman that has just become a giant. I\u2019m interested on testing the limits of my new condition, experiencing what no one has been able to experience before, living the full giantess experience. Said in other words: I\u2019m out to have fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know Palmsdale too well. Which means I\u2019m not too attached to it either. I think this will work out well, since I\u2019m guessing it will take me a while to get used to this size, which probably means that I will end up breaking a little more of Palmsdale than of the cities I visit in the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m a carefree woman, but I\u2019d still rather fuck a totally unknown city with totally unknown people than one I\u2019ve lived in for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, back to the most immediate action. I want to have fun, which necessarily implies testing my newfound size. Which means I need to get moving. I have no specific destination in mind, so I just move to the front, in the direction of the crowd. A crowd is always an appealing sight for a woman of my new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would think that after my long mental diatribe the people would have done a better job of getting away. You would be wrong. They are no more than four blocks away when I start moving. That\u2019s a ridiculous distance by my new standards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey get scared when they see me moving, which was to be expected, of course. I don\u2019t pay too much attention to them because I\u2019m enjoying the feeling of the asphalt creasing, cracking and sinking as I rest my weight on my foot. I take another step to enjoy it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMMMM I moan. I love it. In case you have not got it yet, I\u2019m eager to tell the world that things have changed now that I\u2019m here to play. And I love being able to send a message just by walking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have my mind set on being as sexy as I am powerful. This is quite demanding to my sex appeal, of course. Thankfully, I already have the body and the attire. I just need to add the attitude. I\u2019m barely three blocks away from the first group of geniuses that decided that outrunning a woman my size was an option worth trying and rather than walking I start strutting after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach one of my sexy steps must be accounting for dozens of their strides. The little unlucky bastards really never had an option. If anything I\u2019m surprised that they did not realize before, but I guess that I\u2019m too new and that they are as little used to the situation as I am. The advantage for me is that no one can step on me if I get careless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few more steps and my toes are right behind them. Even without touching them, just resting my weight in one delicate foot has already managed to make a few parked cars bounce and half a dozen people lose their balance, which is exhilarating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to make a decision now. Only the decision was really made the moment I started walking after them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe point that I\u2019m barely five blocks away from the hotel is not lost to me. Most of the tiny people that managed to flee the hotel before it crumbled are probably among those that are now in front of my toes. I have probably crossed my path with a lot of them plenty of times over the last couple of days, in the elevator, at breakfast or in the gym. From twenty-five stories above the ground one tiny person looks pretty much like another and fails to generate too much empathy to someone like me, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir fate was really sealed the moment I decided that I wanted to walk down the road and they managed to get it packed enough that there would be nowhere I would be able to step without getting a few of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, I raise my foot and take my next step normally. I realize it will end up on top of four people, the fifth one miraculously able to dash out of the spot my foot will land in the last instant. He ends up, face up, right in front of my little toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy bare foot is still as delicate as always, so the fact that it has so easily finished four people still feels curious. I\u2019ve noticed a spongy feeling in my sole just before my foot has kept going and cracked the asphalt as with every other step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOOPS I say aloud and I know this is the final insult. YOU GUYS ARE SO SMALL THAT I\u2019M AFRAID I DID NOT SEE YOU I say, mocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can feel some anger in the crowd, but I don\u2019t give a damn. It\u2019s not as if they will be able to do anything about the situation, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not step on them out of hate, or contempt or out of joy. Killing people per se does not give me pleasure. I\u2019m not a mass-murderer at heart, no matter what story the body count figures may tell. I stepped on them out of curiosity. Period.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were the first. I\u2019m sure they won\u2019t be the last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look down again and my eyes lock with those of the tiny man I almost crushed. It\u2019s too tempting to let it pass, so I crouch down and pick him up by the sides with two fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m sure he is thinking that he finally ran out of luck, but I only want to take a closer look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYOU ARE A LUCKY GUY I tell him as I hold him in front of my face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI catch him taking a glimpse down and chuckle when I realize what he was looking at: my cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMEN I say as I keep looking at him with a wide smile in my face<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe blushes instantly and realizes that he made a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTHEY\u2019RE PRETTY IMPRESSIVE, AREN\u2019T THEY? I ask naturally. They are, of course. My chest is clearly oversized for my generally thin frame, and fit into the very tight and very sexy bikini top I\u2019m wearing, my tits bulge like hot-air balloons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHERE, TAKE A CLOSER LOOK I say and then I casually drop him in the tight valley between my imposing mountains of flesh. I was a little worried that he would bounce to death, but he doesn\u2019t. My aim was perfect and he just slides between my breasts until he gets stuck when he is all the way down to his waist. I look down and chuckle at how comic the situation is. He tickles a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>ARE YOU HAVING FUN? I ask. The man looks at me, almost pleading for me to help him out of there. I do\u2026 but probably not in the way he was expecting. Grabbing one breast with each hand, I slightly move them apart and create enough room for him to slide all the way to the bottom of my bikini top. Then, I let nature and the bikini top to do their job and bring my boobs back together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides some initial additional tickling he goes almost unnoticed at his destination. I forget about him as quickly as I noticed him and start thinking on what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t mind killing a few people but, as I said, I\u2019m not a mass murderer. Walking forward will end up in nothing but a massacre, and I\u2019m not interested in that. Instead, I decide it\u2019s time to have a closer look at the action at street level. I know it may sound inconsistent. One moment I\u2019m telling you that standing up and looking at the world from above is the greatest thing ever and the next I\u2019m talking about getting a closer look at what\u2019s happening at feet level. It\u2019s one of the issues with being a giant woman. There\u2019s so much to do that you are faced with constant choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, I drop to my hands and knees. The crowd has not yet had time to adapt to the change when I stretch my legs and lie down on my stomach, face rested on my folded arms. I get a zoom of Lilliput in Full HD. Well, to be fair to the people in Lilliput, the guys here are quite smaller. Or\u2026 well\u2026 it\u2019s actually me that\u2019s bigger than Gulliver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf any aircraft is passing over me right now, its passengers must be getting the best possible look at what I\u2019d like to claim as the best ass in the world. Combine privileged genetic heritage with frequent fitness and you\u2019ll get the idea. Or well, just look at the pictures that people must be taking at this moment and judge by yourselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look to the front. The closest groups are not even 30 feet away, well within my reach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI unfold an arm and start walking two fingers among the crowd. Even my digits dwarf the people, which is kind of hilarious. With a simple gesture I\u2019ve got the people to stop being concerned about me and to start being concerned about my fingers, almost as if they were an entity of their own. People are always afraid of the harm that\u2019s closest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI really have no purpose as I walk my fingers, but soon I get bored and I start to randomly \u201ckick\u201d people. I\u2019m thoroughly surprised when I see that my fingers seem to have the strength of Superman, since I\u2019m able to toss people around 20 or more feet with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns into a game too easily. I start testing how far I can throw them. Then I start testing my aim. When I manage to kick a screaming man into an open third story window I cannot help myself from laughing out loud.         <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Excelsior was close to the beach, which means that there are other luxury hotels around. A stream of people is getting into one of them. I guess it\u2019s kind of natural for the people to try to get away from me, but this does not mean that I have to like it. I get back to my hands and knees and cat walk to the hotel. My right hand ends on two people and my left knee crushes a group of four beyond recognition, but this time I swear that it was not on purpose. I know it makes no difference to the ones I crushed, and hell! It does not even make too much of a difference to me! But I thought it was worth mentioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the day I wonder which body count will be higher: the one tracking deaths I caused on purpose or the one tracking deaths that happened just because I\u2019m too damn big to move around without killing some people and breaking some stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reach the hotel the moment the last person from the group gets into the revolving door. I flick it, out of frustration. The results are unexpected. The door starts twisting like a tornado and a few seconds later, the man is spat outside. I giggle and reach for his limp body. Resting him on my ten foot long index finger I see his chest moving up and down. This tells me that he is alive but unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sit on my knees as I think on what to do with him. He is a whim away from being tossed over my shoulder. Finally, the best part of me takes over, I make a fist with my left hand and easily punch a hole into the hotel\u2019s fa\u00e7ade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA section of the tenth floor gets easily and violently exposed to the world. My fist is so massive that it\u2019s accompanied by similar sections of the eighth, ninth and eleventh floors. A startled couple looks at me and starts screaming. I just move my right hand to the spot they are and carefully drop the limp man in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWILL YOU TAKE CARE OF HIM? I BELIEVE HE\u2019S A LITTLE SHOCKED I say cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple does not reply. They just turn and start running deeper into the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOH I said. Their reaction is predictable but disappointing. Pushing my lips out, I blow out a short gust of wind at them. I snort when as a result of my simple action the tiny couple is lifted off their feet and gets thrown deeper into the building at a quite faster pace than they had intended. Their short flight ends up when they hit a wall. The couple slides down the wall and does not stand up. They are not the only stuff that has become airborne as a result of my breath. Several pieces of furniture splinter as they hit the walls at high speed, just like the couple did. And the limp tiny man I picked from the revolving door does too. He is still limp. Or limper, if that is even possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOH I repeat to myself as I realize about the consequences of a new act of carelessness. I cannot be less worried. If anything I\u2019m impressed at what I\u2019ve done, even if I should have already known about my breath after having watched Eileen\u2019s videos so many times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMentally adding three new people to the list of accidental victims, I crouch back once more to look at the multitude in the lobby. They do not like my renewed attention, as is made evident by the intensified screams and panic. I love their reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, they are at my mercy. I wonder: \u201cWhat should I do with them?\u201d</span></div></div>",

And my sensitivity is good enough to feel the two tiny slugs harmlessly hitting my right buttock. They do not even sting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting up, I look over my shoulder and see him. Then I turn and sit on my haunches, facing the tiny fucker. He is not even a cop. He must be the security guard at one of the neighboring hotels, judging him by his uniform. I wonder how the hell someone like this has a weapon. Then I fix my stare on him and notice his fear. I just roll my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decides to prove that people can always get stupider and takes aim at me. Then, he empties his clip. It\u2019s curious to feel something as tiny as his bullets bouncing from my skin without consequence. The man has anything but a steady pulse, so the only thing that ensures that he hits me is my size. Still, the dozen bullets strike places on my body as far apart as my belly button, my tits or my chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man is frozen, apparently not understanding how I can be so unhurt. I roll my eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDUDE. I\u2019M THE SIZE OF A SKYSCRAPER. DID YOU SERIOUSLY EXPECT YOUR LITTLE TOY GUN TO HURT ME?\u201d I ask in a mocking tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man seems to realize that his little act of heroism was nothing but stupid and drops his gun. Then he turns and starts running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little fucker has not even managed to put a red spot on my skin, so I could easily shrug his pathetic attempt off. However, it feels unnatural to do that. I just need to stoop forward and reach out with my apparently mile-long arms to pick him up by the sides and bring his screaming form in front of my smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI ASKED YOU A QUESTION\u201d I state, smiling evilly at him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis screams get even louder and he starts to become annoying, so I just roll him in my fingers and flick him away, sending him flying over three blocks before he starts falling and crashes into the side of a building.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Something else catches my attention as I follow the flight of the screaming guard with my eyes. It\u2019s a chopper, and it\u2019s pretty close. I immediately forget about the people in the lobby and stand up. In the end, there are millions of people in the city and not so many helicopters, so the toy-sized aircraft is more interesting to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly see where it\u2019s going: the roof of a building a few blocks down the road. I focus on it and smile as I find out that I have the super sight many journalists speculated that my sister had possessed. The roof must be a good half a mile away but still I can see everyone on it in full detail and even zoom in and admire the patterns in their clothes. There are half a dozen people and they are obviously waiting for the chopper to pick them up. It\u2019s not hard to conclude that this is all because of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a couple of steps towards a close by building and stoop forward, resting my heavy breasts on its roof as I rest my chin on my folded arms in a cute way. The building is suffering, but I determine that it will hold, so I forget about its structure and zoom into the roof again. The group shifts as the chopper approaches and I get a full view of one of the people in the back for the first time. My heart fills with glee when I easily identify Jay!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, I know Jay is supposed to be a celebrity popstar for teenagers, but well, I just turned 21. Actually, I think he\u2019s my age. I\u2019ve never been a snobby intellectual when it comes to music, so his catchy tunes appeal me as much as to the legion of fans he has. And he\u2019s so damned hot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI did not know he was in town. Otherwise I would have made sure to stop by his hotel and try to catch his eye. I typically do not have too many problems with that and I would not have had too many problems to make myself available either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy recent changes have made things a little bit different though, so my plan is no longer to catch his eye but to catch him. After all, what\u2019s the point on being an all-powerful giantess if you cannot get a hold of your favorite popstar?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, it\u2019s decided: Jay will be mine. Now I just need to decide how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy first reaction is to remove myself from the building I\u2019m resting at and to walk towards the roof where he is. I restrain myself before starting to move though. Being a giantess has plenty of advantages, but stealth is not one of them. If I start moving to the roof too soon, the chopper might never land in there. And I\u2019m pretty sure that Jay and his entourage will see me and will get back into the building. It would not be entirely impossible to get him out of there unscratched, but it would be harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, my first decision is easy: I need Jay to get into the helicopter, and the best way to do that is by remaining motionless. Once he is on it, I \u201cjust\u201d need to pick the chopper from the air. I don\u2019t have a plan for that. At least not yet. But after having seen all my sister accomplished in her few hours as a giant, I\u2019m convinced that it\u2019s well within my possibilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stay with my head rested on my folded arms as I observe the scene in the roof in Full HD. The chopper lands and the six people close to the heliport need to make an effort to stay on their feet as a result of the wind from the rotor. They are so puny!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA side door opens and Jay is the first one to climb on. Then three more people get inside. The other two wave their hands and then head back to the roof access. The helicopter starts lifting. I don\u2019t move yet. I need to wait just a couple more seconds. As they pass, the chopper gets far enough from the roof that it won\u2019t be immediate for it to land again. My cue. I stand up and face the avenue. I take a first step down the road, an SUV getting crushed flat under the ball of my right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe helicopter is getting higher. I could run after it, but I decide against it. Running is not sexy. Instead, I start strutting again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI keep my stare fixed on the helicopter so I\u2019m not looking where my feet land. I can only guess what I\u2019m stepping on by the feeling under my soles. Whenever it feels like tinfoil I know it\u2019s been a car. Whenever the feeling is spongy I know that one or more often a few unlucky people were in the spot where my foot has broken the asphalt into yet another footprint. And I learn about a new scenario: tinfoil plus mushy. I guess it must be a car with occupants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realize the chopper is getting out of my reach. I know I can solve that by blowing it out of the sky, but that is more than likely to end up with Jay hurt, and I don\u2019t want that. I frown as my eyes keep glued to the aircraft in the distance. Then I feel pressure building behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stop, somewhat concerned since I guess what\u2019s coming. Don\u2019t misunderstand me: I\u2019m as excited as a girl can be about the possibility of having laser vision, but I don\u2019t want to use it yet. I\u2019d rather not turn my celebrity popstar of choice into ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m not on time to look away from the chopper by the moment the pressure relieves. I wait for the worst\u2026 but it does not happen. The helicopter is hit by whatever energy I projected from my eyes, but it is not disintegrated, as I expected. Instead, it gets engulfed by a blueish halo and gets stopped on its tracks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m so surprised that it takes me a couple of seconds to realize that what I shot from my eyes was not a deadly laser beam but actually what I can only describe as a tractor beam. The chopper\u2019s rotor is still turning, but the aircraft is not moving an inch. I stopped it on its tracks\u2026 just with my sight!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decide to test my theory of the tractor beam and will to move the chopper closer to me. It does, even if just by a few feet. I cannot prevent it anymore and I let out a loud laugh as I slap my tight butt with my right hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019M A CERTIFIED GODDESS!\u201d I say for all the city to hear. \u201cNOT EVEN EILEEN KNEW SHE HAD THIS ONE!\u201d I add. I\u2019m sure most of the people that are hearing my words do not know what the hell I\u2019m talking about, but I don\u2019t care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cannot feel more powerful and sexier than I feel right now, so I pose like that. Spreading my legs so that they span the eight lanes of the avenue I\u2019m standing at, I place both my hands at my hips and push my chest and head out a little. Then, I focus on the helicopter I\u2019ve trapped in my sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI keep the aircraft in place, swearing that I can feel its pathetic efforts to break from my eyes\u2019 grip. Then I zoom in and delight when I see the panic of the tiny people trapped inside. I want to see them from up close, so I slowly start dragging the chopper towards me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt does require focus! It is certainly more demanding of me than what it would have been to just pick it up in my hands. I guess it\u2019s all a matter of training. I\u2019ve been picking things up my entire life and this is the first thing I capture with my newfound power. I still manage to keep my hold on it and pull it all the way down the avenue and towards my waiting figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI switch my new power off when the chopper is right in front of me. It shakes for a second, first. Then it tries to pull up, away from me. I easily abort the attempt by firmly grabbing the aircraft from below, closing my delicate fingers around its little frame. If it could not escape from my tractor beam, there is no way it\u2019s going to break from my physical grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rotor is still on, which is annoying. I solve that by simply extending a finger from my free hand and letting the rotor blades break into it. Then I lift the fuselage up and peek through the windows. I smile at the six occupants of the helicopter, but I can see from their reaction that they are anything but happy to see me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t care of course. I only care about getting my popstar idol out. Using my free hand, I break the helicopter in two as if I were breaking an eggshell. Dropping the top part a couple hundred feet below, I look down at the six very shocked people inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, I stretch my free hand and then turn the one that\u2019s holding the chopper upside down, using my wrist to gently shake the six people on the aircraft out of it. Four people fall into my palm, bounce and finally find a resting spot in its soft skin. I turn the broken fuselage up again to see that the pilots did not fall because they were wearing their seatbelts. I do not care about them so I just drop the fuselage with them attached to it. For once, wearing the seatbelt has been counterproductive for safety, I think. In the short time I\u2019ve been around my presence is changing many things people took for granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Quickly forgetting about the two pilots, I focus on the four tiny people on my left palm. They fit there well, reminding me once more about just how big I\u2019ve become. Or well, I guess I should say how big I\u2019ve made myself, since this is what actually happened. Jay is face down, something I quickly solve by rolling him over with a fingertip. He looks up at my smiling face and I say \u201cHELLO HANDSOME!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe starts screaming right away, which I guess is a predictable enough thing to do but upsets me anyway. The three members of his entourage are screaming too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSHUT UP\u201d I command, sounding less friendly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEither out of compliance or out of shock at my thundering voice, they do as I\u2019ve told them. Then, the woman in the group does something I was not expecting and yells at me: \u201cLet us go, you giant bitch\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ve never tolerated insult well, and being a giant makes my temper even shorter that it used to be. It also makes me much more capable to deal with the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further words, I pick the woman with two fingers and say \u201cAS YOU WISH\u201d. Then I toss her over my shoulder. My ears are sharp enough to hear her screams as she flies away from me and into a neighboring street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cANYONE ELSE WANTS TO LEAVE?\u201d I ask, trying to sound innocent. I smile when I see three heads shaking in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGOOD!\u201d I say cheerfully. \u201cYOU ARE MY FAVORITE SINGER!\u201d I add<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJay looks at me, hesitant. Then he asks:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want of me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pick him up with two fingers, just as I did with the tiny woman, but I\u2019m gentler this time. I hold him in front of my eyes and shoot him a naughty look. Then, in my best bedroom voice I say \u201cI LOVE YOUR MUSIC. AND I LIKE YOU. I\u2019M READY TO ENJOY BOTH\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about my colleagues?\u201d he asks, after a couple of seconds of shock<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had forgotten about them. They are so forgettable, lying in my palm. At his question I realize about the use the purpose they serve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH, THEM? I HAVE NO USE FOR THEM\u201d I say and then I carelessly toss them around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey scream. Jay, still in my fingers, screams as well. I try to quiet him down, hushing. Then I say \u201cDON\u2019T WORRY. NONE OF THIS WILL HAPPEN TO YOU. AS LONG AS YOU BEHAVE\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought you liked me!\u201d he protests<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI DO\u201d I confirm to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen, let me go!\u201d he protests a little more<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI laugh out loud. I realize that he has misinterpreted the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI THINK YOU GOT IT WRONG. YOU SEE, I\u2019M NOT YOUR AVERAGE FAN. I\u2019M MORE YOUR AVERAGE SKYSCRAPER-SIZED ALL-POWERFUL GODDESS. THE KIND THAT DOES ANYTHING SHE WANTS AND TAKES ANYTHING SHE WANTS. INCLUDING YOU\u201d I say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you going to do with me?\u201d Jay asks, his mood looking considerably darker<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU\u2019LL BE FINE. AS LONG AS YOU DO AS I SAY\u201d I try to reassure him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou killed my assistants\u201d he says, the fear really noticeable in his voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s hard for me to take what I just did seriously, so I let my mood reply for him. \u201cWELL, TO BE FAIR, I JUST DROPPED THEM. BUT I GUESS THAT UNLESS THEY KNOW HOW TO FLY IT\u2019S QUITE LIKELY THEY ARE DEAD, YES\u201d. I even giggle as I finish the sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe does not reply, but it\u2019s easy enough to see that he did not like my answer. Well, I have more important things to worry about than the mood of an eraser-sized man, even if he is a celebrity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI HAD NO USE FOR THEM\u201d I say as I shrug. \u201cYOU DON\u2019T SEEM TO BE CRYING TOO MUCH FOR THEM EITHER. YOU\u2019LL RECOVER\u201d I add<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want of me?\u201d Jay asks, still dangling from my fingers<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU KNOW, AS BIG AND POWERFUL AS I AM, I\u2019M STILL A 21-YEAR OLD GIRL. I HAVE MY WHIMS AND I HAVE MY CRUSHES\u201d I start saying. I have not done it on purpose, but I realize about what I just said and giggle. He does not like it but as usual, I don\u2019t care. \u201cWELL, I GUESS I HAVE MANY MORE CRUSHES NOW\u201d I say and I giggle again. \u201cANYWAY, WHAT I MEANT WAS THAT I FANCY YOU. AND IN MY POSITION, I JUST TAKE ANYTHING I LIKE\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe does not look comfortable. I guess it\u2019s a natural enough reaction. He\u2019ll get used to his new situation, though. It\u2019s not as if he can do anything else, is there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSO, I\u2019LL KEEP YOU WITH ME AS I EXPLORE THE CITY\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to keep me just for the sake of it?\u201d he asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPARTLY. BUT I ALSO HAVE SOME ASSIGNMENTS FOR YOU. YOU\u2019LL KEEP ME ENTERTAINED. YOU\u2019LL SING FOR ME WHEN I FEEL LIKE IT. AND YOU\u2019LL WRITE A SONG AFTER ME. I WANT IT READY WITHIN THE MORNING. I KNOW I\u2019M GETTING COCKY, BUT I FEEL IT\u2019S TOTALLY JUSTIFIED\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is staring at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSO, DO YOU ACCEPT THE JOB?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there any alternative?\u201d he asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHERE IS ALWAYS AN ALTERNATIVE. LET ME JUST SAY THAT I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT TO YOU\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods. I smile at him and, without warning, bring him closer to my face. Pushing my lips out, I kiss him, my lips engulfing his entire body. I giggle when I see that there\u2019s some lipstick on him, reminding me that I\u2019m not only big but that I\u2019m dressed to kill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGOOD. WELCOME TO MY PAYROLL\u201d I say cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick look around shows me that the people have used the time I\u2019ve invested in Jay to clear the area around me. It was a predictable enough consequence, but somehow I don\u2019t like it. I look further down the road and over the building roofs and I see that they are not so far away, so it won\u2019t be too hard to catch up with them. I don\u2019t want them to get too cocky, though, so I decide that I should better get going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis presents me with a last problem: where should I carry Jay?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not as if my outfit has too many pockets, so the options are quite limited. Remembering about the man I caught before, I reach between my boobs with my free hand and pull him out. His body is limp and sticky. The combination of a shiny and hot day, an oversized rack and a bikini top that pushes my tits together even more than they would naturally do has the effect of making my cleavage quite sweaty. I guess the man just suffocated. Just a few hours ago men would have died to get to second base. Now this one has done it, literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can only feel amused at the consequences of placing a man in one of the most desirable parts of my anatomy. Unfortunately, this means that I cannot place Jay in there, which was my initial idea. Tossing the sticky man aside, I try to think on how to solve the problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf my bikini top is not an option, I doubt my bikini bottom will be. Being a goddess is an arousing business, so my womanhood is as damp as my cleavage, even if the cause is different. I cannot place him in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel frustrated for a second, thinking what should I do if I finally do not find a convenient way of carrying him. I\u2019m sure as hell that I won\u2019t be holding him in my hand for the rest of the day. I need freedom to use my body to have fun as I see fit, and something as small as Jay should not interfere on that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI even consider releasing him when my determination kicks in. I\u2019m a goddess, for God\u2019s sake. I should be able to do anything I fucking want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can see that Jay is startled by my attitude over the last while. I ignore him and focus on looking around instead, trying to find an alternative. My eyes zoom in and zoom out in different sections of the city. I spot car accidents, fleeing crowds and smaller groups of panicked people but I do not see anything that I might use. Then I realize that I have been limiting myself. Turning around, I watch the section of the city at my back, a section of the city that has been spared of my presence only because I\u2019ve chosen to walk to the front after growing rather than looking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy attention is quickly caught. It is so obvious, so damned appealing. And I was about to walk away from it! Thank God I had the need to look back. I would have never been able to forgive myself if I had not visited PalmsWorld.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The area behind me is completely empty, save for a few downed buildings that mark the spot where I embraced my new condition not so long ago. People have done a decent job of clearing the road. This allows me to walk without having to worry about where my feet will land. Ok, it\u2019s not as if I would have worried about it anyway, but now the trek is a tad easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ve let Jay roll onto my palm and closed my fingers gently around him as I started ambling down the avenue and in the direction of my new destination: PalmsWorld. I move my arm freely as I do so. I guess that Jay is getting as motion-sick as anyone can get, but his comfort is much less important than being able to move naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know how I could have forgotten about the theme park after my growth. I guess I had too many things running through my head. But when I try to think on a spot for a girl my size to have fun I cannot think on anywhere better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat makes it even more perfect is the fact that my enhanced sight has no trouble to zoom into the two-mile distant park and show me that it\u2019s still operating!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalmsdale is a touristic city, today is one of the hottest days in summer and PalmsWorld is one of the favorite destinations for visitors, so the park is teeming with people. There must be thousands of them and the best part is that they all seem unaware of my presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I grew not so long ago, so I guess that news of me have not spread around yet. And if they have, people must still be having a hard time to believe them. I\u2019m more than willing to help them. I just need to show up to do that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m pretty sure that it won\u2019t take long for the entire city and the entire country to know everything about me. What the hell, everyone in the world will probably glued to their TV sets in a short while, looking at my antics. I\u2019m thankful once more that what they will see is a model that had just been made ready for a photoshoot. Being sexy just makes the entire giantess experience so much better!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, it suits me well to have the people at PalmsWorld surprised about my presence. I guess that it can only make things funnier. One thing I\u2019ve quickly learned about my size is that having tinies around always makes things much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalmsWorld is one of the biggest theme parks in the world. It spans around two extensive areas, one next to the sea and the other one on top of a cliff. Both are connected by a cable car, which is the first thing that caught my attention about the park. I have some ideas about it, but first, I\u2019m going to enjoy the rides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn less than a minute I\u2019m already close enough to the park that I am noticed. Even in the distance my sharp ears catch the screams and my eyes have no trouble to see people getting berserk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy new condition puts me in a privileged position to observe human nature. I know that the observer always ends up influencing the observation, and I guess that in my case this is especially true, but by the end of the morning I believe that I will be the biggest expert in the world (pun not intended) in crowd reactions in panic situations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s amazing to see how little time people need to turn a regular day in the amusement park into utter chaos. In the minute that takes me to get to the park since the moment the people started reacting to me the crowd has become completely crazy. I can see them running, I can hear them screaming and I start noticing the first crashes in the parking lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that does not make it worse is that people are small, and this makes them slow. Well, at least compared to me. So, by the time I reach the entrance of the parking lot very few of them have actually been able to make it to their cars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis suits me well, so I decided to give them some extra time to set up a proper panic scene. I open my palm under my face to have a look at Jay. He looks like shit. The first thing he does is throw up. It takes all my self-control not to swat him like a fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOUCH\u201d I say looking at the tiny vomit in my hand. \u201cTHIS IS DISGUSTING\u201d I add, ignoring the fact that I make a much worse mess every time I\u2019ve stepped into a crowd. I pick him up with two fingers and crouch down to clean my hand in the road, creasing the asphalt as I do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stand up again, set him in my palm once more and tell him cheerfully: \u201cWE ARE AT THE THEME PARK!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could have told him that we were in a slaughterhouse for all that matters. I can see that he is still feeling sick and that my quick movement down and back up has not helped him get any better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019M GOING TO HAVE SOME FUN. SO I\u2019LL NEED TO KEEP YOU ASIDE FOR A WHILE\u201d I explain to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for me, PalmsWorld is working in an expansion of the park, which has made a large construction crane readily available for me. I take a few steps towards it and set Jay on its highest part. There is no way in the world he will be able to make it down without the help of someone like me, and I\u2019m one of a kind, so I am pretty certain that he will be there when I\u2019m back. It\u2019s never a bad time to threaten someone though, so I decide to let him know what will happen if he gets any ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU BETTER BE HERE WHEN I\u2019M BACK. I WOULD HATE HAVING TO GET CREATIVE WITH MY FAVORITE POPSTAR\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look in his face tells me that he will not try anything. I blow him a kiss, making sure that I don\u2019t aim straight at him since I don\u2019t want to knock him off the crane I just put him on. Then, I turn back to the park.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>People have finally managed to hold themselves together a little. There are still some crashes in the parking lot, since apparently they are more concerned about me than about the other cars driving on it, but a few are already making it towards the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing things from my vantage point of view has many advantages. One of them is that I can time my movements perfectly. So, the moment the large SUV at the front of the procession has just passed the arch that marks the exit of the parking lot my quite larger right foot sets on top of it and crushes it like a matchbox, sinking it and the remainders of the people inside into yet another of my footprints. A second later, a second car crashes against the side of my foot. I gently shove it away and I turn, facing the parking lot and placing my hands on my hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at least I thought I was gentle, since the vehicle, a minivan, is thrown rolling fifty feet and tramples a group of about a dozen people that were trying to find a suitable vehicle to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHIS IS A GIANT GIRL EMERGENCY\u201d I say in a mocking tone. \u201cALL EXITS ARE TEMPORARILY CLOSED. ANYONE WHO NEEDS TO URGENTLY GET OUT, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO HAVE A WORD WITH ME\u201d I finish as I tap my foot on the ground for added effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one seems too willing to talk to me, so I decide that I need to keep the initiative. I\u2019m looking at the theme park with the anticipation of a little girl looking at a sand box. But one thing I\u2019ve found out in my short experience as a giant is that the only thing better than doing giant stuff is to brag about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI GUESS YOU\u2019LL BE WONDERING WHO I AM\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019M JUST A 21-YEAR-OLD GIRL THAT WANTS TO HAVE FUN IN A THEME PARK. I KNOW I\u2019M NOT YOUR AVERAGE 21-YEAR-OLD, BUT THE BOOST IN HEIGHT ONLY MEANS THAT THERE ARE MORE POSSIBILITIES. NAME\u2019S VICKI, BY THE WAY\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI step over the arch that marks the entrance to the parking lot and let my foot crush a car and a half more. Seeing that I mean business, the doors in every remaining car on the line fly open and people start joining the crowd that is forming between the aisles of parked vehicles. My left foot soon joins my right into the theme park\u2019s grounds as I keep looking down at the mass of humanity trying to get away from me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI GUESS IT MUST SUCK BEING YOU, BUT HEY, IT\u2019S NOT MY FAULT THAT YOU ARE SO SMALL. THE THING IS: I\u2019M HUGE, YOU\u2019RE TINY AND THERE IS NO POINT ON DENYING THAT. IT\u2019S MUCH SMARTER TO EMBRACE IT AND TO REALIZE THAT NOW YOU\u2019VE BECOME PART OF THE FUN\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuite predictably, they don\u2019t take my words too well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH, COME ON. DON\u2019T BE SO GLOOMY. NOT ALL OF YOU ARE GOING TO GET CRUSHED!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve made things any better. It was never my intention, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I said before, it\u2019s amazing how quickly my presence can turn any situation into utter chaos. Just showing up, a few mocking words and a couple of examples of what I\u2019m capable of doing have turned the parking lot into a pandemonium. Just a few steps further the theme park itself is not in much better shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime to start playing. I\u2019m eager to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over my shoulder, I zoom into Jay, still sitting in the spot I set him. He looks a little better now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY JAY! TAKE A GOOD LOOK. MAYBE IT WILL INSPIRE YOU FOR THAT SONG ABOUT ME\u201d I say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I just take a step to the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s nowhere on the parking lot where my foot will be able to land without crushing a few people, so I don\u2019t try to avoid it. I feel half a car and a few bodies sinking into my footprint as I lift my left foot and crush some more stuff, bringing my titanic body deeper into the parking lot. Everything around my foot is crazy. So crazy that a couple of people end up being pushed on top of my right toes. I cannot prevent giggling as I see how tiny their bodies are in comparison to my delicate foot. Then I wiggle my toes and send them flying a few feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy sight is so keen that it soon shows me something I was not actually looking for. On the right side of the parking lot there is the small power substation. I\u2019m not an expert in power or in utilities or in any of that shit, but my guess is that the station feeds the park with the juice the rides need to work. It\u2019s not as if I\u2019m going to actually ride on anything, so I decide that switching the power off will be disruptive for everyone else than me, which is a good enough reason to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk towards the station, not caring too much about what ends under my feet, which unavoidably means that my body count is growing at a fast pace. I wonder to which list I should add the victims that, like now, are crushed just because they are on my path and I decided not to divert it. I guess it does not matter too much to them. It certainly does not to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reach the substation soon enough. Luckily I do not need to be an expert in power transportation or utilities to kill the switch. I just need a well-placed stomp. I remember in the last minute that I have not tested myself against electricity before. I experience a mild shock, not too different from what I would feel if I scuffed my feet along carpet and then I touched something metallic. I wonder what would happen if I actually did that, at my size. The thing is, I cannot really calibrate myself about just how powerful the electrical shock has been. Luckily, at my stature I never run out of resources.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a step back towards the parking lot and crouch. Reaching down I grab a handful of people from the crowd, not minding too much the fact that I\u2019ve been rougher than usual. If things go the way I expect them to go, it won\u2019t matter too much too them in a second. Opening my palm I can see seven pretty startled people on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI step back over the fence of the substation and stomp into a fresh section of it while observing the group in my hand. I receive another mild shock. The effect is anything buy mild on them. They start screaming right away. Their screams do not last for too long, as their spasms start. A couple of seconds later they burn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOUCH\u201d I say, turning my palm and letting them drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, I was right. A substation that can provide enough juice to have a theme park running had to be powerful enough. The fact that I barely felt the electricity is yet another proof of my newfound power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother stomp and the power is completely killed. I\u2019m not sure if it has been the act itself or the actual electricity, but the truth is that I feel a surge of power running through my body. And I was feeling incredibly powerful to start with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can feel the regular noises from the park gradually fading out, the screams of the people being my only soundtrack now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick look inside the premises show me people trapped into rides that have suddenly stopped and some others cramming the spaces between doors that do not open anymore. There was chaos when I arrived. I just managed to make it quite worse. I feel proud of myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI add a few thuds to my soundtrack as I step back into the parking lot and walk towards its center. I\u2019m wondering what to do: play a little more with the crowd at my feet or get going into the park to say \u2018Hi\u2019 to the trapped people on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My mind is made up when I see a panicked driver trampling people with his large SUV as he tries to get out as if the devil was chasing him. I stop his little attempt by placing my foot straight into his path. Of course, I trample some people of my own when doing so, but I\u2019m a giant and he\u2019s not, so I\u2019m the only one with a license to trample.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe barely manages to stop his SUV on time. His bumper actually hits the arch of my foot, but the car was almost stopped when it does, so it does not have too much of an impact. And impact on the car, I mean. I was not expecting any sort of impact on myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI crouch down and grab the car, realizing that it\u2019s much larger than any vehicle I have held so far. It\u2019s also quite sturdier. A quick look at the tank-like shape of the SUV gives me the answer. I\u2019m holding a Hummer H2. As large and sturdy as it may be compared to the rest of the world, the H2 still feels like a toy to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising it to my eyes, I offer a naughty smile to the two screaming people inside. They are two guys and if my guess is right, they are big and muscular. At least by little people\u2019s standards. I decide that I\u2019ll play with them a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLEAVING ALREADY?\u201d I ask in my best bedroom voice. \u201cWERE YOU NOT HAVING FUN IN PALMSWORLD? I GUESS YOU HAVEN\u2019T TRIED THE LATEST ATTRACTION IN THE PARK YET. IT\u2019S CALLED GODDESS RIDE\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI crouch and without too much warning I let myself drop on my ass. Of course, with the parking lot as packed as it is, the addition to the body count is substantial. I decide that they should go to the list of \u201cvictims on purpose\u201d. I\u2019m not doing it out of fairness. It\u2019s just that sitting on a crowd feels so much like the final insult that I decide to take full ownership of the action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dozens of people and cars that have ended under my buttocks are not the only victims of my careless action. All around me people are thrown off their feet and cars bounce, some even turning upside down. I cannot prevent a giggle as I see how little I need to create sheer pandemonium. Since I\u2019m at it, I stretch my legs, pushing a few more cars and people as I do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bring the car back in front of my eyes and take a look at the occupants again. I\u2019ve just trampled countless people to make myself comfortable for them and what I have in mind for them. I hope they value the gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick look to the entrance of the parking lot shows me that people have not been idle as I tormented their colleagues deeper into the lot. A group of them has got as far as my initial footprints and is trying to climb out of them in order to get to the road. Of course, I cannot have that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, I do not need to move to deal with the situation. Resting the H2 in my lap, I reach to my back and unfasten the clasp of my bikini top. I make sure that I am slow and sexy as I remove the shiny black piece and let my glorious 34E\u2019s bounce freely. I\u2019ve never been a shy girl. I have no issues tanning or posing topless, so the web is full of pictures of my knockers. Knowing that I\u2019m quickly becoming the world\u2019s center of attention, I guess that there will soon be a plenty more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding the bikini top in my right hand, I gracefully toss it towards the entrance to the parking lot. My aim is perfect as the shiny piece of swimwear soars over hundreds of heads and lands right in front of the arch that gives access to the premises, blocking the exit and even trapping a couple dozen people under the fabric of its oversized cups. Either the spandex or the wire, which felt so light against my skin, must weigh a few tons now, since the combined efforts of the people at the parking lot entrance are not enough to move it a single inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI DID NOT GIVE ANYONE PERMISSION TO LEAVE\u201d I say, feigning an offended tone. \u201cDON\u2019T MAKE ME COME TO REMIND YOU\u201d I then threaten<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI forget about them, since I know there is no way in the world they will beat my bikini, and focus back on the H2. I pick it up from my lap and bring it back to my face, moving it past my now bare breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m somewhat of an exhibitionist, but this is not the reason I removed my bikini top now. At least, it\u2019s not the main one. I don\u2019t waste too long to explain the real reason to my guests in the H2.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU HAVE AN IMPRESSIVE CAR. WELL, AT LEAST I GUESS IT MUST LOOK IMPRESSIVE FOR PEOPLE YOUR SIZE. BUT THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE CHOSEN IT TELLS ME THAT YOU CARE. SO, YOU WILL HELP ME SOLVE ONE OF MANKIND\u2019S LONGEST STANDING DISPUTES: WOMEN VS CARS. WE HAVE TWO BIG MEN, A FANCY CAR AND THE HOTTEST WOMAN IN THE WORLD, SO I GUESS WE\u2019RE ALL SET\u201d I say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I stoop forward and place the car in the shin of one of my outstretched legs. I start rolling it up my silky skin, easily breaking the parking brake and making the wheels spin against their will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBROOOM, BROOOM\u201d I mock as I keep moving the car along my thig and then over my skimpy bikini bottom. Then, I reach my washboard flat stomach and I lie somewhat back, holding my entire weight in one hand that sinks on the asphalt as the other guides the car around my belly button and in the direction of my chest. I increase the pace as I do so. I could swear that I can hear the screams coming from within the H2 as its occupants see what their destination is. They cannot do anything to prevent it, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI crash the car against the underside of my right tit. It bounces, but I would swear that the only reason it does is that I was the one applying some force to the car. The H2 fares much worse. Taking it back and raising it back to my face, I can see that its hood is severely bent. This is not the funniest consequence though. The fact that my tit made the airbags on the car go off is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckle as I reach to the H2 and finish the job my tit started in breaking the glass of the windshield. Then, I pinch the front airbags with my neatly manicured fingernails and rip them out. In the spot behind them I can see the two very startled occupants of the SUV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU KNOW, PEOPLE ALWAYS SAID THAT MY BOOBS WERE LIKE DUAL AIRBAGS\u201d I tease. They don\u2019t seem to be in good enough shape to reply. I go on, incredibly excited about the entire situation. \u201cYOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAID TOO? THAT THEY WERE LIKE DUAL WRECKING BALLS. I WONDER IF IT\u2019S TRUE\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout giving them any time to react, I sit down and place the car horizontal and right under my right tit. I gently move it up until its roof is touching the sensitive skin on its underside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy breasts enjoy the firmness of my age and of my privileged genetic heritage. Eileen did not have large breasts, but half of the women in the family do, and the general comment the Peterson women have always got was that they defied gravity. Still, I\u2019m the Peterson champion when it comes to bra size.  One of the first comments I got when I started modelling was that my chest was fake. I guess one of the first reasons I started posing topless was to prove everyone wrong, showing that the shape and movement of my breasts was the one you would expect from someone with an amazing natural gift like the one I have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m explaining all this so that you\u2019ll have an easier time picturing what happens when I grab my right tit on my left hand and push it up. My breast fills my hand as I try to push up as much as I can. Then I use the hand that was holding the car to move it upwards, to the spot that was formerly occupied by the apparently soft flesh of my breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime for the test, I think, as I let my tit go. It drops violently on the H2 and I can feel something breaking. It\u2019s obviously not my tit. I remove the car from the spot where it has been trampled by my flesh and see that the roof is partially crushed. I looked through the glassless windshield and hear the screams of two absolutely terrified people as they crouch to fit in the much more compressed space. One of them is noticeably bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWELL, I GUESS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO TITS VERUS CARS, TITS WIN\u201d I mock at the two panicky occupants. \u201cLET\u2019S DO A FINAL TEST\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I grab the pretty mangled car and bring it to my cleavage once more. I\u2019m not wearing a bra anymore, but as I mentioned, my tits have found a way to somehow defy gravity. So, they basically stay close enough to each other for me to slide the battered car into my cleavage and for it to stay in place. I make a show of that by letting the car go and opening my arms, to show anyone who might be watching that I do not need to do anything to hold the H2 between my breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI briefly wonder who might be looking at me. I cannot see any news choppers yet, but in my mind, people should only be doing two things: fleeing from me or looking at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose that are looking at me are in for one of my most impressive shows yet. I bring my hands close to my body again and then grab the side of one amazing boob with each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHASTA LA VISTA\u201d I mock in my cheesy Spanish as I finally push my two massive mounds of flesh together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crushing feeling between them is delicious. I keep my tits smashed a couple more seconds and then rub them in excitement. When I finally let them move back, the flattened remainders of the car peel down my cleavage. I take them with two fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no point on checking on the H2\u2019s occupants. Whatever is left of them is oozing through the cracks. I girlishly toss the car aside and start to stand up. When I\u2019m back at my full height, I let go my last pun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS TOLD ME I\u2019VE GOT A KILLER BODY. I GUESS THEY WERE RIGHT\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cannot prevent giggling at my own joke. No one seems to share my sense of humor. That\u2019s a pretty minor inconvenience of my new condition though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A quick look around shows me how fucked up the parking lot is. There are plenty of my neatly contoured footprints scattered around the parking lot, more often than not containing stuff other than asphalt on their bottom. Add to that a few dozen car crashes and the occasional person lying motionless here and there and you\u2019ll get a better idea on what the situation looks like. Oh, and I guess I should not forget about the bikini top blocking the entrance and the twin craters where my buttocks met the ground, resembling the point of impact of meteorites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, I should better move somewhere else. I think it\u2019s important to remark that I do not do it out of compassion. If anyone still things that I\u2019m a compassionate girl I guess that I have not been explaining myself very well. It\u2019s just that the parking lot is not fun anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe park itself looks much more appealing. And it\u2019s just half a dozen steps away\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI leave the people in the parking lot alone and walk towards the park\u2019s grounds. Of course not everyone in the parking is actually left alone, since my short walk towards the fence unavoidably ends up with some more victims, but I guess you are discounting that already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFree from any restraint, my oversized tits bounce and jiggle as my feet keep causing mild earthquakes every time they set on the ground. In a few seconds I\u2019m standing next to the ankle-height barb wire. It\u2019s obvious that it was not designed to keep people like me either in or out, so I just raise my foot a little more than usual in my next step and I\u2019m suddenly inside PalmsWorld.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m so excited! The best part about being a giantess is that the world has turned into a playground. And there\u2019s nowhere better to realize about how true this is than a theme park. My biggest problem is that there is so much stuff I want to do and so many places in the park I want to visit that I do not know where to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday\u2019s a peak day, with very high attendance, and the short work of the parking lot I\u2019ve recently accomplished has ensured that most of the people is forced to stay and keep me company. I don\u2019t care too much that they don\u2019t seem too happy about it. This does not mean that I cannot tease them about it, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY EVERYONE SEEMS SO UNHAPPY\u201d I say, mocking as usual. \u201cTHIS PLACE IS GLORIOUS\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople want to get away from me, but they just can\u2019t. The ones that are the most terrified are probably those that are trapped in their unmoving rides as a result of my little dealing with the power substation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to put myself in their shoes, but it\u2019s hard to. I mean, I know I\u2019ve been like this only for a short while, but somehow it\u2019s already hard to picture myself as one of the tiny, puny fuckers. In any case, I guess that if I were one of them I would be upset at having my fun day in the park suddenly turning into a nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any warning, I crouch and reach into the crowd. By the time I stand up again, a young man in shorts and a red T-shirt is screaming as I hold him between two fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT\u2019S YOUR FAVORITE RIDE HERE?\u201d I ask, trying to enroll his help to make my mind up on what to do next<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at me, incredibly startled. Rolling my eyes, I add:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTELL ME AND I\u2019LL LET YOU GO. PROMISE\u201d I say, crossing the fingers of my free hand for him to see<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFree fall\u201d he says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSOUNDS INTERESTING\u201d I genuinely say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is looking at me with pleading eyes. I do what no one is expecting: I stay true to my word. Crouching down, I set the man in one of the areas that have emptied next to my right foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI WOULD GET OUT IF I WERE YOU. AFTER ALL THE WORK IN SETTING YOU DOWN I\u2019D HATE IT IF I ENDED UP ACCIDENTALLY STEPPING ON YOU\u201d I lie<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe does not waste any time in complying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe free fall sounds interesting. It\u2019s almost at the back of the park, but that is hardly an issue. Well, at least not for me. I guess that it\u2019s an issue for the people on the ground that are trying to stay away from my footfalls. I hardly consider them as I keep my eyes to my sides, looking at the rides I\u2019m walking by. They are the only things here that are at my scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI playfully run a finger along the tracks of what boasts being the tallest rollercoaster in West Coast as I walk past it and eye the car stopped right on top of the starting ramp. It\u2019s filled with people. I wink at them and blow them a kiss as I tell them \u201cWAIT FOR ME HERE\u201d. As if they had any other option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unfamiliar crushing feeling makes me look down for the first time in a few steps. It takes me a second to understand what I\u2019ve just stepped on. An ice-cream cart! My sole feels a little colder than usual but my attention is grabbed by something else. The ice-cream guy is also there. Well, half of him is, his torso and head poking from my toe. His screams are the loudest and most anguished I\u2019ve heard so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven I am surprised that I cannot feel even a tiny bit of empathy for the little guy. To me the situation just registers as curious. Things get even more interesting when the screaming man\u2019s eyes look up and lock into mine, staring at him over my protruding naked breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDO YOU WANT ME TO PUT YOU OUT OF YOUR MISERY?\u201d I ask. I\u2019m being sincere, this time. After a long second, the man nods so I just slide my foot forward and end his suffering with the ease someone would fix a wrinkle on a rug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could not be less bothered about what I just did. In the end, he is barely one in a list that must have already gone beyond a thousand. To say that I\u2019m not annoyed about anything I\u2019ve done would be an understatement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ve never been a reflexive person, so the thought that the old me would have never thought so lightly about ending human life holds on just for a brief instant. I easily shrug it off by realizing that the old me would have never been able to kill anyone with such ease. Let\u2019s face it, my perception on human life changed once it became possible to snuff a dozen of them in one step. And, having millions of them readily available, I guess that I could say that human life has become sort of a commodity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know anyone listening to this will think that I\u2019m a monster. Well, you can always do as I do. If you don\u2019t like me you can try to step on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI keep advancing through the park and finally reach the free fall. I cannot contain a very wide smile when I see that one of the platforms is at the ride\u2019s peak and that it\u2019s full of people. It\u2019s not one of the tallest free falls in the world, barely a couple hundred feet in height. This basically means that my bare nipples are rudely pointing at the forty or so screaming people in the platform as I stop right in front of it and smile at its occupants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides the screams, they react in the strangest ways. It\u2019s soon obvious that they are trapped by the locking system. A group of them seem to coordinate with each other and start pushing up, trying to break the lock and to break free from their seats. A minute ago no one was trying that, no doubt too afraid of the risk of falling to the ground below. But now that I\u2019m around their priorities seem to have changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI easily stopped their attempts by resting my right thumb on the bar, which spans the 8 seats on the front row. Then I push down, undoing any progress they had achieved with their combined efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCAN\u2019T YOU SEE THAT BREAKING FREE IS DANGEROUS?\u201d I ask mockingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey scream, I\u2019m not sure if out of fear or out of frustration for having been so easily defeated by a single digit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cACTUALLY YOU SHOULD BUCKLE UP TIGHTER\u201d I say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir screams intensify again. I guess they imagine what\u2019s coming. It\u2019s not as if I\u2019ve been too subtle, is it? I go on with my plan, anyway, pushing my thumb down and making the bar push on the eight people\u2019s legs. I don\u2019t need to do too much to crush them. Now I\u2019m sure that the screams are out of agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLOOK GUYS, I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY. YOU ARE TRAPPED HERE BECAUSE OF ME\u201d I say to the broader group, teasing as always. \u201cI GUESS IT MUST SUCK, COMING TO THE PARK, PAYING YOUR TICKET AND SUDDENLY NOT BEING ABLE TO ENJOY THE RIDES BECAUSE A GIANT BITCH JUST SWITCHED THE POWER OFF. I FEEL BAD ABOUT IT. REALLY. AND I WANT TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, they are not buying into my tease. Who would? But then again, who cares? I just reach out to the platform and grab one end in each hand. Then I push up and I easily break it from its gears and brakes. A couple of seconds later, the platform remains at two-hundred feet in height only because of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI push my chest closer to the ripped platform, poking a few screaming people with my nipples and giggling. Then I say:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLUCKILY, IT\u2019S WITHIN MY POWER TO HELP WITH THE FREE FALL. HERE, SEE\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone knows what\u2019s coming. I just let go of the platform and watch it drop 200 feet. It spectacularly crashes right in front of my toes, sending parts flying around. I don\u2019t need any medical training to diagnose the people on it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With the free fall gone, I need to move somewhere else. Being my height has many advantages. In PalmsWorld once of them is that I can see what\u2019s going on in the section of the park I\u2019m in but also what\u2019s going on in the section of the park on top of the cliff, since it does not even reach as high as my boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk towards it, moving along the cable car that joins both halves of the park. I look down at the unmoving cars at hip level and smirk when I see that there are people trapped on them too. I will mess with them, of course, but it will be later. It\u2019s not as if they are going to go anywhere else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople in the park have been reacting to my presence, of course. The areas immediately around me have somewhat emptied. With the park as crowded as it is this only means that there are other areas that have got even more packed. And at the speed I\u2019m moving I unavoidably end up in one of them soon enough. It\u2019s not as if I do too much to avoid it, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stop when my toes are right behind the crowd. I\u2019ve never seen them packed so tightly before. They look even tinier, like this. Just seeing how many of them there are in such a confined space has this effect. In comparison my once delicate foot looks like a behemoth, dwarfing them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ve stepped on plenty of people in my short experience as a giant, but I have never been in a situation where one step could be so fatal. I was talking about a dozen people before. I\u2019m pretty sure I can get quite a few more under my sole. I\u2019m explaining all of this not because I\u2019m having second thoughts. Far from that. It\u2019s just that I feel curious. I exercise my curiosity in a very simple way: by taking a step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ignore the usual screams and focus on the feelings on my sole as my foot barely stops at the layer of humanity and then keeps sinking on the asphalt, as usual. The remainder of the crowd was so close to my foot that the moment it makes the asphalt buckle a few of them are pulled towards it. Some even fall on top of my toes, which is a feeling that I start loving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI allow enough time for all the new feelings of what I\u2019ve done to sink in. So, when my left foot joins in an equally crowded spot, it\u2019s quite more unremarkable. Two more steps and I\u2019m standing by the cliff. I had judged correctly. It reaches mid-riff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m about to get a hold of the cliff\u2019s edge to push myself up when have another idea. I\u2019m not just big. I\u2019m bulletproof and I have \u201ctractor beam vision\u201d. I\u2019m pretty sure I also got the super breath and laser vision my sister had and happily used. I\u2019m pretty sure that I should be able to do plenty of other stuff. A girl like me should not push herself up.  Instead, I just lightly flex my knees and jump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out I have not estimated my strength correctly. As a matter of fact, I have greatly underestimated it. My body soars over the edge of the cliff and keeps climbing. I easily clear the edge and climb a distance approximately equivalent to my own height before I start dropping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI land gracefully, imitating the gesture of a gymnast with my arms, barely flexing my knees. My boobs bounce a little, which is unavoidable, given their proportions, but my execution has been as perfect as Nadia Comaneci\u2019s in the Olympics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyone seeing me from a distance can only have been impressed. I\u2019m pretty sure those in the area I landed have second thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder, not for the first time, how to call what I have become. Giant Super Girl? Super Girl Giant? Super Giant Girl? Then I realize that there is already a word to describe my new self: goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet\u2019s see. A goddess is supposed to be all-powerful. Check. She is also supposed to be of great beauty. Check. What else\u2026 yeah, a goddess is supposed to be worshipped. I don\u2019t know where I stand on that. I mean, no one has been worshipping me so far, which is kind of expected. I am sure that I can get plenty of people to worship me, if I want to, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing is: I don\u2019t know if I want to. It sounds boring. I mean, I\u2019m out for fun, so I\u2019d rather be a naughty goddess than a serious one. I can always get people worshipping me later, if I feel like taking a break. Right now I feel like playing though, so I start walking towards my next destination: the pirate ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s amazing how many things in a theme park can be fucked off by an electricity cut. Apparently every locking mechanism in the park is dependent on power, which means that the majority of the rides are still occupied by the latest people to get on them. The pirate ship is not an exception.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reach it and am welcomed by the usual screams. Being quite shorter than some of the rides I\u2019ve messed with, I need to crouch down to get a good look at it. I then sit down, to get more comfortable. I choose the front part of the ship and then spread my legs apart so that the ship is facing my crotch and each of my legs runs along each of the ship\u2019s sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHELLO\u201d I say in my best innocent voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems that my giant bombshell body is having a much more noticeable effect on the people than my voice, since they don\u2019t seem to get any more relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think everyone knows what I\u2019m going to do, so I cut the crap and just get to it. Resting a finger on the ships prow, I push and am rewarded by the entire structure moving backwards, following the pendulum movement it was designed to follow. I am gentle and just wait for the ship to come back to position, being stopped by my finger again. I flex it and push once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people has not stopped screaming, but now their screams are closer to the ones of someone being thrilled at a theme park ride. I start to gradually bring the intensity up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImagine a little girl, sitting alone, pushing a small wooden horse over and over. How long do you think it would take her to get fed up? Not too long, right? Well, that\u2019s me with the pirate ship. I hold a little longer just because torturing the people makes things a little more interesting. Soon I realize that there is not much more to do with a pirate ship ride than pushing it with a finger. When I do, I come to the conclusion that the only interesting thing remaining for me is to check just how much strength I hold in a single digit. It\u2019s the point where I push the ship with all the force I can muster. It\u2019s too much, apparently. At least for the ship, which is violently sent back, hitting its brake and then breaking the mast from the hinges it was attached to in order to follow the pendulum. The entire ship is detached from the structure of the ride and sent rolling into the area on its back, trampling a few of the people that were still there. All I can do is to look cute and say \u201cOOOPS\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get on all fours and sexily cat walk to the spot where the ship has finally come to a rest. My massive tits hung like pendulums as I advance towards the ship. I stop when my head is directly above it. There are still some screams, which means that not everyone is dead, which kind of surprises me. I\u2019ve got used quite quickly to the fact that tiny people seem to have pretty short lifespans when they are around me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU ARE SOME TOUGH LITTLE PEOPLE\u201d I say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey don\u2019t seem too happy with my praise. Based on the anguished screams it\u2019s clear that quite a few of them are not in great shape. The ones that are more or less OK seem to be trying something. I easily see what they are trying to accomplish: to break free of the locks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are battered beyond the point where teasing them makes any sense. Actually, for the first time since I grew through the hotel, I give a damn about some tinies, even if I have to search very deep inside me to find the feeling. So, when I reach out with my right hand the panic level increases but I do not actually do anything to justify that reaction. I just take hold of the stern of the boat with my other hand and use two fingers to easily break the locking mechanism that a dozen tinies could not move an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI repeat the operation half a dozen times and as a result of it, close to a hundred people are freed from their entrapment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU ARE WELCOME\u201d I say, winking<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realize right then that I\u2019ve been too kind. One of the tinies looks at me and pleads for help!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, help us. We cannot get out of the ship\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDO YOU THINK THAT\u2019S MY PROBLEM?\u201d I ask, not believing that he actually dared to ask. \u201cI\u2019VE ALREADY WASTED TOO LONG WITH YOU. GET SOME HELP, GET A LADDER OR\u2026 YOU KNOW\u2026 GROW A LITTLE. IT WORKED FOR ME\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout letting him reply, I stand up and step over the wreck of the pirate ship, forgetting about the tiny people onboard almost as quickly as I found them.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The upper part of PalmsWorld is getting emptier. I realize that the parking lot in this section is still pretty much unscratched, allowing people to flee. I feel bad about it for a moment, but I\u2019m a practical girl so there\u2019s no point on worrying too much about it when I have half the park still crowded enough for me to play. So, I just walk back the way I came and when I reach the cliff\u2019s edge I just let myself drop, my feet hitting the lower section like a bomb as I barely have to bend my knees to absorb the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s obvious that people here do not like to have me around once more. I guess that the ones that have been pulverized under my feet as I dropped are amongst the least enthusiast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU DID NOT THINK YOU HAD GOT RID OF ME, HAD YOU?\u201d I ask, mocking<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving people around reinvigorates me. It\u2019s a great feeling, actually. I unconsciously put some more swagger into my movement as I walk towards one of the places I spotted during my initial walk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get to the rollercoaster soon enough. I stop next to its tallest point and feel even a little frustrated when I see that it reaches a few inches (to my new reference frame, of course\u2026 I guess that we could be talking about a couple dozen feet, in reality) above my head. It\u2019s the first thing I meet that is taller than me and I don\u2019t like it. It is curious how quickly one gets used to being the biggest thing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decide here and now that the rollercoaster will pay the insolence of having tried to make me feel smaller. But not yet. First I want to play. The people in the car have not gone anywhere, so they are going to be my playmates. Or being more precise, they are going to be my toys. After all, the entire rollercoaster spreads out in front of me like nothing more than an elaborate model train set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk around the tracks, observing the details and trying to understand the route the car is supposed to make. It\u2019s a pretty nice rollercoaster, I conclude, filled with loops and twists. I stop when I reach a tight bend and smirk when I realize that a couple of steps in a straight line there is an artificial lake. I quickly devise a game in my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI work on the tracks. Once I\u2019m done I move back and soon enough I\u2019m standing right next to her car. It\u2019s about face level and all the reply I get to my warm smile are louder screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY EVERYONE IS SO LITTLE WELCOMING TO ME\u201d I joke. \u201cALL I WANT TO DO IS MAKE UP FOR HAVING STOPPED EVERY RIDE IN THE PARK BY LETTING YOU ENJOY WHAT YOU PAID FOR\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I finish saying that, I bring two fingers behind the car and start pushing it up, bringing it and the twenty-four people on board to the top of the ramp. It\u2019s going to be a free fall down the ramp, from there onwards, and if my calculations are right, this should give the car enough momentum to keep going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe car reaches its departing point and I address again the screaming people:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI EVEN MADE SOME IMPROVEMENTS TO THE ROLLERCOASTER\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI give the car the final push and it starts falling at amazing speed down the initial ramp. It then reaches the first bend and takes it with a screech, keeping its speed and reaching the first loop. It\u2019s working, so I feel satisfied and move to the spot where I made the modification. The tight bend in front of the lake is not a bend anymore. Some quick work of my fingers was enough to tear the tracks apart, the stainless steel no match for my goddess\u2019 strength. Then, I bent the tracks upwards, creating an exit ramp that faces straight to the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe game I devised is actually pretty simple: I want to know if the rollercoaster car will have enough momentum to reach the lake or not. I sit down, stretch my legs and wait for the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tinies in the car yell like most people do in rollercoasters. I think they know the situation is somewhat different, though. The moment of truth is approaching and I feel excitement. I actually don\u2019t know what is going to happen and I feel genuinely curious. The car takes the last loop and exits it with quite a lot of speed, which makes me confident. Then it advances along the tracks and finally gets into the last ramp, the one I created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt flies. For a second it reminds me of the bike scene at ET, only much smaller, of course. I think it\u2019s going to make it when the car suddenly reaches its highest point and starts dropping. It falls short of the lake by about a couple of feet (again, my scale\u2026 I can\u2019t be bothered to make the effort of trying to think in regular human distances anymore). The crashing sound is pretty loud as the car hits the concrete and breaks into two, the links between its two halves not able to sustain the impact. I hear some more screams as the car rolls over itself and finally drops into the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cannot fool myself. This is not what I was seeking for when I prepared the game. I wonder if it\u2019s still worth half a point, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI forget about the people in the car (there\u2019s no way they are going to make it out of the water on their own and no way I will waste my time on them) and stand up again. The rollercoaster\u2019s possibilities for fun are over, but there is still a little matter I need to take care about. I walk back to the loop that gets a few inches above my head and reach to it with my hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling how the steel of the structure is easily ripped as I pull the tracks apart with my hands is stimulating. Feeling it bend as I push it down is even better. The loop is no longer taller than me, but I feel like making a point out of what I\u2019m doing. The tracks continue to easily twist and bend as I manipulate them with my hands, feeling that not only I\u2019m huge but that I also have the unlimited power of a God, which is what I\u2019ve actually become. By the time I\u2019ve finished, the tracks are tightly knotted together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn around and look for something else to do. The park has somehow emptied. I look to the parking lot and see that it\u2019s just as packed as it was when I left it, with my bikini top effectively blocking the exit. I span the rest of the park\u2019s grounds with my sight and find out where the people is going. A few of them are in the central lake. They have probably thought that I would not go there. The truth is that they probably had a good idea, although now that I see them there I\u2019m having second thoughts and considering the pay them a visit. I see that there are others that have managed to get to the open waters of the Pacific Ocean, escaping through an opening in the outer fence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI keep spanning the park and something else catches my interest almost immediately. I still feel bad about the tiny people trying to outsmart me so looking in the direction of the fence people is escaping through I set my eyes on a large construction container on the outer side and then bat my eyelashes. I smile as I feel the pressure building at my whim. A second later the large crate is engulfed by bluish energy and is completely under my control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was right before. Moving things with my eyes is quite harder than just doing the same with my hands because I\u2019m completely untrained. But I\u2019m getting better at it and I\u2019m sure that I have quite a lot of room for improvement. Moving the crate ends up being quite easier than capturing the chopper and in a second I\u2019ve lifted it over the fence and I\u2019m maneuvering it in the direction of the opening. It drops when I release it, crushing a few people that were still halfway through and blocking the way for the rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI THOUGHT I HAD BEEN CLEAR ABOUT THIS GUYS\u201d I say. \u201cNO ONE LEAVES UNLESS I SAY SO\u201d I add, in a voice loud enough for the entire park to here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With this matter now settled, I am free to move towards my next destination. In a dozen steps I\u2019m standing in front of a Ferris wheel that\u2019s just about my height. And practically every cart on it has a few panicky people inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Ferris wheel is supposed to be a quiet ride. It\u2019s the sort of place tired parents go or the type of ride a guy would bring his date to when they are starting to go out together. It\u2019s slow, it offers a great view and it\u2019s romantic. I\u2019m about to change that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, I reach the wheel and grab some of the radii. Then, without further delay I push it, much as if I were playing the roulette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ve been telling you about just how strong I\u2019ve become. The Ferris wheel proves the fact once more as it starts spinning at several times the speed it was designed to move. People inside do not even have the time to scream. Not prepared for this sort of violent movements, the Ferris wheel does not fashion any type of seatbelts or locks so people in each of the carts is basically being thrown around as the wheel furiously spins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the unavoidable happens. I hear some metal groaning sounds and some hinges start to break. The wheel is still holding, but it\u2019s obvious that it won\u2019t hold too much longer. I just reach out and stop it on its tracks in a sure move. Those in the carts right in front of my eyes are thrown around even more violently, as the centrifugal force of the wheel is suddenly stopped and gravity kicks in once more. I even see some red smears in the glass of a few carts. Ouch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let go of the wheel and see that it\u2019s not going to hold. It starts leaning and I see that it will fall on its side. I don\u2019t want that, so I basically hold the wheel with both hands and pull, finishing the demolition work on my own. Then I lift it from the structure and smirk as the entire wheel is now resting its weight in nothing else but me. I have to say that I\u2019m not even strained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to make a decision now. What does a girl like me do with a Ferris wheel of her own size? A quick look to the side shows me that even if I blocked the exit there are still quite a number of people packing the area right in front of the fence that people were using to flee before. This makes my mind up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, I rest the wheel on the ground and make an effort to keep it balanced. Then I push it and see with a smirk that the wheel is rolling and advancing. I did not give too much speed to it, but that hardly matters. The Ferris wheel is moving in the direction I wish it to move in a slow but ponderous motion. And since no one besides me can do anything to stop it, all I have to do is to face the crowd and wait for the wheel to reach them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough they\u2019ve seen it coming. Who wouldn\u2019t? But they cannot do anything about it. Of course, they try to flee, to get out of the way, and some of them actually achieve it. But when the Ferris wheel reaches the crowd it keeps going, rolling over the people until it hits the container I previously placed by the fence and topples. The wheel debates which side to fall on for an instant. I decide to help it so batting my eyelashes again I let go a brief burst of tractor beam and pull the wheel towards me. It falls on top of the remainder of the crowd as I let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI snort, amused. Then I look for something else to do. There\u2019s not too much. Most everything around me is either uninteresting or broken. I realize that I\u2019ve exhausted the fun possibilities of the park in a very short while. And the scattered tiny people at my feet remind me that I\u2019ve killed plenty of them as I was doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ve had a ton of fun but it has felt short. I come to the realization that my size has a million pros, but it also comes with a few cons. My possibilities have increased a million-fold, but so have my needs. A massive park like PalmsWorld is nothing more than a divertimento for a short while now, a quickly exhausted source of fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI almost slap myself when I realize about how absurd my train of thought is. Sure, a theme park can offer me just a short time of fun, but why would I need more? It\u2019s not as if I\u2019m stuck in PalmsWorld only! The entire city of Palmsdale has become my amusement park and there are thousands of potential sources for fun and millions of people for me to play with in there. And when I\u2019m done with it\u2026 well, I still have an entire country and then an entire planet to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, I should stop whining and start moving towards my next stop. I just need to take care of one last thing. The thing I came to PalmsWorld for in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk back towards the cliff and step by the cable car. There are plenty of people still trapped on it. More than a cable car it actually looks closer to the chairlifts in ski stations, which make it work even better for what I have in mind. I crouch and smile at the people trapped on it, with their legs dangling in the air, then reach out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI only need one of the pairs of chairs, really, but I want it as undamaged as possible. This makes me choose one that\u2019s obviously empty. As everything I\u2019ve done so far, I easily pluck it out from the cable car. I have what I wanted. Time to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it would be just unnatural to leave the people in the chairlift without even saying \u201cHi\u201d. I don\u2019t say anything though. I just rip a section of the cable and snort as I see the chairs start sliding down the cable, which has suddenly lost tension, and into the ground below. It looks like a short drop to me, but I believe that the tinies see it otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI forget about them and walk back towards the park\u2019s entrance. I think that people guessed I would do that, since my path is emptier than I expected. The occasional person still ends up under my foot as I advance, but a considerably smaller number than in my way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI crouch to pick up my bikini top and head towards the construction crane where I left Jay before getting into the park.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStooping to bring my face level with his tiny form, I smile at him and ask:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDID YOU HAVE A GOOD LOOK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods even if he does not look too excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHOW ARE WE WITH THE SONG?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks nervous. I frown and decide to give him an incentive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLOOK, JAY, DARLING\u2026I ONLY HAVE TWO INTERESTS IN YOU. ONE IS YOUR MUSIC. THE OTHER IS MORE SEXUAL IN NATURE. LET ME SAY IT LIKE THIS: YOU DON\u2019T WANT MY INTEREST IN YOU TO BECOME EXCLUSIVELY SEXUAL\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease, I will write something\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU\u2019D BETTER DO\u201d I threaten, even if I use a sweet voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI set the chair next to him and say \u201cCLIMB\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks questioning. I have better things to do than explaining myself, so I just say \u201cJUST TO BE CLEAR\u2026 I WAS NOT SUGGESTING YOU THAT CLIMBING WAS AN OPTION. GET THE FUCK IN!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know which kind of twisted logic makes me enjoy the fact that I am able to scare my favorite popstar so easily. I guess that my new size can do that to logic too. The fact is that the climbs, anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBUCKLE UP\u201d I command. He wastes no time to follow this last command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting the bikini top in the construction crane I reach towards my left ear and remove the golden loop on it. It was hidden under my long and wavy light brown hair, but it grew with me, just like everything else I was wearing in the photoshoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s then very easy to bend the pole of the chair where Jay is sitting at around the golden loop and make it hang from it. Once I finish the operation I proceed to put the earring on again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGOOD! NOW I CAN CARRY YOU AROUND WITHOUT A HASSLE\u201d I say excitedly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s only one last thing I need to do before leaving. I put the bikini top on. I\u2019m not a bashful girl, so I would not have minded rampaging the city topless. But I don\u2019t want to leave my attire here and I reason that I can always take it out again later, if I want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cannot be more content as I turn, look towards Downtown in the distance and try to decide how to have some more fun!</span></div></div>",

A few buildings are down, the streets are deserted and littered with rubble and more often than not abandoned vehicles are crushed beyond recognition. With a landscape like this the number of victims needs to be necessarily high, and it\u2019s easy enough from my height to see them scattered around or, more often than not, turned into unrecognizable stains in the bottoms of the depressions that I know are nothing else than my footprints.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite what you may think, I\u2019m not a sadist, but I would lie if I said that I\u2019m not thoroughly impressed with myself at having been able to wreak so much havoc with so little effort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know the area offers no more incentives, so I just calmly walk along it, ignoring the hip-high hotels and other buildings as I progress. I\u2019m calm and content, the noise of my footsteps being the only thing accompanying me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t want to be calm and content for too long, of course. I\u2019m eager to keep playing with the city and to keep having fun. I just need to decide how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA city like Palmsdale offers countless possibilities for a girl like me. I stop at a point where the road bends and place my hands on my hips. Then I start scanning the landscape. The area of the city I\u2019m in is somewhat away from the real Downtown. It\u2019s more of a touristy area than anything else. The city is still far away but thankfully I have my enhanced vision to take a good look at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing I notice is that a couple of miles or so away people are still minding their own business. This somehow upsets me. Haven\u2019t they learned yet that I\u2019m here to play? Well, I guess they haven\u2019t, so I make a determination to change that very soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething catches my eye in that general area. I smile when I see the city train. Mass transportation vehicles are so appealing to girls my size! The train achieves something else. It reminds me of my sister once more. One of the most repeated images of her on TV was the moment when she made a speed train derail after \u201ccutting\u201d the tracks with her laser vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laser vision\u2026 the most remarkable attribute of my sister, besides her size, when she terrorized River City thirteen years ago. It\u2019s about time I use it. Of course, I\u2019m pretty sure I have it. I even found out I had another impressive ability with my eyes. But nothing can compare to making things go boom with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI focus on a spot in the tracks that is ahead enough of the commuter train. And then I wish that I can project laser beams from my eyes. It\u2019s that easy. I feel the pressure building behind my eyes once again and this time I know that it\u2019s going to be entirely different. Everything in my field of vision turns into different shades of red and the spot my eyes are set get a higher red intensity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s how you aim it, then\u201d I think, marveling at the fact that it\u2019s so easy to master a power such like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realize that I\u2019m also controlling the intensity so, focusing a little bit, I feel the pressure behind my eyes getting higher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s like riding a bike, as if I had always had it\u201d my mind adds<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s time to let go. It\u2019s spectacular. I see the spot I was aiming at start to deform and then I realize it\u2019s melting. I can even zoom into it and see how the twin beams I\u2019m projecting from my eyes are merging together and digging a deep trench in the tracks, just where I wanted it to be. I realize that I can keep it on or turn it off. I do the latter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world turns back to its original colors and my ears start focusing on the sounds in the distance. Despite the fact that I\u2019m two miles away I can hear the screams of the people that do not have any clue where the two intense beams of energy have come from and the screeching sound of the train\u2019s brakes as it unavoidably heads towards the puddle of lava I\u2019ve created in the spot where the tracks were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first car cannot stop in time and partially falls into the lava. It\u2019s not nice, as the superheated rock I have so easily created eats into the metal of the train car and starts disintegrating it. Thankfully for the rest of the convoy, the rest of the train had little enough momentum to stop in time. It derails, of course, but it\u2019s not that spectacular, which tells me that the train is still in good enough shape for me to play with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realize at that moment that I\u2019ve been holding something off. I let out a very loud moan, making some of the people in the area I\u2019m focusing to turn and look in my direction, seeing me for the first time. I bring my hand inside my bikini bottom and realize that it\u2019s as damp as it can be. God, this was nearly orgasmic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think that I will need to do something about it sooner rather than later when I realize that the people are not minding their own business anymore. They are terrified, and I guess that they are right to be. I\u2019m not set to killing them just for the sake of it, but I would lie if I said that I don\u2019t think that plenty of them will end up dead if I let myself get carried away too much, which is likely to happen.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cHELLO\u201d I say, focusing my powerful voice so that it can be heard despite the great distance. I can see their expressions and know that they can understand me. \u201cI\u2019M VICKI AND I\u2019M EAGER TO MEET YOU. I\u2019LL BE THERE IN A MINUTE\u201d I say cutely<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey don\u2019t seem to like my declaration of intentions. A large area of the avenue, which was living in perfect normality until just a minute ago, is now the perfect image of chaos. People have seen me and are now trying to run in the opposite direction to the one I\u2019m at, which is perfectly normal. Only it\u2019s not what I want them to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look around, trying to decide how I\u2019m going to stop them. Because I\u2019m going to stop them. I mean, no one does anything I don\u2019t want to without me doing something about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI find the answer to my question soon enough. There is an overpass three blocks down the road. I focus on it and the world turns red once more. I don\u2019t let the intensity increase too much now. I just focus some more, until the pillars of the overpass become redder. Then, I let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConcrete heats at temperatures close to a thousand degrees as I keep my laser vision on for as long as it takes for it to start melting. I can hear the screams of those on top of the bridge but I don\u2019t care. I just keep going until the bridge starts tilting. It comes down with a loud crash, people on it getting consumed as they fall on the overheated area I created.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOUCH\u201d I say as I realize about the unexpected consequence of my action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe results are more or less the expected ones, though, as the people that were fleeing down the street are suddenly stopped by the impossible obstacle I created. A few start moving into side streets, which of course, I don\u2019t like either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, I can do something about that as well. I bat my long mascara covered eyelashes a couple of times and the world changes to a bluish color. Just for fun, I target a few of the people moving into a side street and lock them into my control. Then, I playfully lift them in the air. Everyone comes to a stop and screams intensify as they see a dozen of their comrades hovering above their heads. I keep them there, to make everyone realize about the futility of trying to get away from me. Then, I get tired and I toss them around like rag dolls. They scream as I do and make everyone else stop on their tracks, now knowing where to go in order to be safe. I take advantage of the momentary stop to pick up a bus with my tractor beam. Hell, I\u2019m getting better at it! I can hold the bus and move it around with much less effort than I did when I just started, a while ago.  I make the bus hover over the heads of terrified citizens, just for fun. They don\u2019t know when and where I\u2019m going to make it land and I guess that by now they\u2019ll have already realized that I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s on top of them. It\u2019s not, for a change. I just toss it into the intersection, blocking it as it gets into one of the side streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople turn and try to flee in the opposite direction. Poor little things. I easily stop them by switching modes once more and letting another controlled red beam out, making the fa\u00e7ade of the building that is marking the intersection explode. Large chunks of the fa\u00e7ade rain down into the intersection and bury a few people. They also block the path for the rest. Just to make sure about it, I switch modes once more and I rearrange the boulders, creating a wall that\u2019s tall enough for anyone of standard height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople turn and for the first time, they start running backwards, towards me. True, I\u2019m still pretty far away, but this does not mean that I\u2019m harmless. Everyone comes to a stop again when they are greeted by half a dozen vehicles hovering in the air just in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod! Now I really have to focus. I wonder if I bit on more than I can chew when I decided to scan not one but six cars into my tractor beam. It reminds me that I might be getting better but I still have not trained this new \u201cmuscle\u201d of my body enough. I\u2019m stubborn, so I do not let go, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople are somewhat hesitant to move under the cars, since I guess they know that I could drop them on their heads easily. I smirk and since they are not coming to the cars, I bring the cars to them. Things start becoming a little easier as my mind, which was originally straining, is getting better at controlling the six vehicles I scanned into my control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bring them back past the intersection. Then I move the cars back a little and let them drop one on top of the next, creating a new wall and boxing a sizeable group of people in the space of about a city block.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m very encouraged by the results of what I\u2019ve been doing and, why not say it, also incredibly aroused. There are some more people in the previous block. I\u2019m thinking on what to do with them when I decide than rather than box them up I shall bring them to the box. This is going to be my most challenging attempt yet. I take a deep breath, bat my eyelashes and zoom out a little to take a good look at the entire block. Then, I start mentally switching my focus over everyone on the area until every last person is marked dark blue. I wonder how many people I\u2019m attempting to scan. I get the answer almost immediately: one hundred and seventeen. Of course, it\u2019s only fair that once I have the power to move things around with my eyes and my mind, I should have the ability to get a count. I take a deep breath and go on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn entire block worth of people is lifted in the air at unison. They scream, their bodies suddenly losing control over their movement just because I decided to. It\u2019s amazing. Absolutely amazing. I moan again as I bring my hand to my wet womanhood and decide that I will need to do something about it soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to concentrate on the people in my hold, though. I try to move them closer together\u2026 and I get it. Soon, the entire block of people forms a tighter group, hovering what must be twenty of their feet above the road.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know I can do anything I want to them and I guess they know it too, since they scream and look as terrified as anyone I\u2019ve seen. I know that facing a woman like me is scary. I\u2019ve seen plenty of people since I got to my new condition. But I realize that uncertainty is even scarier, and this is just what\u2019s happening to the people I\u2019m holding captive. In a way, it\u2019s as if I were a giant puppeteer, messing with the world with my strings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m eager to play some more, I just move the hundred and seventeen people forward and set them right above the city block that I\u2019ve so easily blocked from the distance. Then I let them drop, trying to be more or less gentle, even if it\u2019s hard to be overly conscious about the fragility of the people I was holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere you have! I have over two hundred and people trapped and I did not even have to walk over there in order to do it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, the next thing I want to do is to walk over there and take a good look at them. They are a couple of miles away, so it takes me about a minute to reach them, walking at a casual pace, my feet sinking on the pavement as usual while the waist-high buildings on both sides of the avenue mark a path for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe area is mostly deserted, so there are only a few scattered people around. I guess that my size and the speed of my movements must make me unpredictable for the little, since otherwise there would be little explanation for their erratic movements and for the fact that, from time to time, a tiny man or woman ends up right in the spot where my foot is going to land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOUT OF THE WAY TINIES!\u201d I say with the voice of someone scolding a little child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not as if they are not trying, of course, but they are not as successful as they would like to be. Well, it\u2019s going to hurt them more than me, so I\u2019m hardly worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get to the spot where the train de-railed and I see that I ignored it for too long. People have managed to get out of the cars that did not fall into the lava puddle, and the lava itself has solidified. It would have been interesting to play with it, but with no people on it, it is significantly less interesting than the crowd I have trapped from the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reach the closest wall to the trap I boxed them in and stop, widening my stance and placing both my hands at my hips, looking as commanding as I am sexy. It\u2019s great to see what I have achieved thanks only to my superpowers. Having a closer look makes me excited again and makes me let out a soft moan once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I realize that I have not really thought what I would do with the people once I reached them. Of course, they could not be more uncomfortable with my presence. I\u2019m eager to mess with them, but how?</span></div></div>",

I giggle, thinking that it\u2019s actually going to be quite a lot of fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping my commanding pose, I say:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLISTEN TO ME CAREFULLY\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome people does as I commanded, but most of them are just looking over their shoulders as they keep running along the box without too much purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWE ARE GOING TO PLAY A GAME\u201d I announce, but no one seems too excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realize that I will need to incentive them. I have a couple of more destructive ideas when I think that I should not worry too much about people not doing what I want when I can just make them do it. I bat my eyelashes and prepare for my biggest challenge yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen seconds later, over two hundred people are scanned into my tractor beam and I turn it on, lifting them a couple of feet from the ground and keeping them there. Panic ensues as I keep them there. I\u2019m the only one that is not scared shitless. As a matter of fact, I feel my arousal growing with every second I keep total control over the crowd in the intersection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI make them turn as I keep them hovering. Now they are all facing my direction. They should have learned how things will work, but I decide to let them know, just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLOOK GUYS, YOU WILL DO ANYTHING I WANT YOU TO DO. THE BEST OPTION FOR YOU IS TO DO IT WILLINGLY. IF YOU DON\u2019T, I CAN FORCE YOU DO TO IT ANYWAY. AND IF YOU MANAGE TO UPSET ME ENOUGH, I WILL FIRST FORCE YOU TO DO IT AND THEN I WILL DISINTEGRATE YOU. I WILL SET YOU ON THE GROUND NOW. THEN YOU ARE ALL GOING TO PLAY THE GAME\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had never been so bossy before. Cocky? Sure. But not bossy. I guess that my cockiness has grown with me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI set them down and gradually let go of my hold over them. I\u2019m happy that they obey. Mostly. Half a dozen people do not seem to be able to follow some simple instructions, so they turn and try to flee. Where? I will never know. I bat my eyelashes again and easily lock on them. Then, in a quick succession, my eyes shot half a dozen short bursts of energy that precisely meet their targets and turn them into ashes, leaving just wisps of smoke in the spots they were at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs expected, screams intensify. I just force my expression to look more pissed off that I really am and say:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cANYONE ELSE WANTS TO TRY ANYTHING?\u201d I ask, tapping my foot for added measure<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey are terrified of me, and you know what? Works well enough for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOW, ARE YOU GOING TO DO ANYTHING I TELL YOU TO DO?\u201d I ask them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see some nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGOOD, BECAUSE ACTUALLY, THIS IS WHAT THE GAME IS ABOUT. IT\u2019S CALLED, VICKY SAYS\u201d I tell them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I say \u201cVICKI SAYS: TURN TO THE RIGHT\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly about half of the people on the block seem to understand what I want them to do and actually turn to the right. God, this is going to be harder than I expected. I get myself ready and in a few seconds vaporize the half that did not comply, being careful to let go controlled enough beams of energy as not to damage those that got the movement right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, I\u2019ve managed to make them pee all over themselves, at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVICKI SAYS: TURN TO THE LEFT\u201d I say, without warning<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone knows what the game is about now. My instruction was pretty simple, so everyone turns and I do not have to turn anyone else to ashes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTAKE A STEP TO THE FRONT\u201d I say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little less than half actually move to the front. I disintegrate them in a succession of well-aimed beams and giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI DID NOT SAY VICKI SAYS\u201d I mock<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see a few looks that are not actually of terror. They are looks of anger. Of course, they realize that I\u2019m playing with them and that my games are fatal. But it\u2019s not as if they will be able to do anything about it, so I hardly care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVICKI SAYS\u2026 TAKE A STEP TO THE BACK\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone gets it right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVICKI SAYS\u2026 TURN THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY DEGREES\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe used to do this one in physical education. Invariably, a few people just turned backwards, not completing the entire turn. The same happens with the crowd trapped in the block below, or at least to what remains of it. I shrug as I scan those that did not know how to interpret a turn and punish them for their ignorance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of minutes and I am down to a couple dozen people. God, these games are really fast. I crouch, set my hand on the ground, right into the box, and say:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVICKI SAYS: CLIMB INTO MY HAND\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople are hesitant, but after what I\u2019ve been doing to their colleagues every time they haven\u2019t followed my instructions, they are conditioned enough to know that they need to obey my command. I see them looking at each other and then rushing to my flat palm, conscious that not all of them are going to fit on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey fight for it, and I giggle when I see someone punching someone else really hard in order to grab a spot. I don\u2019t do anything, I just keep my hand flat and start feeling little feet climbing into it, and soon little hands as well as the people is forced to get on all fours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wait until my palm is full enough and then lift it from the ground, with eight or ten people on it. Then, I eye the ones that did not make it. They are terrified, even more so when I smirk at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bat my eyelashes and they expect the worst. Only I just look into the side street and use my tractor beam vision to lift the bus that was blocking it and toss it around some more, freeing the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU ARE FREE TO GO\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost start moving towards the path I just opened for them. A couple keep looking at me, questioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU PLAYED WELL\u201d I just say, standing up and ignoring them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI bring my hand under my face and open it, to find a mass of humanity on it. Being able to hold so many lives in one hand definitely feels great. I\u2019m so excited at what I have been achieving over the last few minutes that it\u2019s hard to feel higher than I am, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey start turning in my palm, looking at my smiling face. Then I say:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVICKI SAYS\u2026 FUCK ME!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir expressions change and I love it, but I cannot hold any longer. I hornier than an entire convention of nymphomaniacs. I use my free hand to pull my bikini bottom away and I drop the contents of my hand inside. They are instantly soaked in my juices. I bring my fingers to the outer part of the bikini and feel the forms of the people I so carelessly tossed in there. One by one, being rather careful, I guide them to my swollen lips and slide them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let out a loud moan. My loudest yet. I\u2019m getting close to climax, and I have to say that the physical stimulation is probably less relevant than the psychical one this time. True, I can feel them in my sweet spot, but what truly gets me off is knowing that I have a bunch of full grown people inside me, moving around the most sacred corner of my anatomy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fireworks come and I let out another loud moan, even louder than the previous one. I tighten my vaginal muscles and feel some cracks, but that hardly matters anymore. Letting myself drop to my butt first and then to my back, I start panting as I keep moaning. Then, I doze off.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I gradually start opening my eyes and realize that the sun is lower. I\u2019ve never been an expert on this, but I would say that it\u2019s early evening. How long was I out? It was not even lunchtime by the time I closed my eyes, so I must have been sleeping for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis tells me that I might have turned myself into a goddess, but I still have very human needs. A groan in my stomach reminds me as much as I realize that I have not had anything to eat since breakfast. A giant\u2019s lifestyle is definitely requires energy, especially when you shoot enough of it through your eyes to light the city for the coming ten years, and my stomach is telling me that I will need to replenish it the old way from time to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy ultra-sensitive ears catch some whispers in the vicinity. I think I can even hear a few people trying to hold their breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stretch and start the gradual transition from grogginess to wakefulness. Then I hear another sound: that of dozens of guns cocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t find a reason to hurry, so I just start sitting down and rubbing my eyes, trying to get awake. When I finally open them I\u2019m greeted by a massive display of cops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe accumulation of officers, squad cars, SWAT vans and even what looks like a blue painted tank would have been impressive to anyone but me. I have to admit that to me it just looks like a massive display of toy soldiers. The main difference is that their uniforms are blue instead of green.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile at them and greet them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWELL, HELLO BOYS. DID NOT KNOW THAT THERE WAS A PARTY\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man in a different uniform and a bullhorn raises it to his lips and yells at me: \u201cFreeze!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe yells at me! And he dares to command something to me!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea comes to mind and I wonder if I will be able to do what I\u2019m thinking on doing. Then I think that so far I have been able to do way more than what I had been able to think on, so\u2026 why not?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further word, I point my face towards the man and push my thick and sexy lips out. Then, I start blowing gently in the direction of the man, focusing on making my breath as cold as I can, kind of like if I were blowing hot coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to say that I\u2019m only mildly surprised when it works. The air from my lungs is channeled through my luscious lips and forces the air in front of me to condensate, creating a whitish cone that quickly expands and moves away from my face. An instant later, the cone reaches the cop and in less than a second he is turned into an ice statue. Of course, I was not aiming for precision, so my super cold breath reaches more people besides the man in charge. By the time I close my lips, a couple dozen cops more and half a dozen of their vehicles are frosted solid. A few of the ones close enough to the doomed area are rubbing their hands along their bodies, clearly feeling the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRaising an eyebrow and using a casual and mocking tone, I say:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO, YOU FREEZE\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cops who are not freezing or frozen do not take my action too well, of course. I can feel more sounds of guns cocking and I see dozens of them pointed at me. I could not be less worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOW, IS ANYONE WILLING TO HAVE A POLITE CONVERSATION OR ALL YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IS TO BARK ORDERS. YOU\u2019VE ALREADY SEEN THAT I DON\u2019T LIKE TOO MUCH THIS LAST APPROACH\u201d I say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are some moments of hesitation. Then a cop who was farther in the back steps to the front. He also has a bullhorn. Apparently they came well prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss\u2026\u201d the cop with the bullhorn says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVICKI\u201d I correct him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u2019\u201d he asks<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMY NAME IS VICKI\u201d I repeat<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss\u2026 Vicki\u2026 we are here to negotiate an agreement with the best interest of the city I mind\u201d he says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I don\u2019t caf\u00e9 about the best interest of the city. I just care about my best interest, and I have a hunch that they are not aligned. I debate whether to instantly vaporize all of the cops and get going. There are so many things I still want to do\u2026 and I wasted too long sleeping. I decide to let them play along, though. It may be fun, in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cLOOK, I DON\u2019T KNOW WHAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY OFFER ME THAT I DON\u2019T HAVE YET OR THAT I CANNOT GET BY MYSELF\u2026 BUT I\u2019M WILLING TO LISTEN. LET NOT IT BE SAID THAT I\u2019M AN UNREASONABLE GIRL\u201d I say. This has the potential to be funny, definitely, so I will play along for a while more. In the end, it\u2019s not as if there is anything to lose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2026 we have a negotiator\u201d the cop with the bullhorn says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

DOES THE NEGOTIATOR WANT TO TALK TO ME? THEN WE\u2019LL TALK FACE TO FACE\u201d I say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are some movements in the line of cops. I hear some murmurs and then I see a guy in his forties getting ahead of the line and start walk in my direction. He is attractive. Of course he is an oldie, but I would still have banged him\u2026 back when sex was one on one and I was more selective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cannot prevent a giggle when the man gets to the area of the road I\u2019ve frozen, slips and falls into his butt. He manages to get up quite gracefully and keeps advancing towards me. He reaches my feet soon enough. With my legs stretched as they are, my feet tower over him, my toes looking down at him from the height of a giant. I signal him to walk by my leg and to my waiting right palm. He hesitates when he reaches right on front of my fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCLIMB DARLING\u201d I say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich assurances do I have you will not hurt me?\u201d he askes<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI WANTED TO HURT YOU, YOU WOULD ALREADY BE A STAIN UNDER MY FIST. THAT\u2019S MY ASSURANCE\u201d I reply, shrugging<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man hesitates again but finally climbs, the feeling of his feet moving over my skin tickling. He falls on his butt as I raise my hand and bring him right under my smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSO, YOU HAVE FULL AUTHORITY TO NEGOTIATE?\u201d I ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do\u201d the man says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCOOL. YOU CAN LET THE REST OF THE COPS KNOW THAT THEY ARE FREE TO GO\u201d I say<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that this is something we want to bring to the table to soon\u201d the negotiator says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH, DON\u2019T MISUNDERSTAND ME. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ALONE, SO I THOUGHT WE WOULD START IN A BETTER MOOD IF RATHER THAN TURNING ALL YOUR COLLEAGUES INTO ASHES I LET THEM GO ON THEIR OWN\u201d I say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man swallows hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBY THE WAY, I MUST WARN YOU: I\u2019M NOT A PATIENT GIRL\u201d I say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man thinks for a couple more seconds, then brings his wrist to his mouth and whispers something. I guess he believes I could not hear it, but it was easy for me to understand his instructions asking all the cops to leave the area. I see the movement soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCOOL\u201d I tell to him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy stomach groans again and I decide to take advantage of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, I HAVE MY FIRST DEMAND. I WANT FOOD. TONS OF IT. AS YOU CAN SEE, I\u2019M A BIG GIRL AND I HAVE A BIG APPETITE\u201d I say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe negotiator looks at me. I see something in his eyes and I realize that he will try something. Well, I guess there\u2019s nothing wrong in trying. In the end, it\u2019s his job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll ask for it. I need something to bargain with\u201d he says<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHAT DO YOU MEAN?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I asked my colleagues to go. And now I\u2019m asking for food. I need you to give me something in exchange\u201d the negotiator says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chuckle and see that this makes him look very uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHIS IS NOT HOW THIS IS GOING TO WORK\u201d I announce<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, this is how negotiations usually work\u201d the guy tells me<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI GUESS THAT THIS IS HOW NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN REGULAR HUMANS WORK. NOW, LET ME TELL YOU HOW THIS IS GOING TO WORK: I WILL ASK FOR THINGS AND YOU\u2019LL MOVE YOUR ASS TO GET THEM AS QUICKLY TO ME AS POSSIBLE\u201d I say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man looks puzzled. Then he tries to look smart and asks:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen, what\u2019s our incentive to do as you say?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let another laugh out and reply to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWELL, IF PLEASING ME WAS NOT INCENTIVE ENOUGH, I GUESS THAT YOU SHOULD LOOK AT IT FROM THIS ANGLE: THE LONGER I\u2019M SITTING AROUND, GETTING PAMPERED BY YOU, THE LONGER I STAY AWAY FROM WREAKING HAVOC\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI see that he is not convinced, so I add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOR, PUTTING IT IN ANOTHER WAY, IF YOU DON\u2019T DO JUST ANTHING I SAY I WILL GET UPSET ENOUGH TO MAKE THE CITY PAY FOR IT\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cop\u2019s face pales, which works well enough for me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDID YOU ORDER MY FOOD YET?\u201d I ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe raises his wrist and starts talking. I interrupt him, saying:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMAKE SURE IT\u2019S TASTY. I GET IN BAD MOOD WHEN THE FOOD\u2019S NOT GOOD\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wait for him to finish his instructions to whoever is on the other side and then start giving him instructions of my own. There were a number of things the tinies can help me with while I invest my time in more profitable matters, such as having the time of my life with my new size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI ask for a dozen new bikinis to be made at my size. I want nothing short of the best designers and I specifically command him to make sure that no one else besides me will be wearing them. I am going to be around for a while\u2026 as a matter of fact, I am going to be around forever, and once you put the size and super-powers apart I\u2019m still a sexy and cocky girl that wants to look good. I ponder whether to ask for more clothes, but I decide against it. I have a bikini body and I cannot think on anything that looks better on a giant girl than a bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing on this topic, I demand for new jewelry, new make-up, nail polish and lipstick. I want to have a selection available.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s time for me to switch gears. I inform the negotiator that I\u2019m going to be down by the city hall to witness the mayor stepping down and accepting power over the city. Since there is no way I can fit in the city hall, I demand a throne to be built on Main Square.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know I\u2019m losing it, but one of the nice things about being me is that I can lose it and no one can call me on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImages of Eileen contently floating in her raft, thirteen years back, come to my head, so I demand for a raft to be built for me as well. Then, melancholy invades me and I demand to have someone responsible for Eileen\u2019s imprisonment come meet me and inform me about her whereabouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cannot think on any other shit at the moment, so I decide to give the negotiator a break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHAT WILL BE ALL, FOR NOW. I WILL COME BACK WITH MORE THINGS LATER\u201d I tell him<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMa\u2019am\u2026 Vicki\u201d he starts. I eye him as he continues \u201cIt may not be possible to get everything you asked for\u201d he says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI frown and decide to let him know that I mean business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLOOK PIPSQUEAK, BEING GIANT AND BEING HOT DOES NOT MAKE ME STUPID. EVERYTHING I\u2019VE ASKED FOR IS PERFECTLY POSSIBLE AS LONG AS IT\u2019S GIVEN THE RIGHT PRIORITY. IT\u2019S YOUR JOB TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT, RIGHT NOW, THERE IS NOTHING THAT HAS HIGHER PRIORITY THAN PLEASING ME. I REALLY THOUGHT I WOULD NOT NEED TO SPELL IT OUT LIKE THIS, BUT JUST IN CASE: BESIDES MY REGULAR ACTIVITY, FOR EVERY HOUR MY DEMANDS ARE NOT MET, I WILL MAKE SURE TO FUCK SOMETHING UP REALLY GOOD. I MEAN, IN A WAY THAT WILL NOT ADMIT INTERPRETATION\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man does not react. I keep my gaze on him and ask:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cARE WE CLEAR?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI change my expression and my tone almost instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCOOL! I GUESS WE ARE DONE FOR NOW, THEN\u201d I say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe negotiator looks nervous as he says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you going to do with me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, yeah, I had not told him yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU ALREADY KNOW HOW THIS WORKS. I\u2019M GOING TO KEEP YOU. I DON\u2019T WANT TO HAVE TO TEACH SOMEONE ELSE THE NEXT TIME I HAVE SOMETHING TO ASK. IT\u2019S PROBABLY GOING TO BE SOON\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI use my free had to undo the loop around my ear and bring the earring chair containing Jay into the same palm that contains the negotiator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU DID NOT THINK I HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT YOU, DID YOU JAY?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the look in his face, he had wished I did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDO I HAVE A SONG?\u201d I ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, by the look in his face it\u2019s clear that I don\u2019t. I frown. He finally shakes his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning I fold my legs and start to stand up. Jay and the negotiator are a little startled by recover soon enough. I maneuver my fingers and take Jay out of the chair. Then, I address the cop:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGET INTO IT\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is now well trained, so he wastes no time in following my commands. By the time he\u2019s done, I look the earring around my ear once more. This leaves a pretty terrified Jay in my palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI used to admire him. Hell, I was a groupie. The fact that he is not even as large as my pinkie finger somehow changes my perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU KNOW JAY? I THINK YOU NEED A LITTLE MORE PRESSURE\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning I bring my hands to my backside and while I pull out my bikini bottom from the cleavage between my ass cheeks, I use my free hand to slide Jay in, head first. I then use a fingertip to push his feet until he is all the way in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting the bikini bottom come back to place, I focus, trying to feel Jay in the tightest spot of my anatomy. The sensation is amazing! Feeling a little mean, I playfully tighten my ass muscles a little, adding to the pressure that his tiny body is certainly sustaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t see how being in my ass is going to help him compose, but I\u2019m definitely having a great time feeling him there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m quite delighted with my idea when my stomach groans again and I come to the conclusion that I cannot wait anymore for some food.</span></div></div>",

Feeling hungry has always made me angry, and being bigger has not helped that at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIT\u2019S MY FUCKING BUSINESS WHAT I WILL DO. NOW, SHUT THE FUCK UP. YOUR NEXT WORDS SHOULD BETTER BE TO TELL ME THAT YOU ACTUALLY MANAGED TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING OF WHAT I REQUESTED YOU\u201d I say, angrily<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gets the message, since I don\u2019t hear him again. Standing up, I start looking around me for a source of food as dusk approaches. Finding the large M is not too hard; I focus my eyes and see that the McDonald\u2019s is reasonably big, with its own drive in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long time without doing it, I get back at walking and digging the road with my cute bare feet. I\u2019m really hungry, so I cover the mile or so to the McDonalds in less than a minute. Then, I let myself drop to my knees, shaking my surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStooping further and bringing my head as close to the ground as possible, I look through the windows and I see that the restaurant is actually pretty crowded. I was not counting on it, but it\u2019s never a bad moment to tease people. Sitting back on my knees, I bring a hand under each roof eave and pull up, easily ripping the entire roof in one go. Tossing it carelessly to the side, I look at the couple dozen people or so, who are now screaming incredibly loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU WERE NOT TRYING TO HIDE FROM ME IN THE MCDONALD\u2019S, WERE YOU?\u201d I ask mockingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI only get screams back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMAKE ROOM\u201d I say, and without giving them any time, I being my right palm, turned upwards, into a space in the center of the restaurant. People try to get away. And most manage to do it. Two of them are too slow and are pinned under the back of my palm. I don\u2019t care and I keep going, feeling a slight crunch as I rest my palm on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOW, I\u2019M HUNGRY. YOU GUYS HAVE ONE MINUTE TO PUT EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF FOOD IN THIS JOINT ON MY HAND\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey need some time to react, but soon most people start working to please me, which makes me smile. People are starting to learn. A minute later, a man looks up at me and shrugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIS THAT ALL?\u201d I ask, annoyed<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cannot believe it. The amount of food in my hand is\u2026 ridiculous. And that\u2019s being generous. If I had the right balance, I could probably hold all of it in a fingertip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy stomach groans again and I say:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH, COME ON! YOU MUST BE KIDDING!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few of them look up and from the fear in their faces I see they are clearly not kidding. I down the burgers in my hand but a new groan of my stomach confirms to me that they were clearly not enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI straighten my back and look around. I cannot find any other restaurant. Then I realize that any restaurant I find will probably be not that different from the McDonald\u2019s. I realize that with my size, all the production of an entire restaurant is not going to account for more than a bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI definitely not feel in the mood to visit half the restaurants in town just to grab a decent meal. Besides, that would not be sustainable. I\u2019ve already learned that I need to sleep and that I need to eat. So, after dinner will come breakfast, and then will come lunch and then will come dinner again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy stomach groans once more and I even feel some pain. This is new for me. Ever since I grew through the hotel, I had thought that pain was a thing of the past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother groan and I cannot take it anymore. My fingers reach into the McDonalds and soon emerge with a yelling woman. I ignore her annoying screams and just bring her to my lips. Then, I slurp her in. She wiggles inside my mouth, making me feel funny. Then, almost by reflex, I swallow. With her size, she is barely more than a morsel and I feel her sliding down my throat and into my stomach with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pitch of the screams down at the McDonalds changes and a quick look shows me that I\u2019ve just managed to inspire a new kind of terror into the tinies. They are shocked and I need to admit that, for the first time, I\u2019m having second thoughts about what I just did. I was feeling so hungry, though!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy stomach doesn\u2019t give me a break and groans again. Of course, a tiny woman like that would not have been enough to quench my hunger. I need to make a decision. There is another groan and I realize about how stupid I\u2019ve been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t mind stepping on them, crushing them between my boobs, freezing them incinerating them or fucking them\u2026 and I get uneasy about eating them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnimals eat other animals all the time. Bigger animals eat smaller animals\u2026and I\u2019m the biggest fish around. I mean, humans are eating animals all day long\u2026 and I bet I\u2019m way superior to any human than they are, compared to the stuff they eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides\u2026 she did not taste bad at all\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile evilly and look down at the terrified crowd at the McDonalds. Then, I say:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSHE TASTED JUST LIKE CHICKEN\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pitch of the screams is the most anguished I\u2019ve heard so far. I just reach down and bring my hand up holding two wiggling people between my fingers. They are holding to each other. I easily separate one of them and bring him to my open mouth. This time I chew, my mouth filling with the flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep! People definitely does not taste bad at all!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll be able to picture just how small of a bite every tiny person was. I\u2019ve come to find out that tiny people have issues to imagine how things are from my perspective. I don\u2019t blame them. I mean, I cannot think like a tiny anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing is that soon I start eating the people in the McDonalds in twos and threes. That\u2019s how hungry I was. I finish the couple dozen soon enough. For those that think I\u2019ve been too much of a glutton let me tell you this: it was barely like eating a quarter pounder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel much better. Not only have I been able to placate my stomach but I\u2019ve resolved a long term need. Of one thing I\u2019m sure: I\u2019m not going to run out of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, I cannot prevent a pretty loud belch. I blush, realizing how unladylike it must have sound. For the first time I may have actually sounded like a monster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, with my needs now taken care of, it\u2019s time for me to move.</span></div></div>",

The sun is already setting, telling me that it\u2019s already late in the evening. The realization that I\u2019ve slept through most of my day as a giant girl makes me feel a little sad. Then I cheer myself up, reminding myself that this was just the first day of the rest of a life of absolute power and limitless fun. Besides, my extended nap has made me fresh enough to be ready for a long night out in the city. I am going to party! I hope Downtown is ready for me. Well, most likely it\u2019s not\u2026 but it\u2019s hardly my problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start strutting down an empty avenue, people in the area having learned by now that staying out of my way is a good idea. As I do, I find out about another pretty welcome side effect of my growth. The sun is already gone behind the skyscrapers of downtown and dusk has taken over the city\u2026 and I can see as well as if I were in full daylight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is what allows me to see them. I feel quite upset, since I specifically commanded them to leave. It seems that they could not do that. The cops are hiding in the corners, in the roofs of some buildings,\u2026 A building at crotch level to my right seems to be holding a command post. They are doing a lousy job of hiding it from me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stoop next to the building and bring my face close to the roof. The cops realize that their cover has been blown and I can see a couple of them getting out of the spot they were hiding and trying to get to the door that gives access to the building. I easily intercept them and in a second they are dangling from my cute fingers. I lower my voice and address them, as well as their colleagues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLOOK GUYS, I THOUGHT IT WAS MORE OBVIOUS BUT I SEE YOU ARE HAVING SOME HARD TIME TO ADAPT. I DON\u2019T UNDERSTAND REALLY\u2026 I MEAN, THIS HAPPENED TO ME AT THE SAME TIME IT HAPPENED FOR YOU, AND IT ALREADY FEELS AS IF I HAD BEEN LIKE THIS FOREVER\u201d I tell them<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I move to my message:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cANYWAY, LET ME LAY IT OUT FOR YOU: THE WORLD HAS CHANGED NOW THAT I\u2019M HERE TO PLAY. YOU MAY LIKE IT OR NOT, BUT THERE\u2019S A NEW GIANT GIRL IN TOWN AND THINGS WILL BE DIFFERENT FROM NOW ON. FOR STARTERS, I\u2019M CALLING THE SHOTS NOW, SO I EXPECT THAT WHEN I SAW SOMETHING YOU TINIES WILL MOVE YOUR ASSES TO FULFILL MY WISHES. IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?\u201d I ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey do not reply, but judging from their expressions I believe that they had understood me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGOOD\u201d I say. Of course, I\u2019m not going to let it go that easily. \u201cNOW, FOR ONCE, IT\u2019S ACTUALLY GOOD THAT YOU GUYS WERE AROUND. YOU SEE, I DID NOT HAVE DESERT\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, I bring the two cops I have in my fingers to my mouth and chew on them before the rest of the cops actually have the time to react. They do by the time I\u2019m swallowing, trying to feel the slight difference in flavor. One of the curious things I\u2019ve come to find out about eating people is that not two of them actually taste the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess that the remaining cops have not taken too well the sight of me devouring their colleagues, since they seem to rally to the one that\u2019s acting as a leader and get out of their hiding, yelling and shooting their guns at me. I realize that this is actually the first time I\u2019m being shot at. It\u2019s not as if I was too concerned about the possibility, but the feeling of bullets harmlessly bouncing off my chin, cheeks and cute nose is refreshing. Then, a couple hit me in the eye and cause a brief moment of discomfort, a tear quickly washing them away. It\u2019s all I need to get upset at the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further word I just part my lips and softly exhale, focusing on producing my coldest breath. An instant later, the four remaining cops are frozen solid, becoming nothing more than ice statues on the roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI forget about them as quickly as I found them and look down the street once more. My eyes focus on a building a couple blocks down and I cannot prevent a smile as I realize what it is: Dalton\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m a whisky girl. To be honest, I will drink anything I get my hands of, and usually in large quantities. In the end, I\u2019m also a party girl. But I\u2019ve always had something with whisky. I don\u2019t care that some people think it\u2019s not a lady\u2019s drink: I love it. And Dalton is among my favorite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, I waste no time in advancing quickly down the street and kneeling next to the building. I know enough about Dalton to know this is not the headquarters. But when I finish peeling the roof off without even chirping my nail polish, I find out that it seems to be a large enough bottling facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile and reach for the first cask. I can pick it between my fingers, but it\u2019s way too small. I use my fingernails to rip it open and drink its contents, but I can barely feel it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the panicked workers on the floor try to make an exit for the door. I easily prevent it by planting my fingers in their path. They seem to be having second thoughts, but it looks like they need some more convincing, so I gently push the leader of the attempt in the chest with my fingertip, sending him on his back. Then, I set the same fingertip on top of him and gradually increase the intensity of my push until he pops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019D VERY MUCH LIKE IT IF YOU STAYED\u201d I say in a mocking tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the group does not need any more incentives and go back to the corner where they were at the beginning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this little distraction now taken care of, I try to figure out how to drink the whiskey. Despite my size, there are enough casks for a drink or two. I\u2019m just not in the mood of ripping them open one by one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start looking around and quickly devise a plan. Standing up after letting the workers know what will happen if they\u2019re not there once I\u2019m back I grab the largest water tower I can find in the neighboring roofs. Ripping it\u2019s top open, I spill the water on the avenue. Who wants to drink that shit, anyway?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA close construction site gives me the rest of the elements I need. Then, I move back to my knees in front of the factory. I\u2019m holding the water tower, some piping I borrowed from the construction site and a few containers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m so strong that I barely realize about the feat of strength my next actions imply. I pierce one of the containers with a pipe and then grab a couple of shelves of casks and casually toss them into the container. Shutting it, I start squeezing, the metal conveniently bending under my strength and breaking the casks inside. Soon, golden delicious-looking liquid starts pouring through the pipe and into the water tower. I repeat the operation a few more times until the water tower, which is about the size of a mug to me, is three-quarters full.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing it to my lips, I take a sip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMMMM\u201d I moan. \u201cYOU GUYS KNOW HOW TO MAKE A NICE WHISKY\u201d I say to the terrified workers. \u201cTOO BAD I DON\u2019T DRINK IT LIKE THIS, THOUG\u201d I say. \u201cI LIKE IT ON THE ROCKS\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, I push my lips out and blow gently at them. By the time I\u2019m done, they are frozen solid. Picking them up with my fingers I toss them into the whisky mug and sip again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOW, THAT\u2019S MORE LIKE IT!\u201d I state</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My back is resting against a protesting ten-story building as I relax and take small sips of my whisky mug. The water tower was pretty large, so I have a really good serving. I\u2019m used to bars at nice hotels, but I can tell you that they never serve anything near this, even when waiters look at me surprised when I ask for a triple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe early night\u2019s breeze caresses my near entirely exposed skin as I relax, taking more sips of my whisky as I reflect on how great the world has suddenly become.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, things were not bad for me. I was young, I was successful, I was moderately wealthy and I was hot enough to have sex with any man I set my eyes on. I guess it\u2019s as good as a life as one can have as a tiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI would have even believed that it was hard to improve it, if I had not had the chance to experience something else. The difference is so astronomical that I even feel stupid for having thought so great about my previous life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of pure will, I\u2019ve turned myself into a goddess. Not in the sense of someone to be worshipped. I couldn\u2019t care less about religion, let alone to found my own. I\u2019m just referring to power. The ultimate power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYesterday I had to ride in taxis and planes. Today I can just walk anywhere in minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYesterday I got really upset when I got stuck in traffic. Now I can just trample it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYesterday I had to work for a living. Today I can just do anything I please without having to worry about the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYesterday I had to go to a restaurant for food. Today I can snack on the world\u2019s population.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYesterday I had to seduce a man to get him to bed. True, it was not hard. But today I just need to reach out to pick a handful of men and fuck them. I guess it would technically be a rape. You could even call it a gangbang. After everything I\u2019ve done, I hope that you are not too shocked about this one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, now that I think about it, I guess that this is one of the nicest effects of what has happened to me. I don\u2019t need to get concerned about morals anymore. Or saying it differently, I make my own morals. And there\u2019s no fucking thing in the world anyone can do about it. They can definitely try, but then I can step on them, freeze them, vaporize them\u2026 well, you get the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess I could say that I\u2019m above right and wrong. I can do anything I want and being a young playful girl, I want to try all the possibilities of my new self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had not realized about any of this before. I had to see things from a new perspective to find out. Even if I had Eileen\u2019s example in front of me all this time\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sadden at the memory of Eileen. I mentally toast to her and then wash out the entire contents of the water tower, feeling the whisky deliciously burning down my throat as I do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was too goodhearted. The world could never forgive her for having humiliated it in the way she did, for having it realize about how helpless they were in front of a being of her power. I will not make the same mistake. There\u2019s no way I will wimp out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of my sister makes me feel melancholic again. The alcohol is starting to take its toll on me and I feel more determined than ever to see her free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s still plenty of stock left at Dalton\u2019s, and I still have some of the stuff I used, so a little clumsier than before, I fix myself a second drink, crushing a whole lot of construction equipment as I do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s no way in the world they will be able to stop me from freeing my sister. Hell, there\u2019s no way in the world they can stop from doing anything I fucking please. I will release her first and then we will both take over the country. Hell! We are going to take over the world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m getting dizzier and dizzier as my mind goes through these thoughts. Before I\u2019ve realized, I\u2019ve downed the second water tower of whisky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTO YOU, EILEEN\u201d I say aloud as I wrap my fingers around the water tower, turn it into a pile of junk and toss it over my shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I stand up in a rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOk, it was too much of a rush. I\u2019m about to fall on my butt when I manage to correct my footing. Unfortunately for it, this sends my left foot right on top of a six story building. It does not stand a chance, crumbling on itself as if it had been made of crackers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOOOPS\u201d I say aloud as I see what I\u2019ve done and I realize that being all-powerful has not apparently made me immune to alcohol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to focus my sight and I realize that I cannot. The world feels as if it were slowly moving\u2026 but both my feet are firmly planted on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to focus, trying to fix my stare into some reference. I find a four-story warehouse like building a couple of blocks away that looks useful for that purpose. The world starts to slowly come back to place. Then, without warning, two powerful beams shot from my eyes and the warehouse erupts into a massive explosion. It has been really massive\u2026 I mean, it has felt as if someone had rigged the entire building with explosives. By the time the debris rains back into the ground and the smoke clears out again I see that there is a huge crater in the spot I was apparently targeting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFUCK\u201d I say aloud<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverything starts turning again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel the high is still on the rise and realize that I have drunk a little too much. My next step confirms the impression as I stumble again and my left foot ends up stomping much harder than it should, reaching a water main and starting to flood the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is hardly the first time I\u2019m drunk. And I know what they say about what drinking does to me: I either get playful, or get violent or get horny. Many times it\u2019s a combination of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look around me. There\u2019s nothing. For all the stuff I\u2019ve done, I\u2019ve not yet visited the city. The area where I\u2019m at is wasted and is boring. The night is young, I\u2019m a 21-year-old drunken goddess and I want to party. I take a first towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree steps later I\u2019m starting to get better and keeping a straight line. A couple of cars have ended under my feet, but I would have probably stepped them anyway if I had actually been looking. A loud sound catches my attention a couple of blocks to the front. I move my head maybe a little too quickly to try to find its source. My head is rolling a little again by the time I see the car and the two tiny guys trying to get into it. The sound is apparently that of the alarm as the guys were probably trying to break into a vehicle that was not theirs to hide from me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt does not play out too well for them as the beams are out before I can realize and the two guys are incinerated, along with the car and half the building it was parked in front of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFUCK!\u201d I say once more<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy laser vision seems to be one more muscle of my body I\u2019ve suddenly lost control of. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m not achieving the finesse I had come to develop\u2026 it\u2019s just that much like an inebriated person not controlling her arms or legs, my eyes seem to be channeling massive amounts of energy out of their own will.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIF I KEEP LIKE THIS FOR A WHILE THERE WON\u2019T BE ANY OF THE CITY LEFT BY THE TIME I GET THERE!\u201d I protest aloud<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a deep breath and focus on trying to keep a straight pace once more. After half a dozen blocks I smile, thinking that I\u2019m actually doing much better. I do not consider any of the partially crumbled fa\u00e7ades of the buildings I brushed with my shins on thighs as I zig-zagged to be too much of an issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red braking lights of the cars of Coastal Highway are already much closer and I can feel that I\u2019m getting to downtown. I think they are reacting to me, although I\u2019m not in the best shape to trust into my perceptions, to be honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t care and I just decide to tease them as I keep advancing in a more or less straight line.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYUHU TINIES!\u201d I call their attention from the distance, even if I\u2019m closing it pretty quickly. \u201cI\u2019M VICKI! I\u2019M A GIANT AND UMMM\u2026 YOU\u2019RE NOT!\u201d I say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI notice that I\u2019m dragging my words as I speak. If I were driving and a cop pulled me up, I guess that this would be more than enough to make him blow into breathalyzer. That\u2019s hardly a problem anymore, since I can step on any cop that shows up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides the obvious problems with my pronunciation, I realize that my words are not an example of eloquence either. I don\u2019t give a shit. I know that I get talkative when I get drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWAIT FOR ME, WILL YOU?\u201d I ask. Then I add \u201cWELL, IT DOESN\u2019T MATTER IF YOU DON\u2019T. I WILL CATCH YOU ANYWAY\u201d. I chuckle, finding myself incredibly funny. Then I keep going. \u201cHEY! I\u2019M JUST A BIG GIRL OUT FOR SOME FUN!\u201d I say. Then, I think about something I find terribly funny again and I giggle before saying \u201cJUST LET ME WARN YOU THAT THIS MAY INVOLVE STEPPING ON YOU, FUCKING YOU AND EATING YOU\u2026 ALTHOUGH NOT NECESSARILY IN THAT ORDER\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel like a stand-up comedian and so far no one has dared to tell me that I\u2019m not funny. Of course I\u2019ve kept zig-zagging towards the highway as I was talking to them and even if I did not follow the straightest possible path, I\u2019ve caught them quickly enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stop, feeling my head turning again. I look down and see a familiar image, just a little more blurred. Dozens of tiny people are scurrying between the aisles of packed cars, just in front of my toes. Their screams are a little distorted when they reach my ears, but they are distinguishable enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH, HERE YOU ARE!\u201d I say cheerfully. \u201cNOW, WHAT WAS THAT I SAID THAT I WAS GOING TO DO WITH YOU?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>One of the problems with being drunk is that one does not control her strength. And apparently my change in size has come with an extra dose of it. I think about that as I\u2019m falling forward, seemingly in slow motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem started a few seconds ago, right at the moment I stopped behind the crowd. I knew I had to do something to them, but I could suddenly think of nothing original. After all my teasing, I had to do something quick, so in front of the lack of ideas I decided to go for a classic. I raised my foot, let it hover on top of packed enough section of the crowd and got ready for the kill. The idea to stomp rather than step came in the last instant. I thought it would reinforce my message, sort of tell the crowd \u201cHere I am\u201d. It turns out the message was a little too strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy foot easily crushed a dozen or so souls and then sank in the tarmac, as I\u2019m already used to. And then it kept sinking. I\u2019m really stoned, so I really can\u2019t tell how much force I put in the stomp, but the moment my foot leg as deep as its ankle and kept going I knew that it was too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy clumsiness, or however you want to call what just happened has really sent a message. I must have caused a moderate intensity earthquake in the area immediately around me, judging from the hundreds of people I\u2019ve sent off their feet and the couple dozen cars that are now resting on their roofs rather than their wheels. It has also sent my leg into the ground all the way to mid shin, and has fucked the surface around me enough to make me completely lose my balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd here I am, falling forward as if I had suddenly stepped on the edge of a tight long dress. I shoot my arms outwards and try to cushion the impact with my hands. A couple of cars and an undefined number of unlucky bastards are instantly flattened as my palms sink in the asphalt and then slide forward, digging parallel trenches and finishing countless more vehicles and people. The rest of my body hits the ground hard an instant later. Hundreds of people end under different parts of it. I seem to be able to focus only on the ones that end up crushed under my oversized tits, which have dropped on them like twin atomic bombs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf my stomp had caused an earthquake, the countless tons of my body have created a massive replica. Most of those that had been affected by the original shake are now stains under several parts of my anatomy, so I get a really close up view of hundreds more being thrown around right under my cute nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDust raises. I stay silent for a second and see dozens of tiny unlucky people looking at me with their butts on the ground. I feel so much like a klutz! I remain silent for another second. Then I take into the consequences of my clumsiness and I start giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOOOOPSY\u201d I say aloud and in a really terrible impersonation of a little girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI keep giggling and see that the expressions of some of the people in front of me are oscillating from terror to something close to indignation. Without warning I slam my right fist on a group of them. Ok, I did not get the group that I was targeting. It\u2019s not as if the crowd will ever realize about it, of course, but I finally officially acknowledge to myself that I\u2019m too drunk. I start giggling again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople are starting to stand up and do what I\u2019m already used to: scream and run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ve finally come to terms with the fact that I\u2019m not going to be able to strive for precision for a while, so I will need to stay in \u201cmaximum effect\u201d mode. That should not be a problem, as I quickly prove to myself and to the crowd by slamming my fist in the midst of it three additional times in quick succession. I was not aiming, so I could not miss. This did not prevent me from having an impact, if the reaction of the crowd is a good measurement at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose that are not crushed are back in their feet and trying to get away from me as fast as they can. I giggle again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI still feel like the funniest person in the world, so I keep on teasing them, not caring that I\u2019m dragging the words a little too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY! WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM ME? I USED TO ATTRACT PEOPLE, NOT SEND THEM AWAY!\u201d I protest. Then I giggle once more and add: \u201cOH RIGHT, I GUESS YOU DON\u2019T LIKE ME CRUSHING YOU!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sound excited, as if I had made a big discovery. And then I slam my fist in the crowd once more for good measure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWELL, I\u2019M SORRY!\u201d I exclaim. \u201cBUT IT IS JUST TOO MUCH FUN!\u201d I add excited. I slam my fist in a different section of the crowd, crushing about half a dozen more people before I say: \u201cIT\u2019S EVEN ADDICTIVE! LIKE POPPING BUBBLEWRAP!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not as if I\u2019m thinking too clearly, so there\u2019s no way I can form a too elaborate thought. But I know I feel good. And I know it has to do with what I\u2019m doing. No matter what you might think, I\u2019m not a sadist. My pleasure does not come from the fact that I\u2019m making the tinies suffer (or killing them, for what matters). It comes from how utterly powerful my actions make me feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing people like disposable toys makes me feel superior in so many ways that I cannot keep myself from doing it over and over again. It\u2019s the ultimate consequence of my status. For a brief instant, maybe driven by my drunkenness, I realize about how different this all must look from the perspective of the helpless population.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI GUESS IT MUST SUCK TO BE YOU\u201d I add, changing my tone to one of mocking pity. \u201cI MEAN, BEING SO PUNY MUST BE REALLY FUCKED UP, RIGHT?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I let out a loud chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019M SO GLAD THAT I\u2019M NOT YOU!\u201d I say. \u201cBEING ME IS THE BEST THING EVER!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI reach out with my arm again. The crowd is expecting the worst, but this time my hand does not close in a fist but opens like a claw. I scoop down and bring my hand up with a pile of wiggling bodies trapped in the cage formed by my fingers. I\u2019m far from coordinated, so I cannot prevent one of the bodies to drop through an opening and fall from what feels like a negligible distance to me but looks quite harder on the tiny woman. I forget about her and bring the hand in front of my smiling face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening my hand, I see half a dozen bodies lying in different positions in my palm. None of them is larger than my pinkie finger. The sight is so exhilarating that I just cannot prevent a new giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIT\u2019S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT I WAS LIKE THIS JUST THIS MORNING\u201d I say to them, but mostly to myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of the diminutive bodies turn and I see their owners looking at me with a combination of amazement and fear. I wink at them. Then I get bored and just toss them carelessly to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd has made it barely out of arms reach, so I decide it is time to get back on my feet. It\u2019s, of course, easier said than done, but after stumbling a little I finally manage to stand up again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe city looks way more interesting than the highway, so I just start walking, ignoring the countless cars and people that end up at the bottom of my footprints. A dozen or so steps into my trek my path crosses with that of an overpass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s pretty crowded, with jammed traffic and dozens of people piling into the aisles between cars. It reaches barely above my ankle. It would have been easy enough to step over it\u2026 if I had any trust on my balance, which I don\u2019t right at this moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for me, my condition gives me plenty of ways to deal with this inconvenience and the easiest one is just to walk through it, feeling the concrete break with ease at my shins, sending countless vehicles and souls to the highway below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shiny reflection of the highway\u2019s streetlights catches my attention and makes me stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world turns a little in my head as I crouch and reach out, grabbing the 18 wheeler gently in my hand. My sudden movement as I stand up makes me even dizzier, but I close my eyes and manage to get focus once more. I\u2019m looking at the scaled down model of the semi as my fingers touch the cold metal of the cylindrical container it carries. Then, I look forward to the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY, SOMEONE LEFT THEIR TOY BEHIND!\u201d I say playfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then I just bring the 18-wheeler over my head and toss it girlishly at the spot where the crowd was thickest. The explosion that ensues is so massive that it even surprises me. I did not check but it turns out that the metallic container had been full of gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH FUCK!\u201d I say, and this time I\u2019m not forcing my words. Dozens must have died instantly at impact. Hundreds more are either burning or trapped by the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I catch myself giggling again at the unexpected consequences of my careless action. I feel as if anything I do has the potential to end up in a massacre.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSOMEONE SHOULD REALLY PUT THAT FIRE OUT\u201d I say, mocking the pretty unsuccessful attempts of the people to escape the flames. \u201cTHERE\u2019S NEVER A FIREFIGHTER AROUND WHEN YOU NEED ONE\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds watching the fire wreak havoc among the people in the crowd I say:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, IF YOU INSIST\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, without warning, I bring my hands to my hips and start blowing in the direction of the fire. I don\u2019t stoop or crouch to try to get closer. I\u2019m in no shape for that. So, I just try to channel the coldest air I can muster through my sultry lips and more or less aim in the direction of the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flames are put out. The unfortunate side effect (for the crowd, that is) is that it\u2019s hard enough to get precise when you are trying to blow at something from a height equivalent to a high-rise\u2019s rooftop, and my current state is not actually helping. So, by the time I cut my breath the flames are out but so is a section of the highway and its surroundings, which suddenly reminds of a Christmas postcard even if we are in the peak of summer. A couple hundred ice statues decorate the picture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH MY! I HOPE THAT YOU DON\u2019T THINK THAT I\u2019M A COLD GIRL!\u201d I say just before I start giggling again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Every drunk 21-year-old girl has thought at some point that she could take over the world. The difference in my case is that it\u2019s true.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ve always been moody, and being drunk only exacerbates that trend in my character. So, one moment I was perfectly content, after having frozen a section of the highway and having strolled the rest of the way to the entrance of downtown and the next I get totally upset when a chopper dares to get too close to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo close, in my new standards, is close enough that the sound of its rotors annoys me. Seeing that the helicopter seems to belong to some sort of news station doesn\u2019t do anything to improve my mood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy expression quickly changes from a smirk to a frown as I look at the chopper and say:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHEY, GET OUT OF MY FACE!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reaction from the pilot really makes my blood boil. The chopper definitely moves, but rather than getting away it just gets a little higher, as if trying to get out of my reach. I realize about the intention of the pilot and when I understand that he is both challenging my commands and feeling safe \u201cjust\u201d because he\u2019s hovering a little too high it really makes me mad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the most immediate consequences of my change is that EVERYONE needs to do as I say, so what the hell does this guy think that he is doing?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHAT WAS AN ORDER FROM YOUR GODDESS!\u201d I say in a really annoyed tone<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chopper does not react, so I decide to take matters into my own hands. Or into my own eyes, to be more precise. I\u2019m really pissed off with the pilot, so I want to capture him, remove him from his stupid aircraft and make him suffer. The idea of pulling his limbs one by one like a cruel girl pulling the wings of a fly crosses my mind and I smirk. I know I told you that I was not a sadist, but I can get really vindictive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ve captured a chopper already, so I know how it\u2019s done. I point my face in the right direction, switch my vision into tractor beam mode and focus on my victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave you ever tried to grab a really slippery soap bar? How does that work for you when you are really stoned and what your eyes see does not really match with what your hand is doing? It\u2019s hard, right? Well, imagine how it would be if rather than the hand and fingers that you\u2019ve been using for your entire life you were trying to exercise a muscle that you have discovered you had just a few hours ago. That\u2019s what happens to my tractor vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought I had mastered it before, but it\u2019s right now when I find out that I\u2019m still a long way from really being in control of some of my most recently found abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chopper is not captured, of course. Instead, I have somehow swatted it at a distance. Of course, if I had really swatted it there would be little more than a few chunks of metal spread around the area, but the action has felt about the same. I have even felt some feedback as the aircraft has been pushed back and sent spiraling down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the gentlest nudge from my eyes has been enough to send the helicopter out of control. It\u2019s now getting farther away from me and lower, and it looks like it will end up crashing on the ground sooner rather than later. The pilot manages to pull out some sort of trick almost in the last minute, though, and to my irritation he gets the helicopter back into a normal flying path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do not have the patience to try to capture him again, so I decide that toasting him will have to do. I get ready and let go my two most powerful beams of energy yet. Somehow I\u2019m able to feel the amount of energy I\u2019m releasing. I completely miss the chopper. Unluckily for the people on it, I do not miss the high-rise just behind it. Its top half is practically disintegrated in the most massive explosion I\u2019ve seen yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFUCK! FUCK! FUCK!\u201d I yell, I guess that sending a chill down the spine of everyone in the city<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hate losing, and even more in front of something as worthless as the fucking pilot in his fucking little toy aircraft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let go another pair of beams and miss again. Another building suffers the consequences, but I don\u2019t care. This time I do not switch the beams off, though, and I just start moving my head and neck, orienting my heat vision and chasing the chopper. The pilot realizes about it and starts his evasive maneuvers. He is helped by the fact that alcohol has really made me suck at aiming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is quite skilled, I have to admit. I do not give up and just keep chasing him, feeling as megawatts of energy are flowing along my body before they are released by my eyes. I never stop to observe the consequences of my chasing of the chopper, but I instinctively know that I must be fucking the city pretty bad. I don\u2019t care. My pride is more important than every person and building in the city combined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI switch off by the time I get tired of the cat and mouse game. I\u2019m not at my best and the guy is pretty good. It\u2019s not as if I\u2019m in my sharpest mental moment either, but luckily for me, a whole day of enjoying my new condition has already given me some instincts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy laser vision might be my most spectacular long-range power, but it\u2019s not the only one. And it requires precision. I smirk as I start inhaling. Air flows slowly to me at first, but then I force the pace and my smirk widens as I see debris on the street being dragged into my direction. By the time I see some abandoned cars clumsily rolling my way I know that I know that I\u2019m REALLY breathing in hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess that my lungs must be compressing the air or something, but I\u2019m too drunk to really put a lot of thought into it. I feel full enough after a few seconds. Then I look in the direction of the chopper, push my lips out and blow hard. I mean, I blow REALLY hard. I had not realized about how super-powerful I had got until this moment. My breath is more than enough not only to push the chopper around but actually to disintegrate it the moment the wave front hits it. A few of the buildings I had half-destroyed with my eyes are now finished by my lungs, exploding, just in a different way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time I stop, a twelve blocks long, three blocks wide section of the city is gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have never, ever felt so horny in my entire life. My bikini bottom is completely wet and I could swear my nipples would cut through steel if I tried just now. My moan has probably been heard in three states and is quickly followed by words that must sound almost as loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy funny stint as a drunk girl is over and I\u2019ve quickly got into an aggressive bragging mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI AM THE FUCKING QUEEN OF THIS CITY!\u201d I yell for everyone to hear. Well, for everyone that\u2019s not dead, that is. \u201cTHE QUEEN OF THE WORLD!\u201d I add. \u201cI AM A GODDESS!\u201d I reinforce my message.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not the greatest speech ever, I know. I\u2019m just not in the proper condition for that. Instead, I keep at letting go a series of untwined boasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019M THE MOST POWERFUL CREATURE THAT HAS EVER SET FOOT ON THIS PLANET! AND ALL OF YOU COMBINED CANNOT EVEN MATCH MY PINKIE FINGER!\u201d I let out. I don\u2019t know if the latter is actually true, but it could very well be, I reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy questionable eloquence is interrupted by the loudest groan I\u2019ve ever heard coming from my stomach. I guess it has been heard several blocks around me. And then, suddenly, I feel ravenously hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ve never felt hunger with such intensity before. I even feel weak, which is something quite new and unexpected, since my change in the morning. I\u2019m not thinking too clearly, but even in my state I realize what has happened. In the course of a few minutes, I\u2019ve released the energy of a couple of large-scale natural disasters. I\u2019m depleted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know what to do to recover, but unfortunately my latest actions have not left too many tinies alive around me. The area in front of me is a wasteland. I turn and see that the streets are empty. My stomach groans loudly once more and it feels even painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know how I manage to think about it, but a flash crosses my mind and, as I turn, I slam my fist into the building right at my back. The top four floors or so are obliterated, making the formerly chest-high building into a shorter version of itself. Then, the dust clears and the debris settles and I see a few dozen startled people wandering around. I\u2019ve never been so happy to see people before, and I have usually been happy when that happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first handful I just scoop and toss into my mouth without any word. I even swallow before I could completely chew them, making my throat bulge as the half a dozen or so mashed bodies travel through it. Oh God! It felt good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI scoop my third handful even while I\u2019m still bringing the second to my mouth. I don\u2019t care if anyone thinks I\u2019m a glutton. I just need this. The remaining people in the building are screaming in front of a new type of terror they were not even imagining, but I don\u2019t care. I just keep at feasting and bring another section of the building down when the one I was eating from is exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m starting to feel much better, but it require a much higher amount of nourishment than I had so far. My thinking is way to fuzzy to put too much thought to the fact that no matter how many of the tinies I\u2019ve eaten, their combined energies are but a fraction of the one I\u2019ve unleashed just a few moments ago. This would be something for a doctor or a scientist to think about. I\u2019m a goddess, and I have other things to pay attention to. As far as I\u2019m concerned, as long as I keep being all-powerful and invulnerable, I don\u2019t care too much about how it works. I\u2019m keener to think about how to use it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t know how many people it finally took, maybe a couple hundred, but I feel much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI pat my tummy and smile once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI NEED ANOTHER DRINK!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Urges<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what I have just done, my perception about destruction has somehow changed. And I have to admit that it was never too restrictive to start with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk past the area of the city I wiped out fast enough. There is nothing remarkable there apart from some smoldering ruins and a few scattered corpses here and there. Fortunately, Palmsdale is large enough, so I reach another thriving section of downtown pretty quick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m excited. The crowd, not so much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun is now already gone, but another of the nice effects of my change seems to be the fact that I can see as clearly in the dark as I could back in midday. The booze is still making it hard for me to focus my sight anywhere for too long, so it\u2019s curious to see things perfectly in the middle of the night at the same time the world is kind of<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stop when my path crosses that of a building which is a little over my height and that has a flat, mirrored face. Right now, I\u2019m the only person on Earth that can see that the windows are actually mirror-like, since no one without my enhanced eyesight would be able to see too much in such low light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI love looking at my figure in mirrors. Of course, that\u2019s because I\u2019m unbelievably hot. I\u2019ve never been humble, and in my present condition I find even less reasons for that. As a matter of fact, as I watch at my reflection in the building, I can only think that I look hotter than ever. I guess that having an entire city as a background helps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, there are other things that help, like my long shiny dark brown hair, my large wilds eyes, my high cheeks and my thick, sultry lips. Soon, the bikini top becomes annoying, since it doesn\u2019t let me get an unhindered sight of my picture perfect breasts. I\u2019ve often been told that they are even a little too much for my generally thin frame, but judging by how much I get hired for bikini photoshoots, I guess that this is not a problem. I\u2019ve never felt like it was. As a matter of fact, I love them just the size they are and I love looking at myself naked, seeing how my tits seem to defy gravity as they stand erect at my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy hands have untied my bikini top and let it drop almost without me noticing. Soon, they are holding a breast each, their size making them more than a handful. I squeeze, moaning in pleasure. I\u2019m still feeling incredibly horny at what I accomplished a short while ago. I squeeze again and then I mash my tits together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand unavoidably ends up reaching my bikini bottom, sliding into it and then extending two fingers into my pussy. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt wetter. I need to get fucked, and I need it now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI step out of my bikini bottom soon enough, standing naked for the first time since my growth. God, I\u2019m even hotter than I remembered myself. I ran my hands along my curves, feeling them, noticing the tightness of my skin everywhere along my body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy washboard flat stomach leads to my wide hips and my clean shaven pussy. It\u2019s craving for attention, and I\u2019m more than willing to help it. I can hear some screams coming from the road below and I start thinking about how many \u201cvolunteers\u201d I will need to pick this time, since my womanhood\u2019s appetite seems to be in line with the one my stomach had just a few minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, I pause enough to take a glance at one more of the remarkable sights my body has to offer: my ass. I\u2019ve been told there are tit-men and ass-men. I\u2019m lucky enough to be able to make both of them happy. My stomach is flat, but I\u2019m anything but skinny. My wide hips and powerful thighs lead to a killer behind, both voluptuous and tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI push it out and admire its reflection, looking over my shoulder. Then, one of the most embarrassing moments since I grew comes: I realize I am going to pass some gas the moment I push my butt out a little too much. I had not realized it would be so noisy. At my size, of course, this means that the entire city has heard me farting. I start blushing, even if no one is able to notice, in the dark. I\u2019m the only one that can see in these conditions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t have too much time to worry about this, though. What happens immediately after is so surprising that I even forget about my brief moment of shame. The glass in the building\u2019s fa\u00e7ade bursts as if it had been hit by a projectile!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHas my fart had this effect? I turn and stoop, to look at the spot where I fucked the fa\u00e7ade up from the distance. The answer to the question comes quickly enough: there is a corpse in the middle of the debris where the fa\u00e7ade caved in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI only need to zoom a little to see that it\u2019s Jay. God! I had forgotten that he had been stuffed in my ass for most of the afternoon! He is certainly dead. I don\u2019t need to feel for a pulse to know that. I\u2019ve become kind of an expert in the matter. The death of my favorite popstar affects me much less than it would have 24 hours ago. I\u2019m looking at the world from a different perspective now, and someone so small has a limited ability to have an impact on me. Especially since he failed at what I wanted him to do, which was to entertain me and to pamper me with songs dedicated to me. I don\u2019t need him. I can now pick among billions of people anytime I want something done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy only doubt is whether he just died now, as a result of the impact, or if he died inside me. I think the latter is probably more likely. For some unknown reason, the thought tickles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cannot prevent thinking that I seem to have found yet another long-distance weapon. How should I call it? Ass canon? Anyway, once I have super-breath and laser vision, I don\u2019t find too much use for it. My main powers are much cooler and much less embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy pussy reminds me that I have a mission, so I just crouch and look for some unwilling lovers. I have to chuckle when I find the spot two of them are trying to hide from me: my bikini bottom!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI guess that their thinking was that I would not be looking into my clothes. They were about right, but unfortunately for them, my sight is so great that I can spot even the most miniscule things and the slightest movements. This is what gave them away and this is what made me pick my bikini bottom up and hold it by its side stripes as the two unlucky bastards are trying their hardest to keep their balance in the area of spandex that would usually go right in front of my snatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m in a phase of my drunkenness where I\u2019m both horny and playful. The latter wins for an instant, so I pull the flexible material of my bikini bottom as much as I can and then I release, shooting the two bugs into the night sky as if I had used a slingshot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggle and toss my bikini bottom over my shoulder. I catch the crowd in three strides and without re-introducing myself I just crouch and grab two handfuls of people. I\u2019m so hot that I do not waste any time in stuffing the first group into my craving pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second I just drop on my chest, as I arch my torso backwards as much as I can so that they will stay between my twin mounds of flesh a little longer than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all end up crashing in the road below. All, except a guy that has miraculously managed to hold to my right nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell done!\u201d I say as I bring a finger to his back and start rubbing him vigorously against one of the most sensitive areas of my anatomy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy other hand is busy in another sensitive spot, my fingers slid into my crotch, stirring the half a dozen people or so I have so carelessly fit inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI think I might have been too rough and broken a couple or three in the insertion process, since I can only feel about half of the bodies moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne problem with the little people is that they are little. Don\u2019t misunderstand me. I love them being little practically all the time. It allows me to do plenty of the funniest stuff to them. The issue is that they are of limited sexual value.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man at my nipple soon becomes boring and the people in my pussy don\u2019t take too long to prove themselves incapable of bringing me anywhere near orgasm. I don\u2019t know how the first group of people I fucked managed to do it. It was probably the novelty, something more psychological than physical. I need physical now. And these guys are not going to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tit man\u2019s head soon bursts against my nipple as I push a little too hard. My fingers soon empty the pussy men out when they stop reacting to the stirring. What just happened barely qualified as foreplay. If anything, I only feel hornier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are plenty more people around me. The supply of tinies has hardly been a problem ever since I grew. But despite my high, I kind of know that I need something else now. A building pays my frustration as I punch it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA second building is saved from my wrath by a sibling. Out in the distance I spot the Glock Tower. Or as half the humorists in the country call it: the Giant Cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow could I have forgotten about one of the most remarkable features in Palmsdale\u2019s skyline? Of course, there is a reason the building is nicknamed the Giant Cock. I bet no one ever thought the building would end up living up to its nickname. I bet no one thought someone like me was possible either. I mean, besides of my sister. But honestly, would anyone have pictured my cute sister Eileen fucking a building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Glock is not so close, but distances are hardly a problem for me since this morning. They are a problem for the crowd. I don\u2019t even care to look down as my bare feet start crushing everything they find on their way. By the nature of the squishes, I can guess that the crowd is getting thicker as I\u2019m getting closer to my destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA last right turn puts me in the plaza right in front of the giant phallus. I look at it. I actually look up at it. Being one of the tallest buildings in the city, the Glock tower is easily four times my height. That\u2019s not an issue. It\u2019s merely an inconvenience for a girl with my abilities. I smile and focus.</span></div></div>",

My now completely bare skin is stretching and a feeling of intense pleasure fills every inch of my already massive body. God! I did not remember how arousing growing was!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was horny as hell to start with, so you can imagine how I\u2019m feeling now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth came really naturally. Now that I\u2019ve done it once, it feels like riding a bike. I instinctively know that I will be able to change my size at will at any time. If anything, my only regret is that I did not find out about all this much sooner. How have I been able to live up to this day without enjoying this power? I look down at some of the scurrying people closer to me and I almost feel disgusted to think that I was once like them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI instinctively know that I could make my growth much faster, but I don\u2019t see a need for it. I\u2019m enjoying every second of it and I\u2019m not in a real hurry. I was already starting to sober up a little by the time I started focusing on getting taller, so I\u2019m almost back to my full senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite my casual growing pace, my eyes soon reach the top of the Glock, with its characteristic rounded shape. This means that I made myself about four times taller in a matter of seconds. This would have been already pretty impressive if my intention was not to grow much more. This building that now reaches to my eye is soon to become my dildo, so I have quite a lot more growing to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI focus on it and I unconsciously accelerate the pace a little, now that I do not have a visual reference to grow against. One of my only regrets is that all this is happening at a moment where the population of Palmsdale (at least the ones that did not suffer any \u201caccidents\u201d since my growth) will have some trouble to see me, since it\u2019s already dark. I can only imagine how magnificent the entire scene would have been if it had had the proper lighting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s not as if my growth goes unnoticed, of course. To start with, my feet are expanding quickly enough to trample some unlucky bastards that were too close to me or to the Glock by the time all this started. Soon, some spotlights start illuminating different spots along my expanding body. None reaches as high as my face, so I doubt the citizens that must undoubtedly be looking up can see my naughty smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy deep belly button passes right in front of the top of the building, but I\u2019m far from done with growing. The entire thing needs to get inside me, so I still need to add quite a lot of size to my already colossal body. I widen my stance a little more, to make sure I do not damage the building as I keep expanding. Right now the Glock is the most precious thing in this city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI lightly moan as my head keeps reaching for the stars and the Glock keeps shrinking right in front of me. I don\u2019t make it stop until the building gets below my knee. I just turn it off as if I had a mental switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m so excited that I\u2019m panting. Part of me is urging me for immediate sexual satisfaction. But another part prevails, even if momentarily. I gradually calm down, taking deep breaths, and start looking at my surroundings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m huge! The city extends around me like a Google Maps image by night, its lights reaching as far as the horizon as my keen eyes can get all the details of its buildings and its inhabitants despite the darkness that prevents everyone else from seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow! My previous size was already impressive, but this\u2026 I\u2019m really titanic now. I was never good at math or at judging distances, but I would say that I would not be wrong to assume that I\u2019m a mile tall. A mile!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are plenty of mountains that are not as tall as my curvaceous body is now! In a sense, I\u2019ve become a mountain of flesh. I know that I was the most powerful creature in the world already, and part of the reason why was that I could grow at will. But now that I\u2019ve actually done it and I stand so tall that even the highest skyscrapers in the city cannot get to my knees I feel even more magnificent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU THOUGHT YOH HAD SEEN EVERYTHING ABOUT ME ALREADY?\u201d I ask in a mocking tone. I do not even raise my voice. I know that I can be heard perfectly well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWELL, MAYBE YOU CANNOT SEE ME THAT WELL\u2026 BUT I BET YOU CAN FEEL ME!\u201d I add, still sounding cheerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I finish, I lift my right foot and look for a random city block in front of me. I take care not to damage the Glock. The rest of the city is fair game. The entire block is demolished under my foot. One full block in one step! How much power is that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decide to get a little away from the only building I care about, as not to damage it. Another entire city block ends up under my left foot as I do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo steps, two city blocks and probably a few thousand people. Wow!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAND I THOUGHT I WAS BIG BEFORE\u201d I mock<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spy a crowd not so far away. Nothing is far away from me now. Even the city limits seem to be at arm\u2019s reach. I move my right foot forward with care and set it on top of the group. Hundreds of people disappear as I do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA spark momentarily lights in my chest. I can barely feel it. I basically just see it through the corner of my eye. I frown, surprised, not knowing what the hell it can be. Then, another spark lights close to the first one. When a third, a fourth and a fifth light in quick succession all over my left tit I finally realize what\u2019s going on. I am being attacked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI find them as soon as I know what to look for. My eyes have no problem to find the little gnats in the dark sky. As a matter of fact, their jets make them a little easier to spot, as soon as they turn and they get ready for a second pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy blood is really boiling now. The notion of being attacked would have been offensive at any moment since I grew through the hotel\u2019s roof. But having it happen now\u2026 it\u2019s as insulting as anything could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cannot help but wonder why, of all the chances they may have had, they have chosen this moment as the one to confront me. I mean, it\u2019s not as if they would have had any chance, even if I had still been small, but now\u2026 it\u2019s so absolutely clear that there\u2019s nothing they can do to hurt me that I cannot even start to describe how utterly ridiculous the entire situation looks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cREALLY? YOU GUYS ARE ATTACKING ME?\u201d I say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA new succession of sparks light in different areas of my torso when I spy a group of planes trying to make a turn for the next pass. They have made the mistake of underestimating my reach, so I quickly teach them how wrong they were by swatting them out of the sky with a deft swipe of my left arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next group realizes about this so they start turning much sooner, right after unloading their payload. As if this were going to save them. I just need to push my lips out and blow gently. Three dozen planes are sent spiraling out of control. Explosions all over the city show me where they ended up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVICKI \u2013 50, AIR FORCE \u2013 ZERO\u201d I say in a mocking tone. All it has taken me is a lazy movement of one arm and an exhalation to get to the score.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to acknowledge that at least the tiny pilots have guts. Despite the clearly inevitable outcome, they still come for a third wave. I decide to up the ante. I push my lips out again, but this time I do not blow with force. I just let out the coldest air I can muster. One by one, the engines of the jets in front of me fail and send the planes down. There are hundred explosions at different spots of the city once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI GUESS THIS IS A KO\u201d I say aloud, not able to see any more planes around<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is something else I can see though. There are a few chutes! Clearly not as many as planes. I\u2019m guessing my freezing breath made the systems of most of the aircraft fail, but a few pilots still managed to eject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile and take a step to the front, reaching for the closest one. Two more city blocks become collateral victims of my curiosity for an almost microscopic guy. The fact that he is attached to a chute makes things much easier to me. I don\u2019t know how I would have done it if he weren\u2019t. I pinch the chute with two fingernails and hold the ridiculous pilot right in front of my curious eyes. He is not even a tenth of an inch tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing how ridiculous people have now become was great enough. Being able to hear his screams just makes things so much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI part my lips and address him quietly. Of course, my quiet words are probably heard a couple of counties away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWOULD YOU CARE TO EXPLAIN TO ME HOW SOMEONE AS RIDICULOUS AS YOU MANAGED TO PUT TOGETHER THE THOUGHT THAT YOU COULD ATTACK SOMEONE LIKE ME?\u201d I ask<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou are destroying Palmsdale and killing thousands!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSO? PALMSDALE IS MINE TO DO AS I PLEASE. HAVE YOU NOT UNDERSTOOD THAT YET?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny pilot does not reply. I was not expecting it, to be honest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first chance in a long time I have a doubt. There are so many different ways I could quickly finish the microbe that I cannot make my mind about which one to use. Then the solution comes to me: it\u2019s so easy to kill him that I will actually keep him alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI THINK THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE A BETTER LOOK. I\u2019LL GIVE YOU THE CHANCE\u201d I say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, I move my hand down and carefully loop his parachute into the silver piercing in my belly button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPAY ATTENTION\u201d I say</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b>Hell hath no fury<br>\r\n</b></font> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s curious. The Air Force attack on me was probably the most ineffective in History. By all means, it should have made me feel even more powerful. And it has. It really has. But it has also pissed me off enormously. I feel vindictive and an entire city will pay the consequences. Well, at least what\u2019s left of it will do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing that\u2019s better than destroying a city is letting everyone know that I\u2019ll do, so I clear my throat and I address the city (and probably a few counties around it) in a determined tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU KNOW MICROBES, I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT BY NOW YOU WOULD HAVE REALIZED HOW USELESS IT IS TO ATTACK ME, BUT THIS IS CLEARLY NOT THE CASE. HONESTLY, I WAS JUST INTERESTED ON HAVING FUN. BUT A GIRL IN MY POSITION CANNOT LET CHALLENGE GO UNANSWERED. I\u2019M TAKING OVER THE WORLD, AFTER ALL. SO, I GUESS IT\u2019S TIME TO REMIND YOU ABOUT WHO YOU ARE DEALING WITH\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI scan the landscape and I soon find my first target. The highway is both distant and feels close. It\u2019s one of the interesting dichotomies of being a mile tall. Even from the distance, I can see that it\u2019s probably the most packed highway I\u2019ve ever seen. The red rear lights of tens of thousands of cars form a bright ribbon that extends as far as my eye can see. It\u2019s evident that people would rather not be in the same city I am. Well, it\u2019s alright with me if they want to keep massing together. It makes things easier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFocusing, I build pressure behind my eyes and then let two powerful beams rip through them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy laser vision was spectacular enough when I was merely the size of a medium-sized building. I can only imagine how it must look like now that I\u2019m a mile tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe beams join into a single one shortly before meeting the highway. They feel more like the main weapon of Independence Day\u2019s aliens than Superman\u2019s ability. Wider than the highway, the beam melts everything it touches instantly, and sears into the ground, digging a trench hundreds of feet deep. Then I start making it advance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy only doubt is whether I broke through Earth\u2019s crust, creating a new fault in the middle of a city that thought itself safe from earthquakes. Twenty miles of highway have suddenly become a canyon, hundreds of thousands of people have vaporized into nothing. My eyes have channeled the highest amount of energy this planet has ever seen and this time I don\u2019t even feel tired. I guess it\u2019s good for the population. I doubt I would be satisfied with less than a million if I really had to eat again. It\u2019s good for me as well. I have no idea on how I would pick them up!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rock on the sides of the canyon I created is still smoldering and some fires have already erupted and are consuming the land on both sides of it. I have kind of created my own version of Mordor, I reflect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI decide to give another try to my landscape changing abilities and look for a different spot. I get appealed by the river, as it heads for the bay. Once more, I spot thousands of people trying to leave the city along its multiple bridges. I stoop slightly and push my lips out. This time my focus is different. I try to make the air that comes out of my lungs and that is channeled by my thick lips as cold as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt my present size, I basically create the worst blizzard the country has ever seen. The landscape in the area I selected turns white in just a few seconds. I just keep on blowing. A thick ice crust is starting to form on the surface of every road and every building. The temperature in the epicenter of my breath descends to the lowest one ever registered on Earth. I keep blowing. The temperature gets below the threshold where life is possible. I don\u2019t care about it. I\u2019m pretty sure that anyone in the area has been dead for a while already. I have another objective. I feel satisfied when I see that I\u2019m accomplishing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe river water whitens and it finally stops moving. I keep blowing. It takes me a full additional minute but by the time I finish the river is completely frozen. Antarctica would feel like a tropical island next to the section of the city I\u2019ve just transformed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all my efforts (not that big, I have to admit), there\u2019s about half of the city left. I decide it\u2019s time for some good old fashioned giantess rampage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take my hands from my hips and turn. A city block is the first receptor of the third and final method I will use to bring this city to the ground and show the world that I mean business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI love my super-powers. I mean, who wouldn\u2019t. They turn my power from ultimate to limitless. I don\u2019t know too well what the difference between the two is, but limitless sounds even better. But if I had to choose between them and the size I would pick the size 100% of the times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is nothing that can compare to being giant. The actual size does not matter that much. There are pros and cons to all of them. The biggest blessing I really got when I unlocked all this powers within me is actually the fact that I will be able to enjoy all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing building-sized makes it easier to move around the city, interact with individual people and make some games up that are not really possible at larger scales. I\u2019ve had the time of my life during the day. But standing above the city, with my head reaching as high as the clouds is equally amazing. There\u2019s something very unique in being able to finish a skyscraper in one step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll sizes, as long as they go beyond a certain threshold, have something in common: the impact. No combination of super-powers will ever have the impact of seeing a young, good looking woman of incredible size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have never been a thinker, but I guess it has something to do with how obvious things look. For people to know about my laser vision or my super-breath I actually need to use them. It\u2019s much easier with the size. I just need to stand there and everyone instantly realizes about the balance of power. I would never change that for super powers. Now, I have nothing against having them. It\u2019s like the icing on the cake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple dozen city blocks have ended under my feet as I was thinking on this. I\u2019m close to another crowded area of the city. I decide to take a closer look. To me, closer means moving from a view from a mile in height to a more manageable 1000\u2019, once I\u2019m standing on my hands and knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy palms prove as effective as my soles at finishing buildings. I guess I don\u2019t need to tell you about what happens to the scattered people I\u2019ve met as I advanced. I stop when the crowd gets thicker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to do? Of course, I could just punch or slap them out of existence. But I\u2019m feeling like a little interaction, so I change my game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning my palm upwards, I easily dig my fingers into the concrete and deeper into the city\u2019s underground. Then, I scoop a section of it the size of four football stadiums and bring my palm up. Sitting on my knees, I spy the section of the city I\u2019m now holding in my palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHERE MUST BE THOUSANDS OF YOU THERE\u201d I say quietly. \u201cAND I\u2019M JUST HOLDING YOU IN MY PALM\u201d I add cheerfully<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHundreds in the edges of the city section in my hand are already dying, as the fall from it to the ground below is way too high for anyone that does not share my colossal height. They are but a fraction of the people I\u2019m holding, though, so I don\u2019t care too much about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHONESTLY, I\u2019M STILL HAVING PROBLEMS TO UNDERSTAND HOW SOMEONE LIKE YOU COULD THINK ABOUT ATTACKING ME. YOU GUYS SHOULD KNOW YOUR PLACE. I KNOW MINE\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shut up, enjoying the fact that I can hear the screams from the thousands in my hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNOW, I REALLY DON\u2019T NEED TO KILL YOU BUT, HONESTLY, NOW THAT I HAVE YOU IN MY PALM I HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT HOW TO SET YOU DOWN WITHOUT ACTUALLY FINISHING ALL OF YOU\u2026 SO I\u2019M NOT GOING TO TRY\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I finish, I just toss an entire section of the city unceremoniously over my shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI keep on my hands a feet for a while, sweeping my arms to the sides to maximize the effect of my passing. At a certain point I get tired of destroying the city little by little and I just let my entire body drop on countless blocks below me. A cloud of dust starts rising in the air but I don\u2019t give it too much time to settle as I start rolling on myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow! Let\u2019s talk about quick destruction! Thirty seconds later my body is resting in a neighboring city and there\u2019s nothing but rubble in the spot I rolled through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggle as I stand up and look into Palmsdale. The formerly modern and massive city has been reduced to a pile of rubble, an ice desert and a pool of lava. And right in the middle of it there is a lone standing skyscraper, just as I wished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI told you just how powerful and horny I felt before. It\u2019s hard to find words to describe my status right now. There is no one else around to talk to so I decide to quite talking and finally get to action. With a naughty smile in my lips I start strutting back to the Glock. It\u2019s time to get my urges taken care of.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nI once read about the Mile-High Club, the group of people that had had sex in a plane. I wonder if having sex while actually being about a mile tall would be enough to qualify.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter not much thought I decide that from now on I\u2019m the only valid member of the mile-high club. The name is much more adequate for me than for any mite-size human, in the end. I feel so strongly about it that I decide to let the people know. Looking up, my keen eyes pierce the clouds and I soon enough find some commercial jetliners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m back to my full senses, so I\u2019m not afraid to use some of my abilities again. Two new beams exit my eyes, but this time they are not meant to disintegrate but to capture. The difference in size with the now tiny jetliner is so remarkable that I almost have to apply no effort to stop it first and then to drag it towards my ready left palm. It felt easy and the plane does not really take all of my palm, so I repeat the operation with three more planes before I consider myself satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI love being able to hold four obviously packed airliners in a single palm. It\u2019s not as if I have thought on what I\u2019ll do with them. Their shapes are appealing but they are, of course, way too small. I don\u2019t need them to take care of my urges, though. Three steps later I\u2019m already straddling the Glock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder what to do with the planes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDID ANYONE INSIDE ANY OF THESE TOY AIRCRAFT HAVE SEX DURING THE FLIGHT?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Without too many ideas coming to my head, I just bring my hand in front of my face and blow, sending them into their last flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been so lubricated. I mean, I really, really need to have sex. In order to understand that, you need to take into account that if you count the days that have passed since I became sexually active, the number of screws I\u2019ve done since then is higher. Looking like I do and thinking like I do it has been easy, really. I\u2019ve never lacked offers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start bending down until my swollen lips touch the tip of the Glock. It\u2019s kind of cold and it sends a shiver down my spine. I keep going, engulfing more of the high-rise within me as I say:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTHIS IS GOING TO BE A MASSIVE ORGY\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder how many people will end up inside me. Thousands probably. I would barely feel them, were it not for the building they are at. My knees have touched the ground, and so have my lips, the Glock now completely inside me. It\u2019s time for the most delicate operation yet: pulling out without breaking the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m more careful than I\u2019ve been with any of my lovers over the last years. I\u2019ve often been told that I\u2019m as wild as I\u2019m hot\u2026 so you can imagine how wild that makes me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thrust down again with care, letting the cold glass structure slide inside me. No matter how careful I am, though, a minor (at least to me) earthquake ensues once I touch the ground again. I moan, more out of power than out of physical pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI repeat the operation a couple more times. Then, I become a little rougher. It was only a matter of time before I got carried away and soon I\u2019m riding the skyscraper like I would any guy I picked from a club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose buildings in the city that had been miraculously been left standing after my previous antics cannot outlast my new ones. If I were not so focused on my own horniness I would have probably put some more thought to how ironic it is for them to have been finally beaten by a love-making session, after all they\u2019ve endured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYESSS!\u201d I scream as I feel that I have finally found a match for my desires. A plane falls out of the sky and crashes not too far away from me and I snort as I realize that the only cause for it has been my lust-filled scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing about this sort of power reinforces my arousal, which at the time makes me shove harder, making me feel even more aroused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ground around me is starting to break as I punish it with more and more of my body\u2019s momentum. The city was a wasteland already, but it\u2019s shape is starting to feel more like a moon crater as I keep going. I keep moaning as I go, effectively broadcasting my sex session live into five states.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too good to be true. The Glock has resisted admirably, but at some point my passion is too much for it and a too hard gyration of my hips rips it entirely from the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFUCK!\u201d I yell aloud<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI let myself fall backwards and carefully pull the building from within me. It\u2019s still pretty much in one piece, even though just the act of holding it makes some debris rain from its base. I try using it as a more conventional dildo\u2026 but it\u2019s no good. Apparently the building\u2019s foundations had a lot to do with its ability to resist my efforts\u2026 up to a certain point. The second time I try to push it inside me, the entire skyscraper starts breaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFUCK!\u201d I say again, this time even louder<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of frustration, I push the Glock even harder. It crumbles into pieces inside me. I stand up and then, out of frustration, I stomp down hard. Anything that was left standing fifty miles around me goes down. I don\u2019t think I have ever feel so frustrated. I was so close to what promised to be the best orgasm in my entire life\u2026 I\u2019m really close to throwing a temper tantrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI manage to keep calm long enough to look around me, trying to find an alternative to the Glock. Unfortunately, the area around me is nothing but a massive swamp now\u2026 thanks to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world is saved from a second, harder stomp when my eyes set on something in the distance. Of course, I know Carlson\u2019s Peak. At my height, I can see its snowy top even from this distance. I know the rich and powerful in Palmsdale ski there, even in summer. It\u2019s one of the only ski resorts in the country that\u2019s open all year long. Almost without thinking, I start walking towards it. My body stretches as I do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy foot covers a slightly bigger area and sinks a little deeper with each step. My view of the landscape is also getting wider and wider as I advance. Carlson\u2019s peak is about level with my knees by the time I\u2019ve covered the 100 miles to it, less than five minutes later. I\u2019ve never been too good at math, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be too far away if I said that I\u2019m about 10 miles tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night is dark, but this does not prevent me from seeing different cloud layers as I look down. The lowest ones reach my mid-shin. Others are right in front of my knees, pussy, belly-button and tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom this high I can see hundreds of cities at the other side of the mountain range. I cannot prevent vaporizing one of the largest ones with two carefully aimed shots from my eyes. It was so tempting. When I see a cloud raising to form a familiar mushroom shape I cannot hold myself anymore and I straddle the mountain with ease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I move down on the peak. I see hundreds of tiny lights in the air as I do so. I had not seen them before since they were too low for my new viewpoint. I realize with admiration that standard commercial planes fly at about the height of my belly-button now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI forget about them the moment my lips engulf the mountain. Two ski stations, three dozen hotels and four villages get deep inside me as my knees bend and I work my way down the mountain slopes. I let go my loudest moan yet and hundreds of lights in the air suddenly turn into explosions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m even hornier than the moment I met the Glock for the first time, so I get rough almost immediately. In the end, if a mountain cannot offer some sort of resilience to me, what will?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder if I will be heard from the East Coast as I keep thrusting and moaning in unison. I never knew that the Carlson was an inactive volcano or something. Well, the truth is that it probably isn\u2019t. I guess that with all my pounding I might have turned the Earth crust into some sort of pudding, so previous geological knowledge doesn\u2019t matter too much anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment the mountain \u201cejects\u201d its burning stream of lava into me is unexpected, but it\u2019s incredibly welcome. The planet and I reach our climax at the same time and I yell so loud that a few of the illuminated cities in the distance catch on fire a few seconds later. Only God knows what sort of disaster my voice created there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe feeling of the lava is so pleasurable that it moves me to thrust one last time. It\u2019s a mistake. What I thought impossible finally happens. I\u2019ve broken the mountain. I hardly care. I can just let myself drop backwards, as the peak of Carlson\u2019s Peak rolls down my thighs. My body hits the ground with the force of a thousand hydrogen bombs, finishing those cities within my view that had miraculously survived until now. I\u2019m panting heavily. Then, the stars start to blur and I doze off. My last thought as the sky turns completely dark is that life cannot get any better!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>End of Vicki\u2019s first day as a Giantess</b></span></div></div>",

I groan and stretch as I start my transition from sleep to wakefulness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world is completely silent as I start sitting down and rub my eyes, getting ready to get them exposed to the light. The transition is less painful than I was expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that a cool breeze has been soothing my entire body tells me that I\u2019m waking up outdoors and nude. It\u2019s hardly a first for me, but it\u2019s also not my most usual way to wake up in the morning, so I try to recall the events that have led me to this situation. The previous occasions had invariably been after a long session of wild sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMemories start flooding my mind as it tries to make some sense out of the weird landscape around me. My brain is quickly activating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan it be possible?\u201d I wonder aloud as I keep exploring my surroundings<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I start laughing when I realize that it has not been a weird dream but an amazing reality. My laughter booms louder than thunder as I zoom in with my sight and find the battered remains of some cities in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was not a dream!\u201d I say loud enough for the entire world to here. Literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, it seems that I fell asleep after a session of wild sex, after all. Only I was fucking a pretty tall mountain. Well, and part of the country.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a deep breath and unwillingly end up swallowing a cloud formation. I cough, since it feels raspy in my throat. It reminds me that things are not the same, at this height. I vaguely remember having thought that I was about 10 miles tall, by the time I finished growing yesterday. I was not paying too much attention to the figure, though, since I was quite more focused on getting laid. After a quick look around me, I believe that this estimation is correct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10 miles tall! Wow! I only got this tall because I needed the size in order to use Carlson\u2019s Peak as a dildo. I was too horny to think on anything else. But now that I\u2019m a little calmer, I cannot prevent thinking on the figure and concluding it\u2019s impressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ve been thinking about being a giant girl for longer than I can remember. Well, I can actually remember the first time I thought about it: the day my sister got a little more than a hundred feet tall and mocked an entire city, 13 years ago. I was only a little girl at the time, so I did not know too well what I was wishing for. As I grew up and became more sexually active, the wish intensified and I began understanding its implications better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all those years, in all my fantasies, I had never pictured myself at my present height. Not even remotely. The most I had been able to think about were not even a couple thousand feet, the height of the tallest skyscrapers in the world. Being 10 miles tall is\u2026 insane. But for some strange reason, it also feels really good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know perfectly well that I can change my size at will. I could shrink myself back to a more manageable height. My initial 25-stories seem ridiculous now, even if that\u2019s the height I\u2019ve had for most of the day and it was tremendously fun. Even a mile-high looks like a reasonable size to shrink to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly I don\u2019t want to. There is something about being this massive\u2026 that turns me on. I mean\u2026 I\u2019ve broken a mountain with my pussy. How much cooler than that can it get?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stretch my limbs and decide to stand up. Whoa! I was right. Being 10 miles tall is INCREDIBLE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo start with, there are layers of clouds practically in front of every part of my body. A quick look down promptly tells me why. The mountain range where the Carlson Peak formerly was has trouble to reach to my lower thighs. My size cannot be measured in human terms anymore. The only valid references are geological. And I love it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is only one thing that a girl my size can do, which is exploring the country, so that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. Well, the country will probably not take that long, so I guess that I should really set myself into exploring the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI need to pick a direction to walk to first. A quick look to my back tells me that I fucked up part of the West Coast really well, so I come to the conclusion that it\u2019s going to be more interesting to walk across the country and get into the East Coast. I can take advantage of that and take over the country too, once I\u2019m there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI start walking, my 4-mile long steps carrying me across states faster than I would normally walk across city blocks. I\u2019ve been living of my body for quite a while, so you can imagine that I\u2019m anything but an expert in geography. I do not recognize most of the features of the landscape my path crosses with and, of course, I cannot name any of the cities I can see from my vast height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s easy enough to recognize Las Vegas in the distance, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy motto is \u201ccarpe diem\u201d so I guess you can imagine that I love Vegas. I start walking towards the city of sin and stop when I realize that some of the buildings at its outskirts are crumbling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realize, too late, that each of my steps is producing a Magnitude 9 earthquake. I might be prepared for the world, but the world is certainly not prepared for the new me. The city is only a few yards away from me, from my new perspective, so I decide to interact with it from the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI place my hands on my hips and observe the city from my height, my eyes easily piercing the different cloud layers. I wonder which sort of reaction my presence is causing in the population. No matter how keen my sight is, people have become just too inconsequential for me to be able to see them properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSO, HOW ARE WE DOING THIS MORNING?\u201d I ask in a cute tone, knowing that my voice is probably shaking the very foundations of the city<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019M VICKI, AS I\u2019M SURE MOST OF YOU WILL KNOW ALREADY. I JUST GOT A LITTLE TALLER. DON\u2019T WORRY. I LOVE VEGAS, SO I WON\u2019T BE FUCKING IT UP ANYMORE THAN IT ALREADY IS. I JUST WANTED TO SAY HI\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDozens of tiny specks show in the air and I quickly realize that plenty of people decided that flying away from me would be the best course of action. Of course, I do not approve of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI NEVER SAID THAT YOU COULD LEAVE, THOUGH\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I finish, I batter my eyelashes and soon two bluish beams emit from my eyes and engulf every single flying craft in the city. I cannot even feel their resistance as I pull them towards me and make them land in the vast extension of my right palm. There is plenty of room to spare. I lift the palm to my face, to take a closer look and some explosions ensue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCRAP!\u201d I say aloud<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do not know too well what has happened, but I have a feeling that regular aircraft might not be prepared to move from 5 to 10 miles in height in an instant. I don\u2019t know if it has been the pressure, the temperature or what not. What I think I know is that there\u2019s nothing alive in my palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOH WELL\u201d I say and then toss the contents of my hand over my shoulder without too much ceremony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI JUST REALIZED THAT MY PRESENT SIZE INTRODUCES SOME CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATION. I MEAN, I\u2019M PRETTY SURE THAT YOU CAN HEAR ME, BUT THERE\u2019S NO FUCKING WAY I CAN HEAR YOU. THIS IS A KIND OF A PROBLEM\u2026 I\u2019M NOT GOING TO BE SHRINKING ANY TIME SOON, SO YOU MICROBES SHOULD BETTER FIGURE OUT A WAY TO LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO TELL ME. I\u2019LL BE IN DC IN A WHILE, TO TAKE OVER, SO IT WOULD BE GOOD IF YOU\u2019D MADE SOMETHING UP BY THEN\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s really not much more I can say to the people in the city, so I\u2019m about to leave. I have second thoughts in the last minute. I do love Vegas. In a way, it is to cities what I am to girls: wild, fun, naughty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019VE JUST THOUGHT ABOUT SOMETHING. THIS IS MY FAVORITE CITY, SO I\u2019M GOING TO MAKE IT MY CAPITAL. AT MY HEIGHT, IT BASICALLY DOES NOT MATTER WHERE IT IS, SINCE I CAN MOVE AROUND WITH EASE. SO, I MIGHT AS WELL PLACE IT HERE\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, my eyes quickly set on the Spring Mountains and on Mt. Charleston. I have an idea. Switching my laser vision on with the ease of someone stretching a finger, I let go unheard of amounts of energy in the direction of the mountain range. I\u2019m not focused on massive destruction, though. Not this time. With a precision that I did not know I have, I use my laser beams like twin scalpels and I begin to sculpt the mountain. By the time I\u2019m done, I have a pretty good version of a stone throne.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking some care to keep my distance with the city so that I will be easily felt but I won\u2019t bring it down just by walking, I move around Vegas and reach my new throne. I realize it\u2019s way too short. Luckily, the Spring Mountains offer me enough raw material. I just need to rip them of the ground and pile them up in the spot I chose as my command chair. Then, I proceed to melt them and sculpt them in the form of the original throne, only much larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time I\u2019m done, I\u2019ve created the tallest mountain on Earth. I\u2019ve also crafted an adequate enough chair for my new self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting and breathing in hard, I smile and address the city:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYOU\u2019LL BE SEEING A LOT OF ME. BELIEVE ME, YOU ARE WAY LUCKIER THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE WORLD\u201d</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>Anniversary</b><br>\r\n</font><br>\r\nThe 15th of June is always a sad day, I reflect as I wake up in another bed in another hotel room and look at the warm body next to me, trying to remember the name of the guy it belongs to. I\u2019ve always been an early riser, not needing to sleep much in order to look great.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick look at the full body mirror of the suite I\u2019m staying confirms my thought. It\u2019s curious how extremely well I got along with my sister, considering the obvious differences between us, not only on the physical side but also in our character. It\u2019s true that she did not have too long to experiment with it, but I just can\u2019t picture Eileen going to bed with the first person she met at a club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m considerably more liberal in that front, as in many others, but I still miss her a lot. She was kind, funny and imaginative and I\u2019m sure that she would have supported me considerably more than Mom and Dad when I decided to become a model rather than going to college. Which, considering the fact that she was a top student, says a lot about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know it\u2019s typical enough to idealize a long lost sibling, especially when I was eight years old the last time I saw her. But Eileen and I were deeply bound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take the remote and switch the TV on. I don\u2019t care about turning the volume down. Muffled sounds from my most recent lover tell me that the TV has awakened him. I don\u2019t mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs every 15th of June, the images are predictable enough. And they cause the same feeling of loneliness of every year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite letters on a red background inform the viewers about the 13th anniversary of Eileen Peterson\u2019s growth in River City and her posterior trek through it. I see the same images of every year, the last images I\u2019ll ever see of my sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRumor has it that she is alive, but the Government will neither confirm nor deny. In a way, it\u2019s worse than if I knew she was dead. The voiceover provides more details to what the text on screen is already saying. The number 17 appears a few times. It\u2019s the official number of victims according to the government. Apparently, most of them were cops in the blockade that had tried to stop Eileen from wreaking more havoc in the city. She incinerated them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voiceover omits the fact that she did so thanks to the amazing heat vision she had just found out she possessed. And of course, it omits the fact that by the time she released it on the cops she had already been hit with hundreds of bullets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYear after year, government and press have worked hard to picture Eileen like a monster. It makes me sick. Especially when it\u2019s so obvious that the only reason Eileen is currently a missing person instead of the giant ruler of a city is the fact that she, out of her own will, agreed on being reduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ve tried to find out about her whereabouts these last years. I have been unsuccessful. Melancholy takes over me as more images of my sister fill the screen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man (Richard?) finally wakes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, today\u2019s the anniversary of the giant bitch attack\u201d he says, looking at the TV<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turn towards him and just utter one word: \u201cOut\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s my tone or my expression, but after a second of hesitation, he hurries to put his pants on and leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI order breakfast in the room and try to get ready for the day. I need to work. There is a reason I\u2019m in Palmsdale and it\u2019s no other than a photoshoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter two years at it, I\u2019m a pro. So, no one notices about my mood as I pose as sexily as ever for the cameras. Today\u2019s photoshoot is about swimwear. Bikinis and lingerie are my two areas of specialty. The way the guy at the agency put it, it seems that I\u2019m somewhat too voluptuous for runway work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know many people think that working as a model is like winning the lottery. Well, the pay is definitely good, even for someone like me who is not at the top (yet). But the work is much harder than anyone imagines. Halfway through the afternoon we are almost done, when we do a last break so that we can refresh ourselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I see him. His face looks familiar from the first moment, but I need a few seconds to associate it with a name. Then, a myriad of reactions erupt inside me when I realize who the person in the audience is: Dr. Solten!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of my family\u2019s physician, precisely today, makes it really hard for me to focus during the last 45 minutes of work. I get the job done as well as possible and then rush to the crowd. I catch his arm as he is trying to get out of the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDr. Solten\u201d I whisper to his ear while people around him look in surprise at the man in his fifties, being intercepted by a hot model in a bikini.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have come\u201d is his only reply<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, you know who I am?\u201d I whisper again<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks around himself, nervously. I know why he is jumpy, but I doubt anyone in the crowd understands what\u2019s going on, besides the initial surprise of seeing me from so up close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy parents changed their name right after Eileen\u2019s incident. The government suggested it to them. We quickly moved to another city. I\u2019m Victoria O\u2019Neal to the world, completely unrelated to the giantess that took over River City in a single afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Solten finally says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou and I need to talk\u201d I say, sounding even authoritative<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea\u201d Dr. Solten says<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI narrow my eyes and reply:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe you\u2019d prefer me to tell everyone who you are, then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, please\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLobby bar, 10 minutes\u201d I say. \u201cDon\u2019t play with me\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nods and I release his arm. In a second, he has scurried inside the crowd. 10 minutes later he is where I told him to be. The fact that he showed up tells me that nervous or not, he wants to talk to me. It would have been easy enough for him to disappear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smile at him, point towards a secluded table and we both walk. Five minutes of small talk and a drink later, we get into the real conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size45\" style=\"\"><b>Awakening</b></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreud enounced the theory that dreams are always related to something that happened to you the day before. And typically, they are related to the thing that impressed you the most the day before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it is clear that Dr. Solten\u2019s revelation that Eileen had grown out of pure will hit home, since the dream I am immersed on when I start to gradually transition from sleep to wakefulness is one of me in Eileen\u2019s place, that is, using the city as a dollhouse. It is not the first time I have had this dream. God, I\u2019m pretty sure that I\u2019m not the only woman that has dreamed about this. But this time it has definitely felt livelier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no warm body next to mine when I wake up today. I was too shocked by Dr. Solten\u2019s revelation to be in the mood for fun. Out of everything he said, there is an idea that keeps coming back to me every few minutes: Eileen grew out of pure will\u2026 and also shrunk out of pure will. She made herself smaller, which allowed the army to apprehend her and take her away from all her loved ones, including me, forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy would she do that? I\u2019m sure that she was not expecting the type of reaction she got from authorities, true. As smart as my sister was, she was also quite na\u00efve. But my question is even more fundamental: once she was an unstoppable, all-powerful giant, why would she accept being a mere normal girl again? This thought has kept haunting me all night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019ve had thirteen years to think about Eileen and what happened to her, and besides the fact that I miss her a lot, there is another strong conclusion I\u2019ve extracted out of all that thinking: had it been me in Eileen\u2019s place, there would have been no way I would have allowed the little people to shrink me! The reaction from authorities that followed only helps me to reinforce that thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, knowing that it was Eileen herself who decided to make herself smaller, rather than some mysterious shrink ray Dr. Solten had put together puzzles me like nothing I\u2019ve ever thought about before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI rush through breakfast and show up at the grand ballroom. The shot is going to be inside the hotel today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time in my short professional career, my mind is not clear enough to work. The photographer has to stop the photoshoot four times to correct me. The fourth time he asks me if I\u2019m feeling well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI apologize and slide into the next swimsuit for the day, a sexy black bikini that looks even sexier in my bombshell body. I know I may be sounding too arrogant, but I\u2019ve never believed in false humility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI get back to the stage and start posing once more. My mind is still going through a way more powerful thought than the photoshoot itself, though. I\u2019m ready to apologize for the second time to the photographer as he stops taking pictures when I realize that the reaction I\u2019m getting is not that of a crew that is pissed off at the lack of professionalism of the model but one of pure shock. They are all staring at me. At an approximately 15-foot-tall version of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh fuck!\u201d I mutter as I realize about what\u2019s going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it all rushes into my head, my mind suddenly focused. Dr. Solten\u2019s words echo in my mind as my eyes move at regular intervals from my impossibly long legs to the absolutely awestruck crew. Then, I mutter something that they obviously do not understand:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan it be possible?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is only one way to know. And I am eager to know. Closing my eyes, I focus my entire will in a single purpose. The stretching feeling becomes evident. I enjoy it with my eyes closed. I open them when I feel my head bump into the ceiling. Give or take, I have added five feet to my already impressive stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew has been motionless for a while, but now they start screaming again. I smile at them. This kind of unsettles them more, as if the fact that I seem to be enjoying the situation is beyond reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, I guess it is, for them, but the truth is that I am as exhilarated as a young woman can be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently, after thirteen years, Dr. Solten could still not understand how Eileen had managed to grow. According to him, no one in the government had a clue, either. The only explanation he had managed to come up with was that Eileen was special, that there was something in her genes that had allowed her to become what she had become.  Finding out that I share the same gift makes me excited beyond any limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that knowledge now in my intimate possession, my next course of action is clear enough in my head. The photoshoot crew has been kind enough, so I decide to give them a fair warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys, I really think it would be a very good idea if you all got out of the building\u2026 like right now\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey waste no time in taking my advice and run to the doors as fast as they can. I giggle, give them a few seconds of head start and then focus again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, I\u2019m going to grow through the building. I\u2019m way to big to get through any of the doors of the ballroom already, and the idea of trying to shrink myself a little for that is so absurd that it does not even deserve any consideration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe photoshoot takes place at a luxury hotel, as usual. And, as usual, most of the people on it are jerks. Or at least that\u2019s the general opinion I have about the ones I\u2019ve seen around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo I decide that the rest of the building does not deserve the same sort of consideration I have had with the crew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy head is pushing plaster again soon enough. It does not need to long to win the battle. Just watching the reaction of those having breakfast as my head bursts through the floor and fills the central area of the restaurant on the third floor would have been worth the effort of growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreams erupt and I see that people do not know too well how to react. I cannot resist the urge to blow a kiss to a few, sending them flying a couple of feet backwards. One of the last things I see before breaking into the next floor are my generous boobs lifting a table and the two people that were still sitting around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, my head is not the only part of my body that is breaking through things. In order, my shoulders and boobs are also creating their fair degree of damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is no one to be seen on the following floor, so I unconsciously speed the process up and break into the next, marvelling at how small the young couple that starts screaming right in front of my eyes looks. In two floors people have moved from Barbie-size to He-Man size. The couple momentarily disappears from view when I get too heavy and my own weight sends my feet two floors down to the lobby. When my head comes back up to smile at them again, a few seconds later, the hole in their floor has widened and the couple has been demoted to G.I. Joe size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n I am running out of toy references, but I am not running out of will to grow at all. If my calculations are right, I am in the seventh floor of the twenty stories tall hotel. Well, to be precise, my beautiful eyes are in the seventh floor. I am almost everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cannot look at any more of the guests at the hotel in detail. At most, I can catch a quick glimpse of their screaming bodies as they fall down; my body has got so massive that the moment my head reaches a new floor it makes it collapse instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI realize that I am fuelling my own growth and that I can keep at it for as long as I want. Being constrained inside a building I do not have too many references on how big I really am, so I just will to keep on growing until my head finally breaks through the roof and I can breath fresh air again. When my head and neck are completely out I wish for everything to come to a halt. It happens almost instantly. I push my arms to the sides, easily breaking through the hotel\u2019s side walls and look back at myself. The Excelsior looks like a tight dress around me. It feels as if just a deep breath would be enough to bring it down. I take it and thee building collapses on myself almost instantly, covering my torso with dust and debris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy thoughts are focused on the fact that the debris that managed to get into my sexy bikini top is most annoying. I\u2019ve almost not considered the fact that there must have been dozens of people in the building I just grew through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m about to say something when a sudden dizziness takes over me and before I can realize I\u2019m falling backwards. The ten-story building behind the Excelsior does not stand a chance as my curvy ass hits its roof and brings it down as if a meteorite had crashed on it. As my tight buttocks hit the ground, a shockwave ensues, bringing down a couple more smaller buildings and severely damaging four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI close my eyes, trying to clear my head. When I open them again the world seems to be ok, except for the fact that it\u2019s ridiculously small, of course. My long silky thighs are completely blocking the four-lane road right in front of the hotel I had been staying<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, I am perfectly conscious that my growth process has casually finished four rather large buildings that I know would have been packed with people. A few of them may have woken up just to see their roof coming down on them. At this moment I could not care less about their fates, though, because my mind can only think on one thing: I am a fucking giant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI do not remember ever having felt so great before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy sister shocked the world a dozen years back. And now, I am just like Eileen. Well, not exactly like her. Eileen was a cute and smart 19-year-old girl with a matching pink bikini. I, her sister, on the other hand, am a 21-year-old bikini model with a bombshell body and an attitude to match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick look down shows me the black bikini I had been wearing, along with the jewellery I had used for the shot. I know I\u2019m also wearing my make up. It\u2019s an attire that tells well enough about myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother obvious difference with Eileen is the size. It is now well known that Eileen had been 108 feet tall. Newscasts did not stop repeating that this would mean that Eileen would be just a tad taller than a 10-story building. Well, now I am somewhat taller than that\u2026 while sitting down. I grew through a twenty-story building and my head was fully out by the time it collapsed, I guess that this makes me more than twice as tall as Eileen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople are quickly reacting to my presence, of course. Well, at least those that have not been crushed by my growth spurt. I smile at them and, quite instinctively, brush the dust and debris off my body. It proves to be fatal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis teaches me one of the first lessons I learn as a giant. Whatever you want to call me now, I am a being about the size of a 25-story building with the instincts of a 5\u20198\u201d human. More often than not, this will not work too well. I realize that most of the times, though, the sole recipient of the \u201cinconveniences\u201d will be the population at my feet, so it\u2019s easy enough to accept that\u2026 well, shit happens. As long as it does not happen to me, there should not be a problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat to me is merely annoying debris turns out to be more of a meteorite rain for the helpless crowd in the road, the only difference being that meteorites have never had such a high success rate when striking people. A casual brush of my hands on my boobs and lap has substantially increased my recently started and quickly growing body count.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNewscasts have incessantly repeated that Eileen\u2019s trek caused 17 direct victims and she was called a monster for that. My first five minutes as a giant woman and I am probably already sitting on twenty times that number. I can only shrug and admire my sister again for having been able to remain so careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI know I will not. And the city will soon learn that, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have not addressed the crowd yet, so I take a look down to see what is still remaining of it after all the disruption I have created. It is easy enough to spot a crew carrying photoshoot equipment. I\u2019m happy that they were able to make it. My sight quickly focuses on the man I\u2019m seeking: the photographer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe is about half a block down. That\u2019s nothing, by my recently updated standards. Stooping, I reach out with an arm the length of a construction crane and soon my fingers and their neatly manicured and freshly painted fingernails are on top of him. I giggle when I realize that a couple dozen little fuckers probably think that I am actually going for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch like a claw machine at an arcade, my hand reaches down and pinches the target man between three fingers. Differently from the claw machines, once I have closed my grip on him there is no way I will let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe screams all the way to my curious face and I smile at him, trying quite unsuccessfully to reassure him. I change his grip from three to two fingers, to make sure that I can hold him by his sides, facing me. Then, I mentally size him. The only toys that come to mind are the little green army men, and I doubt if he would not look like a dwarf among them. It is exhilarating! There is no better reference to understand one\u2019s size as a giant than people, and I know the puny thing I am holding in my fingers was the same tall and reasonably good looking man that has been taking pictures of me half naked over the last couple of days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at him with glee I speak for the first time since I emerged through the roof of the wasted hotel building. To me, my voice still sounds like me. Judging from the fact that half the crowd momentarily stops their attempts to flee and looks up in my direction, I realize that it must have sounded quite loud to them. It\u2019s a question of perspective, I guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHELLO BRAD I say<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man stops screaming, looks at me puzzled and finally says \u201cMy name is Brandon\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh well. It is not the first time I mix a name up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNEVER MIND I say. I PREFER BRAD. ANY OBJECTIONS?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI have to contain a giggle as my tiny lover shakes his head frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy did you grow?\u201d Brandon asks me<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is a good question. The answer is simple enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBECAUSE I COULD I replied<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you going to do with me?\u201d he askes<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGod, I\u2019ve been a giant for less than ten minutes and little people are already so predictable! Feeling naughty, I clash my teeth and say in a deep voice I THINK I\u2019LL EAT YOU<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNooooo\u201d he goes with a face that is the pure picture of panic<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI cannot prevent a giggle as I say I WAS KIDDING, SILLY. I ALREADY HAD BREAKFAST<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying anything else, I drop him on the roof of one of the buildings in the area that is still standing. His yell tells me that I\u2019ve been too careless and that I dropped him from too high. Judging from his reaction, I\u2019d say he has broken a leg. God! Everything is so fragile! I remind myself that I need to be much more careful than I\u2019m being with the world around me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSOMEONE SHOULD CALL AND GET A DOCTOR I say, addressing the crowd<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI take a quick look around and realize that it would be a good idea if someone called a few dozen doctors instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was not so attached to the photographer, in any case, so I quickly forget about him and think on what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the crowd has used the time I spent with the photographer to put some more distance with me. I can\u2019t see any more of them that are both alive and within my reach. It is nothing that I could not easily solve in a dozen different ways, but one of them is to stand up and I\u2019m eager to do so. It\u2019s time for the city to meet me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</td>",
