As you pull into town your car gives out, out of gas. It looks as though your in a fairly modest neightborhood, buildings are big though. your car has stoped infront of the largest mansion you have seen in your life, or more accurately in front of the ajar gates to the estate<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere do you go?</span></div></div>",

This place is impressive, the structure seems to go on for ever, and four floors high. you have a half mile walk even to the front door, the 15 foot tall front door is impressive, you can barely reach the knocker. The door is slightly ajar, strange for sure. The rest of the place looks almost normal, if a hundred years out of date. Some of the wood is rotting a bit too..<br>\r\nLooking around you see a Garage isn't to far away, you see that the front is open and a car was left halfway out, an SUV. On the other side of the front door you see what looks like an entrance to a stormcellar, a bar is holding it closed but you see no lock</span></div></div>",

Walking around a bit you decide that the drainpipe seems sturdy enough, actually, it's huge, you could even climb up the inside if you wanted but you have no idea whats in there so thats out. you slowly get your arms around the thick pipe and climb, step climb step climb, it takes a bit but soon your on the second floor looking in through an open window. apparently this is the bathroom... makes a bit of sense, your real happy you chose not to go on the inside though. it seems empty but you can't tell behind the curtains, you see the shower has frosted glass, the toilet seems safe, all in all it might be a good place to go in, but if your found there... there are eves and ledges you can walk around the house to find a better entrance.</span></div></div>",

Walking a bit further down you eventually end up in the cellar, its mostly natural looking walls, carved roughly rather than a properly laid foundation. Looking on the ground you notice that there are footprints in the dust, big footprints, fresh footprints. <br>\r\nThe celar seems to split off into a few smaller rooms but right here you notice what was once carefully stacked boxes seem to have been tossed around and knocked on the ground. nothing seems to have been broken though...</span></div></div>",

Some even writen in strange ruins, some seeminly built with styles of 100's of years ago. you reach a small circle around a dragon fountain and follow off at a likely direction. the town isn't so modest, but it's still a strange place.</span></div></div>",
