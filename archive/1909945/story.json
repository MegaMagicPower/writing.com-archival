Most of the ship's inhabitants were either sleeping, doing things privately, or were off somewhere else. The only distinct noise emanating from anywhere on the starship was the metallic sound of a quarian tinkering away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she screwed in a couple of loose bolts, Tali couldn't help but reflect on what had led her into her current situation. It all started with what seemed like a normal mission - except that Tali wasn't brought along. To say she was a bit shocked was an understatement. Tali had <i>always</i> gone on missions with Shepard, every mission, since day one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"It's not you, Tali,\" Shepard had told her as he was preparing to leave. \"It's just... well, it's complicated.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali knew Shepard wasn't trying to spite her. They had been squadmates far too long for that. But the words stung nonetheless, mostly because of their vague nature. What was she doing wrong? Was it something she had said?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose questions floated through her head, but received no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"And now Liara and Kaidan are out stomping bad guys, while I'm sitting here all alone,\"</i> Tali thought gloomily to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she would probably never admit it to herself, Tali was growing a bit paranoid. She felt like she was being tossed aside like she didn't matter. She knew - or at least, thought she knew - that she had to work quickly to stop that from happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd thus, the last couple of hours that Shepard and crew had been away had been spent whittling away in her living quarters, trying to come up with something. But Tali thought she had finally gotten it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the last part had been set in place, Tali set the gun down, admiring her handiwork. It was a bit of a wild idea, but in her mind, a doable one. The only way to get back on the missions was to get stronger, right? That's what anyone would want in a soldier. So through a bit of quarian ingenuity and some tech parts that Tali proooobably shouldn't have had, she had managed to create a gun that, in theory, would strengthen up her muscles and give her extra abilities - better strength, better stamina, stuff like that. It would only be a minor boost, but it would hopefully be enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the back of her mind, though, she couldn't help but fantasize about more than that. Imagine being strong enough to take on Wrex. Imagine being strong enough to take on Wrex <i>with ease</i>. Imagine being strong enough to wipe out entire squadrons with just her own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali couldn't help but chuckle a little. It was a nice thought, but an unrealistic one. Even science had its limits, and the gun wouldn't do any more than give her a little athletic boost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr so she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter taking a second to make sure no one was walking around outside her door, Tali picked up the gun, looking at it from every angle to make sure everything was in its correct place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only as she looked down the barrel of the shining pistol that the insanity of the situation really hit her. She was about to shoot herself. <i>With a gun.</i> This was crazy! What if something went wrong? Was dying really worth it at this point?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali shook her head. No. This was her only option at this point. She had devoted her life to Shepard's cause, and she was NOT just going to sit on the sidelines while everything happened around her. Plus, she had triple checked her work. Nothing could go wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali took a deep breath, slowly raising the gun in front of her torso and turning it so the barrel faced her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's now or never.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding her eyes tight, she squeezed the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest, Tali wasn't sure what to expect when the blast hit her. What she expected really didn't matter, though, because what she got felt like someone had hooked her up to a generator. Shockwaves of energy tore through her body, sending her sprawling to the floor. The quarian could barely muffle her cry as she hit the ground, feeling like she was on fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOddly, though, the feeling was gone as quickly as it had come, leaving Tali lying on the floor, gasping for breath.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rarely had anyone seen a Quarian outside their environment suits in centuries. Even amongst their own kind they normally had to keep themselves within the suit as their bodies seemed to lack the ability to fight off most foreign infections. Due to the absolutely pristine environment they had cultivated on Rannoch they had, as a species, had little to no contact with pathogens - until the Geth had driven them off their homeworld. Then, they'd tried to maintain sterile environments wherever they went - and effectively they were left unable to exist in most atmospheres.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo see a Quarian splitting their environments suit like it was the skin of an overripe fruit was certainly not something ever before witnessed - but the flawless skin of Tali'Zorah was doing exactly that now. Sirens were blaring in her helmet as suit ruptures were recorded everywhere. The sound was deafening and irritating in her current state - a lot like an alarm going off during a massive hangover. Her hands gripped at the sides of her helmet and promptly cracked the  casing like a shell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was exposed - and gasping - in the ships atmosphere. But she was in no danger of infection - her bodies immuno-response was now the equal of any human as every aspect of her body was strengthened, enhanced and improved. As she threw back her head in a mix of pain and ecstasy it flashed the beauty of the Quarian people into view of any onlooker - in this case only the recording systems of the Normandy 2. For centuries the Asari were held up as the pinnacle of humanoid beauty - but this was only because none but the Asari and Krogan could remember what a Quarian looked like - and even few of them had every truly seen one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali'Zorah's face was exquisitely beautiful - and her body - always obviously shapely in her skin tight environment suit - had added even greater curves over every inch - curves supplied by sexy layers of powerful muscle. Her hand crushed the gun in her hand - breaking the mix of Reaper, Collector, Quarian and Geth technology that had went into it's construction and releasing a wave of unfocused energy through the Normandy that knocked out many of the systems on the ship - but as the energy passed over Tali's body it seemed to play across it like a sparkling wave. Traces of the energy waves could be seen seeping into Tali's body, which pulsed and grew larger yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe once frail Quarian's body had been enhanced thoroughly - going from vulnerable to the least infection to nearly immune to all pathogens. The strength in her limbs was certainly more than she could have expected. Perhaps she would not be destroying squadrons with just her strength - but as she got to her feet it wasn't hard to imagine her easily handling a Krogan. She was taller now - nearly 8 feet - and her body was packed with super dense muscle - dense enough to shrug off most small weapons fire. And around her body shimmered something never seen from a Quarian - a powerful biotic field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving finally tracked down the source of the power surge that had knocked out the ships system, the engineer Kenneth and Gaby burst into the room where Tali had been experimenting. Gaby felt a mix of awe and desire looking at the naked amazon before her - Kenneth felt no such mixture. Although the strength of her body may not be enough to take down a squadron - the reaction of the young engineers suggester her body might have other ways of dealing with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali was so excited and shocked by her new body that she hadn't even noticed the engineers arrive as she ran her hands over her spectacular form, caressing every inch of herself and enjoying the way her body seemed to respond to her ministrations with pleasant sensations - even when she increased the force of her touch - it only seemed to increase the pleasure, not bring pain. She wouldn't have noticed the engineers were it not for the sounds Kenneth made as he slumped to the floor passed out from lack of blood flow to the brain as the room was now awash in Quarian pheremones - a potent aphrodisiac not encountered before by any species other than Quarians - and never encountered to the degree that Tali's body now produced.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tali felt like she was floating on cloud nine. She was barely aware of anything that was going on around her, yet at the same time felt she could perceive more of the world around her than she could before. She felt strong. She felt fast. She felt beautiful. She just felt flat out amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an amount of time that could have been a couple seconds or a couple years for all she cared, Tali came down off of her little growth high. With the adrenaline leaving her (though she still felt so much more energetic than usual), Tali was able to clear her head and remember where she was, what she was doing... and who had come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quarian amazon turned her head slightly, focusing her gaze on the female engineer, who was helpless to do anything except stare blankly, mouth wide open as her partner lay unconscious on the floor next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the first time she had spoken since she had fired the gun on herself, and even though it was one of the tiniest of words, it highlighted even more differences that she had now. It was subtle, but her voice sounded more... sultry now? That was really the only way she could describe it. Looked like the gun had effects other than what she had intended. Interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabby was still standing there in silence. Honestly, Tali was glad for her stunned reaction. It gave her more time to think, and panicking wasn't needed from anyone right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... do you mind giving me a minute?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabby solemnly nodded, transfixed by the lovely accented voice of the marvelous alien in front of her. Without another word, she quickly turned on her heels and headed straight out the door and down the hallway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter carefully dragging Kenneth out into the hallway (noting to herself how light he seemed now), Tali shut the door behind her, making sure to lock it this time. She took a deep breath, feeling her much larger chest shift heavily with the movement. It was still sort of hard to believe this was happening, even though the sensation was all too real. Now, it was time for the moment of truth. She quickly turned on her heels and faced the full-length mirror on her wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view was breathtaking. Tali knew what she looked like, of course, but with all her traveling it had been so long since she had actually seen her whole body at one time. And that was ignoring the fact that said body was now bigger than most in the galaxy. She leaned in a bit closer, smiling at the familiar sparkle in her eyes that gave her some comfort in this uncertainty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose eyes couldn't help peering down at her incredibly big body. It wasn't exactly what she had intended, but she found herself loving it oh so much. It helped that she had apparently kept her curves - better, they had been improved on, as she noticed her impossibly thin waist and luscious, rounded breasts that tingled a bit in the open air. Slowly, tentatively, she brought her arm up into a bicep flex. She was barely prepared for the incredible sensations that came next. It was near orgasmic, the feeling of immense power that swelled through her whole body at that precise moment. She didn't know exactly HOW strong she was, but from that feeling, it was probably off the charts. And that wasn't even talking about the immense pride she felt just staring at the huge, solid mound of quarian muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer next instinct was to show this off to whoever was in the vicinity. She had no idea how the other crew members would react (though if it was anything like Kenneth and Gabby, it could be a lot of fun), but she really just wanted to show off this new body, to see what it could do. It would probably scare them a bit less if she covered up, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of scavenging, Tali finally decided that the only real option for coverage was her bed sheets. After a little fitting, she managed to wrap the fabric around her in a way that (mostly) covered up all her more womanly parts. She noted how the makeshift clothing looked a little like a ballgown, even doing a little spin in excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali'Zorah was officially ready for anything the galaxy threw at her.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The last rep was always the most difficult. Her muscles were aching, screaming at her to stop and take a break. The logical part of her mind agreed wholeheartedly; she'd pushed herself as hard as possible the last few days, working out like a woman possessed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it wasn't enough for Tali. No, she couldn't give up and sit back, while that <i>asari bitch</i> still had her claws in <i>her </i>Shepard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young quarian growled; her helmet's vocalizer picking up on the sound and flashing. Her arms were shaking as she finally completed the exercise, raising the barbell up to her chest, and then promptly dropping the weight at her feet. Tali panted heavily while attempting to steady her breathing. Glowing pale eyes looked down at the total amount of weight, and then shut tight in obvious frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was her progress so slow?! She needed to get bigger and fast! The skilled engineer had been lifting weights for close to two weeks now, following a rigorous training schedule that would leave even the most dedicated turian drill sergeant sweating. Tali knew the results weren't instantaneous -- she wasn't stupid. However, she couldn't afford to sit by idly while that skank was stealing her future bondmate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason for Tali's anger was simple. Recently, Liara had come back aboard the Normandy after a long vacation, which wasn't that out of the ordinary. It just so happened, though, that the blue-skinned archaeologist might have used her information network to find out Shepard's preferred type of woman; a topic that many had discussed before. There were even entire forums on the extranet about the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turned out, the famous commander John Shepard, hero of the Citadel and nemesis of the Reapers, was a sucker for muscular women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as such, that harpy had used her vacation to work out a bit, gaining some nice muscle definition that made her look like a fitness model. Even Tali had to admit the asari looked nice with those tight abs and defined legs. Really, had Liara done it for herself, she wouldn't be so upset. But Liara's attempt at gaining the commander's favor was so blatant, she was surprised Shepard hadn't noticed yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stupid bosh'tet with her stupid, perfect figure.\" Tali grumbled to herself, pouting behind her mask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could safely say that she loved Shepard. Not like or have a crush or anything like that. No, Tali loved Shepard so much it hurt to see someone else vying for his affection, potentially stealing the handsome human away from her. There was no way in hell she would allow it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she started her own workout schedule. Jacob and Ashley had been kind enough to give her some tips, and the former had gone as far as to recommended good supplements that even a quarian could use. Almost all of her day was dedicated to molding her body into something that her future bondmate couldn't resist. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe results were... not what she was hoping for. Tali had definitely gained some pounds -- all of it muscle mass -- yet it wasn't enough to compete with Liara, who was already receiving a lot more attention from the commander. Hell, today the blue bitch had 'accidentally' brushed her toned butt against Shepard in the mess hall, making him look at it until she left the room. Tali herself had been fuming for hours after that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she often compared herself to Liara as a result. Tali knew when it came to the ass department, she was one of the best of the best; going head-to-head with Miranda, who was considered to be a very beautiful and voluptuous woman. Her hips were also amazing -- or so she'd heard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut now that Liara had decided to buff up, her position was jeopardized by her rival's toned ass. And those muscular legs and defined chest, which made her generous bust stand out more, did not make it any easier for Tali.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to gain muscle faster.\" The environment suit clad quarian said to herself. The gears inside her head were already turning; trying to come up with a way that would get her what she wanted, \"Maybe Mordin could help? He's been asking me to test a new immune-booster, which should help me out a bit. Then again, the last time he asked Joker for help, he gave our pilot nightmares...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left only one solution. Of course, it was a risky option, which explained why she hadn't tried it before. The idea was quite frankly ludicrous to begin with. But she was getting desperate; fast. Tali needed quicker results to surpass Liara. Every single thought she had was consumed with Shepard, pushing her harder to claim him as her own, and show that blue-skinned harpy who was the better woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali left the small gym aboard the Normandy -- nothing more than a makeshift one inside the hangar bay -- and made her way to the engineering deck. There, she climbed down to where Jack had once resided, though that was a thing of the past now. With the war over and no serious threats, most of the team had gone their separate ways, even if they stayed in touch. The ex-convict was too busy teaching biotics than to argue about her place being used as Tali's secret workshop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of equipment was lying around, some more haphazardly than the other. However, the desk at the end of the room was neatly organized. Tali walked over to it with clear purpose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd been looking for a way to get better results through science for a while now. While Tali was by no means as smart as Mordin or possessed sufficient biological knowledge, she was still considered to be an engineering prodigy; among her own people too. And the result of her research was an object that she kept hidden from everyone aboard the ship, making sure she blocked EDI's surveillance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali looked down at the device that was resting in the middle of her workbench, hands reaching out to pick it up. The small machine wasn't that extraordinary; an arc pistol model, designed by admiral Daro'Xen to take down geth, though it could be used to deplete shields as well. Hers was a bit different, however. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gun was a combination of different technologies; geth, cerberus, collector and even reaper -- hence her secrecy. No one in their right mind would even think of using reaper tech, let alone combine it with various other kinds. But Tali was a woman obsessed, and she didn't care as long as it would bring Shepard and her together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo put it simply, the gun was supposed to use the advanced mechanical parts she had acquired to help her gain muscle mass more rapidly. At least, that was the intended purpose. One could never know when playing around with reaper technology. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich was why Tali hesitated to utilize the ray gun. She wasn't sure whether or not it would work. Worst case scenario, she'd either kill herself or something worse. Maybe even turn her into a husk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers tightened their hold on the gun as her eyebrows frowned. There could be no chickening out. A life without being at Shepard's side was a life not worth living. Tali wasn't the kind of woman to give up, and she would not back down from becoming her beloved's dream woman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will become bigger and stronger than ever. Then, I'll get Shepard to love me and break that bitch; Liara!\" The quarian growled, heart ablaze with passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with pure, obsessive love and conviction steeling her mind, Tali aimed the barrel at herself before pulling the trigger.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The sheer amount of energy that was trying to worm its way into the quarian was simply mind-boggling. Electricity sparked all over her body, dancing across her limbs and making it feel as if her nerves were on fire. Pain filled her senses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the gun worked. It worked <i>perfectly</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali fell on all fours as her muscles twitched and spasmed. Despite being sore from earlier, they were getting warmer and warmer; almost to the point they overheated. Her skin was getting sweaty, but then began to stretch out as the muscles underneath expanded. Tali's heart was beating so rapidly she could hear it thunder inside her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer whole body grew thicker, becoming wider with each passing second. Under the tight environmental suit, veins snaked and slithered from her forearms all the way to her elbows, splitting as to spread out. Some decided to pop up on her blossoming abs, while others traveled down her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what paralyzed Tali was a wave of ecstasy mixed with slight pain. The young woman clenched her teeth, eyes wide open behind her mask. Never before had she felt this sudden rush of energy. To be honest, it scared her a bit, but the fear was insignificant next to the pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali gasped as blood was pumped through her arms, overwhelming her with this new sensation. They shook as her muscle fibers were pulled taut before growing. The engineer's muscles shuddered and expanded, biceps rising like bread in the oven. They became larger and rounder. Firmer too. Similarly, definition that hadn't been there before appeared, which was now visible even through her suit. Deep grooves between the bulging muscle mass swallowed the protective material. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali panted heavily as her biceps kept growing; triceps hanging underneath like thick cables, getting bigger in tandem with the biceps, which were now approaching melon size before passing even that. The quarian's forearms packed on some serious beef, as if they gained additional mass with every beat of her heart. They were clearly trying their hardest to catch up with her upper arms for width.Tali convulsed as her shoulders widened considerably. They were pushed sideways thanks to her growing deltoids; each one ripening like a fruit, striations deepening and causing them to truly look like pumpkins -- size and all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuttural grunts escaped her supple lips, brought forth by the sensation of her muscles pumping and throbbing. Tali was vaguely aware of how her suit was getting too tight to be safe, but she was lost in the moment; absorbed by her sudden muscle lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer chest creaked as pounds upon pounds of muscle were piled onto her torso. Obliques jutted out like pianokeys, while her pectorals turned into large slabs of beef; a deep ravine running between the two of them. Tali's pecs were quickly turning into plates of dense armor capable of stopping anything from penetrating. They were wide, striated and most of all jutted outwards. Naturally, the chief engineer's entire upper body became a fortress; from her developing abdominals to her insanely defined obliques. Tali's arms were forced to accommodate space for the latter. Still, the energy that cackled around her frame like electricity was turning her smooth stomach into cobblestone-sized bricks of hard muscle. The suit was stretched thin over the bulging plates of sinewy muscle, all eight of them ripped beyond belief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe protective clothing suffered even more as her back widened by a considerable margin. While Tali's waist remained relatively narrow and attractive, the same could not be said for her backside, which was quickly turning into a maze of muscle fibers and tendons. Finger-thick striations ran across its vast expanse. Connected to her deltoids were a duo of bloated, muscular lats and traps. They were still growing larger, becoming so big that Tali's traps were inching ever so closer to her neck, which was also thickening quite rapidly. By now, her back was at least thrice as wide than before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali instinctively flexed her legs, feeling them swell and absorb the ray gun's energy. Veins branched out over her already thick thighs. They'd been impressive before, but now they were approaching tree trunk sizes, and she doubted they would stop any time soon. The vastus muscles in both her limbs were resembling teardrops, bulging outwards and gaining a staggering amount of definition. Of course, both her quads and hamstrings weren't far behind. With their combined muscle mass, her thighs exceeded the thirty inches mark in their quest for growth. Deep crevices between the muscle groups showcased how insanely striated they truly were. And of course, Tali's calves looked like someone had pumped them up like two balloons. Each calf clenched whenever she flexed her toes, becoming twin balls of hard muscle the size of a cantaloupes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heat inside her chest and nether regions was rising steadily in tandem with the growth. Tali could no longer form any coherent words, relying on throaty whimpers and moans instead. Her barrel-like chest inflated and deflated with each breath she took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali's entire body was already resembling a professional bodybuilder's, yet no one could say that femininity suffered because of it. On the contrary; the quarian's hips became even wider and more sensual, which was made all the more visible by her narrow -- but densely paced with muscle -- waist. And by the ancestors, her butt and breasts were getting huge! Tali was lying on her back, but she could feel her buttocks propping her up higher as they grew. They were turning into twin spheres of firm muscle. The term bubble butt came to mind, though it was debatable whether or not it did her glorious muscular ass any justice. Further above, past her defined abdominals, Tali's meaty pectorals carried a pair of breasts that eclipsed those of a pornstar. Truly, her tits were the size of beachballs with bullet-like nipples puncturing her suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, Tali was faintly aware of her suit's alarms going off inside her helmet as her body finally approached critical mass. The protective suit designed to be incredibly stretchy and accommodating lost the battle against her muscle growth. It tore apart everywhere; her bulging biceps and triceps caused major tears to appear through the simplest of flexes, her thighs were too wide for her pants, and her goddess-worthy chest and feminine attributes tore down the suit's resistance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the environmental suit gone, she was left at the outside world's mercy and its deadly effects on a quarian. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut not her. Tali was too busy savoring the pleasures of growing to read her omni-tool, which had a handy medical program installed that could monitor her vitals. The ray gun's energy had boosted her immune system as well, going as far as to not only grant her the ability to survive in the outside world, but also make her immune to any pathogen in known existence. Tali was now healthier than anyone else. Even a Krogan would not be able to regenerate as fast as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the growth subsided, the energy faded away and so did the overwhelming sensations, prompting Tali to calm down. The massively-muscled quarian raised her hands and grabbed her helmet, before tearing it off. She no longer needed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBesides, she wanted to see her new body with her own eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali felt a rush of excitement as she looked down at herself, using the nearby machinery as crude mirrors to better appreciate her new form. To say that she was big would be an understatement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mix of forbidden and advanced technologies had turned her into a titan; standing at a height of approximately seven feet tall and weighing at least 300 pounds of dense muscle mass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keelah...\" She groaned; voice deeper and huskier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer figure was an extreme hourglass shape. The engineer's upper body was a mountain of muscle, consisting of a wide chest and back alongside shoulders that could fit a grown human with space left to spare. Tali's legs were also huge, leaving no room in between her thighs, which were positively massive and had to be over 40 inches in circumference. Meanwhile, these two parts were connected by a feminine waist, which was riddled with hard, striated muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali was in awe of herself. She put a foot down in front of her, before flexing and curling her toes. As expected, her leg exploded with sinewy muscle. Tali's quads bulged outwards by a good few inches, and her calf turned solid; almost as hard as steel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did the same to one of her arms. While not educated on posing, Tali knew how to do a basic bicep flex. And by the ancestors, what a flex it was. Her bicep rose like bread in the oven, puffy veins spreading out over the striated ball of muscle, and the split on her peak deepened as it swelled. The thickness of her meaty forearm increased as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali gasped as she inspected her arm, watching it grow and then stop at what had to be ultra bodybuilder size. In fact, she had never seen such developed muscles. Her body was more akin to those fantasy artworks that she'd found on Shepard's private terminal, after hacking it to discover more about her beloved's preferences. Tali's muscles writhed beneath her velvety skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat made her curiosity pique was the sudden appearance of a blue glow around her arm. Tali had never heard about any quarian ever possessing biotics, but here she was; a freshly minted biotic. The power soared through her veins, and just from a glimpse she could already tell that her biotic power was like an ocean, similar to her new physical might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali whipped her long, raven black hair over her striated, bulging traps and deltoids. With a confident smirk, she left the workplace behind, ignoring how she'd twisted the metal floor during her transformation and the fact that she was stark naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a commander to find.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even just walking down the hallway was an entirely new experience for the quarian. The halls of the Normandy, which depending on the area of the ship had ranged from normal to rather spacious from Tali's perspective, were now on the smaller side from her increased vantage point and sheer width. Anyone looking to get past her would require notable effort, whether squeezing past those incredibly thick legs or having Tali intentionally turn for them to pass. Even that little thought made Tali smile a bit - no longer was she just a quiet, tiny engineer people could pass by without a second thought. Her size, her natural presence, meant that many things operated on HER whims now. She could get used to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell, even just the <i>way</i> she walked was brand new, and in her mind, a vast improvement. Her thighs were so unbelievably massive that there was no way she could ever walk 'normally' - her quads flexed with each step forward, rolling over the other (and occasionally grazing over her bare mound for added enjoyment) as her feet thumped loudly on the metal floor beneath her. Her hips had to flare out quite widely due to her musclewoman gait, but for her figure it looked more natural. It was simply an extension of her already astounding size, the way she could draw attention with her mere walk, the feminine way her hips swayed showing that this muscle was all woman. She felt amazing. She felt like a QUEEN.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQueen. Now that was a fun thought. The quarians were just starting to settle onto Rannoch with the assistance of the geth, but they were still a small and scattered people. Tali'Zorah was the complete opposite. She hadn't been able to test herself yet, but she could feel just how insanely strong she was, as much as she could feel her heart beating in her chest. On top of this, the biotic surge was still flowing through her, techniques and incredible biotic feats filling her brain. It wasn't just that Tali was a one woman army - it was that she would have been a one woman army with just her physical strength OR her newly minted biotic capabilities. With both at her disposal, it was easy for her to see herself ruling over the quarian people, growing them into the galaxy's greatest empire, ruling over billions of beings... with her one and only king at her side, of course...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali was snapped out of her fantasy as she spotted someone coming around the corner, heading towards her in the hallway... but oh, she couldn't have asked for it to be anyone other than who it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara T'Soni, as was the case most of the time, had her nose buried in a datapad, completely removed from the world around her as she studied whatever academic journal she had scrounged up lately. Liara was wearing the same old uniform she always was... though it was plain to see, at least for Tali, that she had started wearing one that was a single size too small for her - not something dramatically noticeable, but her toned, athletic muscles and pronounced bust were more on display than they would have been otherwise. Just another way Liara thought she was being oh so subtle and clever in trying to steal Shepard's affections away. It made Tali's blood boil just thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Tali's rage subsided to an almost... giddiness now that she had a visual comparison in front of her, now that she could see Liara right in front of her. It almost made her laugh, looking at the asari strolling down the hallway. She thought Liara was STRONG? That was utterly asinine to even consider now. Tali'Zorah's hulking, beastly arms made Liara's arms look like twigs in comparison. Hell, Tali's arms looked like they might be thicker than Liara's TORSO. Tali breathed a sigh of contentment - there was no questioning who the superior woman was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that didn't mean she wasn't going to make sure the point was driven home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than continue walking, Tali simply stopped in her tracks, the thumping of her powerful footsteps fading into a dull drone that lightly echoed throughout the ship's hull. She put her hands on her hips, further widening her frame as her swollen biceps dug into her sides, reveling in the fact that her brilliantly cocky smile was now fully visible to the world, along with the entirety of her gorgeous alien face. She had been waiting for a moment like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara, lost in what she was reading, didn't notice that her pathway was blocked until it was too late. Though her and Tali had been the same height, Tali's growth meant that the asari's head was now at chest level with the quarian. With said head ducked down as she hunched over her datapad, Liara ran right into the underside of Tali's chest, gasping as she stumbled back like she had ran into a wall. Which is what she assumed in the moment, having run into the intense diamond thickness of Tali's abs, but what tipped her off was the boob flesh the top of her head had grazed, strong and durable in its own right but with a very organic softness to it as well. Still, these details didn't add up to anything Liara thought she knew about, so she was completely caught off-guard as she raised her head to see what she had just collided with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith how long the quarian race had basically been imprisoned in their suits, there were surprisingly few people who were fully aware of what one actually looked like outside of their suit, completely naked. But as a scientist and someone with a general wealth of knowledge, Liara T'Soni actually was one of those people. The distinctive three-fingered hands certainly helped. But of course, quarians weren't normally this... big. That was a massive understatement, of course - even krogans did not look quite as mighty and muscular as the figure standing before her. Liara's mind immediately jumped to an intruder, but something about that didn't add up, and as crazy as it sounded in some ways, she couldn't help but think about the only female quarian that was on the ship regularly...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T...Tali?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe familiar chuckle confirmed it for Liara, though it was deeper and more powerful than Liara remembered it being. Then again, things being the same with her would almost be weirder at this point. \"Perceptive as always, Doctor. Though I would prefer if you didn't get in my way while I was going about my business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara's mouth hung wide open, and Tali could see that her eyes were trying very hard to focus on the quarian's face and not her ludicrously busty chest or her massive man-crushing arms, which made the quarian smile a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... you... and... how?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sounding so smart now, are we Ms. T'Soni? It seems you keep getting outclassed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Liara could collect herself enough to react, one of Tali's hands shot out, clasping around the asari's neck. It wasn't near enough to really choke her or snap her neck, though Tali noted with interest how <i>easy</i> that felt, but even a light grip proved too much for Liara. She gasped, bringing her own hands up to try and force Tali off of her, both both arms combined with all their newfound strength barely even registered to Tali.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You put up a valiant effort, I'll give you that. But I'm GALAXIES ahead of you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara began to squirm as Tali hoisted her up, her ham-thick forearm flexing and swelling with deep veins as the asari was lifted straight off the ground, hovering a good foot or two off the ground. Tali smirked - before she probably couldn't lift the asari with both arms, and now doing it with just ONE was as easy as lifting a screwdriver. She felt unstoppable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to hurt you, Liara, despite how much of a slimy <i>bosh'tet</i> you've been. But if you even THINK about getting near my Shepard again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali pivoted on a dime, biceps tensing as she SLAMMED Liara into the metal wall next to her. Tali was very happy with how much control she naturally had over her strength - she succeeded in not breaking the asari, but certainly hitting her hard enough to leave some nasty bruises. The quarian held her victim against the wall, grinning down at her over a chest that could make her a fortune at the Afterlife Club on its own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I might have to reconsider my morals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe asari had already been stunned into silence, but she let out another shocked gasp as she saw Tali's body overtaken by a blue glow. She knew what it was, obviously - biotic energy had a strong signature. But she knew Tali didn't have biotic powers - much less ones that were so powerful they were almost blinding! Before she could think it through further, there was a metallic grinding sound as panels around her were psychically ripped loose, twisted and contorted into thick strips that wrapped around Liara's waist and pulled her even further back against the wall. She groaned as they constricted, so much so that Tali was able to remove her hand and leave the asari hanging a few feet off the ground, the metal strapping her to the wall like a harness. Liara was further floored - biotic blasts and lifting heavy objects was one thing, but such advanced and intricate control of biotics was obscene - how had Tali mastered it so quickly?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm sure it won't come to that. You're well put together, Liara - I'd love to have you plan me and Shepard's honeymoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Tali turned and continued on her way, ignoring Liara's groans of pain and cries for help, just letting her enjoy the view of her titanic ass rippling and bulging with each powerful step she took. The asari surely got the message now... so with no woman to stand in her way, Tali knew true love was right in her grasp.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After her little encounter with Liara,Tali made a beeline for the commander's quarters. She wouldn't allow anyone or anything to stand in her way. Walls would crumble, people would kneel at her feet or be squashed; just because she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut nothing stopped her in her tracks, luckily. The elevator ride went smoothly as well, seeing as the machine was designed to handle any weight, which included the hundreds of pounds of Quarian curves and muscle mass. Of course, that didn't mean the elevator was any faster than it already was. To keep herself occupied, Tali played around with her strength for a bit. Her finger poked the metal wall and immediately created a dent; small but noticeable. Maybe it was a childish idea, but not that anyone could tell Tali off, so she decided to draw the shape of a heart. Tali giggled as the metal was reshaped through the strength in only a single finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDING<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doors opened, revealing the small hallway between Shepard's quarters and the elevator. Tali exited while feeling like an apex predator. There was no doubt in her mind that John would be unable to resist her beauty, strength and sexual appearance. Confidence was something Tali no longer lacked, now possessing it in vast quantities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe palmed the interface of his cabin and practically sauntered inside, hips swaying and hard quads rubbing against each other. Even her massive breasts swayed gently. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long to spot her beloved; a datapad in his hands as he sat in his comfortable couch, drinking from a mug of steaming coffee, his favorite drink during work -- she knew that little detail. Tali's heart almost skipped a beat when she saw him lick his lips, her glowing eyes trailing the appendage, heat pooling between her legs. What she wouldn't give to see him do that while staring at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that could be arranged, no? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali smiled sultrily once she passed his desk, stepping down the small stairs, as her diamond-hard calves bulged and swelled. Shepard noticed. He blinked once he spotted them, and looked away from the datapad, before his eyes widened considerably as he took in her mighty physique. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was absolutely speechless. Tali's smile widened at the sight; shock was written all over his face, and she found some amusement in seeing the fearsome commander Shepard baffled in her presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tali?\" Was the only word he managed to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amazonian Quarian giggled, \"Hello, Shepard. Oh my, did the cat get your tongue? That <i>is </i>the human saying, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... you... how...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never thought the mighty commander could pull off such an expression. How shocking!\" Tali teased, casually flicking her head so her raven-black hair fell down her striated back. The motion caused her thick neck to tense, muscle fibers tightening before loosening up again. She tapped her chin in mock thought, \"What could possibly be the reason? Is it my muscular, defined arms? With biceps as big as cannonballs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe titan of a woman flexed an arm, purple skin creasing as the muscle underneath rose like a mighty mountain, its peak achieving new heights. Naturally, the deep defined lines in between said muscles were highlighted as she maintained the pose. Tali's triceps bulged from underneath, resembling thick cables similar to the ones found in engineering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or is it my long and hard legs? My butt has gotten a bit bigger, you know. I don't mind if you stare~~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali turned around to give her future husband a premium look to what had to be the most perfect booty in the entire galaxy. The Asari thought they had curves? Ha! No one could match a Quarian's ass, and much less Tali's. Her swollen glutes were perfection incarnate; hard and muscular, yet with enough fat to make them even curvier, which gave birth to twin massive spheres of delight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut so were her legs. Long, sensual and packed with dense muscle mass. There was nothing soft about them, save for her velvety skin. Teardrops were what her quadriceps looked like. As if carved out of smooth, purple marble. The strength that these pillars carried had to be tremendous if they could support her wide upper body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard's gaze was so intense, she bit her lower lip in excitement. This was what she wanted; his undivided attention. For far too long did that inferior doctor T'Soni soak it all up -- the selfish bosh'tet. No more. From now, he would only look at <i>her </i>with those piercing blue eyes of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tali, you're huge! How the hell did this happen? And why are you naked?!\" Shepard asked after finding his voice again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I won't bore you with the scientific and engineering parts, but let's just say that I was tired from gaining so little from my workouts, so I crafted a device to help me out.\" She explained, facing the human once more as she placed both hands on her sensual hips. Glowing pale eyes were filled with mirth, \"As for why I'm naked... my body grew too rapidly for my suit to keep up with the transformation -- not that I mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNor did he. Oh, it was cute how her man tried to avert his eyes, but the temptation was too much for him. Tali didn't blame him. In fact, she encouraged it! What better way to be appreciated than have her true love ravish her with that hungry gaze? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes snapped upwards, widening in panic, \"Wait, you're out of your suit. Doesn't that mean you're in danger?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm touched, Shepard. But you don't need to worry. My device didn't just make me powerful; it also improved my immune system. I daresay my body is invulnerable to any diseases.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nData from her omni-tool told her as much anyway. Tali was sure she was pretty much invulnerable to a great many things. If not because of her dense muscles, then surely due to her incredibly powerful biotic might. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, why did you do this?\" The commander's expression reflected his confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali rolled her eyes playfully in response. She came closer to him, almost to point that their skin was touching, and loomed over the human. A shadow was cast over Shepard by her considerable bulk. Yet despite her intimidating figure, Tali smiled gently; the gesture filled with love and adoration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I want to be more than friends, Shepard. The reason as to why I pushed myself to become stronger and bigger is you.\" Tali revealed at last. Funny how all she needed to find the guts to confess her feelings, was becoming the most superior Quarian in known existence, \"Don't ask me how, but I discovered about your preference in women -- which is fine! I mean, I wouldn't have thought you the type to like muscular women, but if that's what it takes to be with you, then I don't mind the change. Do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-no! Tali, I love the new you.\" His response made her smile glow brighter, just like her eyes, \"I never knew you, well, liked me. And then your new body... I'm just overwhelmed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverwhelmed by her beauty and drive, he didn't need to mention. Was she showing an ego that had inflated quite a lot? Yes, but sod it; Tali wasn't lying when she said her strength, beauty and overall appeal was through the roof. The not-so-subtle looks that Shepard gave her only fueled her confidence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tension in the room was palpable. Not in a bad way, though. Tali found herself breathing heavier than earlier, massive chest swelling with each inhale of air, which she relished now that she no longer needed to wear a mask. It also made her gravitate closer to Shepard, their lips so close -- noses almost touching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, it was Tali's turn to lick her supple lips. The amazonian Quarian kept herself stable by bracing a hand against the wall. The thick, defined arm connected to it hung like a cloud of muscle above the commander's head, shrouding half his face in shadows. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where does this leave us, then?\" She asked; her previously shy personality resurfacing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard's lips quirked upwards, \"I think I have an idea you might like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe N7 operative closed the distance between them, soft but calloused lips caressing her delicate ones, and in that instant she experienced pure bliss. Complete quarantine from the outside world had left Tali's body much more sensitive to certain sensations; kissing included. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe practically melted into the kiss, moaning loudly; the rumbling sound in her chest deep and throaty. Tali curled herself against Shepard's smaller body, and the couch was forced to accommodate her gargantuan thighs that pinned her beloved in between. Large quadriceps rubbed against his thighs. Of course, her upper body also got to experience close contact; her bosom was squished tight against his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard's hands could barely link together on her back, seeing as her dense obliques needed room, but luckily her waist was still deliciously small -- though in proportion to the rest of her body. Her spine tingled as she felt his fingers probe the sinews there. If he expected the muscles to give away to the pressure, then he would be sorely disappointed, or pleased in his case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had to separate after a while. Tali's lung capacity had increased at least twofold, allowing her to hold her breath for a longer period of time, but it wasn't the same for her beloved, who needed a break. Still, she already missed the close contact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe human commander and massively muscular Quarian engineer stared into each other's eyes, somehow sharing their feelings without words. Tali found nothing but admiration and lust when she gazed into his, and no doubt he could see the loyalty and love in her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...\" She eventually said, breaking the silence, \"was a good idea.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShepard grinned back at her, \"I knew you would say that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last, they were together. Tali could only curse herself for not becoming a true space amazon sooner. But it was alright now. Even if Tali didn't know what the future would bring, she knew Shepard would be at her side; the man she loved more than anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, he was a true...</span></div></div>",

She didn't usually go there - the human biotic felt more than able to take care of herself, and that included diseases. However, lately she had begun to feel... a bit weaker. Less full of energy. She insisted she was fine, but with the crew's incessant nagging, she finally gave in and went to go see Mordin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, Jack sat around, watching the ship's doctor fiddle around with various chemicals and beakers. Jack wasn't a scientist by any stretch of the imagination, but looking on, she couldn't help but wonder if Mordin didn't know what he was doing half of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, though, Mordin turned around, holding a syringe filled with some strange purple liquid. \"This is it. Elixir will go right into the bloodstream. Give more energy. Slight strength boost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack stretched out a bit. Her various tattoos shifted slightly with her skin. Said tattoos were also very visible; Jack wasn't really known for covering herself up a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me. Put 'er in there, doc.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding slightly, Mordin walked forward, gently grabbing Jack's arm. With intense precision, he stuck the needle into Jack's skin, injecting the whole vial into her bloodstream. It obviously stung a little, but Jack had dealt with far worse pain, so it wasn't much to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe salarian pulled out the needle, immediately going to wipe it off and sterilize it. \"Good. That should be all. Simply rest up. Results should be felt-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordin was interrupted by Jack crying out, as she felt a sudden burst of pain from within her chest. Mordin backed up, slightly stunned. The elixir wasn't supposed to act this fast, much less cause pain! Had he done something wrong? No, that was nearly impossible....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordin could only stand there as Jack felt a swelling feeling inside her...</span></div></div>",

Nothing unusual or even suspicious, the Council was, after all, always looking for better recuits to join the Spectres, why not simply improve the ones they had?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, the story was a cover. The project was, in reality, an experiment backed by mostly Salarian and Asari interests to improve the physicality and even mental capacity of certain operatives. And for the most part, was successful in doing so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy utilising both the Salarian's gene-editing experience and Asari biotics, soldiers who entered the facility always left...better. Smarter, faster, stronger, with better reflexes, every individual got something a little different, the \"treatment\" merely heightened the existing strengths within an individual. Operatives who were snipers before never missed. Those who were undercover agents became more capable in stealth and sabotage. Even grunts grew stronger, faster, better tacticians. In a word, this project created super-soldiers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was this project that Lieutenant Commander Ashley Williams found herself in. The brunette recieved her orders from the council almost immediately after becoming a Spectre. She tried to argue for her place on Shepard's crew again, but they brushed it aside, simply stating, \"Two Spectres on one ship reduces the effectiveness of each. Besides, after your injuries on Mars we want to ensure that you are effective.\" So she shut her mouth and listened to the remainder of the briefing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe the council doesn't trust me, Shepard. They give me Spectre status and they still want to 'ensure I'm effective'. You'd think they figure it out eventually, Humans aren't the worst things in this galaxy,\" Ashley fumed through the intercom to her romantic partner, John Shepard. \"Believe me Ash, I know,\" Shepard replied, trying to think of what to say to calm her down. \"But as much as the council has seemed to be against us, they have a point. You need to be at 100%, especially for the Reapers. Besides, some extra training never hurt, did it?\" He said, hoping it would suffice. Ashley sighed, \"Yea, yea, the Reapers, I know. I don't know how you stay motivated all the time, skipper, but when I'm finished with this training, have a seat on the Normandy ready for me. I dont care if I have to leave the Spectres, I'm not letting you win this war alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey finished their conversation, and Ashley prepared for the journey to the training facility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what she got there was much more than just training. The council had selected her because of her strength. She had been through much with Shepard, and those experiences alone had to have taken a toll on her body and mind. But she resisted, and more importantly, persisted. She pushed through. The council needed that, they needed hard-hitting, hard to kill Spectres that they could rely on, as the Krogan have always been troublesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was their goal for Ash?</span></div></div>",

Her body absorbed all the life energy of anyone she mated with - but for the most part this only served to fuel her incredible biotic powers. Legends spoke of Krogan having an entirely different effect. She wasn't, of course, interested in any run of the mill Krogan - but she also didn't want to draw Sheppard's attention to quickly to her actions by going after Grunt or Urdnot Wrex. But Urdnot Wreav - was a definite option.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found the Krogran Warlord cleaning his weapon after a hunt - a hunt that had acquired him a number of trophies still in various stages of being skinned and mounted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, aren't you a big one.\", she spoke sensuously as she entered the chamber and closed the door. Morinth knew how to move to elicit excitement from any individual - gender and species didn't matter. And exciting Urdnot Wreav would have been an easy feat for any Asari maiden. Her skin tight clothing, her aura of desire, her own excitement about the promise of the legends - all of these alone would have made short work of Wreav, but together had him submitting almost immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't keep his feet and feel backwards - perfect for her to climb up him and begin to passionately kiss him. He returned her ardor at first, but then began to become weak and placid. His actions slowed but her ardor only increased. She could feel it - a tidal wave of energy flowing into her. Every muscle in her body pulsed as she drew the Krogan's tremendous strength into her and she felt them swell and reshape. When Wreav lay an empty husk, Morinth rose to admire herself. She was even more stunning than she was used to - all her muscles had gained tremendous definition and shape. It seemed the legends were true that an Ardat-Yaksi could steal the strength and muscles of a Krogran and reshape them to fit her Asari body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Wreav's muscle reshaped to her feminine body she could probably mask her changes and return to Sheppard's vessel with no one the wiser.

For some inexplicable reason her limbs felt sore, as if she had been straining them to the point of exhaustion all day. It had gotten so bad that she dreaded getting up in the morning. However, the Normandy needed its XO. Miranda wasn't a woman that gave up easily, nor would she allow herself to be bedridden by some ache, so she fulfilled her duties as usual. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former Cerberus operative hissed as she picked up a datapad, feeling a sharp pang of pain in her bicep as she did so. She let out a small sigh. Even as she sat alone in her bedrooms, the dull ache refused to go away and it began to frustrate her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMordin and doctor Chakwas hadn't found anything wrong with her upon checking her up. They had advised her to take it easy for a while. According to them, she had probably just overworked herself. There weren't any signs of illnesses that could be responsible. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda frowned as she placed the device on a neat stack of similar datapads that she had gathered on her desk. Maybe she really did need some rest. After all, she did indeed have a tendency to work too much. But she couldn't help it, considering work was one of her favorite activities. Whereas others found relaxation in things like sports or games, she felt at ease when working, which was a trait she shared with their Quarian engineer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is getting me nowhere.\" Miranda groaned audibly, rubbing her sore wrist. \"Well, Shepard did say he would take over some of the work... Oh, bloody hell. I'll just rest for a while. Maybe that way I'll get rid of this terrible ache, because otherwise I'm going to ask for a blood test. This just isn't normal anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't someone who liked to complain, but the situation was starting to become ridiculous. At this rate she wouldn't be able to go on missions anymore. Not that she didn't like her comfortable office, but some fresh air now and then did wonders for the mind, even if it usually meant getting shot at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda stood up from her seat and stretched her sore limbs. Her tight suit had never before felt so constricting than it did at this exact moment. A loud pop could be heard from her neck as she slightly twisted it, giving some small feeling of relief. She did the same with her arms and almost moaned as the bothersome ache lessened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe buxom member of the Normandy walked over to her bed and almost collapsed on it, only now realizing how exhausted she felt. Miranda didn't even have time to change into something more appropriate as she remained on her back. Her eyelids dropped down as if they were as heavy as stone, her mind slowly falling into a deep slumber. Soft snoring soon echoed throughout the cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Miranda was unaware of the radical change inside her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to anyone, including Miranda herself, their last mission had left its mark on her body. Shepard had recently brought the Normandy to an unknown planet to deal with some upstart mercenaries. Miranda had been part of the squad that had assaulted the merc base, but exposure to the planet's atmosphere had subtly affected her modified DNA. Ever since coming back from the mission, her body had been slowly transforming as her very DNA was altered. Miranda was now the host of a new virus. Not only was it very serious, the effects of the virus were also finally manifesting in Miranda herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe attractive human woman was unaware as her appearance began to change. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda's catsuit began to stretch out as the skin and muscles beneath it expanded. Her long legs packed on a hefty amount of muscle, more fibers and chords being developed by the virus that had grown inside of her body. While her thighs had always been attractive and full, it was nothing compared to how thick they were. Her hamstrings were now strong cables that gave incredible definition to her legs, together with bulging quadriceps as hard as stone. The white fabric that covered her thighs could barely contain the dense muscle mass beneath. Luckily for Miranda and her dignity, the suit she wore was made out of a tight but stretchy material. Miranda's calves inflated to a size as large as grapefruits, but with much more definition. It was a miracle that her boots could contain them. The growth of her legs was supported by a network of veins that mapped them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda let out a small whimper as the growth happened to her upper body as well, though she remained blissfully unaware. Her flat abdomen became more defined wit each deep breath she took. The previously toned abs grew to the size of cobblestones, deep lines running between them alongside small veins. The virus quickly took its hold on her arms. Both limbs inflated as dozens of pounds of muscle were brought into existence, improving her previous musculature. By now her biceps were as big as footballs, if not bigger than that. Their round shape almost caused her sleeves to rip apart. Miranda's forearms had more striations running across them than the average man, but they looked as if someone had sculpted them out of marble. Thick veins fueled them, crisscrossing over the sheer girth of her forearms and all the way up to her pineapple-sized biceps, not leaving her horseshoe-shaped triceps alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe former Cerberus employee's chest grew bigger and bigger, dense pectorals taking up more space of her broadened upper body. Miranda's pecs were big enough to have a deep line running between them. They jutted outwards due to their impressive size. However, her back was equally affected as the muscle tendons within thickened, and were reinforced with more durability and size. By now it was a maze of ripped muscles. They would give her enough strength to remain standing up right, seeing as her already impressive bust expanded. Miranda's assets inflated like balloons due to the virus that changed her very DNA. The catsuit couldn't contain them anymore, opening up above and exposing a fair share of cleavage to the world. The luscious-looking orbs of soft yet firm flesh had an impressive gap between, especially with the armored plates that were her pectorals supporting them. Not only that, but her butt also grew. Miranda's glutes gained mass, the muscle chords within developing to an amazing degree, giving off the impression that two volleyballs had been stuffed in there. The perfect shape of her butt was hypnotizing. No male, and in some cases even female, would be able to resist the temptation of her firm butt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the virus had stopped changing her body, Miranda had grown beyond what could be called an amateur bodybuilder. Her muscles were worthy of the most dedicated bodybuilders that spent their lives molding their own bodies into works of art. However, Miranda seemed to overcome even their standards. Her muscles only increased her overall sex appeal. Her curves were more pronounced than ever, both her breasts and ass now large enough to swoon any man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd not once did she wake up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda was still asleep, her body a mountain of powerful and dense muscles, as he virus was officially done. The modified DNA strain had completed its evolution. However, the transformation that Miranda had undergone had caused it to advance even further. The cabin was already being filled with pheromones, all of them produced by Miranda, that carried the virus. No longer was it imprisoned within the human biotic, but an airborne pathogen that had transcended the barriers of species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn conclusion, Miranda's modified DNA had given birth to a virus that would affect any girl, regardless if she was human or alien. And now it was let free to infect anyone it could find...</span></div></div>",

The raven-haired beauty stood inside her cabin, right in front of her large mirror which she was using to inspect her new self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being confused for a good full minute, Miranda had calmed down to examine her body, trying to find the cause of her transformation. Her omni-tool was already busy scanning her vitals for any anomalies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda hummed as she saw some of the results; a new height of 6'4\" as well as a larger muscle mass, contributing to her musclebound figure. She could say with certainty that she didn't feel any negative effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, it was the complete opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe omni-tool's report stated that her body had improved in every way possible. She was healthier, a better immune system, an increased vitality, much more stamina, etc. The list went on and on. Even her biotics felt stronger than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda looked at the mirror, her gaze washing over her own body. Rippling muscles moved beneath pale skin and skintight material, displaying every curve and definition all over her frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ex-Cerberus operative hummed curiously as she poked at her left arm. The round bicep that stuck out to due to its size wasn't soft at all, but incredibly firm instead, feeling solid to the touch. Miranda flexed it slowly, watching the muscle mass expand before deflating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPING<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her omni-tool; the projected screen was illuminating a thick, vascular forearm as the analysis was completed. Miranda immediately began reading the information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm, it looks like my DNA was altered. Some sort of unknown virus - most likely from the planet we previously visited - infected me while I was planetside, and it forced me to undergo a physical transformation.\" Miranda said to herself as she digested the new intel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bodybuilder-sized woman glanced at her muscles, which were as big as a professional bodybuilder's, if not slightly bigger. Every inch of her body was packed with dense muscle fibers. Her chest was incredibly broad, as was her back, and Miranda was grateful for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as she loved her blessed assets, their increased size would have been hell on her back were it not for the strong muscles that she now had. She would never have back pain again now that she had a tapestry of muscle cords for a backside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda smirked as she looked at herself, \"Well, this wasn't planned, but I can't say I don't like it. This feeling of power is... quite intoxicating, I must say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow she didn't have a single problem with the virus and what it had done to her body. If anything, she felt better than ever, and saw the change as a blessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was an evolution; her human body had ascended, achieving a more superior form that benefited her. Miranda chuckled as she clenched a fist, watching the tendons in her forearm tense tightly and swell. She wasn't lying about the power that she could feel in her muscles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall woman turned around to get a better look of her backside. What she saw did not disappoint; defined muscles could be seen through the tight suit, which had somehow survived her transformation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, except for her chest area, where more than enough cleavage was displayed. She didn't care though, thinking that her body deserved to be looked at in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These seem to be bigger too.\" Miranda smirked as she patted her left buttock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of her ass cheeks were incredibly round and firm, thanks to her evolved glutes. The ex-Cerberus operative took note of how powerful her thighs seemed, and most likely were. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she had to consider what she would do now. No doubt everyone aboard the Normandy would be surprised by her new appearance, but Miranda had no interest in simply standing by; she wanted to be more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda's mind suddenly decided that following Shepard was no longer a good option anymore. After all, why should she listen to an inferior creature like him? All humans - as well as aliens - were inferior to her. They just weren't on her level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven-haired beauty flexed both of her arms, watching them explode in size as the muscles tensed and grew. Thick veins could be seen as they pumped more blood into the hungry muscles. Her triceps flared out, and her biceps brimmed with power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven her biotics acted up; an intense blue glow surrounded her arms, cackling with untapped biotic potential. Miranda just knew that not even an Asari matriarch would ever be as powerful as her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda ended the pose as she walked over to her desk. Each step caused her quads and calves to bulge and ripple beneath the tight suit that clung to every curve of her amazing body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time for her to take over the Normandy. The mere thought of serving alongside inferiors was revolting to her; they should be serving her instead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut perhaps the females could help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda knew that the virus must have affected her mind as well, but she couldn't find it in herself to care. She embraced her new instincts, which told her that she could gain the other women's assistance rather easily, as long as she infected them with the virus before making them submit to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sinister smile formed on her beautiful face. By the time the day was over, every woman on the ship would be a superior amazon; just like her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd under her leadership, they would achieve great things.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Miranda calmly exited her cabin, scanning the mess hall for any noteworthy occupants. Only two male crew members were busy eating something, and the tall raven-haired amazon couldn't help but smile smugly as they gazed at her with wide eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was awe and fear in their eyes; it excited her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer heels clicked on the floor of the deck, each step measured and in control while the muscles in her legs continued to bulge. The inferior humans were powerless in her presence. Miranda could get used to this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her goals took priority, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer first task would be the ground team; they had actual combat experience in contrast to the regular servicewoman aboard the Normandy, and their skill sets would be of better use to her. The others would come later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda figured she should start on the third deck now that she was here. If her memory was correct, then doctor Chakwas and Ashley Williams should be inside the medical bay. The former was usually there all the time, fulfilling her role as the ship's doctor, while the latter had been hurt during a mission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoctor Chakwas had ordered Ashley to remain inside for a few other checkups. As annoying as it was for the Alliance soldier who had decided to serve aboard the Normandy for a while, it proved to be a perfect opportunity for Miranda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo birds with one stone, as they said. And in this case, two soon-to-be amazons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscular woman made her way over the medbay while imagining how the future would play out. In only a few minutes she would already have two enhanced women under her control, and the rest would soon follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached out to the door's interface, palming the green symbol before being given access to the place where they treated their wounded. Sure enough, both of her targets were present.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been around for quite a while, Karin Chakwas was entering her fifties and it showed; the woman's hair was completely grey, and her face showed the weariness of age. Yet despite all of this, the dear doctor was still quite attractive for someone her age, and there was a refined aura to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley Williams was a different story. The brunette was incredibly attractive and had quite the figure. The Alliance soldier had a toned build, but her feminine curves did not suffer because of it. Ashley clearly put effort into her appearance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two women looked at the door to see who had entered, and Miranda was once again confronted with gazes that were filled with awe. Her lips went lifted up as she smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miranda, what has happened to you?\" Chakwas questioned her; the woman's tone conveying pure shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley nodded dumbly from her spot on one of the beds, \"Yeah, what's up with the muscles? I don't mind working out either, but this seems a bit much. Not to mention very sudden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I can assure that it's nothing as mundane as that. What happened to me is a blessing.\" Miranda chuckled as she strode confidently into the medbay. Her victims stared at her gargantuan thighs all the while, \"You see, it appears that a previously unknown virus has forced me to... evolve, so to speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evolve? Miranda, this is serious.\" Chakwas frowned in concern, \"If you have been infected with something like that, then we need to quarantine you before it gets transmitted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe taller and more muscular woman shook her head, \"That will be unnecessary, doctor. In fact, I believe it would be a foolish thing to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, say what now? You can't be serious.\" Ashley disagreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow predictable; Miranda had anticipated resistance, but she couldn't blame them. Perfection was often too much for someone to accept. They simply did not know how this evolution improved her body - nay, her very being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only had her mind being enlightened by the very power of her new existence, but her body had been turned into something more. Her abdominals - each and every one of them as defined as cobblestones - felt like an impenetrable fortress wall, strong enough to take even the hardest blows of a Krogan warrior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet these two would resist her gift? This... perfection?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would show them, and then they'd understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would appear that you need convincing. Rest assured, this will take but a moment.\" Miranda said confidently, taking a step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ex-Cerberus officer headed over to Ashley, who was already tensing up as if she expected an attack. How foolish; did she really think she stood a chance against someone like her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miranda, I'm warning you.\" The brunette told her, \"I don't know what you're planning, but I won't- mph!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cut the woman off by placing her lips against hers, locking them into place. Ashley moved to back away, but Miranda's hands shot out and held her in place, making sure there was no escape. All that the soldier could do was struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the virus was airborne as well, Miranda figured direct contact would be much more effective. She wasn't necessarily into women, but trading saliva with Ashley would most certainly guarantee immediate results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hunch proved to be correct as Ashley's moans of protest took on a different tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miranda, release her!\" Chakwas yelled, a fierce blush on the elderly woman's face, \"I don't know what's gotten into you, but if you don't let Ashley go right now, I'll...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda smirked; she knew why the dear doctor had gone silent. Her supple lips left Ashley's as she backed off, eager to watch the fruits of her labor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what... is... ah!\" The Alliance soldier moaned as she shut her eyes tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuscles began to pile on rapidly on the young woman's frame. Ashley's shirt and pants quickly tightened up around her body as more and more place was consumed by her growing musculature. Each and every part of her became hard and defined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer biceps bulged as they seemed to inflate, like if someone was pumping them full with air, but much more defined. Meanwhile, the muscle cords in Williams' triceps went through a similar process, turning more striated and becoming bigger. More meat was packed to her forearms as they thickened, and veins crawled all over her soft skin, fueling the large muscles underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley almost stumbled as her legs grew larger, becoming as wide as small tree trunks. Both thighs were touching the other by now; no more room was left to spare, seeing as her three quad muscles and hamstrings were on par with the best of bodybuilders. Even her calves were morphed into solid muscle of large proportions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile definitely not as large as Miranda's, her enlarged bossom was fit snugly against her tight shirt, which was too small to conceal everything. Ashley's nipples could be seen poking through the thin material, and her obliques were seemingly melding with her clothing. Her ab-riddled tummy was now exposed to the world, displaying the hard protective muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the forced transformation ended, Ashley stood at six feet with an incredibly muscular and wide body. The brunette took deep breaths of air, trying to regain her senses after being put through such a thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda gave her all the time in the world; the girl would come to her senses, which had been equally changed by the virus, no doubt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is... such power!\" Ashley exclaimed, running her hands over her newly formed muscles. The soldier poked her abs, though the brick-shaped blocks refused to budge at all, \"Damn, this feels amazing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm happy to see that you understand. Surely you also know that I'm stronger, and therefore am in command, yes?\" Miranda spoke up as she placed both hands on her wide hips, puffing up her wide chest and looking down on Williams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing as she was smaller than the raven-haired amazon, Ashley nodded reluctantly, \"Yeah, I guess so... Damn, I really wish I could have been the alpha here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you two talking about?!\" Doctor Chakwas interrupted; the woman had had enough, \"Ashley, you need to come to your senses. I don't know what Miranda just did to you, but we must stop this madness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why would I do that? Miranda opened my eyes, doc. This is a gift!\" Ashley grinned, flexing an arm and watching in satisfaction as a large bicep popped up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda chuckled condescendingly, \"Our dear doctor requires more persuasion. Ashley, hold her down for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChakwas was too stunned to move away in time, and the now amazon soldier proved to be very quick for someone her size; the doctor was caught. She struggled against Ashley's strong grip, but was unable to tug her arms away from the brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go! Don't make me pull rank, Williams!\" Chakwas yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she got in return was a grin, \"This goes beyond duty, doc. I've found something new to dedicate myself to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And so will you, very soon.\" Miranda laughed as she advanced like a predator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no way of escaping, Chakwas was helpless as Miranda forcefully kissed her, transmitting the virus and infecting the ship's medical officer. Within less than a second the elderly woman turned from a frail doctor into a fellow amazon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer labcoat was snug in all the right places as the virus evolved her. Ripped muscle mass now adorned her still relatively average tall body. Chakwas took a few seconds to adjust before smiling confidently; her mind was now that of an amazon's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't fathom why I wanted to prevent this...\" Doctor Chakwas chuckled, rubbing her enlarged legs as she kneaded the solid muscle mass underneath her touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to hear that, doc!\" Ashley joined as she struck a crab pose that showed off her upper body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is not the end, though.\" Miranda declared, gaining their attention, \"Soon, all women aboard the Normandy will be like us. Then we'll show those inferiors who run this galaxy!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So we know what you want to accomplish, but how are we going to get around doing it?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley crossed her beefy arms over her wide torso, pressing her thick forearms against her large bossom, confining the two large orbs in a prison of hard muscle. It was a valid question; one that Miranda was all too willing to answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's quite simple.\" Miranda smiled as she paced inside the medbay, \"I will personally infect the other women aboard the Normandy. Once they've been evolved, we'll assume command of this vessel. The males can serve us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And if they resist?\" Chakwas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA devious grin took its place on Miranda's face, \"Then they'll be crushed like the inferior ants that they are.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can get behind that.\" Ashley chuckled, patting one of her augmented biceps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood; that meant that her theory was correct. Anyone infected by the virus would accept her views, and Miranda's goal of spreading the gift would be a success. Now she just needed to know a few more facts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, doctor, what else can you tell me about the virus?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having been turned, Chakwas had quickly agreed to examining a few samples of the virus that had changed them. The elderly woman -- who had accidentally crushed one of her tools due to her new strength earlier on -- was ready to tell them the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you said, the virus seems to have changed our very DNA. It forced our bodies to evolve on a physical level, but also affected us mentally; nothing harmful, of course.\" Chakwas explained. She gestured towards a screen, \"My scanner has recorded everything that we need to know about it. If given time, I could create a more enhanced version or even a device that would make it easier to spread the virus. Once infected, it is impossible to cure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda nodded approvingly. This was very useful information, which she made sure to store away. Even her mind felt clearer as she processed all factors into her plan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving an easier way to spread the virus would also be a good thing. While Williams and Chakwas' transformations had been complete successes, the need to kiss them for it to work smoothly was somewhat troublesome.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but what about our strength? I'd like to hear more about the good parts.\" Ashley grinned excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor answered, \"Since we have been improved in all possible ways, our bodies are much more capable than the average human. I believe our strength is now on a meta-human's level. Why, I'm fairly sure that dear Miranda here could lift more than a ton, as can both you and I, Williams.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMhm, it certainly felt that way. Miranda looked down at her incredibly muscular physique, and once more concentrated on the feeling of raw power that washed over her. It felt amazing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as she stood there, Miranda had the urge to use her newfound might. The raven-haired woman walked over to one of the beds, regarded the furnishing and then placed both hands on the edges. A small grunt escaped her as she lifted the whole thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer muscles tensed and flexed, and Miranda was ecstatic as a feeling of euphoria welled up inside. There was hardly any strain on her superhuman muscles. The bed didn't even feel that heavy to her, which made her test even more amusing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda switched to one arm, holding the weight on a single hand. Her triceps flared out, while her biceps throbbed with raw power. She watched in satisfaction as her veins pulsed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your theory is correct, doctor. My strength has increased phenomenally.\"  The amazon reported, putting the bed down again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley whistled, \"Nice show. Makes me want to do something similar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No destroying my medbay. I need that equipment.\" Chakwas stated sternly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda silently regarded herself, inspecting her body for any changes. Her eyes narrowed as she flexed her left leg, causing it to expand as it exploded with meaty muscle mass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as she thought; her muscles had grown again. Nothing drastically like the initial transformation, but it did prove that there was still untapped potential left for her to achieve. Miranda smiled a smug grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley was busy doing a similar process. The brunette would flex individual muscles, caressing them as they grew bigger, clearly enamored with her mighty physique. She was easily taller than six feet, and the width of her lower and upper body made an impressive sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose we'll have to increase our numbers for now.\" Chakwas commented as she analyzed more readings of her scanner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, doctor?\" The three amazons turned to look at the door, which closed only a moment later. Standing in front of it was a certain Asari shadow broker/archaeologist; Liara T'Soni. The blue-skinned 'female' was seemingly focused on a datapad in her hands, \"I was wondering if you could help me with this equation. It's been taking hours for me and... and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe relatively young Asari by her race's standards was left speechless upon looking up, settling her gaze on the evolved humans inside the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's it going, Blue?\" Ashley grinned, purposely widening her stance to show off her broad torso and back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ashley? Miranda? Doctor Chakwas?\" Liara blinked as she almost dropped her datapad, \"What has happened to you three?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Evolution, miss T'Soni. Being an archaeologist, I'm sure you'll appreciate being part of this turn in history.\" Miranda said with a sinister smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-haired women then moved forward, closing in on her next prey. She moved with pure confidence, knowing just how powerful and unstoppable she truly was. Her muscles bulged in anticipation of what was to come. Her thighs swelling and pushing against the tight fabric of her suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what is going on here, but I won't let you do whatever it is you're planning on!\" Liara declared, glowing as her biotics took form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Asari shadow broker hurled a wave of biotic energy at Miranda, but the latter simply shrugged it off. A sinister smile appeared on her face; even the biotics of an Asari -- which were renowned for their strength -- couldn't harm her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go on, give it another try.\" Miranda chuckled, \"You'll never beat these muscles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara responded by utilizing her biotics again. The relatively young Asari poured all of her energy into another shockwave, before sending it towards Miranda. However, the result was the same; the amazon simply placed her hands on her wide hips, allowing the blue tidal wave of biotic energy to slam into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe evolved woman's abdominals twitched as they took a heavy hit, yet remained impervious. Miranda's heels were dug into the floor as she remained standing. Her powerful legs flexed and tensed, but she was as still as a statue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara was visibly shocked, \"H-h-how? That was my strongest attack...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your strength is insignificant compared to mine. But no worries,\" Miranda whispered softly as she pinned the blue-skinned alien against the wall, \"You will soon join us and understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that being said, she sealed the distance between them with a searing kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe transformation was immediate; Liara's muscles began expanding rapidly, which was probably a result from allowing the virus to improve. That meant turning other women would be much more effective now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara's arms inflated quickly as each individual muscle group grew. They went from a slender shape to a new veiny, pumped and solid one. Biceps the size of fruits took form, while veins crawled all over meaty forearms and striated deltoids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe researcher's outfit that consisted out of an armored labcoat began to tear apart as more blue flesh was revealed, covering strong muscles. Her ballooning thighs created multiple tears in her pants, showing incredibly defined quadriceps and hamstrings, swallowing up the space between her legs so that they touched. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wide back made out of cables of steel was another step. Liara's backside quickly became wide enough to carry two people on it, while also having more than enough strength to carry them around for hours. Deep lines ran between the striated muscles. Wide and thick slabs of pectoral muscle held up expanded breasts; each one was almost as big as Miranda's. Her traps rose like mighty wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda smirked as she let a hand drift over her captive's belly, feeling brick-like shapes appear under her touch. The Asari's abs grew to become a phenomenal eight-pack, with tiny veins decorating them. Liara moaned into the kiss as her glutes inflated, giving her a blue bubble butt that spilled out of her clothing just like her breasts did. Her decency was protected by only a small amount of shredded material as her muscular body proved to be too much for her labcoat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two amazons separated as soon as the growth was over. Liara immediately inspected her new body, hands caressing every crevice of her big muscles. She then smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm, I do understand now. Thank you, Miranda.\" Liara spoke gratefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raven-haired beauty giggled, \"You're welcome. Let's get you informed on the plan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The brunette shrugged her massive striated shoulders, \"Sounds easy enough. When do we start?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now; the element of surprise is ours at the moment, but it won't be long before someone notices. Find your targets and infect them with the virus.\" Miranda ordered authoritatively, both hands on her wide hips, only partially obscuring her large glutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ex-Cerberus loyalist gave her minions a stern gaze. With the virus having altered the women's minds, they accepted her leadership; she was the strongest and biggest after all. A true Alpha. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Shepard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMiranda smirked cruelly, \"He's nothing but an inferior like all the others. When the female crew has been completely turned, I will personally take care if him. Right now, he's cooped up in his cabin together with our chief engineer, so we have plenty of time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wouldn't it be fun to have him watch as we turn Tali? I can just imagine his face; the sheer despair as his girlfriend ascends, while he remains insignificant.\" Liara chuckled heartily. Only an hour ago the blue-skinned archaeologist would have found such talk to be horrifying, but now that she had seen the light, she felt nothing for inferior males like Shepard, \"The picture would make for a great background on my datapad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, girl. That sounds great!\" Ashley grinned widely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I shall remain here, and work on my research. There is still so much potential that we can unlock.\" Chakwas spoke up from her spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elderly amazon was seated behind her terminal, though her new size proved to be a strain for her chair. It creaked whenever she shifted her massive thighs. Hell, even her firm butt seemed to be too wide for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Keep me updated.\" Miranda nodded approvingly, before turning to her muscular underlings. The smile on her face was nothing short of predatory, \"Now then, shall we begin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen whistled a tune to himself as he checked the Normandy's power couplings. His shift had started a while ago, and everything was going smoothly. He'd taken a longer break since he thought he deserved it now and then. Besides, all it did was maybe give his partner a headache.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of which, Ken wondered where Gabby was. It wasn't like her to be this late. Everyone -- including Ken himself -- knew that the female engineer was much more responsible than him, so her tardiness confused the hell out of him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHell, he wouldn't even mind one of Jack's angry shouts about now. At this point, anything would entertain him. Ken jumped from one screen to another, analyzing the results of a scan of the drive core. It was mundane work, which was the least fun in his opinion, and the lack of assistance of his partner and chief engineer made sure he couldn't weasel his way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence was shattered all of a sudden, however, when the door to engineering opened up. Ken didn't turn around though, being too focused on his work. Oh, he would take the excuse to take another break, but after he was done looking at the scan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, that wouldn't stop him from making small talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gabby, if I was your mother, I'd be giving you a lecture about being on time. Here I was, wondering where you've been and being worried, while you were probably taking your sweet time getting here. You're lucky Tali isn't here to berate you.\" The Scottish engineer jested, not looking up from his terminal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better watch your mouth from now on, Ken. Someone might forcefully silence you -- me specifically, if you don't show respect.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen blinked dumbly, trying to process what he just heard. That voice definitely belonged to Gabby, but the words and tone she used... that was new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" He frowned, looking over his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes widened as he saw a mountain of female muscle standing behind him. Gabby scowled down at him, being a few inches taller than him, which was already enough to make him pause.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman shared Gabby's face, but there was a major difference here; her muscles!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen gawked as his eyes gazed at her immense musculature. Her uniform clung to her bodybuilder physique, wrapping itself around muscles that rippled and twitched. Massive biceps poked through her short sleeves, and were connected to sizable deltoids, giving her a set of very wide shoulders.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the way they led up that thick neck... Ken had never seen such defined neck muscles before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe thought he was dreaming. Surely Gabby -- sweet and certainly not massive Gabby -- couldn't just grow such muscles out of nowhere. Right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, reality spat in his face at that moment, because Ken was forced to look up at the much more intimidating Gabby. While not small himself, he certainly felt that way compared to his fellow engineer's well-muscled physique. After all, he didn't have thighs the size of watermelons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oi, Gabby... Did I drink from my stash of whisky again? I could have sworn you were smaller the last time I saw ya.\" He mumbled disbelievingly, staring at her sturdy chest -- plus its sizable 'assets'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGabby frowned, \"You're not drunk, Ken. As for me, I have simply evolved to a better form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...Right, because that made sense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe really didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph, as expected of a dimwitted inferior like you. Even now you're slow to grasp the situation.\" Gabby shook her head in distaste. The bulky woman then clenched her fists and tensed her muscles, causing them to twitch under her uniform and appear wider than she already was, \"Now listen carefully. From now on, there will be some changes down here in engineering. You'll do whatever I say, with no questions asked. Am I understood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lass, I don't know who is drunk here -- me, you or both -- but I'm not going to take a knee and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence!\" Gabby sneered angrily as she took a step forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA meaty forearm suddenly entered his vision as Ken found himself being hoisted up; fingers digging painfully into his throat. His feet dangled over the floor as Gabby effortlessly picked him up. Her thick, muscular forearm was all that he could hold on to, his own fingers failing to move the solid muscles of her arm, as he gasped for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack!\" No words managed to leave his mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you see this? You should know that I could do much worse.\" Gabby scowled, placing her remaining hand on her hip. The way she stood there made it seem as if he weighed nothing to her, \"Hell, I can probably snap one of your bones with just two fingers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tightened her hold on him, cutting of his supply of oxygen. The tendons in her muscular arm constricted as she applied more strength. Ken could feel his consciousness fading away, but Gabby prevented that from happening, loosening grip after a while. She then dropped him unceremoniously on the floor like a bag of potatoes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was quite unexpected. Ken looked up at his colleague with a healthy dose of fear. His eyes trailed up her bulky legs, passing by her defined abdomen and finally all the way up to her cold eyes. She was looking at him like one might with an insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind if I join in on the fun?\" Came a very familiar voice from the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen almost fainted as Jack walked inside, possessing a similar physique as Gabby did, but slightly more bulky. In addition, the bald woman's biotics would flare up from time to time, appearing like blue electricity that sparked around her very muscular body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery inch of her was ripped; vast amounts of muscle mass was stacked onto the ex-convict, covered by her tattoos. Her striated upper body was plain to see, seeing as she only wore straps over her breasts, which had grown a few cup sizes bigger; her nipples and areola poked through the thin confinement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThick thighs bulged with each step, and Ken watched her pilehammer-like arms twitch at every movement. Even her pectorals were like two plates of armor, similar to how her bare eight-pack was a wall of muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack grinned like a maniac as she carried someone inside, holding the poor fellow by the head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe recognized her victim as one of the male crew members; Daniels. The guy hung limp in her grasp, unmoving as she dragged him along. Ken could feel the blood in his veins turn to ice as he noticed the state that Jack's captive was in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you had a lot of fun already.\" Gabby remarked dryly, glancing at the limp body, \"You do know that we're supposed to keep them alive, right? Well, most of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJack waved her concern away, \"Bah, leave it be. Besides, just wait until I put cheerleader in her place. Then I'll be the leader.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides,\" The powerful biotic smiled a bloodthirsty smile as she held up Daniels, \"I feel like killing worthless ants!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen was silent as Jack grabbed the crew member's head, placing both of her palms against him. Daniels looked up at her with scared eyes, which only excited her even more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she began applying pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscles in her arms flexed heavily, tendons tightening and veins pulsing, as she slowly crushed the man. He began screaming in pain, but no one was coming to his rescue. His eyes bulged, and blood began to seep out of his nose; Jack was killing him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud roar, the psychotic biotic gave one final push before literally crushing the man's skull. Blood flew everywhere, and some of it landed on Jack's pumped muscles, coating them in red liquid. The girl began laughing as she dropped the corpse to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKen gulped fearfully; he didn't know what was happening, but it scared the shit out of him! <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Liara watched in amusement as the two female crew members in front of her groaned and moaned, voicing the sensation that they felt as the virus altered their very DNA. These two were just a few out of a substantial amount of women that she had already changed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClothes were stretched and torn as ripped muscle broke through. Biceps swelled larger and larger, while the rest of the women's bodies was also enhanced. Thick teardrop-shaped muscles tore through pants, allowing naked skin to taste fresh air, and enlarged muscles to be revealed. Skin stretched out as their traps flared out like muscular wings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a sight that never gets old.\" The Asari chuckled, standing proudly over the two infected crew members; her own muscular body like an unmovable mountain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin seconds the women became fellow amazons, and they inspected their improved bodies with excited fervor. Their outfits only covered their chests and private parts anymore, which meant that shredded muscles poked through any available gap. What was left clung tightly to vascular physiques, as well as firm buttocks and massive breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were wide smiles on the girls' faces as they felt up their muscles, caressing the bulges and muscle mass that now made up their amazing musculatures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's enough admiring for now.\" Liara interjected, gaining their attention. The Asari still stood a few inches taller and was more muscular than them, which helped in pulling rank, \"Find others and spread the virus. We should be in control of the third deck by now, but I don't want any surprises. Our esteemed lady Alpha doesn't want screw-ups of any kind. Understood?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, ma'am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth newly enhanced amazons walked out of the crew quarters, leaving behind their blue-skinned superior. Speaking of blue-skinned above-bodybuilder-sized...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Having fun too, Samara?\" Liara said dryly, gazing at her fellow Asari's broad striated back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, even their resident Justicar was infected by the virus. The warrior's outfit had remained intact, but it was stretched thin over her titanic muscles. Even now one could clearly see the pencil-thick veins that ran across her arms, feeding nutrients to her hard biceps and wide forearms. The front of her outfit -- which already showed a healthy amount of cleavage -- now barely covered her big bossom; dark blue areola poke through. That also meant that her cobblestone-like abs were on display. Samara stood on massively muscular legs, and it almost looked as if she had discovered new muscle groups for her kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite so.\" The much older Asari responded in kind, staring sternly at the cowering male crew member at her feet. The man was busy fiddling with a barbell weight, which looked more like a futuristic kind of equipment than the traditional sort, \"Are you almost done, insect? My muscles need to be tested.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-well, ah... It s-should be done.\" He shivered as she narrowed her eyes at him, \"I mean, yes, mistress!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Then get out of the way, or I will crush you like the bug that you are.\" Samara ordered coldly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crew member quickly dashed off, hiding against the wall and sweating as the imposing form of the alien amazon took a step forward. He looked so frail next to her titan-like appearance, and Samara was all too keen to remind him of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara inspected the barbell; a special design created by a tech company, using mass effect fields to create a device that could change its weight by using said fields to manipulate its mass. For example, one could set it to fifty pounds or so, but increase the weight to double the amount by simply adjusting the mass effect fields. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Normandy had one of these devices, seeing as many crew members wanted to stay in shape; especially the soldiers. Samara had never seen much use for them. Combat and exercise, as well as living a healthy life, already did wonders for her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she was no longer a weaker specimen. Now she was a true amazon; evolved beyond her feeble genetics, and a warrior among her fellow amazons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us see just how much strength I now possess.\" Samara said as she bend over, hamstrings tightening as if they were cables made out of the most dense steel. Her pale blue eyes scanned the barbell, before addressing the inferior in the room, \"You have increased the weight to 300 lbs, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the man could do was manage a shaky nod. Of course, he had every right to be afraid of incurring her wrath. He was so small and insignificant compared to her ascended body and mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us experiment, then. Oh, how I've missed the scientific aspects of my work!\" Liara smiled from the sidelines. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara didn't respond to the archaeologist/doctor/information broker's excitement. She had been chosen as a test subject to test their newfound strength, after her transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it was now, Samara was easily one of the biggest women aboard the Normandy. Miranda wanted a detailed report on each woman once they were infected by the virus, and then cataloged by doctor Chakwas and EDI. The latter had been turned to their cause; not because of the virus, but rather some adjustments to her core processor aboard the ship. After all, the AI was a security risk unless properly turned into an asset. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ranks would be given at a later date. There was still untapped potential among some, which had to be allowed proper development before they could assign the ranks. Samara felt very confident about hers; she was roughly around the same size as Miranda -- who was the biggest and Alpha -- but fell only short by a small margin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiara for example was still incredibly big, but smaller than them. Compared to the crew members that performed mundane duties aboard the ship, however, the fellow Asari was still quite a few leagues above them. Her muscles were much bigger and more defined, plus Liara was also taller. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime would tell who would be among the strongest and weakest. But at this moment, Samara was interested in finding out just how strong she truly was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us begin.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara grabbed the bar with an iron grip that could not be broken, and her thick forearms tensed in response. The Asari Justicar then proceeded to raise the barbell, arm muscles swelling and veins pulsing as she lifted the 300 lbs weight, curling it so that the bar reached her chest. Metal soon met firm flesh as the weight touched her breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barbell fell with a loud thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This weight is too light! Increase it, insect.\" Samara glared in annoyance, placing her hands on her wide hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yes, mistress!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike a man desperate to stay alive, the crew member rushed forward and adjusted the weight again, increasing it to an astounding amount of 500 lbs. This was much more difficult, and impossible for any Asari to lift without using their biotics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSamara did the same exercise again, curling the weight to her chest. This time, her biceps swelled even larger as they were pushed further. However, it still left her with an unsatisfying feeling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More.\" Was all she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore tests came and went, until the barbell's mass effect fields were pushed to the brim; now making it weigh a mind-numbing 2000 pounds. This was the weight of a small skycar. A predatory yet calm smile graced Samara's supple lips while eyeing the barbell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was deadly silent save for the quiet gasps that escaped Samara as she raised the bar. Her arms bulged and twitched, muscles tensing and tightening. Her whole body shook with effort and anticipation. The veins were more prominent than ever, and Samara's grip left dents in the bar of the equipment, giving away under her immense strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a victorious yell that bellowed from her powerful lungs -- which were hidden inside a wide and extremely muscular torso -- she went further this time, and lifted the 2000 lbs weight over her head. Striated deltoids pushed outwards, triceps twitched as tendons expanded, and her biceps passed the 26 inch mark with ease. Even her chest broadened out, forcing her massive mammaries into the open as they bounced freely on several inches of thick pectoral meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder Asari let out a satisfied grunt. All of the heavy weight came crashing down on the floor as she released the barbell, leaving its mark on the metal floor. Samara's upper body was pumped; muscles bulged and veins rose to the surface, displaying a muscularity that was unheard of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this power trapped in a blue-skinned body of muscular perfection. Samara smirked pridefully at her sensual body, which didn't lack any curves at all -- her wide hips and huge breasts saw to that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raw power was intoxicating, yet she knew that this was hardly the limit! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in the corner of the room, a young Asari ended the recording of the demonstration. Liara smiled as she filed away this particularly exciting new knowledge.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jacob Taylor was a man who had seen a lot in his life. He'd served in the Alliance, fighting the good fight for humanity and being sent across the galaxy for various assignments. After that, he'd worked for Cerberus and seen a man come back from the dead. Afterwards, he'd helped that same man destroy the Collectors; a very dangerous enemy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSafe to say that Jacob had encountered many strange things during those periods of time. Hell, he still had trouble believing quite a lot of them. Yet it seemed that serving aboard the Normandy practically guaranteed that he would be seeing much more bizarre stuff. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Wrex say again? That the Normandy had become some kind of freak circus?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, Jacob could understand that sentiment. But none of the things that he'd seen before could stand up to what the ex-soldier was looking at now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, this is too easy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob's heart thundered loudly inside his chest, hands clammy and sweat dripping down the backside of his neck. He was hidden in the entrance to the armory, watching the event in the CIC unfold before his very eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly Chambers -- sweet and caring Kelly -- laughed loudly, \"I can't believe you two are so weak!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two males that acted as her opponents yelled their disapproval and disbelief, but they could hardly stand up against the yeoman. Then again, Jacob doubted he could do anything else if he was in their place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause that Kelly was definitely not the one he knew! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob's breathing went up a notch as he tried to remain concealed. How had things gone so bad so quickly?  One moment he had been tending to the armory, cleaning weapons and making sure that the gear was taken care of; a task he enjoyed doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet within a small time frame that still baffled him, the CIC had turned into a madhouse! Whereas normally the crew would be calmly doing their jobs, there was now some kind of freak show going on, with all of the female personnel turning into bodybuilders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't know how it started; only that at one point, Ashley had arrived according to the voice Jacob had heard earlier on, as she exited the elevator while talking to Miranda about something over the comms, and the madness had begun shortly after. Was the female soldier responsible for this? It was another question that Jacob didn't have an answer for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! Too... strong!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly chuckled heartily, \"That's right! I'm way too strong for you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this cultivated into a display of female bodybuilders, who had once been friends, but were now actively dominating the male crew. The ensigns at their stations were no longer checking the Normandy's systems. Instead, they were too busy torturing their colleagues of the opposite sex as they squeezed the desperate men between legs as big as tree trunks. Normally the CIC was bustling with activity, but the activities that were happening now were of a whole different sort; women breaking bones with their bare hands, as sinews flexed and contracted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob peeked around the corner, watching the scene unfold like some kind of nightmare. The women were visibly overpowering the men with their large muscles. The sheer strength that they possessed had to be tremendous if they could do that to every male in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt bile rise up his throat as he spotted the mangled remains of one of the crew members. The poor fellow's arms were bend in unnatural ways, and his legs looked as if someone had crushed them into dust. To make it even worse, blood was seeping out of the man's crushed skull. The culprit was standing next to the battered corpse, wiping off the red liquid that coated her bulky thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd last but not least, there was Kelly Chambers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was easily the biggest of them all; standing at what had to be at least six and a half feet, she had more muscle packed onto her tall frame than any other girl he could see. Her military outfit was stretched thin over her upper body, though the sleeves had long given up and allowed her muscular arms to breathe. Her pec-supported bust had torn the fabric apart in the middle, which created a small hole that acted as a window for her cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tight white pants that normally looked just right on her previously slender legs were torn in multiple places due to how wide her legs had become. Vascular beef had ripped the seams apart, and Kelly's bulky quadriceps were probably as hard as they looked; not to mention incredibly defined. Honestly, Jacob wondered if her thighs were as big as his waist. Her calves were certainly bigger than his fists, that much he knew. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly's biceps were also on a complete other level. So big and so defined, it didn't surprise him anymore that the striations spread to her biceps itself; a line etched in each peak of the twin globes of muscle mass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of said football-sized biceps was currently threatening to bash in someone's skull as Kelly had a male crew member caught in a headlock. The second man was desperately trying to push her boot off of him, seeing as her foot was placed on his chest as he lied on the ground. Fingers clawed at a meaty calf, yet his strength was not enough to move the pillar that was Kelly's leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"K-Kelly -- ack --- please!\" The man under her foot gasped; his chest was being caved in slowly, and his face was turning red from the slowly diminishing supply of air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm? What was that, Connors?\" Kelly hummed teasingly as she pretended not to hear him. Her emerald eyes were full of mirth as she inflicted pain on her colleagues, \"I couldn't quite hear you over my muscles flexing~~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer other captive moaned painfully, \"Why... doing this?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? That's a good question for such an inferior like you, Doyle. I suppose I just feel like it. You see, I've spent so much time being cooped up in here behind my terminal, wondering what it would be like to be out there in the field. But obviously I was never considered capable of such dangerous work. Oh, goodness no; someone like me would hardly be considered fighting material.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly tightened her grip on Doyle as she continued talking. Her bicep protruded outwards, causing him to cry out in pain as the dense muscle mass closed in, thick veins throbbing all over her skin. Lumps of a tricep horseshoe extended from the other side. Clearly the redhead was causing him major agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet she kept on talking as if she was explaining the weather, \"But now? I think it's about time I show the world the new Kelly Chambers; strong, tall and sexy! And what better way to prove that than crushing some inferior males? Take a good look, Connors. Our dear friend Doyle will experience my amazing strength firsthand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly her arm convulsed; tendons tightened and squirmed beneath her flawless skin, and Kelly began to put more pressure on her captive. The striations of her deltoid doubled as she did so. Connors was suddenly unable to speak anymore due to the headlock, which was now getting more painful by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKelly was slow and meticulous in her torment. Veins the size of pencils squirmed over her hungry muscles, as she squeezed harder and harder. By now, Connors' face was turning an unhealthy purple, lacking the necessary oxygen to keep him functioning properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it got even worse. Jacob's eyes widened as blood began to pour out of Connors' nose, and muffled screams tried to escape the man's mouth. A massive bicep that had to be at least 24 or so inches was literally crushing his skull! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too much for the man to handle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConnors' skull finally caved in, bones breaking and skin tearing as Kelly's forearm -- which was as thick as Jacob's upper arm -- and her mountain of a bicep pulverized his head. It popped like a ripe fruit! Vast amounts of blood and gore dropped down on the floor and Doyle, who was speechless after seeing Kelly use her huge muscles and insane strength to kill a man like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tada! Impressive, no?\" Kelly grinned widely. There was a maniacal glint to her eyes, which only intensified with a hunger as her gaze drifted to the helpless and terrified man under her boot, \"Now then, shall we play a bit more?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob almost vomited as he heard Doyle's screams of agony. He backed away into the armory, wishing he could simply forget what he had just seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, his heart skipped a beat when he bumped into something hard, yet also something very squishy and firm at the same time. The ex-alliance soldier turned around only to experience pure despair at what he saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it isn't little Jacob.\" Ashley Williams smiled cruelly as she looked down at him. The titan of a woman was even bigger than the others, standing at what had to be almost seven feet with what looked like at least 300 pounds of dense muscle on her curvaceous figure, \"Spying on Kelly like that? For shame. I suppose it's only fair if I punish you, no?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacob whimpered miserably.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In this case, the events could be traced by Aria back to a single individual - Sheppard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, he had arrived on her station and aided Mordin Solus in curing a plague released by the Collectors - a plague to attacked the DNA of all non-human, and non-Vorcha exposed. This included one very interesting Asari that had come aboard Aria's station. The plague would have killed her were it not for Solus's cure - and instead it remained in her blood - dormant and mutated by both the cure and the unusual physiology of the Asari herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSheppard later returned to Omega to find that very Asari - an Ardat-Yakshi named Morinth - and in the end, he killed her with the help of her mother Samara. Their ambush of Morinth meant that the Asari had been forced to go straight from the height of her seduction to combat - flooding her body with a very unusual mix of Asari hormones and enzymes - all of them mutated by her Ardat-Yakshi nature. These interacted with the dead and dormant virus mutating it further - bringing it to life but thoroughly changed. It had absorbed the nature of an Ardat-Yakshi into itself thanks to the particular genetic engineering of the collectors and the experimental cure provided by the Salarian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the next person to come into direct contact with that body...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAria had the corpse brought to her - no one had touched it or examined it. She wanted to look at this Ardat-Yaksi - in all her life she hadn't seen one that she was certain of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen her skin brushed the skin of Morinth, the virus - no longer able to travel airborne after it's mutation, transferred into her body. It couldn't long survive in a host without the strange chemical concoction that had given it new life, but, as such things are want to do - it attempted to make it's host compatible in the brief time it lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her examination of Morinth was complete, Aria had the corpse burned, vaporized and ejected into space - just to ensure no contamination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin 24 hours the last traces of the virus in her own system were destroyed - but they had transformed Aria - into something akin to an Ardat-Yakshi. Her body would drain anyone she engaged in amorous activity with - of not just their life energy, but thanks to the virus, of everything the virus was designed to destroy - muscular strength, bone density, internal organ resilience.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">The basic outline of this Interactive is that the females from the Mass Effect game series all bulk up into super massive amazons. Other than that, there are only a few rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRULES:<br>\r\n- As the title implies, only females may grow.<br>\r\n- The only females I'll allow are women available as squadmates in the game - my apologies to any Kelly Chambers fans.<br>\r\n- Keep it to muscle growth ONLY - and yes, that includes no macro growth. I'd like these women to remain at at least somewhat reasonable heights, please.<br>\r\n- Please try to at least put SOME effort into your writing. Simple chapters like \"and then she grew 20 feet like wow\" won't fly. Basically, try to write at least a decent paragraph of text. Choice chapters at the beginning (Such as which character will grow, how will they grow, etc.) are exempt from this, but let's try to avoid this being a 200 chapter Interactive of just choices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than that, there isn't much to it. If you're chapter violates any of these rules, I retain the right to remove it, and my word is finally. I'll be giving out 300 GP for your first addition and 100 GP for each subsequent addition - this will be upped to 600/200 if your chapter is REALLY meaty! However, once again, choice chapters are exempt from this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHave fun, and get growing!</td>",
