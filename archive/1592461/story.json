You have been transferred to S Company, the worst in the US Army. You begged to stay, but were denied. You had to parachute in, as no helicopter would land there. Company S wasn't regulated by the army, so no rules were enforced. You didn't have to shower, change clothes, wear clothes, or do anything. It was half men, and half women. But, rumors say the women are worse than the guys. And on top of all this, you have been shrinking 2 inches a day. Who do you meet first?</span></div></div>",

Yesterday, I was 6'1'', today I'm 5'6''.\" \" Wow, you're having the same problem as me! I'm shrinking too. Sucks don't it?\" \"I'm glad I  won't go through this alone.\", you say. \" The problem is if we get too small, well...\" \"Well what? \" Well, lets just say you don't want want to get too close to feet around here\" Just then someone walks in.</span></div></div>",
