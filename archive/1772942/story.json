He was simply running around his house, doing his chores as he always did, and trying to ignore the bickering of the three living dolls who had come to live with him. Yes, things had finally returned to normal for Jun (or as close to normal as the life of a boy who lived with 3 magical dolls could be, anyway). It was hard to believe that, only three short months ago, these very dolls (along with 4 others) had waged an intense battle against each other for the title of 'Alice', the one perfect doll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese 7 Rozen Maiden dolls engaged each other in a life-or-death battle, each seeking to claim the other's Rosa Mystica, the very source of these dolls' life. One by one, each of them fell to one another until only two remained; Shinku and the mysterious seventh doll Barasuishou. As these two battled it out, there was no clear sign of who would come out on top. In the end however, just as Shinku had gained the upper hand and was about to put an end to the infernal battle, an intervention by Jun gave Barasuishou the opening she needed to claim victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Shinku defeated by this desperate attack, Barasuishou had claimed all the Rosa Mysticae from the other dolls. However, by an unexpected twist of fate, it was revealed that she wasn't a true Rozen Maiden doll herself. Being only a replica, she was unable to control the immense power of the Rosa Mysticae. The Alice Game ended as Barasuishou self destructed, and all of the dolls who were defeated by her were allowed to come back to life. It was a difficult time for all of them, yet despite the tears that had been shed during the Alice Game, life had slowly drifted back to the way it once was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after the Alice Game had ended, the true seventh doll made herself known to the others as Kirakishou. In a show of good will to thank them for vanquishing her impersonator, Kirakishou returned the final two Rosa Mysticae to Shinku, allowing her to resurrect the only two dolls who were defeated by someone other than Barasuishou. With Souseiseki and HinaIchigo back to normal, it was as if the entire Alice Game had never happened. Yet there was one good thing that did come out of the dreadful war; after their final battle, Shinku and Suigintou had set their long-standing hatred for each other aside. With this truce between the two, Suigintou eventually came to befriend her sister dolls as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuigintou and Kirakishou now came to visit Jun's house just as often as Souseiseki and Kanaria, and the daily life of the young boy was finally in relative peace once again. As crazy as his life had become since first meeting with Shinku, he couldn't deny that he enjoyed having the Rozen Maidens in his life. In fact, if it weren't for them, then he probably would have never even set foot outside his own home (but that's a whole other story). The dolls had definitely added more to his life than they had taken away. It may be an abnormal life that he was now living, but he had gotten used to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun went about his daily business the same as always today, never suspecting that something would once again throw his peaceful life into chaos. Something even more bizarre mysterious than even the Alice Game had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jun was busy cleaning up the house, he heard the sound of someone ringing the doorbell. He immediately called out to Shinku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shinku! I'm right in the middle of cleaning. Can you get that for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would Jun, but I have some problems of my own to deal with at the moment! Knock it off you two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun looked over to see Shinku trying to sort out another argument between Suiseiseki and HinaIchigo. Jun simply sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh... It's probably just Kirakishou again... Well, at least she has the courtesy to actually ring the doorbell. Suigintou just teleports in through the mirror, Souseiseki flies straight through my bedroom window even if it isn't open, and Kanaria seems to just show up in my back yard out of nowhere... I swear, these dolls are more trouble than they're worth...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was ranting, the person at the door rang the bell again. Jun immediately set down his cleaning equipment and walked over to the door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he reached the door and opened it, he looked around to see that there was nobody in sight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's weird... I wonder who could have rung the doorbell...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Jun noticed a small brown parcel at his feet. Curious, he picked it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck is this thing? I don't remember ordering anything off the internet lately. Ugh... I bet it was Shinku. Knowing her, it's probably some more Detective Kun-kun merchandise or something... Well, whatever. If she's gonna order stuff without my permission, then I'm sure she won't mind if I take a look inside...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun then took the lid off of the box and peeked inside. Much to his surprise, a cloud of strange purple gas blasted out into his face. He immediately dropped the gas box and stumbled backwards, coughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the *cough* heck was that?! *cough* If that was her idea *cough* of a prank, then I'll *cough* be sure to give her a piece of my *cough* mind!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Jun realized something strange. His head was barely as high as the doorknob, and he was getting smaller by the second! Jun began to panic as he realized that he was shrinking, but there wasn't anything he could do about it. He continued to get smaller and smaller until he was only a pathetic 3 inches tall! Suddenly, Jun heard a thud from behind him, followed by another, and another. He quickly realized that these thuds were coming in a regular pattern; they were footsteps! Turning to the source of the sound, Jun stared upward to see the face of ______________ looking right at him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jun breathed a sigh of relief as he saw that Shinku was the one who approached him. Out of all the Rozen Maiden dolls, she was the first one he had encountered. As such, she was the one that he had the strongest bond with. The two had become close friends over their time together, and although Shinku herself was a bit hesitant to open up about her emotions, she still had come to trust Jun as both her medium and her friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinku now towered over him with a look of surprise on her face. The crimson-clothed doll then reached down to pick him up. Seeing her massive hand moving toward him, Jun suddenly began to worry about just what she would do with him. He quickly pushed these worries aside, however, as he remembered all the times that Shinku had saved his life during their time together. Jun simply stood and allowed the doll's large fingers to wrap around his body. Lifting him up to her face, Shinku began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jun? Is that you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Shinku! It's me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what exactly happened to you? How did you get so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really don't know what the heck happened! When I opened the door, there was nobody in sight. Then I saw this weird box on the porch, and when I opened it, I got sprayed with some kind of powder. I think that you can see the results for yourself...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my, well this could be a difficult case to solve... You're so tiny, you almost look like...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinku paused as she placed her free hand over her mouth and began to giggle. Jun himself didn't see what was so funny about this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What do I look like that's so funny?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look just like a doll now, Jun!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?! Listen Shinku, <i>you're</i> the doll, not me! Come on, you have to help me get back to normal!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow will Shinku respond to this?</span></div></div>",

Well then, let's just see how much you like it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun began to get worried. He could tell that he had probably crossed into forbidden territory with that last comment, and it was clear that Shinku was annoyed with him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what do you mean by that?\" Jun said nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinku simply smirked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Jun, to put it bluntly, you'll be spending the day as my doll to teach you what being a doll is really like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun was cut off as Shinku covered his mouth with her index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No 'but's, Jun. You need to learn a lesson, and I'm going to give it to you. Now don't worry too much; I promise that I won't hurt you, so just think of this as a learning experience. Maybe after today, you'll understand more about what it's like to be a doll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinku then removed her finger from his mouth, and Jun simply sighed. As demeaning as this situation was, he knew that he had no choice in the matter. Besides, he trusted Shinku when she said she wouldn't hurt him. Reluctantly, Jun resigned himself to spending the day as Shinku's doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Shinku, you win... Just be careful, alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But of course, Jun. You are my medium, after all. I would never let anything happen to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShinku then smiled and anounced what they would be doing first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Jun, let's get started.

Don't worry, I'm going to help you now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a touch that was surprisingly gentle, Shinku carried Jun in her hands towards his bedroom. They needed someplace private where they could discuss the situation. Looking down to her palm and seeing a slightly worried expression on Jun's face, Shinku decided to try and reassure him that everything would be okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's all right Jun, there's bound to be a way to reverse something like this. After all, if it can be done it can also be undone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really think so?\" Jun asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't that he doubted what Shinku said (she sounded too confident for that) but he was just so nervous about being put into this situation. Shinku simply smiled at him tenderly as she responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naturally. You just calm down and we'll get this whole mess sorted out. I can't have my medium running around looking like that, now can I?\" She said, her smile turning to a playful grin as she looked down at him. Jun found himself laughing in spite of himself; perhaps this wouldn\u2019t be so bad after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been decided a while back that a practical investment in stepladders should be made so as to allow the dolls to open door easily and simply without having to resort to carrying an umbrella with them everywhere. With practiced steps, Shinku opened the door to Jun\u2019s room and shut it behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey settled on his bed, Jun sat in Shinku\u2019s lap, the folds of her red dress like the waves in an ocean of blood\u2026 He quickly banished that mental image \u2013 to many disturbing possibilities. Jun had always hated having to look up at anyone, and now he was staring up at the colossal face of a doll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was\u2026 there was no other word but unbearable, he had to do something about it anything. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think I, er\u2026 we should do Shinku?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think that it would be best if you were to start looking on that intraweb thing for any information that might be useful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s internet Shinku, and that\u2019s probably a good idea. If anyone\u2019s ever seen something like this before, then I'm sure it\u2019ll be online somewhere.\u201d The bright smile soon fell from his face however. \u201cShinku?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Jun.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t use a computer at this size, at all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh\u2026 well\u2026\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And since this really doesn't have anything to do with me, I think that Nori would be more than happy to handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then walked away, leaving Jun alone on the floor once again. For a few minutes, he was simply standing there and waiting for Shinku's return. After a while, he heard footsteps again and saw Shinku had come back with his sister in tow. Shinku pointed at him and looked up at Nori.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See! I told you!

You can't honestly tell me that you're okay with me being the size of a doll!\" Jun said, irritated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No offense Jun, but I think that even the dolls are a fair bit bigger than you are right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not the point!

For a brief moment, Suiseiseki was an excited playful little girl overly joyous about her brand new dolly she got for her birthday... too bad that brief moment quickly vanished as Jun had realized he was gonna be treated far worse than a doll. FAR far worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick motion and a quick fuck you to the laws of gravity, the doll zipped up and stood back on her feet, still clenching her mini-Jun tightly in her grasp!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty, pint-size!\" she shouted anxiously, \"ready for the first game of the day?!\"<br>\r\n\"FIRST game of the day?!\"<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a yes!\" she grinned right before purposely dropping the poor kid right in front of her feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creepy little doll with a big mouth towered over him as her red eye glowed with keen interest.

All he'd have to do is scale the dual-eyed bratty toy and he's in! No sweat, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, fine! I'll do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOWEVER...\" unfortunately for our little hero, Suiseiseki wasnt done, \"if... no, WHEN you fail to reach the top of me before time runs out, we're gonna play ANOTHER little game.\"<br>\r\nJun swallowed hard, \"...What game?\"<br>\r\n\"Let's just say it's an 'educational' game,\" she replied with a devious smirk as the jade &amp; ruby glowed, \"...one that involves a thorough examination of the human anatomy! ....Yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat odd threat left Jun speechless. Lord only knew what kind of disturbing 'educational' game Suiseiseki was talking about, but it's not like Jun was in any hurry to find out! He's gonna have to play to win!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"READY SET GO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun charged like his life depended on it, grabbed tightly to the folds of the doll's dress trying especially hard not to inadvertently touch any girly parts... not like she had any (at least I THINK she doesnt!) and climbed up the the sky high dress as Suiseiseki snickered at his desperate attempt to scale her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, an idea to make the game more interesting flashed in the crazy doll's mind!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Did I forget to mention... that Mt. Suiseiseki is incredibly prone to...EARTHQUAKES?!\" she shouted just before shaking her dress a lot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...wwha...wwhaaa...\" Jun clung on to the fabric for dear life!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....WAAAAAHH-OOF!!\" and failed. All that effort put into climbing up her was now wasted. \"Hey! No fair! You never said you were-\"<br>\r\n\"Clock's still ticking, tiny!\"<br>\r\n\"OH CRAP!\" Remembering there was still a timer (even though he didnt how much time there was in the first place!), Jun quickly rethought his strategy... and attempted to climb up Suiseiseki's long wavy hair!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah!\"<br>\r\n\"Wwaaaa-ugh!\" but with a quick jerk of her head, Jun was sent flying back!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon, twerp!\" she egged him on, \"only the few and the proud have ever scaled Mt. Suiseiseki and survived!\" She pounded her chest, \"Put some heart into it, yes?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up,\" Jun mumbled as he tried again to climb up her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Flick!*<br>\r\n\"AAAHH!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd immediately got flicked off! As Jun lied flat on his face, the cheating mountain frowned down at him and put her hands to her hips!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk tsk.\" Suiseiseki shook her head, \"Pathetic. I always thought my medium had a lot more spine than this...\"<br>\r\nJun gritted his teeth from hearing that crazed doll belittle him. But for the possibility of getting his size back, he would have to endure and win this game!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuestion is... despite all of Suiseiki's last minute changes to the rules... can Jun still win?</span></div></div>",

If he climbed up the curtains, then he could jump straight onto her head from the top of the window frame! It might be a dirty strategy, but Suiseiseki wasn't exactly playing fair either. If he wanted to win her little game, then this was his only chance. Running past Suiseiseki, Jun grabbed on to the curtains and began to climb. Suiseiseki simply watched him, confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck are you doing, puny human? You're supposed to be climbing <i>ME</i>, not the window!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun just ignored her and continued climbing. It took him a while, but he finally managed to reach the top of the window frame. Looking down at Suiseiseki from up there, Jun realized just how high up he really was. If he missed his target and didn't land on the doll's head, he could seriously end up injuring himself. Putting these fears aside for the moment, Jun focused on his goal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one swift movement, he lept from the window frame and flew toward Suiseiseki's head. It took her a moment, but she quickly figured out just what Jun was planning on. Suiseiseki quickly attempted to move out of the way, but she wasn't quick enough. Jun safely landed on top of her head, and now stood triumphantly amidst the doll's long brown hair. Sighing, Suiseiseki knew that she had lost at her own game. She carefully plucked the tiny Jun from atop her head and placed him in front of her again. Putting her hands on her hips, she began to congratulate him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Jun, you win. I must say, I am very impressed. I honestly never expected a human as puny as you to actually succeed in my challenge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gee, thanks... Well, I won your game Suiseiseki. So, how about you tell me how you intend to return me to normal now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuiseiseki simply stared at him for a moment. She had never expected for Jun to actually make it to the top of her head, and as such, she hadn't even planned this far ahead. What will she do now that Jun managed to win her game?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If little Miss Duely-Eyes can't back up her bogus claims, she'll just keep stalling until she could get away with it. Besides, she said by winning the game, Jun was one step closer to getting his size back. She didn't say how big a step! And when it regards someone like Suiseiseki, that step will ALWAYS be too big for Jun to reach!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmph!\" Suiseiseki tilted her head up and looked away. To Jun, this was never a good sign. \"You're getting way ahead of yourself after winning just ONE game!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" Jun asked the giant playful doll, \"I won, now cough up the prize! My size!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk!\" the giant doll looked down at him and tsked, \"...is that tiny brain of yours STILL too small for your puny body? Don't you remember me saying that was our 'FIRST game of the day'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoor little puny tiny iddy biddy hopeless Jun gritted his teeth remembering that one little fact!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Ugh... how many games am I gonna have to play?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends on big a jerk you're gonna be with me, yes?!\" Suiseiseki crossed her arms and hmphed, \"maybe if you spoke a little nicer, I'd consider only a few... <i>dozen...</i>\" she muttered the last part under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright alright,\" Jun sighed in defeat and embarrassment that a stupid doll was 1upping him, \"what's the next game Suisei-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HOLD IT!\" she cut him off, \"who said you could call me that?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From now on, until the games are over, you are to address me as the Beautiful Maiden of Jade and Twilight, yes?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Y-You gotta be...\" oh what's the use? She obviously wasn't kidding. She was gonna milk Jun like the tiny little clipped bull that he is (and it was gonna be a LONG while since bulls don't give milk!) Jun lowered his head and sighed, \"Yes... Beautiful Maiden of Jade and Twilight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuiseiseki clapped her hands and smiled, \"That's better! Now for your next trial... It's called 'Hide and Seek'. The rules are so simple even a stupid puny human like you can understand them, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how to play Hide and Seek,\" Jun said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" she replied, \"then we'll add a few more rules to the game to make it more interesting, yes? Rule 1: You can only hide in this bedroom! You may NOT leave this room!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFigures it wasn't gonna be that easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rule 2: You may NOT make contact with any of the other dolls! AT ALL!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun shrugged. She's honestly telling him he cant get help. It was just HIM and the <i>Beautiful Maiden of Jade and Twilight</i>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rule 3: No hiding in places that I cant reach!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUgh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And lastly, Rule 4: Don't even THINK about hiding under my dress!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n...WAIT, WHAT?! DID SHE JUST SAY?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know how you make that perverted glance whenever you look at me!\" Suiseiseki said, glaring down at Jun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You give yourself WAY too much credit,\" Jun whispered... thankfully, too quiet for the doll to hear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And If you break ANY of these rules...\" Suiseiseki began as she waved her finger for a couple seconds before pausing to think. \"Uh... um... I... I'll shrink your sister, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun's eyes widened when he heard that threat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Y.... YOU WOULDN'T DARE!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I DO dare, yes?!\" Suiseiseki continued her bluff, \"And then... uh... when they come back, I'll shrink your parents, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun gasped. That was a heck of a threat. If he was normal sized, he would take that threat very seriously and toss Suiseiseki in a wood chipper! Would she dare go far as to threaten his mom and dad as well?!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But that's not all, yes?! I'll tell the others you and your family were gobbled up by evil space ninjas! They'll spend the rest of their lives crying and mourning your loss while I stuff you in a little mason jar and jump on the nearest plane leading to America! Then me and my tiny little puny pets will spend the rest of our lives touring Nickelback concerts!\" Stars and stones, she spent quite a lot of time thinking about that, didn't she? Something's gotta go wrong, because she's feeling way too damn good!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun glared up at the duel-eyed wise-ass doll and bit the bullet. \"Fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled smugly, \"Good! I'm gonna count to 10! Start hiding!\" She turned around and covered her eyes. \"1....2....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun had to think quickly about where to hide. The closet, the bed, the closet, the drawer, the closet, the closet, behind the tv, and the closet. Looks like his choices were limited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"3.....5... uh... wait...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he turned his head to the door. The bottom of it had plenty of space to squeeze through...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.... 5.... 7....4...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuiseiseki wasnt gonna help poor Jun out. He'd need somebody else. Preferably one of the OTHER girls!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...7.....B, no wait.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, he still remembers the threat she made. If she really isn't bluffing (fat chance), he'd only succeed in putting his family in jeopardy. They don't deserve to suffer just because HE didn't want to play nice with the doll from Hell!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....7, ugh! I already said that! 2....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun better think fast! Does he dare leave the safety of his room and risk a terrible fate? Or resume being Suiseiseki's little torture toy and risk a terrible fate as well?!</span></div></div>",

He could only stare in awe at how big the young doll was to him now. It was a complete role reversal, as he was now the size of a doll and being held in her hand.

It had been a full three months of her visiting his house regularly, and he still didn't feel safe around her. He was especially nervous now, seeing the deadly doll towering over him as if she were 50 feet tall!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun was terrified, and immediately turned to run. Luckily he hadn't shut the door before he shrunk, so he thought he could still escape. His path was cut off as a large black feather, that was just as big as he was, shot past him and lodged itself in the floor in front of him. Before he could even react, he found his body wrapped in the fingers of the silver-haired doll. As she lifted him up and placed him on the palm of her hand, Jun began to shiver in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well... What have we here?

Desperate to get away, he tried climbing up Suigintou's dress to get over her legs. Seeing this, Suigintou began to giggle to herself. For a time she allowed Jun to keep up his futile struggles, but as soon as he reached the top and was preparing to jump off of her leg to the other side, Suigintou carelessly poked him and sent him tumbling right back to where he started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't let you get away that easily, Jun.

If he had to have any of the dolls looming over him like this, then at least he was glad that it was the one with the most solid grasp on reality. Unlike the others, who were with the exception of Shinku either crazy or completely clueless airheads, Souseiseki always managed to remain serious. Despite her tomboyish personality, Souseiseki was probably the least likely of the dolls to end up hurting Jun; intentionally or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jun?

You see, your sister and Hina were having another one of their pointless arguments. Shinku was trying to break the two of them up, and then the doorbell rang. Since Shinku was already busy, I went to go answer the door. There wasn't anyone there, but there was a weird package on the porch. I grabbed the box and opened it, and then some freaky shrinking dust shot out and did <i>this</i> to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, well that does sound like quite the problem...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly!

He didn't know how it was possible! He saw her lose control of the rosa mysticae energy shatter into pieces before his very eyes, yet somehow this devilish doll had returned! As she stood on his doorstep and glared at him, Jun began to quiver in fear. Jun knew full well what Barasuishou was capable of; she was the one who manipulated the others into starting the Alice Game in the first place, and if not for being unable to control the rosa mysticae, she would have won it too! Her cruel methods and heartless manipulation of the other dolls was a truly scary thing to watch, and her power was almost as great as Shinku herself!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she had only vanquished Shinku due to a sneak attack, it was still a very close fight up until that point. In the moment of her defeat, Shinku was about to show mercy on her despite the evils she had committed. The results of this incident showed that Bara herself was one without mercy. Jun knew that being trapped in the hands of this porcelain demon would be the worst fate he could ever be forced to endure. He instantly turned tail and began to run, but Barasuishou saw through his attempt to escape from her. With a snap of her fingers, a large crystal shot out of the ground and blocked off Jun's only escape route! He was now completely trapped!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a devilish smirk, Bara knelt down to get a closer look at her cowering captive. Seeing the small human boy shaking in fear of her, Barasuishou couldn't help but laugh. Reaching out toward him, she proceeded to give Jun a painful flick with her index finger that easily knocked him onto his back. Jun was stunned by the pain, and he was absolutely petrified by the thought of what this doll could do to him in his current state. She could have easily killed him at his normal size, and now he himself was as small as a doll to her! Relishing in the fear she saw on her prey's face, Barasuishou then pinned Jun's miniscule body down with only her index finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out another laugh, Barasuishou began to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, it's so good to finally be back again! I simply adore the feeling of power I get from dominating a pitiful little creature like you! So Jun, tell me... Did you miss me while I was gone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how are you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarasuishou cut Jun off there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How am I alive, you ask? It's quite simple really. Enju wanted revenge on you for causing my destruction, so he rebuilt me and sent me to have some fun with you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"B-but didn't he-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInterrupting him again, Barasuishou continued speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he did disappear when I was defeated, but he didn't die. Father was simply sealed into a bizarre N-field. He's floating around in eternal nothingness, and it's <b><i>all your fault</i></b>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing accused of causing the fate that that Rozen wannabe brought upon himself infuriated Jun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! But I didn't seal him away! It's <i>his</i> fault for trying to outdo Rozen in the first place! You can't do this to me! Let me go right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBarasuishou was ticked off as she heard Jun insulting her creator, and she instantly snatched him off the ground and clenched him within her fist. She proceeded to squeeze him tightly, wanting to hear him apologize to her and beg for mercy. When she saw that he was still being stubborn, Barasuishou increased the pressure she was putting on him. Jun immediately screamed out in agony as his body was being crushed in the devilish doll's mighty grip. Barasuishou simply laughed once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that you're in much of a position to be making demands, pathetic human! Now that my shrinking powder has reduced you to such a laughable size, you won't ever be able to escape from my wrath! You belong to me from now on, and I'm going to have a lot of fun torturing you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun simply couldn't contain his fear. His face was as pale as a sheet, and he was shaking like a leaf. This doll was the source of his shrinking, and now he was utterly helpless in her hands. He was completely at her mercy, and she had long ago proven that she had no mercy to offer. He knew that he was doomed if he couldn't get help, and with the last of his breath, Jun called out desperately for Shinku. Hearing his desperate cry, Barasuishou squeezed him once again, constricting his body with her powerful fingers and preventing him from breathing. With the lack of air, Jun quickly slipped into merciful unconsciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis only hope was that Shinku had heard him. As Jun blacked out, he could only pray that she had. Several hours later, Jun wakes up in...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The skirt was below knee-length and had two layers, the top layer was lavender and joined to the top, the bottom was light pink,which obscure the top of a pair of high, purple, laced-up boots. On her head were two matching rosebuds as the one on her collar, each accompanied by three crystals that tied a few strands of her hair back slightly.

Just hearing her slow footsteps was unbearable to him. She could easily just float over to the corner of the room, but instead she walked at a casual calming pace. It was like she wanted to take her time with it, just to make Jun sweat over it. Well, he was sweating. He should've pissed himself while he was at it, cuz what was awaiting him was something Jun wouldn't wish on his worst enemy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jun?\" he heard Barasuishou call out to him in an unfittingly calm voice, \"may I ask you a quick question?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...what?\" Jun asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be a doll yourself?\"<br>\r\n'What kind of question is that?' Jun wondered. But since he didn't wanna test her when he's in such a vulnerable state, he answered, \"I... I guess...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad you've gotten curious,\" she called out, \"very glad. To be honest, ever since I first met you, I wondered what kind of doll you'd make. I personally think you would have made a great plain doll. Not a wacky super-hero action figure doll or a little girl's doll with a fake plasticy smile. A plain normal boy doll... just like every other real boy.\" Jun wasn't in any mood to listen to Barasuishou's little rant, however something told him he needed to pay close attention to it! \"You wouldn't be a doll that does tricks like a kung-fu grip or shoot fireballs or anything spontaneous. You would just be a normal old fashioned little boy doll... like one of those classic ones back in it's prime... before there was a need to be extreme or do silly tricks to attract attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh... what exactly are you going on about?\" Jun got really sick of the commentary and wished she'd just get to the point! He could hear a bit of rustling around in the dark, followed by the sound of metal clanking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't you figured it out yet?\" Barasuishou quietly spoke, \"obviously, you wouldn't be one of the SMARTER dolls. But that's fine. A plain average doll would fit you perfectly.\"<br>\r\n\"For the last time, weed-eye, what the heck are you planning?!\" Jun finally mustered the courage to raise his voice. He would then come to regret that.<br>\r\nAfter hearing a faint giggle, he heard her voice continue, \"I'm going to prove myself right. I'm going to make you a doll.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor boy paled as she finally stepped out of the darkness, carry two new toys. One of them being a black suitcase that seemed to be designed for someone her size to carry. The other being a little doll mask.<br>\r\nHer rose blossomed with as much tenacity as her yellow eye as she gazed down at Jun... then to her little doll mask.<br>\r\n\"Look, Jun,\" she brought it to his face... the mask looked exactly, EXACTLY like his own! Carved perfectly well... right down to the way his eyebrows tilt and his lips sink downward in such a sad expression, \"it's a perfect match. It took me so long to carve this to match your face, but I think I did a spectacular job! Don't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shivered and sweated. How Barasuishou managed to have the time, patience, and talent to carve out a doll face to match his own exactly in his particular size is a mystery he'd way rather not solve!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father would be so proud of me, don't you think?\" she didn't give him any time to answer as she opened up the suitcase, revealing a plethora of surgical tools, hammers, nails, screws, etc.\"He'd also be proud of the way I paid back an enemy of his.\"<br>\r\n\"W-W-W-WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?!!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm going to make my doll, Jun.\" Barasuishou pulled out a syringe, \"My very first doll, made all by myself, for nobody to play with but me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun didn't even get to finish his horrified scream before the mad one-eyed doll injected her 'medicine' into his neck! Barely seconds later, Jun's voice fell flat. He remained awake and aware, but he couldn't move an inch of his body. All the feeling in him that wasn't emotional was gone. He was practically lifeless... like a doll.<br>\r\nHe stared blankly into space, barely able to roll his eyes, but he could still see quite clearly what was happening. Barasuishou made sure that whatever the hell that was she injected him with didn't give him the luxury of putting him to sleep. He was gonna see it the whole way through!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the doll mask was on, Barasuishou had to make sure it'd STAY on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could see her disturbed smile light up the room as she placed the sad Jun doll mask over his face and got to work. He stared when she pulled out a nice little hammer and a couple of nails and the next thing he knew-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*KINK! KINK! KINK! KINK!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHard heavy clanking that shook his head a bit as a nail was being pounded into the side of his skull. All this time, Jun was screaming for help in his mind. He wanted to scream, he wanted to curse, he wanted to pray, he wanted to go home, but Barasuishou denied him of all of that. He could only listen to the nail penetrate deeper into his head and at the very least be thankful he couldn't scream. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clanking from the side of his head had stopped, but only for his doll captor to turn his head and work on the other side!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*KINK! KINK! KINK!*<br>\r\nThe noise would probably haunt his nightmares at this rate. He couldn't so much as feel the tears dripping out. The sad expression on his doll face matched what he was feeling perfectly. By the time his torturer is done with him, he'd probably never want to smile again at this rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pounding had finally ended. The doll face now a part of him.<br>\r\nBarasuishou admired her work as she stared at it with a sadistic smile, \"Perfect! Just perfect! Now what part of you should I start on next?\"</span></div></div>",

Jun would have opened his mouth to protest and beg Suigintou to allow him relief, but her earlier command had left his mouth sealed shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Jun, let's make this even more fun, shall we? Take off those pathetic underwear of yours for me.\" Suigintou commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnable to resist her commands thanks to the power of the collar, Jun reluctantly reached down and pulled off his underwear. As soon as he dropped his underwear at her feet, Suigintou reached down to remove her socks from her feet as well. With both her feet and her victim's cock bared to the world, Suigintou immediately went back to toying with Jun's cock between her delicate feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that the only things separating his rock hard cock from Suigintou's teasing bare feet now gone, the sensation of pleasure that he got from their touch was now magnified exponentially. Very quickly, however, that pleasure began to turn into torture. Unable to cum, Jun was forced to endure the buildup as Suigintou's footjob continued. She was giggling sadistically at his suffering throughout the entire process, greatly enjoying the pained expressions that were forming on his face as the touch of her dainty porcelain feet drove him mad with pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you aren't getting too excited yet, Jun. I'm only just getting started.\" Suigintou teased. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the sadistic doll jumped off of the computer chair and landed her rear atop Jun's face. With her panties smothering his face, Suigintou leaned forward and took Jun's cock in her hands. As she wrapped those slender fingers of hers around his tortured shaft, Jun let out a muffled moan. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like that, boy? It's only going to get better from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuigintou said as she began slowly and methodically stroking Jun's cock. With one hand she would gently tease his strained balls, the other hand smoothly gliding along his shaft. With each stroke Suigintou's hands moved ever so slightly faster. Up and down the shaft her hand went, mercilessly teasing the painfully aroused boy beneath her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one more sadistic giggle, Suigintou moved on to her grand finale. Leaning forward, the black winged doll carefully wrapped her lips around the tip of his cock. Jun couldn't believe that these sensations were actually coming from a doll. Suigintou's hands and feet had felt no different from the smooth skin of a real human, and now her mouth... It was just as moist as a real person's would have been, and her tongue felt no different as it gracefully danced around his cock head, torturing him with the unbearable pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Jun felt like his mind was going to break from this overload of pleasure without release, Suigintou removed her mouth from his cock and spoke to him once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Jun... I think that this little game has gone on long enough. Since I'm such a kind and gracious mistress, I've decided to give you the honor of cumming in my presence. I'm going to count down from 10, and when I say '1', you let out everything that's been building up in those poor tortured balls of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuigintou then reached down to grab Jun's underwear and, wrapping them around his cock to contain the inevitable eruption, gripped his pole with both her hands and her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready Jun? Here we go! 10... 9... 8...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuigintou began rubbing her hands up and down along his shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"7... 6... 5...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow her hands started rubbing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"4... 3... 2...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each passing number the speed of Suigintou's rubbing sped up, until finally...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"1! Let it all out, boy!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe instant '1' left Suigintou's lips, Jun's dick was already exploding. Suigintou laughed to herself as she watched Jun stain his own underwear with his cum. Finally, once he had run out of semen at last, Suigintou got up off of his face and allowed him to breath freely once again without her rear getting in the way. Once she was up, Suigintou lifted Jun's cum-stained underwear and dangled them in front of his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like somebody made a huge mess in his pants. How dirty of you, Jun.\" Suigintou teased with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun glared at her angrily, but with his mouth still sealed by her command there was no way for him to reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww... Come on Jun, don't look so mad. I was just having a little fun with you. Here, open your mouth and suck on these until they're nice and clean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJun, forced to obey Suigintou's every sadistic command, had no choice but to open his mouth and allow her to drop his own cum-stained underwear into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuigintou began to laugh louder than ever when she saw the pained expression on Jun's face as he reluctantly sucked his own cum from his underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha! Oh, Jun... This is such a beautiful sight. You really are the greatest toy that a doll could ever ask for.\" Suigintou said with a cruel smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

And of course, being the twisted little sadist that she was, she was having a blast abusing her power over him in the most perverted ways possible. Jun could do nothing but continue sucking on his own cum-stained underwear as Suigintou had ordered him to. Well, that and lay on the ground waiting for his cruel porcelain mistress to come up with her next humiliating command. Just as he thought that, the black winged doll began to speak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Jun... For your next task, I'm going to have you-\" No sooner had she began speaking, however, than she was cut off by the sound of a door opening downstairs. Nobody else was home at the moment, so this could only mean one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jun, I'm home!\" Jun heard his sister yell up to him as she closed the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYup. Nori and the other dolls had returned early, much to Suigintou's frustration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit! What are they doing back so soon?!\" Suigintou cursed under her breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jun, you wouldn't happen to have a spare needle and thread on hand, would you?\" Nori asked, her voice now sounding much closer than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot hearing any response from her brother, Nori began to get worried and knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jun, can you hear me? Is everything okay in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuigintou began to panic when she saw the doorknob twisting. The door was about to be opened. She definitely wouldn't be able to get out of here before Nori opened the door and saw what she had done to her brother. That left her with only two other options. She could either attempt to explain away the situation to Nori and make it sound like Jun had asked her to do this to him, or she could jump her as soon as the door opened and attempt to enslave her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth plans carried a level of risk with them. The issue with the former obviously being that it would be tough to come up with a convincing enough lie to trick Jun's sister, the one person who knew him better than anyone else, into believing that he was secretly a submissive pervert who wanted to be dominated by a doll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe issue with the latter was that Suigintou didn't know if the other dolls had followed her up the stairs or not, and if they would be there to get in her way when she tried to ambush Nori. Sure, she probably could defeat them in battle pretty easily; after all, that collar she had put on Jun could be used to turn him into a valuable hostage and gain a significant advantage if things started to get rough; but she wasn't exactly in a fighting mood at the moment, and would rather not waste her energy on any unnecessary conflict. If the other dolls were still downstairs, then it would be as simple as slapping the collar on Nori and silencing her before she could call for help. Otherwise, things could get ugly fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout much time left to think before the door opened and Nori walked into the room, Suigintou made a quick decision: She decided to...</span></div></div>",

Suigintou frowned for a little before grabbing the sides of Jun's head, somehow having enough strength to effortlessly hold his head in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naughty, stupid boy. A beautiful lady is giving you her full attention. All you should do is return the favor...\" Suigintou said before continuing her kisses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each kiss, Jun had a harder time resisting the urge to cum. In fact, it felt like Suigintou was sapping his will every time her lovely lips came into contact with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'No! that can't be true! I'm just a teenager! That has to be the cause, not her enslaving me through kisses!' </i>Jun thought.</span></div></div>",

I'm willing to offer 500 gift points for each chapter added. However, as I am currently very busy with college and other real life things, I may not notice new chapters for quite some time.

The storyline can involve Jun shrinking, one of the Rozen Maiden dolls (or any of the other girls in the series) growing into a giantess, or a simple femdom story for those who aren't into the giantess thing. <b>Also, be warned that this story WILL contain major spoilers for those who haven't finished watching both seasons of the show. Enter at your own risk!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1) no giant males<br>\r\n2) in the non-femdom routes, the girls can be gentle, evil, or neutral giantesses toward Jun. In the femdom route, their personalities will obviously be more dominating<br>\r\n3) use proper grammar/spelling<br>\r\n4) choice chapters are allowed, but if you post one, then you MUST fill in at least 1 of the choices immediately afterward<br>\r\n5) since the reboot anime came out and it takes place in a different universe from the original, I'm going to say that while this story is primarily based on the original anime, you can feel free to introduce any characters or elements from the reboot to the story as well. More variety and all that.<br>\r\n6) I reserve the right to add more rules later on (obviously, it's my story after all...)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><b><u><br>\r\nIn order to improve the reading experience, I'll try to correct any spelling and grammar mistakes I find. I also reserve the right to make minor alterations to chapters if it is necessary to insert detail or correct one of the above rules being broken. If a chapter is too poorly written for me to fix, then it will be deleted. Chapters that I have to delete will not qualify for the GP reward.</u><br>\r\n</b></i><br>\r\nFor those who don't know about this series, here's the wiki about it: <a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://rozenmaiden.wikia.com/wiki/Rozen_Maiden_Wiki\" target=\"_blank\">http://rozenmaiden.wikia.com/wiki/Rozen_Maiden_Wiki</a><br>\r\n</td>",
