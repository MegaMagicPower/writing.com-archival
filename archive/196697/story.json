So we left home, hit the road with nothing to lose, eighty bucks apiece, two acoustic guitars and the world was ours to discover....  As youthfulness goes, we were pretty much the epitome of that. Invincible and young with nothing to worry about except which way the wind seemed to be blowing...\r<br>\n\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

I looked over at Sherry.  She sat on the curb with her knees to her chest, humming a sad, little lament.  I recognized the song so I put down my Dr Pepper and offered up a some accompaniment on guitar.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nSherry sang, I strummed and Mike kept the beat with his foot, as he smiled at us through a mouth full of Twinkie.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n<div align=\"center\"><i>Who's that out on the road?\r<br>\nare you, gonna toe that line?\r<br>\nI wear this ball and chain\r<br>\nany time I'm Blind.\"</i></div>\r<br>\n\r<br>\nA couple of people stopped to listen, and when we finished playing; they smiled and gave us money.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Hey\", said Mike.  \"They gave us money\".  He deftly tuned his fat-bottomed Epiphone and began playing a catchy reggae thing in G.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nWe played for a couple of hours more, but never with the same success as our first song.  I thought about where we could go play where maybe we could get a little more money.  So far two hours of playing in a parking lot had netted us 10.36 in change.  Ten bucks and change was a start, but I had been getting paid more at the Paco Taco.  It was heartening, however, that we could make lunch money off an impromptu jam session.  I mused about bigger and better venues.  At least I didn't have to say \"Welcome to Paco Taco, would you like mild or hot sauce with your muy bueno burrito\" anymore.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\r<br>\n</span></div></div>",

It was still early in the evening, and walking down the road was hot work.  We passed a small, white shack with the name \u2018Beverly\u2019s\u2019 spray painted over the door.  We could hear The Doobie Brothers\u2019 \u2018Takin\u2019 it to the Street\u2019 inside.  As if on cue Mike and I both suggested we go in for a drink at the same time.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nBeverly\u2019s was mostly empty.  We made our way to the bar.  The barkeep didn\u2019t look like any Beverly I\u2019d ever run across.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cID\u201d? He asked.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nI reached into my pocket and put a twenty on the bar.  \u201cSir, Your establishment enticed us in.  We were hot and thirsty, and the righteous tunes we heard beckoned us.  We do not wish to inconvenience you , but as you may have guessed we have no ID.  We don\u2019t need to stay long, just a couple of Heinekens and a drink for your gracious self\u201d.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cThe barkeep gave me casual glance, grunted, then pulled down two glasses from the shelf.  He collected a bottle of unmarked brown stuff, and slammed it down, along with the glasses in front of us.  \u201cBoys\u201d., he said.  \u201cTruth is I don\u2019t care how old you are, but if your going to drink here you better learn to drink like men.\u201d  He filled us each a glass, set the bottle back down and walked away.  At the end of the bar he picked up a tumbler full of the brown stuff, took a long pull, shook his mangy head and coughed twice.  \u201cI already have my own drink\u201d, he wheezed back at us.  \u201cYou know I can\u2019t sell you no liquor, but I ain\u2019t selling you any\u201d.  He stuffed my twenty into his pocket.  \u201cThis ain\u2019t for the booze.  This pays for some advice.\u201d\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cAdvice\u201d? I managed to get out between spasms.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cYup\u201d.  He answered.  \u201cI\u2019d lay off that fancy talk before the regulars show up, and never, ever pet a burning dog\u201d.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe spasms subsided, but the tears kept streaming down my face.  Mike\u2019s face was as red as an apple.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cWhat is this stuff\u201d? Mike asked.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cNot that we\u2019re complaining\u201d.  He quickly added.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\u201cIt\u2019s a homebrew my Pa makes.\u201d  The barkeep answered.  \u201cThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t sell it to you.  It would be illegal, but your welcome to drink as much as you like.  I\u2019ve got barrels full of it\u201d.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe thunder from what sounded like a hundred or so Harley\u2019s set the glasses behind the bar to clinking.</span></div></div>",

We had long since quit playing...  the cold was beginning to set in, and our fingers had gone numb from playing our guitars so long.   I kept glancing back to Mike lurking in the shadows behind me,  his fingers flicking the ash of a cigarette to the ground.  Right now he seemed more absorbed in watching the girls walking across the street than talking to anyone.    Sherry was silent as well,  her knees tucked up to her chest,  chin resting on her hands as she watched the sun sink beneath the horizon.  She seemed quiet,  musing,  buried in her own thoughts...   so solomn for how optimistic she usually was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \"What's on your mind, Sherry?\"  I asked quietly, not wanting to disturb her thoughts too drastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  For a moment there I thought that she wasn't going to answer me.   And then, she turned to study me carefully,  bright blue eyes piercing in the fading light.   \"Tell me something,\"  she responded softly.  \"Do you really want to go back home tonight?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI heard Mike snort in the backround,  sharp exhale of smoke as he bit back a sarcastic comment.  We knew that Mike wasn't ever willing to go back home, any night. But as for me...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" I told her finally.  Even with my family, things were seriously beginning to grate on my nerves... I didn't think I could stand being stagnant much longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think about leaving, then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leaving to where?\"  Mike asked suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shrug was nonchalant.   \"Would it matter?  Away.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn impetuous smile grew across his face- i knew he was caught, but i wasn't ready to go just yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it!  We wouldn't have to answer to anyone... And we could play for a living, like we did today.  We wouldn't get much money, though- but that's the fun of it! We'll never know where we'll sleep next, or where our next gig'll be.  It'll just be moving from place to place.  No one to answer to- no curfews- no one to tell us what we ought to be doing.  What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about my family?\"  I asked.  It was a big decision, to just pick up and leave like that, especially if we didn't know when we would return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your choice,\" mike told me seriously.   \"We'll go, right sherry?\"  <br>\r\nShe nodded afffirmation. <br>\r\n\"You can tell you parents.  Or we can leave right now.  Or you don't have to come at all... what'll it be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was used to this however, because fast-food places are the same around the globe, so I was able to decipher her order from the junk, \"I want a number two, three medium Diet Cokes, and a large Smegma Enchillada, with extra cheese.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Smegma Grande, yes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" the woman screamed into the mike; I could probably open the window to hear her, instead of using the damn 35 year-old microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.  Two small onion rings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotcha.  Your total is $11.37.  Please pull through to the second window.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put my hand over the mouthpiece and yelled toward the door to Liz and Jimmy, \"Joel will let you in, right after he's done cleaning the crapper!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy headset rang with a very clear and a very startled, \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn!  I thought my hand had covered the mouthpiece.  I quickly spoke into it, \"Not you, ma'am.  Please pull through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJoel let our bandmates in as I made the drive-through order.  I exchanged her food for the money, made change, and sent her on her way.  I was left to close up shop and prep for the coming day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz informed us that they had absolutely struck out at landing us a gig.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe were all disheartened, and after several long moments, Joel quietly asked if we should go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head, \"There's nothing for us back there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLiz nodded, \"I agree.  We can do this; nobody said it'd be easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJimmy shuffled a foot, \"I dunno, man.  We're barely scraping by.  This may never happen to us, you know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a light rap on the door.  We all looked up to see a guy looking at us expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at Jimmy, \"Didn't you lock the outer doors after Liz and Joel came in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shrugged, \"I guess not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked up at the guy and shouted, \"We're closed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded and spoke; we could kind of hear him through the glass, \"I know, but all I have to do is take a leak!  My bladder ain't as young and strong as it once was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was middle-aged, a little thin on top, slightly pudgy.  He was wearing black clothes and a dark headband.  I didn't want to let him in to piss all over Jimmy's nice bathroom detail, but I also didn't want him to go out in the parking lot, either.  I looked at Liz for advice.</span></div></div>",

Nobody's gonna just walk in here and hand us a recording contract.  We gotta start small, build a fan base, work from the bottom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others were still quiet, and still unconvinced, \"I guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was into the whole \"rah-rah\" speech now.  I paced in front of them and waved my arms around my head, occasionally striking a fist in the air, \"We gotta believe in each other and believe in the music.  What we are doing is worthwhile, and we gotta hold on to it, embrace it, and let the hard times make us stronger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of them were silent, but I heard movement behind me.  I looked to see the headband-wearing dude was leaning against the corner.  He said, \"I heard your speech.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh?  What'd you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled.  The creases around his eyes deepened as he did so, but his eyes looked thirty years younger,  \"Oh, to be young and ignorant again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to leave, but said something on the way out, \"That was really nice of you guys to let me use the john; I appreciate it.  I'd love and chat with you young rock-and-rollers, but my bus is waiting for me.  We had to stop cuz one of my guys was in the can.  Can you believe that?  My own bus and I can't take a whiz!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked out the door, he turned for one final message, \"Oh!  And you're right about one thing: no one's ever gonna come walkin' through these doors and just hand you a damn thing, but...\" he winked at us,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe someone might be willing to lend a hand someday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, buddy,\" we waved him off.  Jimmy and I cleaned out back while Joel and Liz swept out front and filled the napkin dispensers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights were out, and the four of us walked out the doors, remembering to lock both sets this time, when Liz noticed the strangest thing, \"Hey, you guys!  Look at this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting against the side of the building was an autographed Les Paul guitar with a note taped to the neck.  It read:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear kids,<br>\r\nThanks for lettin' an old fart use your john, it was very kind.  I meant what I said about lending a hand.  Maybe this helps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd signed underneath, \"Dick Dale.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath that sheet was another that had the phone numbers and addresses for a couple dozen different rock and roll agents, record companies, and bars that might be willing to give us a listen, if we wanted them to hear us badly enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow,\"  Jimmy said.  Jimmy was our guitarist, and obviously a kindred spirit,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dick Dale rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNobody could disagree.  </span></div></div>",

All we want is to find a cheap hotel to hide from the heat and rest our scenery-numb eyes, however, our funds are limited, so we settle for three cups of coffee at a rather plush McDonald's. <br>\r\nCaffeine-injected, we continue on our way, touring the city, but, finding no parks to start up a song in and no local (non-starbucks)coffee shops to get a gig at, nearly decide to join the tons of begger's standing on every exit ramp asking for money. We search around for writing materials and construct a sign, but by the time we're finished it darkness has fallen and it's gotten quite late. Despondan, we sit on a curb and try to regroup.<br>\r\n*indent* Thankfully, Rod spots a free community newspaper which draws our attention to Deep Ellum, the local club scene. <br>\r\nElated, we speed there immediately, thanking our luck that it's an semi-early Saturday evening. Once there, amidst the swarming mobs of club-hoppers, we set up shop in a choice location and begin to play.<br>\r\nMaria and Rod on guitar, I on vocals. <br>\r\n </span></div></div>",
