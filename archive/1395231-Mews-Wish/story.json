Not many Pokemon knew this, but Mew was an FA. \"The usual things, Mew?\" a voice said. Mew whirled around, and saw Jirachi floating behind her. \"Yeah. And didn't I tell you NOT to sneak up on me like that?\" said Mew. \"Well, I think I've decided to grant your wish.\" Jirachi said with a smile. \"I've sent out these special watches to everyone in town, and the world, as well...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLucario looked, quite confused, at the watch in the package he had received. It had a Lucario on it. Lucario placed the watch on, and pressed a button to set the time. Suddenly, a strange sensation overcame him... a sensation he knew to be Evolution. When the glow dispersed, he stared at his body in the mirror, and gasped when he saw that he had gained... </span></div></div>",

Not enough to make him immobile, but definately very pudgy. His once firm, slim belly now squishy and wide adding about 20in to his figure. His thighs now squished against each other. His face had also gained a large amount of weight. His cheeks now bounced on his wide face making the serious looking Pokemon now look rather cute. Even his legs and arms were now very wide! Not knowing what to do, Lucario in a mad panic, attempted to take the watch off in which he gained another 30lb. Across town another Pokemon was having a similar problem...</span></div></div>",

Outside again, he gasped, realizing that this new weight gave him the feeling he was having a heart attack with each shock factor. What he saw amazed him, all the other pokemon also had gained weight, at least 100 pounds! He also realized that they had similar watches on, except they had the picture of the pokemon that they were on them.<br>\r\n   Lucario waddled up to his best friend, and umbreon named Luka, he had gained more weight than even Lucario himself! <br>\r\n   \"Oh, hey Lucario,\" Luka said when he had noticed him, \"Where'd this sudden fat come from?! It's really doing a number on my legs,\" he said. Lucario then also realized, that the weight made his legs hurt like crazy also. What had happened!?<br>\r\n   Suddenly Mew came from her house with her friend, Jirachi. Lucario noted with annoyance that she and jirachi weren't fat. Mew was smiling with happiness at the fat pokemon waddling around her, flying up to each of them she said, \"ooooohhh, honey! I LOVE your style, new haircut or something?\"<br>\r\n   They just glared at her, thinking that she was mocking them. That night when Lucario was in bed, ready to sleep he took the watch off and realized the evolving sensation again! When he looked in the mirror next he was relieved. When he had took the watch off he had come back to normal, he than realized the connection. The watch. He laughed and so did other pokemon in thier own homes when they took the watches off themselves.<br>\r\n   The next day, Mew gasped, no one had thier watches on and they weren't fat! She ran into her house, screaming that they had found out her plan. Jirachi sighed with annoyance and put a palm to her face. She drifted out of the wailing mew's house and began telling everyone about  the watch. She told them it was a practical joke and everyone laughed along with her, jolly, but not fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">The End</span></span></div></div>",

He had never really hated fat, but he never really wanted it either and now here he was, a huge fatty with more chins then he could count! Hoping to get back to normal, Lucario tried to take off the watch, but when he tried, a red light on the watch flashed, a quick jolt went through his body and he gained another 100 lbs! Hopelessness flooded through him as he realized he was stuck like this for maybe the rest of his life. He then heard somewhere near the back of his mind \"Hey it's not a big deal, heck it's a great thing to happen to you! You never hated it before so why now? Just accept it and embrace it and move on.\" He thought it over for a second, true he never really hated it so maybe this could work out. Then his legs started aching and he was forced to sit down. Whether they were aching because they had so much weight to carry, or because he was standing in the same spot for 10 minutes or because his legs were growing muscles to handle this weight, he couldn't be sure of. When they felt better he got off he walking without thinking, \"Now.\" He thought to himself \"I think I should...\"</span></div></div>",
