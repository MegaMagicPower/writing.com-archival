In the kitchen Jenny started taking out different ingredients and started to try and make some cat-food (Because they didn\u2019t have any at home). In her cooking she decided to put in some weight gain powder in the mix, because she thought that a live on the streets must have been pretty hard on Oliver\u2019s body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Jenny had finished her homemade cat-food, she took one of Georgettes finest bowl and poured it on. Oliver became a bit unsure. The food was a grey mass with little bits that looked like dog food. He hadn\u2019t been having a real meal in a long time, but was he so desperate that he would be eating this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis looks like something I would find under a garbage can.\u201d Oliver thought. \u201cBut if I don\u2019t eat it she might kick me out.\u201d And with that Oliver dived his head into the bowl and started eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Oliver think it tastes?</span></div></div>",

He even sometimes swallowed without chewing. Finally he finished his eating by licking the bowl clean. He then laid on his back rubbing his belly. By then his stomach had expanded to almost three times its original size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you like that?\u201d Jenny asked. Oliver answered with a nod, followed by a (big for a kitten) burp.  This made Oliver blush a little. \u201cSo much?\u201d Jenny said and giggled a little at Oliver\u00b4s burp. \u201cIn that case I have to remember the recipe so I can make it again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes!\u201d Oliver thought. \u201cIt was the best food I ever eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Another thing the sleeping had done was to transfer all the fat and calories from Oliver\u00b4s belly to the other parts of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis whole frame was a little wider and rounder. He had still a bit of a belly hanging, and the start of an double chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found it difficult to get out of his basket because of his new body structure. But after some tries he got up rolling from laying on his back to on his stomach, and heave himself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked to Jenny\u00b4s bed finding that his walks style I different to. They are more wider and longer, and his body shakes a little of doing them. When he reaches her bad he tries to jump up to her. But he doesn\u2019t reach the edge of the bed and land on his fatted rump. He tries to wake her up by yelling like cat do. And it works.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod morning Oliver.\u201d Jenny says while rubbing her eyes a little. \u201cDo you need some breakfast?\u201d she asks. Oliver gives her a little nod in response. \u201cThen I\u2019ll help you make some.\u201d She said and walked down to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she went down the stairs Oliver followed her. But found it a bit more difficult to do all these little jumps down, because his bigger belly seemed to be getting in the way all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the kitchen Jenny started to take ingredients and started cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow will the cooking go?</span></div></div>",

So she took some, and then some more just to be safe. She had actually double the dose of weigh gain powder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking this didn\u2019t take so long because she didn\u2019t needed to heat up anything. After a minute so was she finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost at the same time when Oliver had finally made it down all the stairs. For him it felt like he had run a mile, so his stomach demanded some food. Now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny poured the mix into another of Georgettes food bowls and served Oliver. Remembering how wonderful it tasted last time Oliver downed down and started eating it like crazy. He took his time more this time and could enjoy the flavours more. He gave his teeth and tongue some work to do this time. Last time he\u00b4d just filled his mouth and swallowed the food. This time he took his time to taste, chew taste some more, and finally swallow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had understood now that being a pet he was going to be able to eat this delicious food how much he wanted. With that in mind he still made sure to eat up every little bit this time to. He even made sure to lick the bowl clean when he was finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating he felt strange. The extra weight gain powder didn\u2019t make him feel as full like last time, but more heavy like he had a big cement block in his belly. Even Jenny thought that Oliver felt a lot heavier when she was helping Oliver back to his basket in her room. A soon as Oliver was back in his basket he feel asleep to let his food digest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow much had Oliver gained the next day?</span></div></div>",

Totally so far had Oliver gained 15 pounds. Making him a bit chubby for a kitten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver liked his new body though. He felt so warm and cuddly. If every meal he gets is making him gain so much it wont be long before he\u00b4s obese or even immobile, but Oliver was prepared to be that. If he could still be lying in a comfortable bed, in a warmed up room, with all the food he can eat, he wouldn\u2019t care if he would never be able to move a muscle again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter dreaming about his future self Oliver took the time to take a look at his new body. He saw that his previous equally wide form now had a bulge in the midsection. It was his belly. It stood out 2 inches and looked he had swallowed a tennis ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was stretching his paws over to feel his belly, he saw the next change of his body. His arms and legs were thicker and heavier. He rested his front paws on his stomach, and felt how his paws sunk in a little. He liked how that felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast he felt that he was breading a little heavier then before. He took and reached his arms to feel his throat. He could feel the same touch of fat that he had feel on his stomach. Bending down his head to try and see, Oliver felt something stopping him. it was a second chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill Oliver welcomed his changes, and was hopping to be a bigger kitten after his next meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat kind of meal would Jenny give him next?</span></div></div>",

He had decided to become a gainer, and not stop until he wasn\u2019t able to reach for any food on his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to feel that something was wrong when he didn\u2019t see Jenny cooking anything. She just took a bag from the self and pored into a smaller then usual bowl some strange looking things. They where small and dry and hard. Jenny thought that Oliver looked like he had had more then enough of fattening meals and should get ordinary cat food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver decided to at least give the new food a chance before complaining. But it didn\u2019t take long before he missed the old fat food. These things where so small that he barley could feel satisfied after eating all of them he got served. While the old food where mostly like a thick liquid with some little hard bits, these were all completely hard things that required much of his jaws muscles to handle. Finally it was dry, so dry. It was so dry that Jenny had put a water bowl just to help him rinse his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing it all he felt like he had only been eating almost half the amount of food he from his first meal here. He had after only two meals of Jenny\u00b4s homemade cooking been addicted to only eat meals that would make him fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo what should he do to achieve his goal?</span></div></div>",

Luckily for him Jenny leaves the bedroom door open for him if he needed to move around during the night. After having no problems getting to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow comes the more tricky part. With just his bare paws he would have to take and lift, move and open things to be able to make his meal. His final plan was to take and put a bowl on the floor, and then rollover food packages and let the ingredients pour down into the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started with jumping up to the counter. Even if he was a bit chubby he was still able to jump like usual. He happens to find a big cooking bowl standing on the counter. He then took the bowl and pushed it into the sink under the water tap. He took and turned on the tap and let the bowl get filled to the brim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Oliver found the ingredients for the dish after opened a cupboard. The things that would give the dish the taste and the fat were in powder form. All he had to do was to tip them over and let the powder pour into the water filled bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the box with the powder to give taste poured out enough the one with the fat didn\u2019t. It just didn\u2019t stop coming. Even Oliver thought that it was enough and tried to make it stop to no avail. It seems like fat even in powder form was heavier. When Oliver finally was able to rise the box straight again almost half of the powder in it had fall into the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile looking at the mix that was starting to come together to the same mixture that Jenny had made Oliver suddenly felt like he heard something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was it?</span></div></div>",

Doing that made some food going in to the big opened mouth of the cat. Not thinking of what to do Oliver swallowed the food, and realized just how to get out of this situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to take large bits of food and swallow to make the level sink. And with the more food he eats, the quicker he became to swallow the next portions. He could feel how his stomach got bigger and more stretched as time went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver had only been eaten half of the big feast before he started to feel a pain of being full in his belly. He could also feel his feet touching the bottom of the bowl. He could quit here, sleep the night and get pick up by Jenny the next day. But he was best\u00e4md to finish this challenge he had been given himself. The challenge to eat every little bit of the food that he had made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo he continued to eat. He eat so much that he was lying on the bottom of the bowl with no more food left. Or almost no more food left. There was some bits that was on the walls of the bowl that Oliver had missed. Speaking of Oliver he looked full. Really, really full. Lying on his back he saw that his previously chubby belly had grown to a mini mountain. It was three times wider and two times higher. He must have been eating at least 20 pounds of food, and with the weight gaining powder it would probably lead to 10 more pounds<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he still didn\u2019t feel satisfied. The where still some chunks of food hanging on the walls. And he was going to eat everything. He started were he could, which was the bottom walls around him. It was just like eating a mouthful, but there were bigger portions higher up. With the walls cleaned Oliver could finally get a grip with his claws, and used then to help heaving him up. When he had lifted himself up enough he took and tried standing on his hind legs. Surprisingly it worked. All the extra weight in the bottom half of him made him stand up like a Tjock p\u00e5 boten docka. With easy little steps he made his way to the higher placed food. During his eating he could feel his stomach giving massive protests. Ignoring his huge pains Oliver finished the very last piece of food in the entire bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing so Oliver felt back on his back again, squirming and massaging his stomach. He seriously felt like he was on bite from exploding. But it was worth it. Jenny could do everything she wanted to him now. She could put him on diets, make him exercise, or even throw him out of the house. He didn\u2019t care. He felt like he had done everything you could do in life. \u201cSo bring you\u00b4re best Jenny! I can take it!\u201d Oliver thought. He felt asleep afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA couple of hours later Jenny woke up felling hungry. She walked down to the kitchen getting a little shock. She saw several boxes opened, and trace of the ingredients on the kitchen table leading to the kitchen sink. Looking down she saw a food bowl with a very stuffed Oliver. Oliver actually woke up of the sounds of Jenny being in the room. The big confidence that he had before going to sleep was gone now when saw Jenny eye to eye. He had no idea if she was going to punish him or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was she going to do?</span></div></div>",

Oliver was a bit confused at first, but he quickly understood what her sudden change of mood was about when she exclaimed: \"OLIVER! You're SOOOOOOOOO kay-ute!\" She licked his face and nestled her own face into his soft, fat tummy, and also tickled both that and his sides, causing Oliver to burst into laughter. \"Hey, hahahahahahahahahahahahaha, stop it, Georgette! Hahahahahahahahahaha! I'm ticklish! Especially on my tummy! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Knock it off! Cut it out! Hahahahahahahahahahaha!\" Soon she'd tickled him so much that tears were coming from his eyes, but then she stopped and picked him up, going: \"Oh, my, I can't believe I was annoyed at you being here at first. You're so adorable, and even if you were before, you're even more so now by quite a lot! Just like you weigh more by quite a lot, too!\" She held him close and hugged him tight, then Oliver couldn't help but start to purr as he closed his eyes contentedly. Not only was that fattening food Jenny gave him good, but it had made Georgette love him instead of seeing him as an intruder. He was now like a priceless, one of a kind treasure to her, and he could tell he was most definitely going to like this new life of his, even if it also meant he was going to be something of a tubby tabby and corpulent kitten from now on, especially since, if one meal made him this large, he knew he was only going to continue gaining weight until he couldn't move at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgette stroked him down the back many a time and let her face get lost in his flabby paunch, and Oliver hugged her face and purred soothingly and serenely. After a bit of it, Georgette was done and placed Oliver, who was disappointed that such a heavenly embrace had to end, back down, making sure he would be placed on all four feet, or the closest thing he could get to it with his new gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, Oliver!\" he then heard Georgette say, seeing a look on her face which clearly signified she'd come up with a marvelous new idea. His own face lit up as he became excited and eager to hear what he knew was something she meant to say that he anticipated. Looking into his happy eyes, she then told him: \"I think that this is the perfect time for me to...\"     </span></div></div>",

Nothing for us but sheer, unmitigated indulgence for as long as we desire. Your not like those common tabbies anymore. Digging through trash for fish bones. Pouncing on birds.....'working' for a living catching mice for humans in some vain hope they will feed you....\" Her lips pulled back in disgust at the 'W' word. \"Here in this place. Your use to the humans in merely to grace them with your presence. The mere act of existing and letting them care for you is your sole job. Why, you could grow so fat that you couldn't move. So fat that you stomach lifts your paws off the marble, and when you can't reach your food, they will bring the food to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmm.\" The kitten looked thoughtful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All you need to do my dear, is look adorable. And I must say, your doing a good job of that.\" She tickled his side, causing him to pull back with a laugh \"All you need is...a 'few' changes here and there, and you'll be living the high life for the 'rest' of your life. Just like yours truly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Changes?\" He asked slowly as the dog circled behind him. Pushing her nose against his back to wordlessly say she wanted him to move. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Your just naturally so cute it shouldn't take much. But a little styling here, the right conditioner there. Some filing on your claws, the right tooth whitener. Why you'll have even the butler talking to you like a newborn no matter how fat you grow.\" She grinned. Holding her head high as she thought of everything she would help Oliver with. Everything she would teach him about proper attitude. Proper behaviour and he grew larger and larger \"I'll teach you everything I know about how one should hold themselves. How to speak to others. How to make what you want clear to the humans. Oh it will be fabulous. We'll be the best of friends.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said my dear.

And a rich girl like Jenny?\" Georgette thought. \"And in the body of a CAT, of all things? What Jenny fed him, I've no clue, but in any case, I can't believe what I'm looking upon.\" She then snarled: \"You listen here, you tubby little runt...\" Oliver gulped in fear at the sudden hostility, especially with such a vulnerable position as he was in. He was on his back, bloated belly fully exposed, and unable to move much due to how full he was, after all. \"It's annoying enough I have to deal with sharing a house with you to begin with, since I don't like attention being diverted from me to you, and that you are a cat makes it worse, at least for a perfected poodle like myself. But for you to bloat up like a balloon after eating some of MY food that Jenny just happened to give you for how she took you in? You make me want to puke! I can't believe I'm even looking at you, much less talking to you! You don't even deserve that, not even in the form of condemning like this! You are a disgrace to this house and if you have any respect for me, Jenny and/or Winston at all, you will leave the instant you can move again and never so much as look back in the direction of this mansion again! And who knows? Maybe you'll make a nice, plump snack for the vicious street dogs out there! I only wish I could hear you scream and die when it happens!\" Georgette said all of this in an extremely coarse, bitter and nasty tone, which one might expect to hear from the hosts of hell, and her cutting words also were reminiscent of what hell's demonic occupants would say to someone. Oliver was so frightened, his feelings so hurt, that he not only went white(or as white as he could go, given his orange and yellow fur), but he literally vomited up the rich, special food Jenny had given him. All of it, to the point where he was almost as thin as he had been before eating it, and the difference was so subtle, even eagle eyes would have difficulty seeing it. He also, realizing he could move again and felt empty, ran into the corner and stayed backed against it, tears coming out of his petrified eyes as he looked terrified beyond belief, and felt equally trapped. He was also trembling with trepidation, thinking Georgette was going to either kill him, throw him out or do something equally awful. He'd never felt this cornered, this afraid or this hurt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgette, having previously been consumed by her disgust at the sight of the up until a few seconds ago fattened kitten, now realized just how cutting, cruel and vicious she'd been when she lashed out at him, and couldn't help but feel a little pity towards how helpless and scared he looked. Her conscience and the heart she had deep down despite all her vices and quirks made her see that this was just an innocent kitten who was hungry and happened to have eaten a lot because of it and she'd now scared him so badly he'd puked his meal up and looked nearly identical to the way he had before. Her angry eyes turned to concerned, caring ones and she walked over, nuzzled Oliver, who quickly saw she was trying to comfort him, to his surprise, and she said: \"I'm so sorry, little one. I didn't mean to frighten you. I shouldn't have been so nasty. You were just in need of some food and had a big meal, and now I made you literally lose your lunch because of the way it made you look after you'd eaten. Yeah, it's annoying to have Jenny pay attention to you along with me, instead of just me, but I should know better than to condemn you like this. I should be more fair to you.\" Oliver increasingly realized how sorry Georgette was and how sincere she was about it, and that he didn't need to be afraid. He rapidly began to calm down and soon hugged Georgette's muzzle. As soon as he was back to his normal, cheerful self, Georgette said: \"You deserve something nice from me after all you've been through, right down to the inexcusable way I treated you just now, so to atone for it and make you feel more welcome here, why don't I...\"    </span></div></div>",

Oliver just looked at her for a moment before going back to eat it, but just like last time, right before he took his first taste of it he asked, \"Don't you want to eat also?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis got Georgette in a slight panic state.

So against her better will she had to eat a small piece of her own food. \"If I eat just a small bit the effects of the pills maybe wont be so hard.\" She thought and took a small piece and eat it carefully. While she did that Oliver went into it with full force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving living a life of starving had made him trained to eat everything of anything that was eatable, and this case wasn't any different. But after only getting half of it eaten Oliver suddenly started to feel sleepy, and before he could do or say anything else he had fallen asleep. Georgette couldn't be more happy for the moment seeing Oliver laying there motionless in front of her. It wasn't before she herself started feeling a bit heavy on her eyes that she realized that she didn't have much time before she would fall asleep herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrying Oliver's unconscious body to the second floor proved to also be something she hadn't thought about all the way through. The only way she knew how to do was to take a grip on his neck and carry him with her teeth's, with Oliver's added weight became a hard task. All the energy it took for Georgette to carry him upstairs made it much harder for Georgette to keep her eyes open, but she was determined to fulfill her plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was in Jenny's room she had to stand on her hind legs to be able to reach over the edge of the box and lower Oliver down. It was then her eyes finally gave up and she felt how everything went dark. What happen then was that since she already had half her body lowered down into the box to place Oliver there, once she lost her consciousness it made the rest of Georgette's body to fall down into the box joining Oliver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce both of the pets woke up from their sleep they found that they where both...</span></div></div>",

Furthermore, he and his fellow dogs had gotten a pardon for their past offenses as their reward for such a deed, along with being allowed to enter a special condo Fagin was rewarded along with a fortune for putting Sykes out of commission permanently, and one which was located just two blocks from Jenny's house, no less, so Oliver was easily accessible to be visited by Dodger and vice versa. Needless to say, Dodger was living a good life and was no longer a thief, as there was no need for it anymore, and the same went for his four friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThing is, though, that his new life also awakened something that Dodger knew about himself all along, but didn't acknowledge or pay attention to until now because he knew there was no point, for it was utterly out of the question for his previous kind of lifestyle. After all, when he was using the streets to survive, he had to be fit, limber and lithe, and he was, in a very attractive way, along with agile, fast, skilled and nimble. But now that he no longer needed that kind of lifestyle, and now that he lived a more serene, lazy one in which all of his food was handed to him by Fagin like it was to the other dogs, and never would they need to steal again, nor would Fagin be poor or desperate again, it was clear that he was no longer able to deny or ignore this feeling of his. He wanted to be fat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, you read right. That's what you read. Almost since he was a puppy, Dodger had secretly wanted to be as fat as possible. He had a closet dream of being New York's fattest quadruped. Sure, it was sweet being that city's coolest quadruped, but it just didn't stick to his ribs(pun intended)like being the fattest dog in the city would. He had sometimes eaten more than everyone else, though in a subtle way, since they might get suspicious and he couldn't afford that, as just thinking about his secret desire to himself was enough to make him blush, much less revealing it to those around him. But now, he had made up his mind. He would devise a way to turn himself into a corpulent blimp of a portly pooch and he would make good on that way, and subsequently reveal it to anyone and everyone he knew! He would also either keep it that way or continue to be a gainer, depending on how much fatter he'd become and what mood it put him in, along with how sexy it would cause Rita to think he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the way Dodger thought up to pull the trigger on making himself go from outstanding to obese was... </span></div></div>",

His neck also had an extra layer of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDodger walked around the city and found saw a hot dog cart. Lucky for him, no one was attending it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my lucky day.

His belly started to expand a bit from all he was eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the cart was now bone dry of hot dogs. All of them now resigned in Dodger's belly.

I really want to keep going and eat more.\" He then realized something. He still had the collar. \"Maybe I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince putting on the collar makes one gain weight, it also increase the capacity of one's stomach.

Since Dodger wanted to be as big and fat as possible, this was a win-win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Dodger got up and put the collar back on his neck. He then watch as he slowly began to bloat up again.

Dodger had now had a belly 5 times the size of a car. It was stuffed to the brim with the dog food he ate. It jiggled like jello and sloashed loudly as he started to digest.

But no one leaved such an impresion on her like when Dodgers fought against Sykes Dobermans on the subwaystation. That was for her the most unselfish, amazing and boldest thing ever. All she wanted was to tell him what he meant for her and what she saw in him. But she was to shy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when they all left and she was stuck with Oliver she wonder if she ever would see him again and be able to ever show her thanks. \"It woulnd't be must...\" She thought, \"If anything I would be happy to give him just a flower, or a box of treats...\" Just then an idea was formed in her head. She could just send him a box with treats to show her thanks, and leave it with a note that it was from her so he would know. The only problem is <u>how</u> will she be able to send it to him? Then another idea popped. It was a vague on, but it just might work. She turned to Oliver the cat and asked him if he happend to know the adress to where the dogs and Fagin lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunate for her he knew, and soon she had sent a package that just a couple of days later a reach the house boat from where they lived. Things hadn't change so much. Since saving Jenny Fagin had got a job, but you don't make monkey directly, so they knew they had too still live like this for a little while longer. and food supplies wasn't good neither. So it came like a big surprise when Dodgers walked out to see if they had got some mails for them and found the gift box from Georgette. On the gift card he got to know that the luxurious poodle actually had weak spot for him, and that all of this treats in this basket was only for <u>him</u>. Dodgers was very honored at first to get this, but them got reminded of how bad his friends was having it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas he going to be so selfish?</span></div></div>",

It's time for 8ths.\" She batted her eyes at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLost in them the 'little' dog opened up his tiny mouth just so it could be filled up by high price meat. Knowing she wasn't going to let him breath until he ate it all he gnawed furiously at the meat. Tearing and shredding it for all it was worth until he'd eaten every bite. He sighed deeply in relief before she lifted up another cut towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe panted. His stomach felt full, as it tended to nowadays. He liked the feeling don't get him wrong........but he was getting kind of sick of feeling it almost the entire day with these prolonged meal time. He'd been eating for three hours now and from what he'd heard there was only more on the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't.\" He said through bloated cheeks. \"Too Full.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved back slightly as though affronted. \"Full? Why nonsense my love.\" She said as she patted his enormous stomach \"Your not even a little sated yet. You've got much more to eat before your finished.\" She pushed the steak cut against his mouth again forcing him to start eating. \"Much, much more.\" She lay her head against his belly. He shifted about for a minute which she enjoyed since it felt like one of those massage beds, relaxing her greatly. She didn't know....or maybe didn't care that it was really him trying to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a useless action anyway. Tito couldn't leave, he couldn't move at all. He was fat, hell he wasn't fat he was obese........for a much bigger dog! He looked like a furry brown beach ball, his tiny feet stuck out uselessly from his four massively thick legs. His tiny head stuck out comically from a neck wider than his skull. He looked like someone has taken a much bigger dog and shrunk his hands and feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgette had him sitting up with his forelegs in mid air while his stomach inched forward to cover his back ones, if he ever tried getting on all fours again he would have to pray his stomach lifted his legs off the ground or else their bulk would break his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet Georgette suggested, insisted, demanded he keep getting fatter. That her living pillow grow more comfortable, more attractive to her. He learned all too late that the pampered poodle had a thing for 'big' guys. She normally wouldn't look at a male unless his stomach hung a good number of inches of him, and positively adored those whose belly's brushed the ground. She also loved nothing more than taking skinny or buff dudes (like him) and turning them into lazy lardos, which once again he learned to little to late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gasp he was rolled onto his back, his entire bulk sloshing up to his minuscule head to try and make it fly off. Georgette gave him a half lidded expression before licking his nose affectionately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMine.\u201d She whispered into his ear. She got herself comfortable again and sighed in contentment before falling asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTito groaned to himself, not knowing whether to be happy that such a gorgeous se\u00f1orita was cuddling him, or sad becasue she had him trapped like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Tito basically looks like this <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/full/10488244/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.furaffinity.net/full/10488244...</a> except bigger.

He remembered Georgette showing him around the house that was now going to be his place for living as well. Taken in by all the nice decors and furnishing Tito almost feel like he was walking around in a museum, and not in someone's home. Even more unbelievable for him was that this now was <u>his</u> home, and that he was sharing it together with such a lovely se\u00f1orita. She was really a thing of beauty. \"That's the kind of beautiful woman that could make a man do almost anything for her.\" (If he had only known how right he had been right there.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they where heading up towards Georgette's private bedroom Tito became a bit unsure. Being raised by his mother to treat other women with respect, he felt that walking into a se\u00f1orita's bedroom uninvited yould be considered rude. Seeing Tito stop outside her room Georgette asked Tito what the problem was. Tito told her about his ways about being a gentleman to her, and Georgette giggled a little telling him that it was okay for him to go in with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting inside Tito got once again amazed over how much space one dog could have for herself, and of all the things she had. Private makeup corner, Her very own wardrobe, and in the middle of the room her own bed that stood on it's very own round platform. But what caught Tito's eyes where a giant pillow that Georgette had laying in its own corner. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/aQfVXoni03I/hqdefault.jpg?feature=og\" target=\"_blank\">http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/aQfVXoni03I/hqdef...</a> It looked more soft and comfortable then anything he had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started to walk towards it, almost at a brainwashed state with his body doing it on its own. After a few step however Tito's brain began to work again and he stopped himself. \"I'm not going to just walk around acting like I own all this. This is the property of the se\u00f1orita, and she would be pleased if I started to use her stuff without her permission.\" Tito though to himself. \"Oh, What's the matter?\" Georgette asked, waking Tito up from his own thoughts. \"I-I, just wanted to try and test your pillow.\" Tito said a bit nervous, expecting the big she dog to say no and tell him to never touch any of her stuff. But to his surprise she just smiled and said \"Of course you can do that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the welcome he got Tito took and jumped onto the pillow, feeling himself almost sink into it. While feeling as relaxed as can be, a familiar female dog showed up and asked \"Are you comfortable?\" \"Oh yes, I am.\" Tito said feeling so laid back and cozy as possible. \"I think I know what would make this even more cozy for you.\" Georgette said with a bit of seduction in her voice. Getting all turned on by this Tito could not resist to ask what that would be. \"Get of that pillow for one second and I'll show you.\" Georgette said with a really sexy tone in her voice. Jumping of immediately of the pillow Georgette took and let herself fall back onto it. Seeing this giant beauty spreading herself out was real eye candy for Tito. After getting herself comfortable Georgette invites Tito back with her paws. Pointing at her own body Tito stops for a second, looking up towards her face just to be sure he's not mistaken. Smiling to him Georgette says that there's no problems, and that he's welcome to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the pillow towards the middle Tito can't help but think that he must be dreaming. He's going to share a pillow together with possibly on of the most beautiful women he's ever seen. Once there Georgette points to her stomach and chest area, and asks Tito to lay on top there. Not waisting a second Tito lays himself on top of her, and it feels so much more softer and warmer then the pillow. \"So how does <u>that</u> feel?\" Georgette asks, seeing that the little dog is really enjoying it. \"It feels soo much more amazing that it's insane! You are the best pillow I've ever felt.\" \"Thanks, Its really my pleasure to see you enjoying it soo much.\" Georgette said blushing slightly about the compliment. \"I only wish that I to could get to feel the same things your feeling right now.\" Georgette said to Tito with a bit sadness in her voice. \"Georgette my dear, If I could I would wish to make myself the best pillow you have ever seen.\" Tito said to comfort her. (He would regret soo much about saying that to her if he had known what that would lead to.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking the wonderful mood that they had Georgette asked if Tito was hungry. Feeling a little hungry Tito said, \"Yeah, maybe a little snacks would be nice.\" \"Well, then I think you are going to like this,\" Georgette said getting of the pillow, leaving Tito still laying in it. \"You have gotten a chance to test my house and my pillow, now I think is the time for you to test some of my food.\" Georgette said, and took out a can of dog food and a spoon. Getting the tap of she put the spoon inside and scooped out a nice spoonful. \"Once you have tried my meat, you wouldn't want to stop eating it at all.\" Georgette said, with a bit of an evil undertone in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould Tito understand that hint?</span></div></div>",

It had either been raw, undercooked, overcooked, or almost non-edible moldy for this poor dog and his friends. But now he had in his mouth this wonderfully tasting treat of food. The sheer richness of it's taste and it's loose content litearlly made it melt in his mouth. Spreading himself out over the giant pillow Tito could feel how his whole body was getting much more softer and relaxed by this single spoonful. It was almost like he was in a coma like state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the expected reaction of Tito Georgette smiled knowing that things would be going exactly as planned. \"If this is how he feels after just one spoonful, then this is going to be easier then I thought.\" Georgette thought diabolically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Tito getting back from his minor food coma Georgette made sure to prepare another spoonful for him. \"Unh, What happen?\" Tito asked feeling a bit hangover over the sudden super relaxed feeling. \"Oh, I just let you taste on some of my private own dog food. Did you like it?\" Georgette asked while pretending to be completely unaware of what had happen. \"It was...the best thing I ever been eating.\" Tito said sounding a bit stoned. \"Then I guess you wont stop to eat another one?\" Georgette asked while trying to sound as dim as typical beauty model would sound. (This was all a part of her plan to make Tito feel like he was the one with the upperhand.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so...\" Tito said trying to understand why Georgette was actiong so weird. \"Then open up and I'll feed you.\" Georgette said happily and started to feed Tito a second spoonful. Tasting, chewing, and swallowing the second spoonful made Tito feel this wonderful effects again, and now they felt really addicting and he wanted more of it. \"Do you want more food?\" Georgette was asking. \"Yes, give me more food!\" Tito shouted in a very numb voice. \"As you wish dear.\" Georgette said playfully as she gave him his third spoon almost directly after his second one. The lead to the wonderful feeling inside Tito being twice as powerful, and he wanted even more of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued being feed spoon after spoon after spoon, until the whole can was emptied. \"More food! Give me more food!\" Tito shouted from the pillow while rubbing his slightly bulged belly. Having been getting more and more food to eat had made him think more and more that <u>he</u> was the man in the house now and could have whatever he wanted, and he wanted food..lots of it. Reaching inside the can Georgette found it to be empty. \"FOOD!\" Tito shouted. \"I hear you but the can is empty. I will have to go down to the kitchen to get another one.\" Georgette said as she was heading out the door. \"Make sure to be quick woman!\" Tito shouted to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting down to the kitchen Georgette felt furious inside. \"That little pup has some nerves. Just let him pretend being in charge for a moment and <i>then</i> he shows his true colours. But just you wait, when I'm done with you, you will regret not being nicer to me when you had the chance.\" Georgette thought as the grabbed a new can and headed back up. Once back she feed him the whole other can before Tito was feeling full. \"Satisfied?\" Georgette asked trying to really sound dreamy when asking. \"Yeah, that was great. You are the best woman ever.\" Tito said trying badly to pretend to sound charming while rubbing his now fully bloated belly, that was about the size of Tito himself before eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Tito relaxing on her pillow with a potbelly of a pig Georgette had to try hard to not get tempted and eat him. \"He's soo bad at hiding his true feelings that it's almost sad, but lets just see how long time it takes before he realizes that he has just been used this whole time?\" Georgette think to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow long would it take for Tito see that something is up?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This acting of Georgette pretending to be Tito's faithful servant while feeding him constantly went on for two months.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring this time Tito was growing larger and larger by all the eating. He wasn't that big of an immobile blob like he was in the present, but his movement in his les where starting to get pretty limited. He would much more prefer sitting or laying down then standing up and having to support his body, and if he was forced to walk he would probably only get a couple of yards before getting tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with his weight getting bigger so was also his ego. The fact that he had all this food to eat, and beautiful woman serving him it made him feel like he was some kind big shot of the mobster world that had everything and could get anything he wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Georgette this pretending was only getting her patience more and more thin. Tito's growing arrogant attitude that he had was really putting a test on her. Sometimes she felt like she just wanted to throw the fat sack of lard that he was out on the street and leave him there, but then another thought entered her head. \"He was playing the role as the dominate one of the two, but soon those roles might get reversed.\"  she thought, and smiled by the thought of overthrowing her husband as the ruler of the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one more feeding before telling him news\" Georgette thought as she entered the bedroom where Tito was taking up a big part of it with his weight. \"There you are woman!\" Tito said, having to started calling Georgette nothing else but \"woman\" ever since his greed raised a certain level. \"Yes dear?\" Georgette asked with her teethes clenched, trying to keep her cool. \"I'm hungry, feed me!\" The very fat Tito shouted, leaving his mouth open for Georgette to put food into it. \"You used to be such a loving husband, and now you're this...pig!\" Georgette thought as she started to hand feed him huge pieces of meat for him to chew and swallow. \"But just you wait. After this feeding <b>you</b> will be the one having to follow orders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she was done feeding him Tito had a very stuffed and bloated middle, and would be very hard to move on his own when laying on his back like he did. Now would be the right moment for Georgette. \"Tito my dear?\" She said nicely, trying to give him one last chance to be nice to her. \"What do you want you old bat?\" Tito asked nonchalant, trying to sleep after his eating. That was a mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad he paid any attention to who his wife was he would have known that under <u>no</u> circumstances would you ever call Georgette old! Especially not when she was about to do what she was about to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoing from \"pretending to be nice\" to \"more furious then a bull seeing a red cape\" Georgette dropped the act and dropped one of her paws on the recently feed Tito's belly. \"Ouch!!!\" Tito shouted, felling the paw press down with really powerful force onto his sensitive spot. \"What are you doing?...\" Tito asked wit hpain in his voice before Georgette took over the conversation with full force. \"You listen here!\" She shouted, \"I have been nothing but nice to you and feed you and petting you and doing pretty much everything else for you, and how do you repay me? By acting like a big fat pig, just eating and slobbering all day while I do everything else in the house! And that I can live with, but I'm tired of your new attitude. Always calling me <i>woman</i> when you know, my, name!\" (During that part she repeatedly stepped her paw on his stomach to make her point.) \"But all that will change now and do you know why?\" She asked him, getting a scared head shake for a \"no\" back from him. \"Because <b>I'm</b> now the one in charge now, and you will from now on only say <i>yes dear</i> when I speak to you. Is that understood?\" She asked, staring him in the eyes threateningly. Fearing what she would do Tito quickly said \"Yes Dear.\" back to her. \"Good.\" She said, taking her paw of his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Tito was clutching his soar middle Georgette continue telling him the new rules. Everything from how she was still going to feed him regularly and how he now was going to have a scheme to follow for how many times a day and how much he would be consuming. How he would treat her with respect each time he talked to her if he didn't want to be forced to eat even more as punishment, and how as time goes one he would have to be prepared to take in even larger amounts of food as his body would grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of this sounded like something from a nightmare to Tito. The dog he used to love so much had now gone crazy with wanting to fattening him up, and he only had himself to blame for making it end up so. Given his body he wouldn't either be able to put up much of a fight or resist her forcing the food down to him, so there wasn't much of plan to work around. \"Oh, and I almost forgot.\" Georgette said, brining Tito out of his own thoughts. \"Since it's so late right now I suggest we both have a good night sleep, and then the next day we start the first day of your new life.\" Georgette said before leaving the bedroom. \"You can have the bed for yourself dear, it will be the last night so spend in it while being so <i>skinny</i>.\" She said jokingly, before closing the door and going downstairs to sleep on the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot of thoughts flew around in Tito's head at the moment. \"Should I try escaping the house during the night and flee? But where you I go? Think if Georgette catches me in the act and punishes me? Maybe I should just give in, and let her have her way?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich side of his debate wins?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(This takes place before the movie) Tito wasn\u2019t doing anything. He was just lying on the floor like the rest of his friends waiting. This was one of those days when it just wasn\u2019t anything to do. As he was resting he could feel his stomach starting to growl. He remembers Dodger saying before he left the houseboat that he was going to get out and try to get some food. \u201cI hope he\u00b4s back soon.\u201d Tito thought trying to calm his roaring stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a convenience Dodger was back just at that moment throwing a bunch of hotdogs onto the floor. \u201cHere\u00b4s the grub!\u201d he said. Immediately Tito and the other dog where on their way to just dive into their meals when Dodger stopped them. \u201cTake it easy.\u201d He said, \u201cLet\u00b4s first take and try to share these fair.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was eight hotdogs that they where going to share fairly. Einstein got three because he was much bigger then the rest and had to eat more. Francis also being a very big dog (but his friends would say that he is more round then tall) got two to eat. This leaves Dodger, Rita and Tito with only three hotdogs. At first it looked like they where all going to get one hotdog each. But suddenly to Tito\u00b4s surprise Dodger took one fourth of his hotdog and that to Rita. He then took another fourth and eat that himself. Leaving Tito with only a half hotdog to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he munched his little half Tito thought of all the time when they got food and Dodger had to have his little \u201cSharing fair\u201d thing. The only thing he saw with this was an excuse for the others to take away most of his food. \u201cJust because I\u00b4m the smallest doesn\u2019t mean that I have the smallest hunger.\u201d Tito thought. \u201cI to could be hungry, really hungry. I could actually be the hungriest dog of them all, but just because I don\u2019t look like I wouldn\u2019t need much to get filled up doesn\u2019t mean it\u00b4s true. All my life it has been so, but no more. I\u00b4m going for once to be the dog that will get to have a proper meal just one time, no matter how!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that he broke his silent he usually ha when eating and said to Dodger. \u201cI have had enough now!\u201d \u201cEnough of what?\u201d was Dodgers surprised answer. \u201cTo always get nothing because of my size!\u201d Tito said and pointed at the very little piece of hotdog that was his meal. \u201cBut you must realise that we are very limited to food.\u201d Rita commented. \u201cThat\u00b4s no excuse!\u201d Tito said. \u201cJust because I\u00b4m little doesn\u2019t mean that my appetiser is small to. I need to have just as much to eat as anyone of you.\u201d \u201cBut I can only trick this much from Hotdog Louie.\u201d Dodger said. \u201cSo what are you going to do?\u201d Francis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTito\u00b4s answer was \u201cI\u00b4m going to\u2026</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been three weeks since Sykes and his two demonic dobermans had kicked the bucket, and things had gotten a lot better since then in many ways for NYC(no surprise there, seeing as how Sykes was a real monster and so were his two attack dogs he raised to be like him). Anyway, though there were some good zeniths reached, like how Fagin was able to get a real job and an apartment to live in along with his dogs, plus their part in bringing Sykes down made it so they were vindicated from all past thefts as long as Fagin promised neither he nor any one of his dogs would ever steal again(which he promptly did and made sure his dogs did, as well). Along with how said apartment was in a building right next door to Jenny's mansion. And, of course, how Oliver had grown on Georgette and she was much nicer to him than she'd been initially, and he was glad they were at last friends, and, in a loose sense, sort of siblings, since he just wanted to be her friend from the start, being the sweet, lovable and innocent kitten he was. That, and Dodger and Rita had fallen in love, and Tito had apologized to Georgette and vice versa, reconciling their relationship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the biggest milestone of all? Georgette was able to admit her feelings(at least just to Oliver, anyway)of how she was really tired of always having to be perfect and keep the way she looked in check, and it was depressing to always have to look the best possible way she could and live rigidly and strictly. And winning all those 1st place awards, trophies, oooohs and aaaaaahs and the like? It was no fun anymore, especially since it had gotten to be repetitive even for her. Oliver, being as sweet, caring and understanding as he was, sympathized with the poodle and thought up the perfect idea to make things better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So who says you have to continue with all those shows? Your room's already filled with trophies, and they actually said on the news recently, as I heard Jenny's parents talking about, that you were an everlasting champion on those shows and deserved a free life, and thus were being allowed to drop out and always be looked at as # 1 no matter what, and regardless of how you chose to shape your future! That you helped put a stop to Sykes only added to how well deserved such a nice break for you was!\" \"Yes, Oliver,\" Georgette acknowledged, \"but the problem is I don't know what to do now! The purpose I've now quit has been my purpose for years, and I know of no other ways of life! It's like I've hit a dead end, or at the very least a wall, and a high one, at that!\" \"Well, not anymore, because I'm going to show you just how fun it is to live softly and be able to afford such a nice life on easy street!\" Oliver smiled as he winked at her. Georgette was a bit surprised, especially with how excited his tone was, but she could tell this was the best bet she was likely to get for the rest of her life, so she went along with Oliver's idea. She and her kitten pal made their way into the kitchen, and the latter said: \"Okay, you've always kept yourself so thin and twiglike. And I've been thin for my whole life, to this day, even as we now both have a better one. Sure, it's for different reasons entirely, but don't you think we could both use some food and, for that matter, some weight? Especially since this kind of life doesn't require you to do much except laze around?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgette, as soon as she heard this, opened her eyes widely, for the realization of what Oliver was saying hit her like the C-Train in the subway of the city she lived in. \"Are you suggesting we turn ourselves into fat, inert, overly-contented, gluttonous fur blobs?\" \"Basically, but more along the lines of gainers. Think about all those foods you've always wanted to eat, but known you couldn't. Not to mention how I've always wondered what they're like, but never got the chance for them. Well, today, since Jenny's at school, Winston is on a trip to a wrestling match he has tickets for a seat in the audience of and both of Jenny's parents are on a business trip, that means we have the whole house to ourselves and this could be the once in a lifetime opportunity we get to eat as much junk food, gain as much weight and live as much of a soft, lazy, relaxed, happy life as we possibly can. Won't it be fun to pile on the pounds?\" Oliver responded, and this last bit of his coaxing did the trick. Realizing what she wanted, and knowing how strange this felt after years of being Miss Six Times National Champion and a perfect princess of a pencil thin poodle, Georgette got herself under control and was able to deal with how weird this far cry from her former self she was going to become was, and said: \"All right, Oliver, how do we make ourselves go from cadaverous to corpulent? What do we eat?\" \"What don't we eat? But we've got to start somewhere.\" Oliver answered. \"Hey, I know! How about...\"   </span></div></div>",

Then like clark kent always did in the superman comics dodger quickly went into a phonebooth and thus became superdog and gathered his team. All right guys you know what to do, we have to stop georgette from devouring all of new york city and possibly the world.

This is jarring beyond words, but we need to try and find a way to figure out what happened here, both concerning how we got here so suddenly and how we got this obese, neither of which have any apparent explanation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"E-E-E-E-EASY FOR YOU T-T-T-T-TO SAY...\" Georgette replied, on the verge of falling apart and becoming catatonic. \"Y-Y-Y-YOU AREN'T THE ONE WHO NEEDS TO M-M-M-M-MAINTAIN HER PERFECTION E-E-E-E-EACH DAY...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SAID STOP FREAKING OUT AND DON'T HAVE A BREAKDOWN!\" Rita boomed, silencing Georgette and suddenly causing her losing it to cease, at least for the time being. \"We have to look for a way to, A, get home, since, unless they're still asleep, our respective friends and owners are undoubtedly worried sick about us, B, look for an answer to what caused all of this and, C, do something to solve the problem and undo everything that's been done here. So the last thing we need is to make it worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're...you're right, Rita.\" Georgette nodded, realizing how the saluki's words were indeed accurate. \"It's just...I never thought I'd see anything the least bit remotely like this even in my worst of nightmares. But yeah, going nuts isn't going to solve anything. First thing's first, though. How are we going to stand up again, and even if we do, how will we be able to move?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both very good questions.\" Rita said. \"Fortunately, I'm sufficiently smart to find a way for us to do both, though this will, fair warning, cause you to think I'm insane.\" Georgette nodded, and Rita continued: \"We push and suck our guts in as much as possible, then we use what strength we've got left in our current conditions to thrust ourselves up and stand on our hind legs, which means we'll have to use our forelegs and forepaws as arms and hands, respectively. I know, I know. Crazy idea. But it's either that or being immobile and literally getting nowhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgette sighed, once more unable to deny how right Rita was, and then said: \"Okay, are we doing this on the count of three?\" Rita nodded and said: \"Yes, because that's the way to do it that stands the greatest chance of success. I'll do the counting. Ready?\" \"Ready.\" Georgette said, and Rita told her: \"One, two, three!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sucked their guts in with all their might along with using their forelegs and forepaws to push them in and hold them in(or at least do so to what they could of them, anyway)and pushed their hind legs and hindpaws up, also with as much strength as they could, and it proved just enough so that they were standing again before they had to let go of their giant bellies and let them spill out again, though thankfully they made sure to do so slowly so that they wouldn't fall over, given how much effort this all took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what do you know? It worked!\" Georgette said. \"I hate to admit it, but this was a great idea, Rita, as crazy as it was.\" \"See? What did I tell you?\" Rita said, and then she told Georgette: \"Okay, next of all, we can move now, but unlike how we were able to move previously, we'll be moving almost as slow as it's possible for anyone and/or anything to move. So it's going to take us quite a while to get anywhere, both figuratively and literally. In other words, keep it together. Because otherwise there'll be more problems, and I don't think you want any of those any more than I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Rita, of course not!\" Georgette confirmed. \"Well, you know these streets better than I do, so lead the way.\" Rita informed her: \"Just what I was thinking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo they got going, and to their surprise, they discovered...</span></div></div>",

This started to take hard on Rita's body. She felt weaker and started almost to look like skin and bones on some places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring walks in town she had started to see that some of the riche male dogs had started to flirt with her. She had got some panting and some barks that on dog languages mean things like \u201dHey there pretty. Why don\u2019t you hang with guys like us? \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first she just ignored their comments. But as her hunger become bigger she started to come up with a plan. If those dogs think that she is so attractive, then she is going to use that to her advantage. Her plan was to seduce the rich dogs to share some of their food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day when Fagin was out trying to sell some junk and the other dogs busy fixing food Rita saw her chance. She went alone to the rich dogs neighbourhood. She stopped at the first house on the block and started to test her plan. First she gave a whistle to get the dog\u2019s attention. When he looked out of a window he saw Rita seducing. She gave little winks and kisses that worked better than she could ever believe. The male dog was so charmed by her flirting that he was more than eager to help her when she asked if there was some food she could have.  He invited her in and shared some of his dog-food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter having a bigger portion of food that Rita had have for a long time, she asked if she could have some in a trash bag to take with her.  The dog was a bit confused why she wanted to have it in a trash bag, but if that what she wants then that\u2019s what\u2019s she gets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne her way home she started to take a look on herself. She saw that all that eating showed it\u00b4s sings. Her belly had grown a bit and was wiggling a little to her movements. She just hopes that the other dogs don\u2019t see it when she comes home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she returned to the Houseboat she found that the other hadn\u2019t been so lucky finding food. So when Rita unwrapped he trash bag and showed them the food they where happy at first, Eating like crazy, Except Rita how was still felling full from her huge meal. But then Tito asked where she found it witch made all the other dogs to stop and looked at Rita wondering that to. It wasn\u2019t just likely to find so much food. \u201cI-I\u00b4ll was lucky. I\u00b4ll found it in a trashcan outside one of those houses in the rich district. Y-You know how wasteful the people who lives there is.\u201d Rita said and tried to look convincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily her friends bought it and didn\u2019t notice that her belly was a little bigger, they where just happy to have a meal that made all of them fairly feed. This made Rita wonder if she should do it again? This way she could always be sure to get more food to eat then she could eat, and give her friends some to feed them to. The problem was for how long can she trick them to not discover the truth?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas it worth the risks? </span></div></div>",

To get a chance after a life of starving to pig herself out and pack those pounds. She had hold those thoughts back because of the fear of being banished by her friends for lying.

Tomorrow Rita was going see how much she could eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were five rich dogs living on the blocks. Hans, Brad, Erik, Walt and John. Rita was going to visit them all and get herself stuffed at every house. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one to visit was Hans a Scottish terrier.  Being a bit of an (Excuse pun) old dog, He was easy as usual to seduce. Her slim figure and beautiful face could make him do what ever she wanted to.  Once inside she started to eat. Rita had learnt because of her many visiting\u2019s what kind of dog-food each dog have. Hans\u2019s dog-food was pretty good and filling. Nothing amazing compared to the food she was going to eat at the other dogs, but good for a start. When she had eaten enough she took like she used to do some rests in a bag and walked of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter visiting a dog she took a walk around the block to make it look like for the dog she just been at that she was leaving. When she comes back she hide the bag with food in a bush before she started to go to the next house. Taking a look at herself she could see that she had a little full stomach. She felt like she could go on about a half day before she hungry again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second dog to visit was Brad. While Hans was an old little dog, Brad was a big, young and strong Doberman. He and Rita was in about same age and when Rita had seen him flirting her, she to felt a little something to him. Being a heavily training dog he had dog-food that was healthier and just okay in taste. To get the result that she wanted Rita had to eat much more then what was the normal portion. Brad started to wonder if Rita had have enough when he saw that her belly started to get big and hanging. Rita answered that she could take the rest of the food with her and eat later and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring her walk around the block she thought that her plan was near to fall. Brad got suspicious and it was near that she could have been forced to tell the truth. She would rather die then letting anyone know. While hiding the other sack she saw that her belly looked rather full now. She could feel how it was starting to stretch her skin because she had never been so full before, and it even started to become heavy and weight her down. She was wondering how she was going to get in to the other three dogs house looking like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ranged on the door to the house of the third dog Erik. Erik was a Golden Retriever boy, who looked to be about the same age as Rita. He was just the handsome looking dog that a lot of girl dogs wanted to be with. While waiting for Erik to open the door, Rita was trying to pull in her stomach. But she was so full that it wouldn\u2019t move in. When Erik opened the door Rita was frozen for a moment. Her little plan on eating from all of the dogs could be destroyed if Erik finds out. But before she could come up with an explanation to her state Erik said, \u201cMy god! Since when did you get with pups?\u201d It was just like Erik just had given her the perfect excuse to tell him. Given herself a quick look she realized that she actually looked pregnant. \u201cWell, about a week ago. It was that long since we saw each other?\u201d Rita asked. \u201cYeah, but I don\u2019t remember that we ever did \u201cthat\u201d together.\u201d Erik said looking a bit nervous while he was staring at Rita\u2019s belly. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. I forgot to tell that I know the father to these kids.\u201d Rita lied while giving a little giggle to Erik for his reaction of thinking he was suddenly a father. \u201cSo why are you here?\u201d Erik asked. \u201cWell, we have it a bit rough right now with food. So I was just cheeking if a certain dog could provided with food for my little baby\u2019s.\u201d Rita said and gave her tummy a little clap.  \u201cOf course.\u201d Erik said and let her in. Erik\u2019s food was just like him very sweet.  Rita had some trouble eating at first seeing that her belly was stretches not by puppies, but of already eaten food. But to keep it a secret for Erik Rita forced herself to eat almost all of the food that she usually gets when eating at home of Erik.  She took a bag of food that she said was to her husband at home (Which was a lie) before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was going to leave the third bag with the rest she thought about how she was felling right now. She felt overfull and, had a belly that looked like she was 3 weeks pregnant. Her stomach made a lot of sounds when it was trying to digest all the food she had eaten.  Rita was wondering f she could take any more, and if she could keep the truth hidden?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should she do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If she had decided that she was going to do this, then she was going to do it.  She started to walk up the little staircase to the house. Even if it just was four steps Rita saw that it became a bit hard for her to walk up because of her belly heaving her down. Thing didn\u2019t get better when Walt (A Great Dane) opened the door and when Rita was going to say hello she instead accidently gave a little burp. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d Walt said. \u201cJust a little snack I had before getting here.\u201d Rita said trying to look convincing. \u201cI have to eat a lot since I\u2019ve got these.\u201d Rita said and pointed to her bloated stomach. To her delight she saw how Walt looked at her stomach and seemed to fell for it. \u201cBut wasn\u2019t it just a week since we saw each other last?\u201d Walt asked. \u201cWell you know, when kids come they grow at a fast spurt.\u201d Rita said to him. Walt decided to trust Rita\u2019s words since he, as a male didn\u2019t know how it was to have kids. So after righting that out Walt invited Rita to help her feed (What he thought it was) her puppies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing a Great Dane his food was big to match his size. They were big both in size and in amount of calories. Just one bit was like small boulder in her paw, and it felt like it weight a half-pound. When she had eaten with him before, he had usually been the one were she had been eating least food from. This was because his food was so big that Rita simply couldn\u2019t eat much. Now she was almost forced by Walt to eat more then usual for the sake of her \u201cpuppies\u201d. Rita was starting to regret the whole pregnancy thing. For every bit that she ate, she could feel how her already bloated and heaving stomach just became heavier and crowded by all the extra food. The whole feeling of overeating had gone from pleasure to a bit painful. She started to wonder if she would physically be able to eat all the food that the last dog John would give her when she visits him? Or if she was going too able too just finish Walt\u2019s food? After what felt like an eternity she was finally done eating\u2026 for now. She took a quick look at her stomach. It was so round that it looked like her \u201cpuppies\u201d was almost ready to be born.  Rita felt much more heavy to. By now she felt like she had 80 pounds of dog-food in her belly. While she was taken her bag with rest to go Walt asked another suspicious question. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it look a bit to big to be pups?\u201d \u201cWell\u201d Rita said, \u201cIt puppies and food in it now.\u201d Like all the other lies Rita had told him he bought this one too. So Rita said goodbye to Walt and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last dog Rita had to see was John. John is a pug, and a very overweight one for that matter. He had lots of thick chins in his face, a flabby chest, wide legs and an enormous belly to match the rest of his body. He seemed to weight around 200 pounds. He had always been the easiest one to get in to because he seemed to be in love with Rita, and she herself had started to feel a little for him. She seemed to have something for guys with extra weight. When she had been eating at his place it always seemed like he was trying to do something to her. His food was always very fattening, and he tried every time to give more food when she said that she felt full. It looked like he was trying to make her fatter, to have her as his overweight girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Rita was climbing the staircase like it was a mountain, she though about if it was any chance that he could fool John in that she was pregnant. (Because her belly looked like she had 20 that where one years old.) John hadn\u2019t done more than open the door before Rita saw in the way he looked at her belly and then in her eyes that he saw that she was stuffed with food. Without any idea of how to explain John suddenly said, \u201cSo you finally decided to become a gainer?\u201d Rita answered quickly  \u201cYes!\u201d (It was some true. She wanted to eat herself fat, but not for him. But it seems like better then tell the truth right now.) Well inside John started to give Rita some of his food to eat. His food was like you could guess very high in fat and calories. But it was also very addictive. It could make a dog with a weak mind completely dependent to continuing eating until there's no more food left. It wasn\u2019t the best food to have to last, because Rita know that it tastes delicious but was very hard to quit eating from, and right now her stomach felt like it was about to explode of all the food that was eaten. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still managed to eat a good deal of food. Very little compared to how much she could eat at John before mentally stopping herself. This time it was because her body simply couldn\u2019t manage to eat one more bit. She had lay on her back to make pain feel less. Her belly bloated out like balloon. She could also feel with her paws how stretched her skin was. It felt like a drum. It was so thin that thanks to the lights in the house she could see silhouettes of the food that she had eaten. It felt like it weight more then she did at the beginning of this journey. John couldn\u2019t help but to touch her massive bulk. Rita moaned when she felt John\u2019s paw press her. John apologise and said that he knows a massage that he used to do on himself when he had eaten to much, and started to give it to Rita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita wasn\u2019t sure what to do. On one paw she knew that she had to go back to her friends with the food she had been collecting from all the dogs. But on the other paw she felt so stuffed and in a real need of a rest. She had John by her side that gave a massage and some good company. But she couldn\u2019t just leave her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm sorry, but I really have to go!\u201d Rita said while trying to get up. After a few tries she found that with her enormous belly it was impossible on her own. She asked John if he could help her get up. John was split for a moment about what to do. On one paw he knew that he now had the dog he secretly loves lying helpless, a situation that he know never would come again. On the other paw he knew that if he really loves her he should respect her and let her do what she wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was he going to do?</span></div></div>",

But with her added weight it would become almost three times longer trip for her to walk. Not only because all that she had eaten would slow her pace and make her do a lot of breaks, but because of detours she would have to take to not risk to meet any other dogs or dogcatchers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer long journey took her trough streets, parks, and docks. Her added weight had actually helped her give her a new look at the city that she had never thought of before, the felling of the ground. With her belly being in constant contact with the ground she could almost know just were she was just by felling the ground with her belly. Her paws weren\u2019t as sensitive being that they had been shaped to be able to walk on all sorts of terrains. Her belly's contact with the ground was like the fingers of a blind person reading braille.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo as she walked her belly got to feel wide variations of surfaces. She got to know that resting your overfull stomach on concrete plates that got heated up by the sun was a good way to helping your digestion of the food. To having it covered in mud from a mud pool in a park was like giving it a pleasant massage, and that the slippery planks on the docks actually made it easier for her to drag both her heavy belly and bags of food. Next time she stuffs herself so it hurts, she now knows to go to some of these places to make her stomach fell better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was almost at the end of her walk she checked with herself one more time about the false story to tell the gang for why she had been gone for all day. As she went it through in her head she thought that it should work. As she was getting down into the houseboat she saw that all of the gang had heard her when she was dragging all the bags down. They all looked shocked at first of what they saw, then Dodger took and asked, \u201cWhat has happened to you and where did all this food come from?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Rita said, \u201cYou know that I lately had found a lot of food in the dumpster that belongs to the rich dogs?\u201d Everybody in the gang nodded. \u201cWell I got curious about where all that food they throw away went, so I followed the garbage truck that took care of their food. It lead me to a special garbage dump somewhere outside of town. It had only throwaway food, I first though that I was in heaven. I'll ate and ate all that I could eat. Then I knew that I couldn\u2019t just be selfish and only let myself have this, so I packed five garbage bags (that I just happened to find) full with all kinds of food that there was. When I was on my way to get out some of the workers on the dump found me and tried to capture me. I rust all I could with the bags to get out and get back home. I succeeded to escape them but it was so rough to run in my current state that I collapsed when I knew I was safe, and when I woke up I didn\u2019t know where I was or where the dump was. After a while if got into town and then I found my way back home with the food.\u201d Rita said and hoped that she sounded convincing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would the gang think?</span></div></div>",

After much nervousness Rita could finally feel safe when she heard Dodger say \u201cIt\u00b4s a good thing that you are still alive. Just promise that next time you tell us so you are not doing dangerous things by yourself.\u201d Rita was almost near to blow it for herself by looking a little glad while Dodger said this, but she quickly realized what she was doing and made sure too keep to the act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Dodger had told Rita what to do next time she thought about going out on a risky adventure, it was time for a feast! All the dogs (Except Rita who was still a bit full after all her eating) started to gorge themselves with all kinds of different foods that Rita had fixed them. For all the dogs this was an ones in a lifetime experience, to for the first in a long time to really eat to your own limits. As Rita was laying aside and watch she could see how all the dogs she lives with were really happy. It felt a bit hard inside to know that there was dogs that had more food then they could eat before there lives ends, and that there was dogs like Rita and the gang that was living in poverty. She wished that there were something that she could do to make thing fairer between dogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she was laying and thinking about her secret life and the possibilities she has to make things better she didn\u00b4t notice Dodger walking up to her. It wasn\u2019t before she notices something casting a shadow over her that she looked up. She saw that it was Dodger, and then she saw something different about him. He had a little belly hanging. She must have been daydreaming for long time because when she looked around she could see that all of the other dogs had been eaten a lot. Dodger had been stuffing himself enough to give himself a little potbelly when all of the food was digested. Francis laid on the his back felling really bloated, and no wonder he had eaten so much that his belly was stretch out and rounded. It sounds clich\u00e9 to say but his belly really looked like an inflated beach ball. Just as round and big and with a skin almost as tight. Even Einstein who was the biggest in size had succeeded in eating too much. His belly (that was the one highest from the ground being that he is the tallest) was almost touching the ground, and swaying a little with every move he made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDodger laid himself next to Rita to make it more comfortable. Then all of a sudden they heard Tito\u00b4s voice saying \u201cJust look at you to fatty lovers!\u201d As Rita and Dodger looked at him they saw that he wasn\u2019t any skin and bones himself, he was actually the fattest of them all. Being that he was the smallest it didn\u2019t take much food to stuff him. His belly was so big and round that it lifted him from the ground, and the only way for him to move was to lean on his hind legs and push the rest of his body. \u201cHey Rita\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you eat anything since you came back. Are you not in shape for a little eating contest?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis shouting of a challenge to Rita had got the other dogs attention. They seemed interested in this thing and were starting to make bets to eats other. Rita was a bit unsure a first if she should this. Her stomach had been in pain all day for being stuffed and moved all the time, and she felt that the time she spent laying next to Dodger was really relaxing. But at the same time most she didn\u2019t want to disappoint the other dogs that really wanted to see this eating battle. When she thought about it, it seemed that it would be an easy match also. Being that she had been resting while Tito had been eating like crazy, and that whit Tito being the smaller dog it didn\u2019t seemed like Rita had to eat much to win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will she chose?</span></div></div>",

Let\u2019s do this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the other dogs had cheered her a little for her participation they started to prepare for the eating duel. Dodger and Einstein took a table and started to fill dog bowls with food. To make it easy for Francis (who almost couldn\u2019t move because of his overfull gullet) to see they took and put the table besides him so he didn\u2019t have to try look over his mountain of a stomach to see. Rita and Tito place themselves in positions and waited for the signal to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA \u201cDong\u201d sound from an old saucepan beaten by Dodger became the start signal. Rita took an easy start while Tito took and stuffed himself like crazy from the start. When she was only halfway done with her first bowl Tito had already started on his second. Rita started to eat a bit faster now knowing that even if Tito would be finished soon, she at least wanted to be equal in mass of food that had been eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the third bowl Rita started too feel a little packed again. She could feel how her stomach started to get a little full. She looked over at Tito who still ate as wild like he had from the start. \u201cIf he\u00b4s not going to stop soon I\u00b4ll think his body is going to do it for him.\u201d Rita thought while looking at him. And she was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating four bowls of high calories and high fattening dog food Tito showed no sings of stopping. But when he was going to start on his fifth something was wrong. He couldn\u2019t bend forward to eat from the bowl. Looking down to see why chocked him a little. His belly had expanded so much that none of his legs was touching the ground! He couldn\u2019t make any contact with the ground with any of his legs how much he tried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe contest had to stop for a moment to see what\u2019s to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, is Tito finished?\u201d Einstein asked.<br>\r\n\u201cNo way man! I can still eat much more!\u201d Tito yelled.<br>\r\n\u201cSo what does we do then?\u201d Rita asked.<br>\r\n\u201cI think someone has to help feed Tito.\u201d Dodger said.<br>\r\n\u201cOk, fine. But who would do it?\u201d Tito asked.<br>\r\n\u201cI can do it.\u201d Einstein said.<br>\r\n\u201cOk, lets start this contest again and start feed me.\u201d Tito said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDodger bonked the saucepan again and the contest had started again. While Rita started now to eat faster then before, Tito was in a slower pace because of Einstein\u00b4s feeding. \u201cCome on man! Your making me lose!\u201d Tito yelled.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u00b4m sorry. I\u00b4m just trying to be careful and not risking you choke anything.\u201d Einstein said.<br>\r\n\u201cDude, It an Eating Contest! The whole thing with it is to eat as much you can in the smallest time.\u201d Tito said.<br>\r\n\u201cOh.\u201d Einstein said finally understanding what an eating contest was about.<br>\r\n\u201cSo you want me to give you the food quicker?\u201d Einstein asked.<br>\r\n\u201cYes! As fast as you can! I don\u00b4t wanna lose!\u201d Tito yelled, angry over that Rita was on her way to take the lead.<br>\r\n\u201cOk, but don\u00b4t say I didn\u00b4t warn you.\u201d Einstein said and started to hand over food as fast as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was actually as he tried to warn Tito much faster then anyone believed. He started to go just faster and faster. So fast in fact that Tito didn\u00b4t had a chance to actually chew some of the food, and was starting to swallow large bits of whole food. During the break for filling the bowls for round eight Tito got a chance to talk to Einstein. He said that while making him swallow whole pieces was a way to empty the bowl quicker, it also made it harder for his stomach to get room for more food because the bigger food was taking longer to digest. He asked Einstein if there was any \u201cmiddle\u201d pace he could hold? Einstein answered that he was going to see if he could find some for the next round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the break Rita had something to say to Dodger who was referee for the match. \u201cI think this is unfair.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is unfair?\u201d Dodger asked.<br>\r\n\u201cWith someone to help feed Tito he has no problem to finish his round. He get eating much quicker then I possibly can.\u201d Rita explained.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I think I know a solution to that.\u201d Dodger said while giving a little smirk at Rita.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u00b4s that?\u201d Rita asked.<br>\r\n\u201cI\u00b4ll be feeding you.\u201d Dodger said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo with the help of each feeder who will win the contest?</span></div></div>",

Rita\u00b4s belly was in \u201cHalfway pregnant\u201d stage, while Tito\u00b4s whole body was starting to get rounded to get room for the food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing the bigger dog Rita had no problem eating bigger amounts of food then Tito. But the little dog had an obsession to win that seems to be bigger then his belly, and both didn\u2019t seem wanting to quit for a while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing four more rounds like this Rita and Tito seemed both to be slowing down a bit. Mostly Tito. While Rita was almost as bloated as she was after she had been eating at Walt, (The fourth rich dog.) Tito was starting to be swelled up as a football.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the twelfth round Rita was almost twice as quick on finishing her food then Tito was. Starting to feel a bit desperate Tito said to Einstein that he had to do the \u201cfast pace\u201d again. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d Einstein asked.  \u201cYeah I\u00b4m sure. Speed it up\u201d was Tito\u00b4s response. Einstein just said \u201cokay\u201d and started to do his \u201chigh paced feeding\u201d again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now Rita was about to feel as full so it\u00b4s hurts like when she started to eat the food from John (The fifth dog), while Tito seemed to have no limits for how far he could stretch his stomach. His whole body started to reach football size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was going to win? (Yeah I know it\u00b4s a bit unnecessary to ask that when you have picked that Rita should win, but I just want to make it a bit exiting and be great on the details on their gains.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the sixteenths round both Rita and Tito found themselves near their limits. Rita felt like she was almost at the same state as when she finished John\u2019s meal, and Tito simply was about to stop soon. His sphere of a body was about to reach it\u00b4s limit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Einstein and Dodger realized that none of the eaters would be able to finish their meal on their own. So both the feeders had to see which one who could make that last piece of food into their contester. Dodger saw that a bit of Rita\u00b4s pains was that her heaved belly was pressing against both the floor and her legs, so he told her to lay herself on her back to ease the pain. Rita did as she was told and felt a little bit better with her stomach being free from the press, making it easier to eat the last bit of food. Einstein was about to tell Tito to do the same when he saw that his stomach was so widely spread that it didn\u00b4t mater what side he put him in. He saw that Rita had just finished her last bits, and started to press Tito\u00b4s last food in his mouth to make him swallow. But it was impossible. Every little bit that was left came back up every time Tito swallowed. His body had reached it limit. It was so full of food that nothing even with force could be put in there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing now that his body had finally given up Tito accepted his lost and congratulated Rita for the victory. Afterwards all the dogs went to sleep.</span></div></div>",

She saw that he had got a little (Compared to the other dogs) belly. It wasn\u00b4t enormous but it was bigger then the average dog. Except from that it wasn\u00b4t much else of him that had changed. He just looked like he had a big meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis was heavy sleeping with a smile on his face. He had all night been complaining of being in big pain for overstuffing himself. He hadn\u2019t even tried to move because of belly hurting to much. During the night his resting had made his belly more soft and less stretched. It was still very big and round, but this time it was more of a basketball size then a beach ball size. He had started to get some small mans breasts, His arms and legs was a bit flabby with fat and it also looked like he had got a couple of extra chins, and some puffed cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEinstein had one of the biggest bellies of the gang, only being beaten by Francis. During the night his stomach seemed to be the one that have shrunken the most. It was almost half as big as it was before he went to sleep. Half of his belly fat had spread itself all over his body during the night.  His dangling cheeks were now smaller because his face was now more thick. He had now even two-three double chins. His legs looks wider and even his rump looked a little plumped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she took a look at the one that had been her competitor last night, Tito. During most of the duel Rita hasn\u2019t looked over at Tito\u00b4s side to see how he was doing, she had been to focus on her own eating. So seeing him now in his immobile, bloated state come as a little chock for her. (She didn\u2019t thought about looking how she self looked, I\u00b4m saving it for the next chapter.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she looked over of how fat her friends was her stomach gave a little growl. It wasn\u2019t a big one (more like the one you get when you just started to get a little hungry.) but Rita had been obsessed with the felling of overeating. So for her this little growl was an enormous roar for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was on her way to go when she took one more look on her friends. Was she going to leave her friends while she was going to have a big block-long feast? Or could there be a way to even let her friends get food chaired by the rich dogs?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should she do?</span></div></div>",

No wonder the other dogs looked so tired when Rita woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn her way to the rich dogs Rita first walked, then jogging a bit, and then started to run. It didn\u2019t take long before Rita had to walk again. She knew that she ate some last night, but she couldn\u2019t think the thought to look at herself and see what all that eating have done to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she arrived she knocked on the door to Hans. Hans opened and Rita did her old seductive thing to trick the old terrier. She blinked her eyes, wagged her hips, and stretched her legs to make herself look sexy. But she saw after a moment of doing it that Hans didn\u2019t seemed seduced. He seemed more chocked. \u201cWhat has happened to your body?\u201d he asked. Rita then did what she hadn\u2019t done since evening yesterday. Looked at her own body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got a bit shocked herself of how what changes her body had made after all the eating from the rich dogs, and from the food duel with Tito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw that on her front legs the part that was over the knee was building up with fat and was working its way down to her feet\u2019s.

At first Rita surprised (and almost dragged to the ground), but then happy that Hans wasn\u2019t angry of her gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hugging her big belly enough he told her that if she ever wanted anything to eat he would be more then happy to offer her some of his food.

Before Rita got a chance to answer her stomach growled. \u201cI\u00b4ll take that as a yes.\u201d Hans said and lead Rita in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Rita had just been taken easy of the eating because she planned to eat from more then one dog. Now Hans was willing to give her all the food she needed to give the result they both wanted. Rita noticed also that Hans now was ready to do anything to help her gain. He poured food into a bowl for her. He took and filled all the time so it wouldn\u2019t run out of food for her to eat. He even took his time too help raising food from the bowl to Rita\u00b4s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lots of eating Rita and Hans seemed to bee finished for today. \u201cI\u00b4ll have to have something to eat for myself too.\u201d Hans said. All that eating had made Rita so heavy she needed help to stand up. Her belly looked almost as big as it was right after the food duel with Tito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita said thanks and goodbye to Hans and waddled herself out of his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere would Rita go next?</span></div></div>",

Lucky for her the block where the rich dogs lived in was in a very high point of the city. That had been a relief for her because after every big meal it hadn\u2019t been so hard too walk back home. When she had to walk back up too them the day after the food had been digested by then, and she didn\u2019t have so much extra weight to pull up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she started running home. Or tried too, but she found quickly out that running with a big round belly that hold more then half of your bodyweight wasn\u2019t a very smart idea. It leads her to lose her balance and starting to roll down the street. For people (or dogs) passing by it looked like a overstuffed and furry (excuse pun) hotdog that was rolling by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita finally got a stop of her rolling when she rolled into a (convenient placed) removal box full with pillows. After getting up on her legs (after much struggle.) Rita made sure to walk the last part home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she got home she saw that other dogs still hadn\u2019t woke up. \u201cI must have been the first one that went to bed last night.\u201d Rita thought. Right then she noticed Einstein was started to wake up. And when he woke up so wasn\u2019t it long before the other did the same. She took and fined her place were she slept last night. She then pretended to sleep so no one would know that she had been out today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon after she got in position Einstein started to wake up. He yawed loudly and kicked his large legs, accidently hitting some of his pals. (It was actually a common way that for them to bee woken up by.) As they where starting to woke, Rita pretended to do the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAre they going to see through Rita\u00b4s act? </span></div></div>",

Dodger is first quiet, then he says \u201cWell, You and Tito did in fact eat a lot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey took a look at the other dogs that was starting to get up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEinstein\u00b4s fat had been divided all over his body. His face was more rounded with thicker cheeks and multiple chins. His legs where like four tree trunks. He still had a very big belly that reached to his knees. He had a body that resemble an elephant. He even had thanks to his fatten feet\u00b4s and enormous belly got the walking style of an elephant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis had before sleeping a belly so big and round and heavy that he was pinned down by it. After a night sleeps his belly had shrink enough too let him stand on all four again. It was still very big and round. It was so big that it was giving a light touch to the floor. It was also so round that it had him to spread his legs so much that you could get a good look at it even if you were looking at the front. The food that had been digested during the night had now gotten spread all over his body. His face was puffy, his legs were thick and his butt was inflated. His whole body had become more of the one of a slob.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tito was starting to wake the other dogs got a bit worried. After the big food duel against Rita Tito\u00b4s whole body had gotten a big ball shape. Even after a night of sleep and digestion his body still was as round as before. The other dogs were now worried that when he wakes he is going to be horrified by his new body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange thing was that Tito didn\u2019t seem to notice that he was so fat and round that he was immobile. He yawned, stretched his paw (Most of his legs were consumed by his fat.) and scratched his body with his little paws. Then he saw the looks on everyone else starring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked, not at all noticing that his paws was in the air and his belly was the only thing making contact with the floor. The other got a bit unsure of how to tell him, and who should do it. First Dodger tried \u201cWell, you were really into the eating duel last night.\u201d \u201cYeah?\u201d Tito said still confused. \u201cAnd you are not in the same size like us.\u201d Rita hinted to him. \u201cSo what do you mean?\u201d Tito asked a little annoyed for not getting any straight answers. \u201cEinstein.\u201d Tito said. \u201cCan you say what the thing is?\u201d Einstein first looked at his friend and then at Tito and said. \u201cYou have become a beach ball.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d Tito said and then examined his body. Realizing how it finally was he became quiet for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was his reaction to his state going to be?</span></div></div>",

This time before the door opened she tried too such in her stomach, trying too trick him in believing she was still the same. But as soon as he saw Rita, she knew that he saw something wasn\u2019t right. Looking at Rita Brad saw a female dog who while having her stomach looking normal, had the rest of her body overweight. Rita couldn\u2019t hold her stomach in much longer, (Being fatter had made her stretch muscles weaker too.) and it fell down, making the rest of her body almost drag down to the ground of the sudden pressure. She felt a bit ashamed, but was still on her way to try and give some kind of explanation to her current state. But before she got a chance to start Brad said. \u201cSo you just used me as a way to pig yourself with my food. Well I\u00b4m goanna set a stop for it right Now!\u201d and then he slammed and locked the door, leaving Rita felling a bit more down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill with a small ounce of hope, Rita decides to try at the third dog (Erik). But this time Eric just got a glimpse of her state before he slammed his door. \u201cWell, I can understand him.\u201d Rita thought. \u201cI tricked him in believing that he had made me pregnant.\u201d And with that Rita sat down wondering if it was even worth going to the last two dogs? \u201cThey are going to probably hate me to.\u201d Rita thought. \u201cBut it would feel better to let them see the truth, then keeping it a secret.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow are the two remaining dogs going to react?</span></div></div>",

If she couldn\u2019t get any food from ay of the dogs, then her friends would realise that she had have all the control of the food. They were probably going to make her leave the houseboat. Thus making her completely alone and unable too survive. (Being morbidly obese and all.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knocked at John's door and when he opened he just stared at her. And slowly Rita saw a facial expression of joy on John. At first she didn\u2019t get why. But then she remembered that last time they meet he said that he wanted to have a fat girl.

Rita asked him what kind of food he had. \u201cWell\u201d Walt said \u201cRight now I have two types of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first one is called <i>Whale chops</i>. They are bits of meat and fat from whales. They are very high in calories and fat, and also very big in size. In taste they are just okay, but they are in big help if you ant your meal to make your fatter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other one is named <i>Thin but tasty bacon</i>. They are more thin in size and in amount of calories.

Fagin had gotten a job as a cleaner for the Foxworths, and this even allowed it so he could live in their mansion along with his dogs, just like Georgette, Oliver, Jenny and Winston lived in it now. It was the best of both worlds for everyone. And because Fagin had helped in ridding the world of Sykes, he and his dogs were exonerated from all their past crimes, especially since they made it clear they wouldn't have done it if they had any other options and if Fagin wasn't so poor and desperate. They also swore an oath to never steal again. However, just as a reminder of what they once were and why they should be knowledgeable of the fact crime doesn't pay, an NYC cathedral priest gave them a special book. It was a book that focused around all kinds of sin, vice, crime and wrongdoing, and why it was wrong and to be avoided at all costs. Fagin was to read it to his dogs once a week, so they would remember why it was so important they made the change they did and why they were let off the hook this time, but might not have been if some things had been a different matter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, this book, unbeknownst to any of them, or to anyone, including the priest, for that matter, was not just a book on sin and the like. It was also a book which was, in its own way, quite magical. And part of it consisted of the seven deadly sins chapter, which started with gluttony. After a few days of reading it each night, Fagin had reached that very chapter and marked his place. And though all his dogs listened well when he read it and learned what he did, one of them, Rita, to be exact, was more curious than the others about what was to be seen in the next of chapters. So when Fagin and the other dogs were asleep and so were Oliver, Jenny, Georgette, Winston and the Foxworth parents, Rita snuck to where she'd seen Fagin put the book, grabbed it, took it to a place where there was enough light to read despite how dark it was due to the moon shining through the windows, and opened it up to the gluttony chapter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put her paw on where she read to keep track of things and was just about to start reading, when all of a sudden the magic in the book reared its head(so to speak)and went off right at Rita, causing her to be knocked back and knocked out. What Rita didn't know after passing out from this surprise was that, after she woke up the next morning, she would see that the sin of gluttony had passed itself into her from that book mystically, at least in a way, and the result of it was that, while she was asleep, she turned out to have gained weight. Along with how her appetite and craving for food had been boosted drastically, but I digress. The exact amount of weight she'd gained to go with what she'd weighed before was...    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After living together for four months Francis had really got to know how it is to live in luxury. Or more exactly his <u>body</u> has got to knows it. Since living with Georgette he had gained 280 pounds. His previous weight was about 80 pounds. So he was now weighting 360 pounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing to make him gain this much was the sudden change of environment. Before he would have to move and do a lot of things before there was any food, and then he had to share that little food piece with the rest of the gang. But now he could eat as much as he want without doing anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd not only that. It was also much thanks to Georgette that he had become obese to. When Jenny gave Georgette food before Francis had moved in she used to give her big portions, because she thinks Georgette looked a bit underfed. So Georgette had to bury almost half of her portions to make Jenny think that she had eaten it. Now when she has Francis she can simply give him her half. And if Francis wanted some more food she could just ask Jenny for more. Francis couldn't do it because Jenny saw that he had have more then enough, but she was whiling to give Georgette more food because she looked like she could need more. Jenny never suspected that Georgette gave that food to Francis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was an other reason to why Georgette was the biggest source to Francis huge weight. Francis had actually thought long before that he might be going to be to fat. But Georgette told him that loved him more and more for every pound that he gained. So Francis decided to grant his lovers wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body had gone through some major changes. To start from the top, His head had some very thick rolls of fat all over his face. His cheeks was so puffed that he always looked like his mouth was full of food even is he didn't have any in it. He didn't have any neck, just neck rolls that looked like they where trying to take over his head. He had six thick chins who seemed to go all the way down to his huge chest. His arms and legs where very fatty to. When he was standing on all four, it looked like his arm and leg fat where starting to cover his paws. His ass was big to. It looked his little tail was about to be engulfed by his huge butt. And then it was his stomach. That was something of fatness. It was so big and fat that the best way to describe it was that it was as round and big as a beach ball. And filled with fat. It was the part of him that cared the most weight. Almost 100 pound of fat was in this perfect ball shaped belly. Even if his belly was hard as a rock Georgette couldn't think about anything better then to rest her head against it like it was a pillow. It was so warm and soft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this body it became a bit difficult for Francis to walk. His heavy stomach plus fatten limbs had him to waddle instead of walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe usually meet some of his old gang during the wakings. Francis could see that even his friends had gone through some weight changers. They weren't fat but they had got some little bellies now. It seems that after Francis had left the group, They had not have any trouble to get enough food to make them all feed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe best moments Francis and Georgette could have are when they are laying in front of the fireplace after a huge dinner. Francis is always so exhausted because he eats to his limits. There for it always fells so great for him to have his large belly getting warmed by the fire. It also helps that Georgette gives his belly a massage while he his lying. Georgette enjoys it to, getting to feel the huge, round, warm thing that was Francis belly. Having her paws to stroke it and push in to it to feel how deep she could push them in. She also liked to press her precious face into its warm softness. Snuggling around it and sleep with the dog she loved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne afternoon when Georgette and Francis have had dinner, she told him that she had something to show him.</span></div></div>",

It is going to be lots and lots of food to be served just for you and the other fat dogs.\" Georgette explained. At first this sounded to good to be true for Francis. An exclusive dinner with more food then he had ever eaten before. He was just imagining all piles of food waiting for him. \"So are we going?\" Georgette asked. \"Yes, we are certainly.\" Francis answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at the dinner, Francis and Georgette get to know who the other guests are. There were four other couples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst they meet a fat German Shepherd male with an athletic female German Shepard. He\u2019s body was a little weird. He had double chins, a big hanging belly, and a jiggery ass. But his forelegs and hind legs looked more muscles then fat. His legs had bits of fat hanging on them, but they where not near as engulfed in fat as Francis legs. \u201cMy name is Frank and this is Linda, my love.\u201d The fat one said. \u201cI am weighing 280 pound, but almost 60 of my pound are the muscles in my legs. I am a police dog. I used to be an attack dog. My job was to chase criminals and vehicles. As you can guess I had a very fit figure. But after one successful criminal catch a policeman awarded me with a doughnut. For the first time in my life I had got a tasted of something sweet. It was just overwhelming me with it\u2019s sugary sweetness. I just wanted to eat more and more doughnuts, nut I know that I then wouldn\u2019t be able to do my work. It was then she came in to my live.\u201d Frank said putting one of his forelegs over his wife\u2019s shoulders. \u201cOr more exactly started at his job.\u201d Linda filled in. \u201cFrom the moment we saw each other we knew we were meant for each other. (Takes a moment to gives each other a kiss.) Frank became so close to me that he felt he could tell me about his problem.\u201d \u201cAt first I just thought that she was going to think I was strange.\u201d Frank said. \u201cBeing a police dog who wants to get fat. But to my surprise Linda told me that she had a secret to.  That she wanted the man of her dreams to be fat. \u201c \u201cThat\u2019s where I come up with a solution.\u201d Linda filled in. \u201cBy hard training I could take the role as the attack dog, and my husband trained to be a drug dog.\u201d \u201cIn that job I could just sit in a small corridor and bark when I smelt someone who was careering drugs.  But I\u2019m still training a little on my spare time, even if I want to be fat I still want to able to walk.\u201d)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next pair Francis and Georgette meet was a small Pomeranian female and a big Great Dane that reminded them of Einstein. \u201cI\u2019m Stefanie the head chief for Big Dog dog-food, and this is Bob our literally biggest mascot for our products.\u201d the little dog said. Bob was a big dog.  He looked like he was 40 inches meet from paw to shoulder, and he was incredibly fat.  He had double chins, big belly and flabby legs to name just some. He had a fat body very similar to Francis\u2019s.  But he had gone for the step further being so big he looks like a blob. \u201cNot a bad size eh?\u201d The Pomeranian said. \u201cMaybe I should give a little backstory? He is not very talkative.\u201d She said looking at the Dane who just gave a blank stare. \u201cIt started with that Big dog dog-food had trouble with marketing. We had have TV-commercials where prizewinning beauties eat our dog-food. But those didn\u2019t sell well. When we in the management board where discussing how to make thing better, we got an alarm in food supply. It was Bob. I had no idea where he was from, all that I know about him is his collar that said Bob. He seamed to be homeless and very hungry. So hungry that he had fight through 20 of our security guards just to get to the food. That\u2019s when I got the idea for how to make good marketing. Our TV-commercials that we made was Bob fighting his way through obstacles and other dogs to get to the food, and it had the slogan \u201cBig Dog, worth fighting for.\u201d The commercials became a hit and our selling was successful. As a reward Bob could eat all the dog food he wanted. But after a day of nothing else then eating for Bob we saw what changes our food could do. The food was high on calories and fattening, and was only meant to be eating one portion a day. Bob had just spent the whole day eating all the food he could before he had to sleep. Now the day after we could see that all the dog food had made him obese. We where thinking about how we where going to sell our product when our mascot was a fatty. It has to become a failure right? But to our surprise dogs still wanted our food. They said that still liked Bob because they saw in his eyes that he really loved the food, and that that was the only proof they needed to bye it. So we are still selling well and Bob still gets to eat as much as he wants. He can eat up to almost 30 pounds of dog food a day. Being so tall that he is he now has a weight around 500 pounds. So to celebrate him for saving our company I invited him to this dinner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Francis and Georgette came to where the third pair should be they just saw a Golden retriever girl caring a bowling bag. \u201cWhere is your fat partner?\u201d Georgette asked. \u201cOh, He\u2019s here.\u201d The retriever girl said and opens her bag. Francis and Georgette got a small chock of what they saw. In the bowling bag was a Chihuahua guy how was a ball of fat. Everything except for his head and paws had become so fat that they had consumed the dog. \u201cHi, my name is Doug and this my girlfriend Ann.\u201d The Chihuahua ball said. \u201cLast time weight myself I was around 200 pounds, with is a lot for a guy my size. I bet you want to know how I became this?\u201d the Chihuahua asked. Francis and Georgette just nodded as an answer. \u201cIt started some time ago when I was just a pudgy little Chihuahua compered to how I am now. I used to work on a fabric that made dog food. (If it is the same as the one in the previous story you decide.) I always had a bad habit of eating small portions of the food when nobody saw. One Friday night I had a plan of eating a little from a big food tank. I waited until all the others had gone home, to make sure that nobody would discover me. I leaned over the edge of the tank to try to get some of the food. But I\u2019ll tripped and fell into the tank instead. It felt like I was sinking in quicksand. To make things worse so was there no workers left to help me. There was only one way to save myself\u2026Eat. So for two days straight I did nothing else then eating and eating. So when the others staff return on Monday they found an empty tank and me like this. As you could guess I was fired, and now also immobile. I had to get me a maid to help me with everything at home, since I can\u2019t move anymore. And would you know it? She happens to bee the love of my life.\u201d Doug said giving the word to Ann. \u201cI remember when first meet him. They had said the he was \u201cspecial\u201d case because of his weight problem. I thought I was going to meet dog like you.\u201d She said looking at Francis. \u201cBut when I saw Doug, I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes first. Seeing this little ball with a dog\u2019s head and paw on it was just unbelievable. But then I saw just what cute little eyes he had.\u201d Ann said looking at Doug who blushed a little. \u201cThen after a day of helping him, he and I discovered that we had a lot of thing in common. So he asked me out on a date. And after that date we both knew that we where going to be together in the rest of our lives. I moved in to him so I always can be there and help him. Moving him around all the time has actually been good exercise for me. One thing I\u2019m glad for this dinner is that there is lots of servants how can help Doug so get a chance to just do things myself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last pair that Francis and Georgette meet was a basset couple. (Who reminds them about the Barnyard Dawg from Looney Tunes.) Both of them looked fat. But while the male dog was just having a bit of a potbelly and a double shin, his wife was the real fat one. She had big belly, huge thighs and lots of chin like other fatty\u2019s. But being a female she had fat on some other places to. All the fat had given her huge breasts that have the size DDD. She had even a couple of bottoms matching her breast size. Francis got a little lost in the beautiful female fatty, until Georgette woke him up again. \u201cHay, My name is Henry and this is my beautiful wife Emily.\u201d Henry said, letting Emily take over. \u201cEver since I\u2019ve been a little pup, I have always loved to be fat. My biggest wish was to find a man to share the love of fatness. At first I was afraid of asking for man who wants to live with someone fat. But everything feels so easy since I found Henry.\u201d Emily said giving Henry a big kiss. \u201cI actually had a so called \u201cnormal\u201d weight before I meet Emily, but now all I want is that we shall be the fattest dog pair in the world.\u201d \u201cWe even have plans on getting children, and teach them about the wonders of being fat. And together become the fattest family known to exist.\u201d Emily filled in. \u201cIf you are curious Emily weights 280 pounds, and I myself weights 140 pounds. So I got a lot to catch up to.\u201d Henry said giving Emily a kiss back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter meting all the other guests Francis and Georgette had two things to do. Mingle and Eat. During the entire evening all the pairs was going to be in two groups. The fat one and the partners. That means Francis is only talking and eating with, Frank, Bob, Doug and Emily. And Georgette vice verse with, Linda, Stefanie, Ann and Henry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat are we going now?</span></div></div>",

Georgette was a bit unsure at first being that she was a prizewinning, elegant living dog. And most of those how where here is pretty much \u201cpeasants\u201d in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was one dog that stood out for her. A dog that just like her had high grace, and also had a lot of funds to be able to live nicely with. That dog was Stefanie. (The Pomeranian that is the boss for a big dog food company.) She walked to her and decided to talk about the only thing she knew about. Money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(G=Georgette, S=Stefanie)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nG: \u201cSo, being the CEO of a big successful dog food business gives a lot of money?\u201d<br>\r\nS: \u201cYes. Yes it does.\u201d<br>\r\nG: \u201dBig part of it is Bob right?\u201d<br>\r\nS: \u201cYes, but things hasn\u2019t been so good lately.\u201d<br>\r\nG: \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\nS: \u201cDogs are starting to complain that the commercials makes it look like our dog food turns whoever eats it into mindless slaves.\u201d<br>\r\nG: \u201cWell, that\u2019s bad.\u201d<br>\r\nS: \u201c Yes, its certainly bad for business. Having him as the face out has started to make us lose our customers. Without a dog that can give a believable acting for how good our food are I think were doomed.<br>\r\nG: \u201cWell I think I know were to find the dog you need.<br>\r\nS: \u201cAnd how should that be?\u201d<br>\r\nG: \u201cMy husband Francis.\u201d<br>\r\nS: \u201cFrancis?\u201d<br>\r\nG: \u201cYes, He had told me that his dream is to become an actor, and he have been showing me his own made theatre shows a lot of times.

All of them had their own ways in preparing. Rita who had the job to look for the right car was stretching her neck to be able to switch from looking left to looking right very quickly. Einstein who's job was to run into the running car Rita chooses was warming up himself by hitting himself against the brick house walls. Tito was warming up his jaws so he wouldn\u2019t have any troubles biting through hard cables. Oliver had only been told to stick close with Tito and look for trouble for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then it was Francis. His part was to act like he had been hit by the car. Even if it was simple task for Francis he still took it more serious then any of the others. Being that he always had have a dream of being a professional theatre actor, Francis had took every opportunity to watch some Shakespearians acting when it was on the TV. He also took and used his spare time to watch how his friends was acting in various situations and trying to imitate their movements and talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the alley Francis took the time to make several different positions of him looking like had been hit. There was short direct deaths, and long stretching sections of him in pain. \u201cAren't you taking this a bit to serious?\u201d Tito asked. \u201cI mean, it only a fake death for about 20 persons.\u201d \u201cEvery public performance is worth to put your effort into.\u201d Was Francis answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita then told them to be ready for the stealing. They all got into their positions as Rita gave the signal. As soon as the signal was giving Einstein went of. As soon as he throw himself against the car Francis took and throw himself into position on the ground. He was lying on his left side with his legs spread out and his tongue hanging out of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeople was starting to crowd around Francis, and Tito and Oliver was own their way to get into the car when the driver (Winston) also went to see the dog. But as soon as he got out they could all hear a man in the crowd around Francis say. \u201cThis dog is just playing dead!\u201d Realising something had gone wrong with Francis part of the plan Tito, Oliver, Rita and Einstein sadly had to escape leaving Francis alone with the crowd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis didn\u2019t know what to do now. His acting hadn\u2019t failed, and except for that one man saying so no other person seemed to see the different between a dog playing dead and a real dead dog. Francis didn\u2019t know who this man was, but if he thought that if he just stayed \u201cdead\u201d maybe he would also left. Other persons from the crowd started to talk back to this strange man. \u201cHow do you know it not dead?\u201d  \u201cDid you saw it get hit?\u201d \u201cAre you a veterinarian?\u201d  \u201cWho are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u201d the mysterious man said in a slightly sissy british voice, \u201cAm Bob Suberson, Special trainer of animal actors. I can tell the difference between a dead animal and one acting better then anybody else. And I can see that this dog is just acting, very good acting mind you, but still not real death.\u201d Francis didn\u2019t know if he should feel honoured for getting the compliment from the man saying that he was really good on acting, or if he was going to get scared of him getting caught any second now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike an answered pray from Francis some of the people in the mob started to get suspicious of what the man said. \u201cHow do we no you are not bluffing?\u201d \u201cAre you really an expert?\u201d \u201cCan you prove it?\u201d Looking like he just had been asked for a duel the man calmly answered\u2026\u201dEasy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked up close to Francis (who hadn\u2019t moved an inch since he started laying down.) and started stretching his hands like he was warming up. \u201cIf he's really dead then nothing should happen when I do\u2026 this!\u201d Bob said and pressed a finger on a certain spot on Francis right shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though Francis tried to keep himself as still as possible all the time, he couldn\u2019t keep himself together when the man pushed his finger into his shoulder. In on second Francis could feel how his whole nervous system got stretched and then doze of. For all the people watching they saw the dog pull his legs together, clench his teeth\u2019s and scout his eyes. To then fall onto his back motionless like his body was made of jelly. His eyes were blinking and he was gasping after air so they knew now that he was alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis was getting really scared now of what was going to happen to him now. Not only did the people know that he wasn\u2019t dead, his muscles wasn\u2019t working any more so he didn\u2019t have any way of escaping now. Bob Suberson looked at the motionless dog and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you are going to get mobility again in an hour or so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho owns this dog?\u201d Bob asked the mob. When nobody seemed to make an announcement Bob got an idea that gave him a big smile. Looking at Francis he picked him up and said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t seems to belong to anyone, then I'll think I will become you owner. I can see that you have big talents in acting, and I'll make sure that you will be a huge star!\u201d and walked away with the temporality paralyzed Francis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiding in the alley Francis friends had seen everything that had happened. They asked each other what to do. Tito said that they should juts follow the man with Francis and take Francis back as soon they know the location. Rita and Dodger thought more that they should spy on the place and take their time to think out a plan the rescue Francis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat where they going to do?</span></div></div>",

Peeking out from behind a bush Francis\u00b4s friends saw how the man carried him inside the building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gang had decided that this being risky they would take their time to think out a plan before trying to get Francis back. But just by looking at the building they saw that this wasn\u2019t going to be easy. It was a very blank looking building with no windows on the bottom floor and doors you would need keys to get thought. On the higher floors where a couple of windows. (This was the office\u00b4s.) They also saw that there were ventilation shafts on the roof that maybe also would come in handy. \u201cThis will properly take some time to think out.\u201d Dodger said. \u201cI just hopes that Francis can hold out.\u201d Rita said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the building Mr Suberson placed Francis in a dog cage. \u201cSorry for having to do this to you.\u201d He said. \u201cBut even such a talented creature like you have to start as a \u201c\u201dunknown\u201d\u201d here. But I can guarantee that I will do what I can do to get you the biggest roles that I fix, and if you play your parts right you may even get your own dressing room to live in instead of this dirty cage.\u201d Francis was still pretty unsure of to feel in the situation that he was in. He was right now trapped in a cage in an unknown place with a man he didn\u2019t know at all. But the way the man spoke was starting to make him feel (oddly enough) safe. He seemed to care for what was happening to him and to help him become the star that he had always dreamed of to be. Also he seemed to care for him feeling good by wanting to fix him someplace better to live then in a cage. If he really was just a mean man after money he would just left him to live inside there. The bad thing was that he still felt paralyzed. But the nice man made sure to calm Francis on that to. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the effect of my pitch will soon end. Now I have to take you to my boss.\u201d And with that he started caring the cage to his boss room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the transport Francis got a chance to see how things looked here, and it actually looked pretty good. He saw all kind of animal doing movie parts, but his focuses where mostly on the dogs there. He saw dog that was being trained, filmed and then rewarded with treats for their good work. He saw dogs that had their own trainers, dressers and even (just like Bob had told him) own dressing rooms with their names on them. Also during this traveling he started to feel his movements coming back just like Bob had told him. He was then putt down by him when they arrived at his boss\u2019s office. \u201cI have to leave you outside because our boss is \u201c\u201dironically \u201c\u201d allergic to animals. And so Mr Suberson left Francis alone outside while he was going to convince his boss to give Francis a chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the waiting Francis had got back all of his movement again. While stretching himself he discovered that the cage wasn\u2019t locked probably. This meant that he had a chance to escape from the cage and try to get out of this building. But if this man really wanted to make him a star then this was his once in a lifetime chance to make his dream come true. What should he do?</span></div></div>",

A man had walked up to him while he was playing dead. He had seen through the act but praised him for his ability to act. Then he had taken him against his will to an unknown place inside a cage. He had been saying that he was sorry for doing this and been giving promises to help him get a better place to live in then the cage. Although it looked like the mans actions and will seemed to be to let the world see Francis talent. So taking a big risk (from Francis perspective) he decided to stay in the cage and see what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the office Francis \u201ckidnapper\u201d Bob Suberson was having a talk with his boss Donald Ford. Donald or Mr Ford like his staff called him looked just like an average boss. He seemed to be in his fifties, was bald, a little bit overweight. His emotion side was a bit different. He is a nice against his employers and the animals (even though he is allergic against some animals like cats and dogs.) but he could also get really aggressive when things don\u2019t go as he planed, or not after \u201cschemat\u201d. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Bob made his entrance into the office he saw his boss sitting behind his desk doing a phone call, and he seemed a bit upset. \u201cIs that so? Well I can tell you that if you don\u00b4t bring he a male dog soon I\u00b4ll make sure you wont be able to get a job again!\u201d slamming the \u201ctelefonluren\u201d when he was finished. Bob felt a bit nervous talking to him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis boss noticed him now standing against the door. \u201cOh Bob, Come here take a seat.\u201d He said a bit more calm now, \u201cVilket\u201d also made Bob feel calmer. \u201cI\u00b4m sorry you had to see that.\u201d Mr Ford said while Bob took a seat. \u201cBut I\u00b4m in a bit of a jam right now. You see I\u00b4m really in need of a male dog to play in an important project, and all I get to hear is that all the dogs we have is filming right now. The shooting is this afternoon and I\u00b4m starting to get really desperate.\u201d \u201cWell Mr Ford.\u201d Bob said. \u201cI happen to get my hands on a male dog this morning.\u201d His boss got a bit of hope in hearing this. \u201cIs it an experience dog?\u201d he asked. \u201cWell, probably.\u201d Bob answered. \u201cWhat do you mean probably?\u201d his boss asked him a bit worried. \u201cYou see\u2026\u201d Bob said pausing a bit before saying. \u201cI actually found this dog on the streets ownerless.\u201d His boss was staring to get angry but controlled himself because he knew Bob was confident enough to not do this without having a good reason for doing things. (Even though this was pretty hard to get.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd can I ask what your thoughts are in putting an inexperienced dog that you found on the streets in a high budget production like this?\u201d he asked. \u201cI know this seems crazy from your perspective, but when I saw this dog on the streets playing dead in front of a crowed I could swear that I had never seen an ownerless dog fooling an audience like he did.\u201d Bob answered. His boss looked still unsure and Bob continued without giving his boss a chance to answer. \u201cAnd I swear that I\u00b4m seeing so big potential in that dog that if he would fail and ruin the whole thing I will take the whole blame for it, and I would let you make sure that I \u201cWont be able to get a job again.\u201d\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis boss was silent for a moment. Inside his head he thought about how risky the whole thing would be if let this dog have the role. But he know that Bob always would know what real talent is, and this must be s a really talented dog he had found if he was prepared to risk his own job for this dog. Trusting in a good worker Donald Ford said. \u201cIf you are really sure that he can do it, then he can have that role.<br>\r\nBob was all exited over hearing this. He knew that he wouldn\u2019t probably do the same if he was the boss so he was just happy for his and Francis sake. After shaking hand with his boss he went outside again to find Francis in his cage. \u201cI have good new and bad news.\u201d He said to Francis. \u201cThe good news is that I got a role for you, and it is a big thing.\u201d Francis eyes getting filled with enjoy of knowing that he had chosen the right thing, and that this man was trustworthy. \u201cThe bad news is that the shooting is in just a couple of hours and we have to rehearsal on stage \u201cDirekt.\u201d Francis got a bit stage fright now. He wanted to get a chance to do things, but this was getting a bit to quickly for him. But he had had his chance to escape and didn\u2019t take it, now he has to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat where they going to film?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Bob explained for Francis what it was it seemed easy. He was going to be in a commercial for Bulkim dog-food. He was going to sniff at two different dog-foods and then chose the one that was made by Bulkim. \u201cSeems like nothing hard.\u201d Francis thought, \u201cJust act like if it is a real battle in your mind in choosing and everything will be perfect.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat Francis hadn\u2019t thought about was his counterpart in the commercial. In the commercial it would be a female dog that would be \u201ctalking \u201cinto the camera about how much better Bulkim\u00b4s dog-food is compered to it\u00b4s competitors. The dog wouldn\u2019t really talk. She would just move her mouth and a human female would do the voice. The counterpart was going to be played by none other then Georgette. (Being that she\u00b4s the winner of  \u201c56 blue ribbons, 14 regional trophies and six-time national champion.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that was staring in a high paid dog-food commercial.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was getting ready for her makeup when she saw Francis walk in. (Being that this is a fictional story Georgette never met Oliver or the gang before.) \u201cWhat on earth is that?\u201d Georgette thought. Being a prizewinning beauty and a rich diva she was expecting something along the line with a handsome and prizewinning Greyhound racer as her co-star. So seeing this \u201cdog-looking\u201d thing was a big scandal for her. \u201cAre they serious with starring that ugly sack of slum as my co-star? He doesn\u2019t even look like he has been probably cleaned for a loooong time.\u201d Then she saw how his trainer was showing him the script and started to tell him the scene. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t even read the script? What kind of amateur casting I this!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Francis got a really quick makeover/washing, Georgette thought about what to do. She could just take and do her part, not thinking about this stranger. Maybe they wanted to have him just so they could just make Georgette look better in comparing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if that wasn\u2019t the case then they did this just to test Georgettes temper. The thought of letting this ugly, stinking, talentless stranger come here and try to be like the big stars just made Georgette mad. \u201cIf he wants to be a part of this then he will have to fight for it.\u201d Georgette thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat way was Georgette going to go?</span></div></div>",

Almost as an answer she heard how the stranger dogs stomach growled a little. Then she got an evil looking smile across her face because she now knew what she was going to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the commercial the male dog is going to eat the dog-food before Georgette does her part. This means that even if they would have to do another take, the food from the first take would still be in him. \u201cIf he want dog-food, then he\u00b4s going to get lots of it.\u201d Georgette thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was time for the first take Francis did his part, maybe eating a little bit more food then he was suppose to, but he was really hungry and this could be the only food he was going to get in a long time. As for Georgette she pretended to get a cough so they had to do a retake. Francis actually got a bit happy for this because this meant he would get a little more food to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the second take Francis was keeping himself closer to the mass he was suppose to eat, but still eating just a little bit more because he was still hungry. This time Georgette pretended to trip as she was walking into the shoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving to do a third take Francis thanked his lucky star for this chance of him getting a prober meal. \u201cMay she never get the scene right.\u201d He thought for himself. Georgette was happy that her plan seemed to work so far. The stranger dog was getting fatten up and didn\u2019t seemed to suspect anything. \u201cJust a few more takes and then he\u00b4s probably down for it.\u201d Georgette thought.</span></div></div>",

She had sneezed, caught, tripped, forgot to speak, been too late in her entrance, everything. She was starting to run out of ways to fail the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis was still going strong but with much more pain inside him now. Having done over 30 takes had been starting to take hard on his stomach. It started nice with one portion. But then the portions started to become a pound of food in him, and that grow into two pounds, and then to three pounds, and then to four pounds. Until he finally had been eating 20 pounds of dog-food. It really showed on his body too because he started as an underfed hungry dog, that now have a stomach that stretched out a feet. Luckily for him the food was placed on a set piece that sealed of Francis bloated body from the cameras. He had also gone from loving the dog-food to almost getting sick of eating it. But even thought all of this Francis still eat the food with the same dependency in every scene. Giving his all for the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the 31th take Georgette was finally done with failing. She had used all her tricks, and couldn\u2019t figure out any more to do. So she had to simply find herself beaten this time, and just do the scene. During the take she got surprised to see that her counter star didn\u2019t show any sings of him being full. He eats like he hadn\u2019t been eating for the entire day. Georgette had to admit that it must take really good acting for him to still keep a straight face considering all the food that he had been eaten.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the director yelled \u201cCut!\u201d and \u201cThat\u00b4s a rap.\u201d Francis could finally quit his acting and show how his body really felt. He fell onto his back and squirmed and clouts his paw around his bloated stomach. Being that he had lived his whole life on the streets starving made the feeling of being full a whole new experience for Francis. He felt pain for being overstuffed, but he also loved the feeling he got before he had eaten too much, and he didn\u2019t want to do anything else then to get to try that wonderful feeling of being full again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would happen next?

Doing that made Francis let out a small howl of pain by how taunt his stomach felt. \"Ops! Sorry there little friend. Didn't mean to hurt you.\" Bob apologized before putting Francis back into his cage. \"Now make sure to get some good rest now. You're going to do another tv thing in just a few hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrancis took his advice and immediately fell asleep. Having all this food inside of him really made him wanting to rest and digest it. While laying asleep and not moving Francis had to admit that he liked the feeling in his stomach now. It was still crowded and noisy, but after having a chance to digest it for some time the pressure inside had been lowered and the whole size of it was now a bit less streched. Now when he was feeling on it with his paws Francis could feel the warmth and comfort with being stuffed of food. Once again reminding himself of how he had been at the point of starving for most of his life Francis loved even more the feeling of for once being full. \"If I ever got the chance to once again eat a lot, I have to remember to stop eating here. Going futher would only make it hurt again.\" Francis thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some wonderful hours of sleeping of his meal Francis was awaken by Bob who had fixed a new job for him. As he got out from the cage both he and Bob could see the result of his sleeping. They could both see that while shrinking during his sleep Francis stomach was still very bloated. Still Francis didn't seem to either feel any pain from it or having truble walking on his own now, so Bob let it be. \"I think it will take a whole night's sleep to make your stomach disappear completely. But for now I think we need to get to the audition I fixed for you.\" Bob said as he lead Francis to the place where the audition would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting there Francis saw that the tv-series Bob was trying to get Francis on was...</span></div></div>",

It's about the life of the aristocracy class living in the Victorian era England. It is one of the most watch tv dramas of present time, and Francis favorite show. For a long time he had been fantasizing about being a part of it, and could hardly believe that he was standing among the show's sets. Feeling his stomach still being a bit hard on him, he cursed himself for not being in his best shape for his big opportunity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf in a corner there was a group of men arguing, and by the sound of it, it felt very important. Bob knew that those was the men he was suppose to show Francis to, but hearing how much into their discussion they where he decided to just stand next to them and wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing just next to them he heard them say things like \"How are we going to show it?\" and \"We need something to symbolize with.\", before suddenly hearing one of them shout \"What do you want?!\" right at him. Taken by surprise Bob moved back seeing that he now had all the men's attention. \"Can't you see that we are in an important discussion about finding an important piece to the story?\" One of them asked upset. \"Well, I didn't mean to disrupt you but I was suppose to show you the dog that might be able to play the part as miss Hardembell's pet.\" Bob said and asked Francis to come to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling more then a little nervous Francis walked up seeing all of these great men that was the whole reason for this show to be a success, and having them judge him. While all the men was just quiet for a while examining the dog in front of them, Bob tries to help selling Francis into it. \"I know that he looks a little chunky, but he had an incident with a dog food commercial, and...\" Was all Bob could say before he heard them shouting. \"He's perfect!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Bob and Francis was not prepared to hear that. They both thought that he would be used playing the pet dog to some nameless extra standing in the background, and here they are told that he would be perfect for the part as the leading character's dog. As all the men was on them begging Bob and Francis could hear them say things like, \"You must let us use your dog.\" and \"He would fit great into the settings. \" All Bob managed to say was, \"G-Great, I will just make sure to get him silm again and bring him back here.\" Before getting cut off by the men. \"No!\" \"Don't do that!\" \"That's the thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Bob asked confused. \"You see,\" Said the man who was the head writher for the show. \"The show centers around how the upper class is living at a much more richer and comfortable life then anyone else, and we have been wondering on who to create a great symbol for that. Something that would throughout the whole season show the changes that the aristocratic living would give, and we think this dog would become the perfect symbol for that. He would be givin as a pet to Lady Hardembell, looking around the normal size of what that kind of dog weights. And throughout the season he will gradually gain weight, and show what a spoiled lifestyle would do to him. What do say about that? Can he do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob took a moment to speak with Francis about it. \"I know this is probably the greatest opportunity you ever can get but that also mean that you will not only be forced to have this kind of body, but even getting much larger then you are now. Are you sure you really want this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of thinking Francis decided to go full in for the art and nodded to Bob. \"Okay buddy, if you say soo.\" Bob said and turned back to the men. \"Francis have agreed to play the part.\" He said, much to the men's delight. \"He will be a perfect for the part, he will not regret it.\" He said before letting Francis back to his cage to sleep. \"Have a good sleep now Francis. Tomorrow is the start of show business.\" Bob said before leaving Francis for the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he was getting himself comfortable he couldn't help but to think for the first time since being placed here what his friends where doing right now. Where they trying to form a plan to save him, or had they already forgot about him?</span></div></div>",

Oliver and the gang made themselves ready for todays job. Unknown to Oliver their job was to try and steal a car. For all the other they know their positions. Rita would spot the car they would take. Einstein was going to hit the car with his thick head. Francis was going to act like he had been hit, and Tito was going to highjack the car. Oliver's part would be to look out for Tito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the sidewalk of the street a Golden retriever girl named Cindy was getting her morning walk with her owner. She saw the dog gang with the cat hiding in the alley and she knew by the look of them that they seemed up too no good. She decided to make her owner stop by pretending that she needed to sniff a lamppost. As she watched them preparing for something she couldn\u2019t stop looking at the big tall dog. While the others seemed like they where criminals that had done bad things before, this dog looked so innocent. He didn\u2019t looked like the brightest one, but in his eyes she could feel that if he wasn\u2019t in the wrong company he could probably have a nice family to live with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rita gave her signal Einstein went of. At first Cindy didn\u2019t get what was going on, but then she got shocked to see Einstein rush towards a speeding car and hit his head at the side. Francis was quick to lay himself in position so it looked like he was the one getting hit, but Cindy saw how it really went. She couldn\u2019t believe that they made that Great Dane hit his own head against a high speeding car. \u201cHe could get brain damages, or even die\u201d she thought. All she wanted to do was to get free from her leash and go to see if he was okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would get her chance almost immediately after thinking that because while Francis was fooling the mass in that he was hurt Tito and Oliver had made it into the car trying to high jack it. Tito told Oliver too look in case the owner was coming back to the car, while he was going to find the starting cables. Oliver accidently turned the keys while scouting. At the same time Tito bit into the starting cables, leading to him getting electrocuted and fly across the street like a rocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chaos the mob gave was the perfect time for Cindy to break free from her owners grip and try to find the Great Dane. During the chaos the other dogs tried to make an escape into the alleys. Einstein that still was a bit dizzy after the hit missed this and was left alone, not knowing what to do. That's when this beautiful girl dog came up to him. \u201cOh my gosh! Are you head okay?\u201d Was the first thing Cindy could think of to say to this stranger dog she just meet. Einstein who was know to be very polite to answer a given question said \u201cYes, I'm used to it now.\u201d Before he understood that he talked to someone he didn\u2019t know. \u201cWho are you?\u201d Einstein asked. \u201cOh, sorry. Forgot to tell you, I\u2019m Cindy.\u201d Cindy said. \u201cMy name is Einstein.\u201d Einstein said. After a moment Einstein understood that a completely unknown female had walked up to him and started talking to him without any reason. \u201cSo?  What did you want?\u201d Einstein asked. \u201cWell, I saw what you did there before.\u201d Cindy answered. She then saw that Einstein couldn\u2019t put what exactly she had seen him do, so she said \u201cThat you smashed your head against the car.\u201d \u201cOh yeah.\u201d Einstein said looking like a light bulb had appeared above his head. \u201cI did that. I actually forgot about it. Must have been the hit in the head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCindy couldn\u2019t help but giggle a little at what he said. He was so sweet and kind in his voice just so lovable of his own stupidity. But she felt a bit down again when the thought about how he let himself be treaded by the other dogs returned to her head. Einstein who saw how she changed emotion asked what was wrong. Knowing she couldn\u2019t lie to him Cindy said, \u201dI like you.\u201d Einstein got a bit confused by her expression and what she said so he asked, \u201cWhere you sad about that?\u201d Cindy feeling even more sorry for him still not understanding said flat out, \u201cI think you deserves a better life!\u201d Einstein was still a bit clueless while letting Cindy continue. \u201cI think you are a kind, gentle and even\u2026 sweet dog. So much that I even think I love you.\u201d That part Einstein understood eminently, but he was to surprised to interrupt Cindy who continued. \u201cI felt so bad when I saw such a good being treated like he was nothing. I'm willing to do anything to give you better life.\u201d Einstein started to feel like it all went to fast. For just a minuet ago he had just meet this dog, and now she was all over him about love and all. But before he had a chance too say anything he got shushed by Cindy who was listening to something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCindy! Cindy!\u201d Cindy could hear her owner call for her. She quickly turned back to Einstein and said, \u201cI don\u2019t have more time. If you want to meet me again do it at \u201c\u201dBlackpearl street 7 in one hour.\u201d And with that she leaved Einstein alone not being able to say anything back too her before he heard the voices of his gang shouting after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he made his way back to the gang he wondered if he was going to alone visit Cindy in one hour as she wanted, or should he tell his friends what happened?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Almost an hour since the incident on the street EInstein found himself standing outside the door to the house on Blackpearl street 7 waiting to met Cindy. He didn't know why he was doing this. Why he had leaved his friends and family unnoticed, and walked his way through out the city to this adress all alone. Was it something he saw in this female dog that made him do it? Or was it that he just had a habit to follow all kinds of orders that was given to him, without any second thinking about it? No matter what he now stood there now, waiting and waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter waiting for a while he heard a knock on the window on the left side to the door. Looking at his left side he saw Cindy on the other side waving at him. At first he didn't get what she wanted and just waved back to her, but then he saw her doing gestures with her paws telling him to walk around into the alley next to the house. Doing so Einstein saw her appear in another window that was standing a little open, making it possible for her to speak with him. \"I'm so glad that you came to see me again.\" She said. \"Well, you asked me to come here, so I did that.\" Einstein answered like it nothing strange to do what strangers told him. \"My owner right now is gone for work and I have the house all by myself.\" Cindy explained, \"The door on the front is locked, but I know another way to get you in.\" Cindy said as she used her paws to fix the clasp to open up the window. \"There's a trashcan standing over there, if you took and brought to next to under the window you should be able to reach in.\" Einstein did just that and put the trashcan under the window, stepped on it, and managed to reach up to the window and get inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside the great dane found himself standing in a pretty normal kitchen. For Cindy and most other dogs with homes it was nothing special, but for someone like Einstein who had only been living on the streets and had only had the houseboat as any kind of home this was amazing. Everything was so crystal clean, and there was so much space that didn't have any junk laying around. But what really caught his attention were when he saw that Cindy not only had her own personal bowl to eat from, but also one for the food and one for the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou have been staring at my bowls for a long time, are you hungry?\u201d Cindy asked. \u201cNo thanks, I had a whole orange and some pieces of bread so I should be good for the day.\u201d Einstein said polite. \u201cThat is not anywhere near the amount of food a dog of you\u2019re size should be consuming daily.\u201d Cindy said shocked. \u201cIt isn\u2019t?\u201d Einstein asked confused. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of food I\u2019ve been eating ever since I can remember.\u201d \u201cThen we need to change that now.\u201d Cindy said as started to pull out bags of dog food from the kitchen cabinets. Einstein just stood there, not understanding what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done she had two big bags of dog foods standing next to her. They both stood higher up from the ground then Cindy, and they both had their own labels on them. \u201cOkay,\u201d Cindy said, \u201cI\u2019ve got here on my left <i>Cridgers super-beef</i>. It\u2019s a type of dog food that has been made to give the rich taste of pure beef in their biscuits, their small at size but rich in calories. So they are recommended to eat in small portions, as they will put on some pound in big portions. The one on my right is called <i>Maderins hypno-chow</i>, their name comes from the food being spiced with chemicals that makes the food very addicted. While smaller in calories compared to the super-beef, these small chows will make you so obsessed with eating them that you wont stop until your stomach is full.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what will you choose?\u201d Cindy asked Einstein. \u201cWait. You want me to choose the food for you?\u201d Einstein asked dumbfounded. \u201cNo, not me. It\u2019s for you.\u201d Cindy said. Einstein was quiet for a moment, trying to think if he had heard right. \u201cYou-You want to give you\u2019re food to me?\u201d Einstein asked. Cindy responded with a nod. This was all very strange ways of acting for Einstein. As he had learned from being raised on the street you don\u2019t share things like this. When it comes to food you always keep as much as you can for yourself, just for the sake of survival. So seeing this female dog that he had only knew for about a couple of hours now stood here offering food to him that was almost as big as she was, were a very big contradiction to everything he had known before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was woken up from his thoughts by a voice saying, \u201cAre you going to choose one?\u201d Looking back at Cindy and the bags of food again, Einstein started to feel something new in his body. He felt hunger. Hunger for almost never in his live being able to have a meal big enough to satisfy him. \u201cThis was it now.\u201d He thought, he was finally going to be able to satisfy his own needs for once. And the only thing left for him to do was to choose which food he would like to have as his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat food does he choose?</span></div></div>",

She then ripped a hole on top of the dog food bag, before pouring it into the bowl. About a fourth of the bags content was used before the bowl was filled. She then put the bag aside, looked at Einstein and said, \"Dig in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Einstein still was unsure of doing this. He still felt that he was stealing the food from her instead of seeing it as a gift, but after Cindy instead told him \"Eat it! It's an order!\" In a serious bossy way, Einstein started immediately to dig in. As he was starting to eat he still felt unsure if he should do this, but after only one chew and a first taste he was gone. He didn't think about morals or consciences or anything. All he could think about was eating, and it felt wonderful. The taste, the size, the freshness, everything about this food was better then anything else he had ever had in his life. He realized that after only a few mouthfuls he had been eating about the same amout of food that he would eat a day. It felt insane for him. How he could have managed to live a full live on his previously diet seemed like a mystery for him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Cindy looked on as he chowed down she coudn't help but to feel \"Strange\" inside. What exact she felt she couldn't say yet, but it was something. She had felt things before but that was mostly about how <u>badly</u> she felt for him. Now it felt like the opposite of that, but why. Was it to see how happy he was now being able to eat a real meal? Was it the good conscience of helping someone in need? Or could it be beacuse of that bulging belly that he started to get?...\"Wait, what bulding belly?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking another look she saw now that her friend had started to get really big and round down there, and looking over at the bowl she could see that he had only been getting halfway done eating. \"Geez! I knew those things got a high calorie value but this is insane. Does he even chew them before swallowing?\" She couldn't stop staring at it, and she didn't know why. He was a big dog a big size was to expect, but this? Maybe it's that he looks more thinner overall compared to other great danes she seen, but still it was crazy. She just couldn't stop staring at this thing still growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing some sloppy sound coming from the bowl Cindy took a quick.to see that he was almost done. \"Have I been staring for so long?\" Cindy thought as she quickly raised her eyes as she got eye contact with Einstein again. Even though he wasn't saying anything she could tell by his face that he was happier now then ever before. \"Did you enjoy that?\" She asked. \"Oboy, that was the greatest thing I have ever eat.\" Einstein said, his jaws acting almost numbed after his intense eating. \"I can clearly see that.\" Cindy said mumbling to herself while taking a quick look at the belly again. \"Did you say something?\" Einstein asked. \"Eh...You're drooling a little.\" Cindy said seeing a small drool escaping from his tiring jaw. Einstein quickly took and tried to pull it in again, and Cindy made sure to not stare at his belly anymore. \"If you would like to you could come back around the same time the next day, if you would like that?\" She asked. \"To get more food from you?\" Einstein asked, and Cindy answered with a nod. \"Then yes, I would really like to come back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the sudden an important thought appeared inside Einsteins head, and he said out loud, \"I need to get back to my friends!\" Looking at a bit shocked Cindy he said, \"Thank you for the food, but my friend may think I'm missing and I need to get back.\" \"Okay, you can just go out the same way as you came in.\" Cindy said and pointed to the window. Climbing up the sink to reach the window felt harder for Einstein, but he couldn't tell why. Cindy could see why <u>very</u> clearly, and that's his new bigger stomach getting in his way. Still Einstein managed to get to the window without bigger problems, that is until he tried to get trough the window. With his new wider figure he only went halfway through before getting stuck in the opening. \"Could you help me CIndy?\" Einstein asked, \"It looks like the window is much smaller on this side.\" Ignoring how stupid that sounded Cindy climbed up to help him, only to be greeted by a amazing view. Being stuck halfway through left Einstein's front side hanging outside, and his backside stuck inside. For Cindy this meant that when she got herself up to the sink she got incredible close to Einsteins hindlegs, butt, and mostly his big hanging stomach. It looked so inviting to her. Just like something out of a exrotic dream that she had have in her head ever since she first saw Einstein in this state. \"Could you give me a push?\" She heard Einstein say from the other side. Given the small space on the sink plus that Einsteins hindlegs still stood there taking space, that leaved Cindy to only one way of helping. By pressing her face into his swollen gut. Feeling like she was living her dream right now Cindy had to fight her inner dirty thoughts and focus on helping Einstein, but pressing her face into the warm soft underside of this dog was enought for her to start panting heavily. \"Don't give up Cindy, I know you have the strenght to do it!\" Einstein shouted, thinking the panting was from her being exhausted trying to push him. \"Oh, If he only knew:\" Cindy thought as she tried to fight her own horniness which wasn't easy. By having her face pressed into him and not being able to see, smell, and feel anything else then his full stomach made it almost impossible for her to just start making out to it. When she finally managed to get Einstein through the window Cindy feel down on the floor and panted hard. Hearing it Einstein simply said \"Thanks! You can rest now.\" Before heading back to the houseboat. Still laying on the floor Cindy couldn't belive that she had become so turned on by this dog having a big gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he headed back he couldn't stop think about how strange she had been acting towards him. How she had been looking at him, and talked to him. Being not the smartest tool in the box Einstein didn't figure out that she was in love with him. (Or more specifically his added weight.) Strangely nowhere on the walk home did Einstein ever notice how his big dangling stomach was swaying as he was running. Not even when it almost made him tumble over when he took a curve very sharp. All he could think about was the worries of his friends wondering where he had been. \"I can only hope they don't get to know about Cindy.\" He thought as he was heading to the houseboat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes his friend notice that he had been gone when he got back?</span></div></div>",

(Still not getting it was from the huge belly he had gained from all the eating.) As he carefully walked down to under deck where they all sleep Einstein felt even more worried about it, thinking that the first thing they would all do would be to ask him where he had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntering the room Einstein looked around prepared to have everyone down his throat asking where he had been all day, but to his surprise nothing happened. Looking around he could see everything looking like it was on a normal day. Francis and Tito was bickering as usal about simple things like what channel on the tv to watch. Rita was trying to sleep despite the loud arguing happening almost next to her, and Dodgers was just chilling in a new pair of sunglasses that he had stolen from a stand on the streets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelling a bit to scared to speak at first Einstein then took curage to say, \"I'm pretty sure you all been wondering where I have been...\" Before being cut of by Tito and Francis. \"Give me the remote, I want to watch wrestling!\" \"Such brainless nonsense? Never, as long as I would say.\" \"And what would you rather watch? One of those boring old plays where everybody speaks like no one has for the past hundred years?\" \"Huh! They speak the way all people who has a little bit of intellect would speak. It's not my problem that you don't know about the <i>diplomatic</i> way to solve an issue.\" \"If one of those guys just took out his sword and chopped the other ones head of things could be solved quicker!\" \"Yes. If you want to solve all your problems like you where a caveman then fine, but at least do it somewhere else.\" \"Fine, I will!\" Tito said and walked away, only to stop after a few moments. \"HEY! You're trickering me to walk away so you can have the tv for yourself!\" \"And I see that it worked.\" This made Tito soo angry that he started to attack Francis, who wasn't late to reply. At this point none of them said anything that sounded like words, they where just two angry dogs fighting. \"What I was about to say was...\" Einstein tried to say again before getting cut off by Rita this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't you two just shut up!? Some of us are trying to get some sleep!\" Rita yelled at them. \"Well excuse us for not staying up all night like someone else.\" Tito said back. \"I have you know that I do night shifts as well. That meant that <u>I</u> offer some of my night sleep to look for food or valuables or anything else that can help our situation! So don't you dare tell me that I do nothing important while you all are asleep, as I give more to this team every <u>day</u> then you two could do in a week together!\" \"As if.\" Tito said unimpressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRita was on her way to get up and tear that stuck up little dog apart, and Einstein prepared to go in between when the cool sterling voice of Dodger kicked in. \"Rita darling, keep your cool. Don't let yourself sink down to their levels.\" Taking Dodgers advice Rita took and laid down again, while Dodger still sat down with his back turned to everybody. \"And you two, why do you have to do such a fight over this? Don't you remeber the rules Francis?\" \"Yes I do.\" Francis answered in a low voice, knowing what to come. \"And what does the rules say?\" That on uneven days I get to pick the program to watch and on even days TIto gets to choose.\" And what day is it today?\" Dodger asked, knowing too the answer to come. \"The...tenth.\" Francis said after much resistance. \"So what does that mean?\" Dodger asked cooly again. \"That Tito is the one who gets to choose.\" Francis said defeated. \"Then give Tito the remote.\" Dodger said whichs Francis then did, which lead to Tito changing the channel back to wrestling. \"Still thinks it's a poor excuse to show grafical violence.\" Francis muttered. \"To bad I'm the one with the remote now.\" Tito said and continued watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing how during all of this nobody had notiched him EInstein decided to go back to his sleeping place to rest. He put on a blanket over him for comfort, that also conveniently hide his swollen middle. It wasn't until Fagin came back home that the gang started to notice that Einstein also was present, but they still thought that he had been with them the whole day. When it was time for them all to have dinner Einstein still felt like he wasn't hungry and passed. It was also good since then he didn't need to get up and reveal his still hanging gut for everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the night was coming and all the other dogs and Fagin was asleep Einstein was the only one to be awake thinking about what to do the next day. He remembers the promise he and Cindy made about meeting again, but he wondered if she would have mined him bringing his friends with him? She had a lot of food to spare and his friends all looked like they could use some of it, but ever since coming back he realized that they didn't seem to notice any difference in their lifes if he was gone a whole day. \"Maybe they don't deserve it?\" Einstein thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should he do the next day?</span></div></div>",

Cars was stopping and honking at him as he run along before he dissapeared into an alley. Oliver didn't know at first what was wrong with this dog. It wasn't a very tall dog, he looked to be about just a few inches taller then a full grown cat. But there was something else about his looks. Oliver had seen that he had a collar with a tag that looked like a lighting bolt, and he had also seen the same symbol on the dogs fur. Thinking back Oliver remembers looking at pictures of strange people dressed in suits with symbols like that in comics that Jenny read. She had said to him that those people was \"heroes\", whose job was to safe the world from evil bad guys. \"Then this dog must be one of those hero types!\" Oliver figured out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying a word to neither Georgette or Jenny, Oliver took off and started to run into the alley after the dog. Once there he looked around and saw some white fur sticking out from under some rags. He approached it carefully as if to not startle him, but as soon as he touched his body with his paw the dog quickly jumped up from the trash and looked like he was going to attack. \"Who are you and who are you working for?!\" The dog asked threatening. \"Working for?\" Oliver asked confused and scared. \"Yes, Who send you to take care of me?!\" The dog asked back. \"A-All I wanted to do was to h-help you.\" Oliver said super afraid that the dog would end him any second now, but instead the dog became more confused by this. \"Help me? Why would I need help?\" He asked. \"Because you looked a bit lost, and maybe needed someone to guide you?\" Oliver answered carefully. The dog took a moment to look at his surroundings while saying, \"I have to admit I might need some directions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a lot of courage Oliver said, \"My name is Oliver. What's yours?\" \"The name is Bolt.\" The dog said. \"Oh, Just like the thing on you're collar and body.\" Oliver said. \"Yes. The very symbol of me.\" Bolt said proud. \"Are you a hero mister Bolt?\" Oliver asked. \"Yes. Yes I am kid.\" Bolt answers. \"I'm a dog with the greatest power in existence. Powers soo strong that a single bark from me has the power to destroy this whole city.\" \"Wow!\" Oliver said amazed. \"I'm currently on a mission to save my owner Penny from the evil clutches of Doctor Calico, my arch nemesis, but I have no idea where I am, or where she is...\" Bolt said before his stomach interrupted him. \"And I haven't been eating for a while.\" He said a bit embarassed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver didn't know what to do first. This dog was acting a bit strange and he had been a bit agressive to him at first, but he both looked, talked, and acted just like a hero from one of those comicbooks would act, and if what he said was true then Oliver needed to anything he could to help him. And the best way to do soo right now seems to be to help him get food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He quickly gave him the street address to Jenny's home, and then he went back to join Jenny and Georgette. As they all three walked back home Oliver could see the dog called \"Bolt\" leave the alley and run of in the opposite direction. \"I wonder if I will see that mysterious dog again?\" Oliver thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at home things went on as usual, but later on the evening things would be a bit different. Oliver woke up during the night and felt he needed to have a midnight snack. When he got to the kitchen he heard the sound of something hitting the window. Looking out he saw that it was that strange dog from before standing outside throwing pebbles at the window. \"Bolt!\" Oliver said happily surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took and open the window, and to his surprise saw that despite the dog looking very hungry and weak still managed to take a huge leap and reach up to the kitchen window. Once inside Bolt took a moment to really take in the new environment he was in. It was really big and warm, not exactly the kind of home he would have expected a simple cat to live in. Suddenly he heard a very familiar sound coming from him. It was his stomach, still hungry for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need anything to eat?\" Oliver asked him when he too heard Bolt's stomach make it's sound. But before the dog had any chance to answer they both heard the sound of someone upstairs making their way down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is it?</span></div></div>",

(But she like to call herself Wa-Wa for short) She's working as a stand up comedian, and she will become Tito's love interest in the story. (While Tito is still together with Georgette, creating a love triangle)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack story: She was born and raised in New York city, She was fat already as a pup, and got bullied a lot by other pups because of that. All the mean things they said only made her want to stay inside and eat more, which only lead to more bulling, which only lead to more eating...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was feeling at most sad her mother decided to take her to see a comedy show to try and make her happy. In this show was a dog that had only three legs (He lost one in a traffic accident) , and made jokes about that. He made all kinds of jokes like \"In racers I'm only worth three quarters of the bets!\" or \"I'll give my right hind leg for that.\". Wa-Wa laughed at his jokes but felt bad at the same time laughing at his missing one limb. But she saw how other dogs laughed at him, and how he just took it into him as something good that made her feel comfortable laughing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the show she asked her mother if she could get back staged and talk to the limped dog, and she said yes. Once she meet him she told him that being laughed at herself for her weight she could never think about laughing at him at first, feeling it would be a really mean thing to do. He told her that he too had been in the same situation as her, being made fun of for being the only one three legged had made him feel bad too, but once he realized he could take their \"bad\" laughter and turn it into \"good\" laughter he thought he could use his disadvantage to his own advantage. He asked her to tell him a joke about her weight, and even thought her mother thought it was very rude of him to force her daughter into doing something like that she decided to do it, and gave him her best try. After telling a joke that she just managed to make up on the spot the three legged dog was quiet for a moment, and then bursted out laughing out loud at it. Feeling how his laugher worked as adrenaline to her she immediately gave him another joke, and then another one, and then another one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for other comedy act sitting next to them to also get involved in the act, and once they heard one joke from her they too where laughing uncontrollably. Even her own mother found her funny side after a while and was just so happy to see her daughter being happy herself. Once she finally felt that she run out of jokes to tell the three legged dog told her that she had great potential to become a great name in the business, and that she could always use comedy as a way to make her feel better about herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd since then she has been a hardworking stand up comedian that shows that no matter what others thinks about your looks, you yourself is the one that makes the final choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe has a very joke filled attitude. Both on stage and in private she like to pull prank and tell jokes. (Often using her own fatness as a source.) She also is a very \"down to earth\" dog, not being as full of herself like other famous dogs. (Like Georgette.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Just so you know she can go on a diet and loose her weight if she wants, but she wont. No only because it would take away a big part of her act, but she herself has also been living her whole life like this, and she also likes it very much. Her fat is part of her both symbolically and physically.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Inspiration for her is a sketched picture on furaffinity by the user Dutch. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/view/6306952/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.furaffinity.net/view/6306952/...</a> )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWould you like the story to be about her?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ever since getting together Tito and Georgette had been trying new things to do together to try and find a common interest, but they turned out to be VERY different. While Georgette liked things like fashion show, modelling, and romantic movies Tito preferred wrestling, gambling, and action films. They had both tried to convince the other one to test the others interest, but no one would want to chance. The whole situation seemed to be unsolvable, until Georgette got the idea of trying something that none of them had ever tried before and see if that would bring them closer together. The only thing now was to figure out what they should try. It wasn't until Georgette saw an ad in the newspaper about a \"Dog Special: Stand Up Night.\" None of them had ever been at a stand up club evening before so it would be a unique experience for both of them. They both very quickly decided that this would be great, and made it an evening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater at the club Georgette and Tito both had no idea of just how fun this would turned out to be. All night they had been seeing many funny dogs doing their stand up routines, all from a very tall Great Dane male talking about how strange it is being friends with dogs that was so much smaller as full grown adults then he had been as a pup, to a female Saluki telling about the day when she realized just how ridiculously similar lifestyles both her and her owner had, to a male poodle talking about how hard it was being a male and having everyone he met believing that he either was a female or a very \"feminine\" male. After he was done a Dalmatian male came out on stage (that was the organizer of the show), and told everyone that there was one \"special\" guest left. \"And now ladies and gentledogs it's time for me to present one of the literally biggest names of show business. Yes, even bigger then Big George. (The Great Dane from earlier) Give a round of applauds to Whitney Awa Henriksen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs everybody gave a big applaud for her as she entered the stage some of them stopped applauding in shock when they saw her. They weren't lying when they said she was \"one of the biggest names\" in standup comedy. She was a Chihuahua female that was at least eight times the dog when it comes to weight. As she waddled in everyone could see how her entire body was shaking with every step. How her swollen cheeks and extra chins made her face much more \"filling\". Her chest was puffing out with a great distance and so was her stomach. And even though they couldn't see her from behind they still knew that she must have one wide read end. The only parts of her that looked kinda non-fat was her legs (that still was a bit more meaty then on normal dogs of her breed), and her tail that looked ridiculously small compared to the rest of her. As for her choice of being dressed for the evening she had a small English bowler hat (She used it as a part of her famous impersonation of an English bulldog. She was good at doing both a British accent and a male voice, and she of course had the right physics to make it complete.), and a collar with rubber bone attached on it that she used as a funny signal to give after telling one of her jokes. Seeing this colossus of a dog's body shake as she walked was simply disgusting for Georgette, while Tito couldn't stop staring at the beauty of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she got to the microphone she took a moment to take in the environment before saying, \"Good Evening New York City!!!\". \"Good Evening Wa-Wa!!!\" Almost the whole crowd shouted back at her. (Tito and Georgette being the exception of course.) She knew she would get that answer and she loved hearing it every time. \"Let me introduce myself. My name is Whitney Awa Henriksen, but I like you to just call me Wa-Wa.\" The fat Chihuahua said as the start of her routine. \"I know what you're thinking now, have someone taken and shrunk the head and legs of a well feed bulldog?\" She asked showing of how little her legs where compared to her belly. This tore down another great laughter from the audience. Some of them had seen her tell this joke before so they what would come next, but they still laughed like mad. \"Well all I can say to that is...\" She said before taking a break to keep the crowd on their seats for the punch line. \"As long as me staff keeps feeding me, who am I to complain?\" she said in her flawless impersonation of a male British bulldog. For all of those who had seen her before this was classic Wa-Wa stick they where watching, but for someone like Tito who saw it for the first time this was one of the most amazing comedy acts he had ever seen. He just knew he had to go see her afterward and let her know just how much he loved her act. (And maybe more then so.) \"I can't believe you find this overstuffed sauces funny.\" Georgette whispered to Tito, who only replayed \"Well, it was your idea to get here in the first place.\" back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould we jump to after the show where Tito goes to meet Wa-Wa backstage, or should we watch some more of her routine?</span></div></div>",

Knowing that Georgette wasn't so keen about her he decided to go and meet her alone. \"You can go home before me dear, I am just going to...see if they have something nice in the gift shop for me to buy.\" Tito made up as an excuse to Georgette, who seemed to believe it. \"Okay, see you back at home.\" She said before leaving. \"That was almost to easy.\" Tito thought, thinking that Georgette would have seen through his badly acted lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce at the entrance to the changing rooms Tito saw a big Doberman guarding the door. Even though he was getting a bit afraid getting close to him, (Still having bad memories of Roscoe and Desoto.) he took courage and walked up to him. The Doberman looked down at him and Tito carefully asked if it was possible to meet and greet \"Miss seniorrita Wa-Wa\" as Tito called her. The Doberman told him that almost no one of the dogs performing here likes to get disturbed by fans, \"But lucky for you miss Wa-Wa happens to be one of those few who is most glad to meet anyone that she has been helping making their lives a bit more happier.\" The Doberman finished and let Tito pass. \"Her dressing room is the one on the right at the very end of the corridor.\" He said before closing the door behind Tito.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tito walked through the small hallway he could see some doors being slightly open, and inside he could see some of the other dogs that had preformed resting inside. Some of them where reading some book or newspaper, some where eating or drinking, and some where just taking a quick sleep. He took small glances on many of them, but made sure to not stare for to long since they would notice and be upset. His goal was to get to the last door on the right at the end of corridor and nothing else. His plan was that once he got there he wa going to tell her how much he enjoyed her act, and then maybe ask her if she wanted to come over for dinner back at his and Georgette's place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there he saw that unlike many of the other acts she seemed to prefer to have her door completely closed. This made Tito a bit more nervous since now he would have to knock on her door to get her attention. After some moments of courage building he took and knocked on her door. From inside he heard her say \"Who is it?\" in a very calm and kind voice. Hearing this Tito got a bit more calm and safely said \"It's a fan that would very much like to meet you.\" \"Oh, then just come in and close the door after you.\" Wa-Wa answered very quickly. Almost not believing this was for real Tito took and open the door to her dressing room and walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside Tito saw that Wa-Wa...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Close the door if you please.\" He heard Wa-Wa say, and he did so immediately. Turning back to her after doing so Tito found himself staring right into the huge butt of Wa-Wa. She was having a very small changing room, and given her big size that didn't make things better. Trying to look over her big behind Tito could see her face in the reflection of the mirror in the room. \"If you want me to wait outside until you're done I can do that.\" Tito said while standing on his hind legs to be able to see her in the eyes while talking. \"No you can stay.\" Wa-Wa answered casually back. \"But...\" Tito said while having his eyes quickly go back to the butt of Wa-Wa, \"Wouldn't it be better to be able to see me in the eyes when we talk?\" He managed to get out, while slightly distracted. \"It's okay. I'm soon done getting dressed.\" He heard Wa-Wa say. \"Oh okay...Wait, you are naked?!\" Tito asked shocked, as he lost his balance and fell down onto the floor. \"I'm without my collar on me so yeah, I guess so.\" Wa-Wa said still as casual as ever. Tito felt a bit strange inside. He knew dogs where pretty much naked all the time, but they all had some kind of accessories on themselves. Some had collars or scarf's like Georgette or Dodgers, or a headband like him. Knowing that this lady wasn't wearing anything and staring at her butt once again made Tito feel a bit more awkward of staring (And a bit turned on.) \"Um,\" He said while doing his balance act once again, \"Are you really sure you don't want me to wait outside?\" \"You can stay where you are.\" Wa-Wa said. \"And you,\" She said looking him straight in the eyes via the mirror. \" Yes?\" Tito asked curious. \"You don't look to comfortable standing like that, don't you?\" She asked. \"No I don't.\" Tito answered, trying to sound as normal as he could. \"Why don't you take and stand normally while you talk to me?\" She asks. \"Well...I...\" Tito tried to give a honest answer, but he didn't want to make it sound like he was a pervert. \"It's just that...you wont probably be able to hear me if I don't stand up on my hind legs.\" He finally managed to say. \"I could hear you when you where outside of my dressing room, and you could hear me.\" She said, making Tito's argument invalid. Knowing he didn't have any other reason to give why he didn't want to speak this way with her Tito accepted defeat, and got down on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was it something else you wanted?\" Wa-Wa asked. \"Well, I came here both to say that I really liked your stand up show.\" Tito said, starting to sound very casual in his tone as well now. \"Oh how sweet of you.\" He heard Wa-Wa say. \"And I also got over here to ask you if you wanted too...\" Tito stopped when he saw that Wa-Wa's huge rear was starting to shake from side to side a little. Still being so close to it Tito had even more trouble ignoring it now. \"Uhm, do you have any troubles back there?\" Tito asked, starting to get a bit scared that she was going to start move her big bottom right into him. \"Oh that, I'm just trying too fit my collar around my neck, and that's not so easy.\" She said in-between shakes. \"If you want to I could help you put it on.\" Tito said, trying his best to break the hypnosis he felt he was starting to get by watching Wa-Wa's shaking. \"I've done it hundreds of times before alone. I think I can fix it. It will just take some time. What was the other thing you wanted to ask about?\" She asked curious. \"Oh that, uhm.\" Tito tried to find words but Wa-Wa's butt looked like it was shaking a bit more then before. \"I just wanted to tell you that since you where so great at stage and I really liked you I thought that maybe you would be interested in getting something more for your hard work, something more then just you're regular salary. Not that it is something wrong with what you earn, I think you must be getting paid a lot for it, being so good at doing comedy like you do and...\" Okay Tito was convinced now. Her well round rump was shaking much, much more then before! Even it's rhythms seemed to be moving in a much more seductive way then before. \"AND I would very much like that someone like you should be given something more then the ordinary, since you are so gifted and talented and good and...ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T NEED ANY HELP WITH YOUR COLLAR??!!!\" Tito shouted, finally finding it impossible to ignore Wa-Wa's butt shaking as a result of her struggling to get her collar on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he asked that the butt shaking suddenly stopped and Wa-Wa turned her entire body around to show Tito her collar sitting around her neck. \"I got it on a looooong time ago.\" Wa-Wa said and laughed at her own prank. Tito felt really embarrassed over being tricked like that, and by the fact that Wa-Wa had known he had been staring this whole time. \"Was it something that kept you distracted from just talking normally to me?\" She asked and made motions that made her behind parts shake again. \"Maybe some things.\" Tito managed to say with blushed checks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

What was it you wanted to ask me?\" Wa-Wa asked, sounding a bit more serious this time. \"What I wanted to ask you was if you wanted to come over to my place for dinner one night?\" Tito said in the kind of serious and straight on way he had wished to say from the start. \"Oh.\" Wa-Wa said, in a bit of a sad way. \"Listen. you are really sweet Tito, but I just can't go home to complete stranger and have dinner. It's not a very safe thing to do.\" \"I understand.\" Tito said, feeling very disappointed. \"I think I should go.\" He said and turned his back to walk out. \"I think Georgette might be waiting for me at home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" He heard Wa-Wa shout from behind him. \"Yes, what is it?\" Tito asked confused. \"Are you telling me that you are together with Georgette. The Georgette?\" Wa-Wa asked sounding very excited. \"Uhm yeah. Why do you ask that...\" Tito managed to say before getting attacked by Wa-Wa's screams of joy. \"Oh my god! Oh my god! You have no idea but I LOVE to read about gossips, and one of my favourite dogs to read about is Georgette the modelling poodle. There is always so many wonderful scandals about everything she says and does that you could make whole newspapers just about her.\" She said while being so excited that she managed to make her fat jump several times, making the ground Tito stood on shake. She was acting a lot like his bellowed Georgette when she was shopping for new clothes. \"I remember reading about her getting together with some troublemaker living on the streets, but I could never guess it was you.\" She said getting really close face to face. \"Well, since getting together I live the high life so I don't need to work hard to get some riches.\" Tito said as an awkward way to give her an answer. \"We where both sitting here and watched your show Wa-Wa.\" Tito said. \"And I didn't see you. Just my luck.\" Wa-Wa said feeling like she missed her only chance at seeing her favourite celebrity. \"You know, I still got that dinner for you if you want to.\" Tito told her again, this time feeling more sure she would take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he was right in believing so since Wa-Wa gave him several quick \"Yes\" to make sure he did understand. \"I wouldn't want to do anything else then to see with my own eyes how a typical evening in Georgette's crazy life is.\" \"Then should next Friday sound like a good day to come.\" Tito asked. \"Yes, I think so.\" Wa-Wa answered after some thought. \"And I guess I won't have to tell you where we live?\" Tito asked feeling he would already know the answer. \"I have been reading enough magazines to know just everyway there is to go there.\" Wa-Wa said. \"In that case I guess I leave now and we all three see each other next Friday.\" Tito said and started to leave when...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After making up the plans for the dinner with Wa-Wa Tito thought there would be no problems telling his wife about it, turns out it wasn't that easy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was trying to put it up nicely to make it easier when he got to the point of it, but every time he even mentions the club or \"stand up\" in general all Georgette would say was how much she hated that \"Pig disguised as a dog\". So Tito always took and decided to wait later to tell her. \"Not a smart idea to anger the beast.\" Tito thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the day had arrived and Tito had still not managed to tell Georgette about the \"guest\" they would be having tonight. All he had managed to tell her was that he wanted the dinner for tonight to be \"extra nice\", and when Georgette asked him why he was so interested in just tonight's dinner he only managed to say \"Just to have a romantic evening together\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't until Georgette was in the middle of making the dinner that Tito finally took courage to tell her the truth, but even then he took it gently. \"Uhm, sweetie?\" He said almost whispering to her. \"Yes dear?\" She answered calmly while cooking the food. \"There is something I have been trying to tell you a long time without being able to do so before.\" Tito said while keeping his eyes down from Georgette for fear of what to come. \"And what would that be?\" Georgette asked, turning her head to look down at Tito while still cooking. \"We might have a guest for dinner tonight.\" He said almost wanting to leave after saying it. This made Georgette actually stop with what she was doing and turn around to look her husband in the eyes. \"What?\" She asked sounding really upset, and with good reasons. \"I invited another dog to eat with us.\" Tito said, once again not daring to say it was Wa-Wa he was talking about. He expected Georgette to freak out and get furious over it, but instead all she could say was. \"And how do you expect that this food I am making for us is suppose to feed three?\" Tito being surprised over that that was her biggest concern simply answered. \"Well, you always make food with the intention for two dogs your size. And since I'm barley able to eat half a portion of my dish, and you always thinking about your figure it is at least another whole portion that becomes leftovers each time.\" He felt really smart for thinking that out on the spot (Not counting on the fact that someone like Wa-Wa possibly could eat two Georgette sized meals as her own dinner) , and Georgette seems to buy it. \"Alright.\" She said after a moment of thinking, \"I guess we can have one of you friends over for tonight without any problems, but next time you should tell me earlier.\" She said before getting back to the cooking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTito felt really relieved of that everything seemed to be solved. So much so that it wasn't until there was a knock on the door that it hit him Who he had been inviting. \"Is that the guest already here?\" Georgette asked. \"I think so.\" Tito said nervously. \"I'm nowhere near done, why is this guest so early?\" Georgette asked, a bit frustrated over her husband putting up the pressure on her. \"I must have forgot to tell her the time.\" Tito said, before realizing what word he had just said next to Georgette. \"She?\" He heard her say with that familiar tone of suspecting her husband cheating on her, like she always did when he had been hanging with some unknown female dog. \"Yes. She's a she.\" Tito said with confidence. \"She's a friend and nothing more. I could never find anyone that could possible replace you my majestic flower.\" He told her, while thinking (Although that Wa-Wa is pretty close second.). \"So what should you suggest we do now with the food no where near done yet?\" Georgette asked, wanting to see if her husband already had some plan thought out for it. \"I can just show her around the house while you finish it up. Giving how much wonderful prizes of you there is to show it might take much more time then necessary to let you have time to put it up nicely on the table.\" Tito said, knowing that talking about Georgette's all prizes always made her think about her greatness. \"I guess that could be a good way to spend some time.\" Georgette said while thinking about it for a small moment. \"Alright, let her in while I stay here.\" She finally said. \"Aye, Aye darling.\" Tito said and went off to let Wa-Wa in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of the door was Wa-Wa, looking as pretty as always to Tito. She wasn't wearing her boulder hat like she did at the club, and instead of her \"joke\" collar she was now wearing a beautifully golden collar with a small diamond hanging in front of it. Wa-Wa could see that Tito was totally mesmerised by the sight of her and she asked jokingly, \"What do you think?\" \"I think you look as pretty as a new blossomed flower.\" Tito said not braking his stare. \"Oh, fancy words for me? Is there a hint of love I see?\" Wa-Wa asked playfully, and Tito immediately broke from his trance to say, \"What? No, no, no. That's crazy. I can't be in love since I already have a wife. He, he.\" He said, pretending to laugh at the thought about him loving her. (Even thought he knew inside that he had been feeling just that ever since he first saw her.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to change the subject Tito asked if she wanted to come inside, which she said yes to with no doubt. Once inside Tito told her that Georgette was to busy working up the food to see her right now so he thought it would be better if they both took and wondered around the house during the time it would take. Wa-Wa was really excited over it. She had been reading so many articles about how it looks inside Georgette's house, but seeing it herself was something new. Every things in every room was like a holy museum artefact to her, and to meet Georgette herself would be the great final to everything. \"Oh, I can't wait to meet Georgette in person. When I see I think I will flip out!\" She said excited to Tito. \"Not as much as she probably will.\" Tito said quietly to himself, dreading the moment when they had to meet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking around the whole house Wa-Wa felt she needed to rest her tired legs. Tito quickly lead her to a big bean bag laying in the living room., where she quickly laid herself down on her back. \"Was it the stairs that was to hard to walk or what was it?\" Tito asked worried, as he laid himself next to her. \"No, it's not that.\" Wa-Wa said, \"When you have a body like of course you will get tired easily. On the way here I had to rest at least three times before I got here.\" \"Don't you think that you should maybe...lose some weight?\" Tito asked after having a slight pause, fearing he had been stepping on a nerve on her there. \"Some times yes.\" Wa-Wa answered calmly. \"But there is so many times when I can do good and funny things with my body, that I can't help but loving it soo much. Do you remember when I had trouble putting my collar on?\" She asked, and could see on Tito blushing that he did remember it very well. \"When I get older I might have to do it to be able to move around better, but as long as I can still move will never get rid of a single pound!\" She said proud. Tito could do nothing more then agree on what she was saying. \"If you can't even love your own body, then who can you love?\" He thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly they both heard the sound of the kitchen timer going of meaning that the food was finished, and that Georgette would soon make her entrance to the room. Tito thought franticly over what he should do or say that would be best for the situation, but he couldn't think out anything that would work on Georgette when she was in her anger mood. All he could do was to wait for the inevitable to happen. Just as he heard Georgette was on her way Tito decided to get up from the bean bag, if anything he thought that having Georgette see him laying next to the dog she hated so much wouldn't be the best way to start of with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Georgette finally came through the door Tito was quick to try and make her look only at him as he tried his best to explain why she was there, and why he thought it was a good idea to invite her. But trying to hide the dog eight times his size from the dog that was having her head two feet higher up then he could reach was just as impossible as you could guess. He could see in her eyes that she was filled with disgust and annoyance over seeing that dog again, and also the fact that she was inside her own home gave her also a personal anger to it. She didn't say anything, and when Tito tried to speak to her all she said was. \"You and me. The kitchen. NOW!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot daring to speak against her now he and Georgette had to continue to have their talk inside the kitchen with closed doors, while Wa-Wa had to keep waiting on the bean bag. Once alone Georgette wasted no time by immediately ask Tito \"What do you mean by inviting HER into our house?!\" very angrily. \"Well...\" Tito started carefully, \"You said to me earlier that it was okay for me to invite a friend for dinner.\" \"But that was before I knew that the friend you where talking about was that sack of lard that is now laying on my bean sack.\" Georgette said, trying her hardest to find new things to call her. \"Hey! She's a very hard working entertainer! She has a very tight schedule to work with, and when I asked her if she wanted an evening with dinner at our place I didn't think she would have time, but she looked past a lot of things just find a day when she could get here. She has made a long trip to get here and if you still want her to go you will have to tell, cause I wont!\" Tito barked back, tired of hearing his wife say all these mean things to her. Georgette stared at her little man for a while (Being a bit impressed over how loud he could make his voice some times.), before saying....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You really want her to have this dinner?\" Georgette asked calmly, waiting to say what she thinks until Tito had answered. \"More then anything else. She needs a break for her hectic lifestyle.\" Tito answered, without any hesitation. \"Well then.\" Georgette said and turned away. \"I will let your friend have dinner together with us if it means so much for you and her.\" Tito was very surprised over hearing Georgette actually giving in to it. \"While I take and serve up the food, could you go and tell he that its time to eat?\" She asked in a much more nicer tone compared to just a couple of seconds ago. \"I will.\" Tito said and started walking back to the living room where Wa-Wa was waiting. But before he left he looked back at Georgette and said. \"And darling?\" \"Yes dear?\" Georgette asked, sounding a bit annoyed thinking that Tito still wanted her to do something more for that strange dog. \"I'm sorry that I yell at you. I just want to try and help a friend in need when I can.\" Tito said sounding a bit regretful over how he had been acting. \"I think I may have been judging a bit to hard as well.\" Georgette said and looked at her husband for comfort. \"I love you darling.\" Tito said. \"I love you to dear.\" Georgette said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Tito leaved the kitchen and came back to the living room he could feel how difficult things became. He had just said to Georgette that he loved her, but seeing Wa-Wa again laying with her cute belly up made Tito feel so heart-full inside again. Was it truly Georgette that he loved, or did his heart lay in charming and funny Wa-Wa?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo matter what he knew that what was important now was the dinner, and that's what he would be focusing on right now. \"The dinner is served now.\" He tried to told her, in the most \"normal\" sounding voice he could. \"Are you working as the staff at this place now or what?\" Wa-Wa jokingly said while getting off the bean bag. Tito once again had to admirer that girl's way of always finding something funny to say in almost every situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they both entered the kitchen they saw that Georgette had been preparing a nice meal for all of them. She had been cooking some nice juicy pieces of chicken breasts that was being served with some mashed potatoes, some roasted bits of unions, and a slightly spiced salsa sauce. She had originally planned on serving two pieces of chicken to herself and Tito, but since he told her about him inviting a third dog she had changed it to her still having two while the other two each had a single chicken breast. Since she was much bigger then  the two other Georgette thought it would be enough for them all, but knowing now that it was Wa-Wa Tito had invited she didn't felt so sure anymore. Wa-Wa noticed that it also was some lighted candles and rose petals spread all over the table. \"Where you planning on something romantic?\" Wa-Wa asked, while seeing how Tito was getting a little ashamed of her asking. \"Yes. Tito wanted me to make tonight dinner a bit special, but that was before he had told me that the something special was you.\" Georgette said, and tried to not sound a even a little bit upset over her husband not telling about Wa-Wa coming here until she was standing cooking the dinner for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey decided to get to their sets, and while Georgette had no problems getting on her chair Tito had to jump up because of his small size, and then there was Wa-Wa. Seeing her standing next to the big chair with her small fat body Tito realized very quickly that she wouldn't be able to jump up like he did, so he leaned over to Georgette and whispered \"Miss Wa-Wa seems to have trouble getting up.\" \"And what do you suggest I will do about it?\" Georgette asked, not understanding where he was going with it. \"Maybe you should help her get up?\" Tito asked back, sounding a bit more serious his tone. \"Why me?\" Georgette said, sounding really surprised that she should do it. \"She is your friend, so why don't you do it?\" She asked back to him. \"Because of her \"uh hum\" size, I wouldn't be able to lift her with my small body. And since you are so much bigger and stronger then me, I'm begging you to do it.\" Tito said, sounding really concern this time. \"Fine.\" Georgette said after a moment of thinking and got off her chair to help Wa-Wa up, and since she couldn't keep herself balanced while picking her up with her paws Georgette would have to use her head instead. Sighing she walked over to Wa-Wa and told her that she would help her get up, and before she knew it she found her face pressed deep into the fat butt of Wa-Wa, as she was pressing her up towards her seat. Remembering the event that took place at the changing room Tito felt a bit jealous on his wife getting to experience this. After what felt like an hour long of smelly torture Wa-Wa was able to get up on her chair, and Georgette could go back to her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally starting the dinner all three of them started enjoying the food Georgette had been taking the time to make. They all had different ways of eating. Georgette was as predicted very keen on her manners and actually used the forks and knife a bit like humans do to make everything she sticks in her mouth just large enough, without making a mess of things. Something that her husband used to do when he was a single guy, but ever since meeting Georgette his manners had started to change a little. He was still eating with his paws and was digging his head down to eat, but he tried much more to not make a mess out of things when he eat, and he also took some breaks in-between mouthfuls to really feel the taste of things. The one that was actually eating must like a dog was Wa-Wa, who was just pressing her face into the plate all-time and eating like she was a pig. Still nothing of what she ate ended up outside the plate or on the table, much to Georgette and Tito's surprise. She loved Georgette's cooking so much that she made sure nothing got wasted, and once she was done with the plate she still had two mouthfuls of food all over her face, which she just licked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter eating they all three just sat there and let the food rest inside of them. Mostly Wa-Wa, who's belly stood out even more then usual (If that even was possible). While Georgette and Tito had both had a portion that suited their body size's Wa-Wa had been having a Georgette sized portion instead, making her much more full inside then the other two. \"I'll have to say not only is your husband a nice guy for thanking me for my show, but that he invites me to your home as well.\" Wa-Wa said while rubbing her stomach. \"Sounds like you are a big fan of my husband.\" Georgette said, having those nasty jealous feeling coming back, scaring Tito that things may end up ugly. That is until Wa-Wa (Not noticing Georgette's jealousness) says, \"What? No, I'm a huge fan of you.\" \"Wait what?\" Georgette said, not at all expecting her to say that. \"You are a fan, of me?\" \"Yes absolute. I love following everything the headlines says about you, and all the articles that gets published.\" Wa-Wa continued talking, making Georgette much more calmer and liking her more and more. \"In fact I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for your husband telling me that he was together with you.\" She finished, having Georgette feeling great regret for everything she had said and thought about her before. \"But of course, you should be here. I mean why wouldn't someone that has such great taste in dogs not be.\" Georgette said, sounding very into herself as usual. While starting to ramble about how great she is Wa-Wa leaned over to Tito and whispered. \"I had a feeling before that she didn't like me, but I know that if I just stroke her ego a little she would start becoming a fan of me as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the dinner everyone seemed to be in a much more nicer mood then when it started, and when Wa-Wa was about to go Georgette said \"If you ever want to come back just ask.\" \"I will.\" Wa-Wa said and started heading to the door. Tito was quick to get over there to greet her farewell, and before leaving Wa-Wa looked over to see that Georgette wasn't near before whispering \"And I think I might like meeting just you sometimes to.\" into Tito's ear before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis left Tito standing there, looking over as Wa-Wa's great wide back side turned around a corner and was gone. The words she had said to him was still getting processed trough his brain. \"Meeting me alone.\" Was the only sentence he could make out from it, but should he do it? Should he go out and meet her in secret, or should he tell Georgette about what was going on?</span></div></div>",

Still everybody in the audience loved it all, or rather everyone except for Georgette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor her this was the lowest excuse for anything called comedy she had ever seen. \"A fat disgusting blob telling everyone just ridiculously obese she is. How in the heck is that funny?\" Georgette thought to herself angrily. She wanted just to leave, but since her husband Tito was with her she felt that it would be very rude towards him to do. Still she felt that she wouldn't probably be able to take much more of this. She hated just about everything about her. How she looked so stupid wearing her little bowler hat and rubber toy collar, how her fatty body was making her sweat like crazy under the spotlights, \"After tonight's performance I think I will have to eat a lot backstage to regain those 5 pounds I must have sweat away performing for you.\" Wa-Wa said, getting another avalanche of applauses from the crowd. \"See! She just admitted herself just how much of a slob she is!\" Georgette thought highly, but to herself. \"Why can't nobody else see the same things I see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not so much for keeping myself pretty as you can see. I just think it's a lot of extra work for honestly, very little payoff.\" Wa-Wa said and pointed towards Georgette and Tito in the crowd. \"I mean just look on those two. The lady have probably spent 3 hours on hair and makeup making herself look good for tonight while her partner looks like he just wake up looking like this and decided to go with it.\" Everyone looked at Georgette and Tito and laughed at Wa-Wa's observation. Tito laughed as well, telling Georgette how true that was, while Georgette felt that this was her last straw. \"I can let her do this thing she calls entertainment if there actually is dogs liking this sort of thing, but I'm NOT letting her get away making me look like a fool! And this makeup and hair only took me two hours to put on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgette was really on the warpath now, and she was not going to quit it until she had told that stand up comedian a thing or two about what she thought of her. \"Can't anyone see just how vulgar and disgusting this thing looks?\" Georgette asked loudly as she stood up and pointed at Wa-Wa. The whole room got quiet and first looked at Georgette, and then at Wa-Wa to see how she would take it. Wa-Wa was a bit surprised to the poodle she just made fun of talking back to her, but she was very quick to reply, \"Yes they can. And if I get a mirror you can see it as well.\" This got the entire room on track of laughing again, this time over how well Wa-Wa had been taking the bad criticism and turned it back against the one saying it. Georgette felt how she had gone from making them the truth (Her vision), to making her the laughing stock of the place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that all you wanted to say or do you have something more?\" Wa-Wa asked, sounding like she was challenging Georgette now to insult her again. Taking the bait Georgette took and once again gave the worst insult she could give her. \"Do you often get compared to a pig?!\" She asked aggressively, creating some \"Oooooh's\" from the audience. Wa-Wa looked even more comfortable this time, answering even faster back to Georgette \"Yes, but they always think that's the worst thing they could be compared to.\" As if Georgette didn't feel angry enough that the chihuahua blimp managed to get another roaring applauses and laughter's she really got mad when the dog on stage said, \"I've heard that on almost every day, can't you give me something original?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, if you want original. I will give you that!\" Georgette thought, and tried her hardest think out another great insult to throw at her. \"Tell me if you have heard this before.\" Georgette shouted to get her attention. (Which she has been having all the time since this started.) \"You are insignificant, incompetent, and nobody likes your looks.\" Georgette said coldly. \"No, since I have never met you i don't know what other dogs likes to call you.\" Wa-Wa answers back quickly once again, sending another wave of her audience support right onto Georgette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the applause Wa-Wa started to ignore Georgette's actions by saying, \"You know that last one wasn't even a fat joke, so has anyone else better insults they would like to throw at me?\" Many in the audience felt unsure, not wanting to say anything bad to her. But Wa-Wa really made it sound fun by saying, \"Come on! How many celebrities do you know that gives their audience a chance to make fun of themselves? Take this chance to let you imagination go loose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon there was several dogs throwing fat jokes towards her which she every time manages to send back to the one saying it, making them feel like a moron for saying it in the first place. Georgette didn't know what to do now. She wanted say what she thought to her and make her feel bad, but now several other dogs where doing the same thing as a joke. She wondered if she should just give up and leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she choose?</span></div></div>",

One day he meet a Jack Russell Terrier called Dodger, who makes a deal with him. If he can help him steal a bunch of hotdogs, he can get some to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter being chased throughout half of New York city by the angry hotdog salesman, Oliver and Dodger managed to find a place to hide from him. The place they choose (Or rather Dodger choose and Oliver followed blindly.) was an old abounded balloon factory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was one of those place where Dodger had found out was not taken over by any other dogs, so he called it his personal hideout. This was a place where nobody (not even his own gang) could find him in, and where he could just chill and relax as he felt like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he dropped the hotdogs and was preparing himself for a good meal he suddenly heard some panting sounds from behind him. Looking back he saw that it was that little cat from earlier, that seemed to have manage to follow him all the way here. \"What are you doing here?\" Dodger asked the cat, who answered in between breaths. \"You...Promise...We...Share.\" \"Say that again?\" Dodger said, wondering if he had heard wrong. \"You promise me that you would share those hotdogs with me if I helped you.\" Oliver said, having catch his breath now so he could talk normally. \"Did I promise that?\" Dodger asked, just playing with the cat. (Of course he remembers it, he said it just to have the cat help him and then leave it behind. He would never believe that the little fur ball actually would be able to catch up to him.) \"Yes! Yes you did!\" The cat said, sounding a bit annoyed over the dog tricking him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I guess I can give you something.\" Dodger said, making the cat believe that he actually made Dodger cooperate with him. \"But...\" He said, making Oliver listen. \"I want you to close your eyes, and open your mouth wide.\" \"W-Why?\" The cat asked slightly nervous. \"If you really want to have anything you will have to trust me, or else you can just leave with nothing.\" Dodger said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you choose he asked. Oliver knew that he must be planning something fishy, but it did sounded better then leaving with absolutely nothing. So with no more hesitation's Oliver closed his eyes, open his mouth wide, and waited. At first he thought that the dog would just run away and leave him like this, but then he felt something entering his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he didn't feel the taste of hotdogs from it he open his eyes and saw that he had shoved in his mouth...</span></div></div>",

He took and spied on the insides of the houseboat from a window on the celling. He could see Dodger and the hotdogs, then he saw four more dogs! 3 males and one female. The female one looked to be a Saluki, while the other three was a Bulldog, a Great Dane and a Chihuahua. He thought it whould be best to just stop here and go home again giving that the hotdogs wasn\u00b4t going to be worth the risk, but just as he made a quick move to leave he slipt and fell through the open window.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he landed he hoped that what he was seeing was nothing more then a nightmare. All of the four other dogs where staring and snarling at him. He tried to explane himself but they wouldn\u00b4t belive him. \"Let\u00b4s eat him!\" he heard the small little chihuahua say. Even if he was really scared by the thought of being eaten by the dogs he was surprised to hear the threat come from the smallest of the dogs. He was actually bigger then that dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as it looks like Olive was going to become a dogs dinner Fagin (their owner) came back home. All the dogs forgets Oliver for a moment to say hello to their master. Fagin sees Oliver but dosen\u00b4t get how the situation is. \"Have you brought a cat in her? You know that we have it hard with enough food given as many as we already are.\" But then he saw into Oliver eyes with beaging. (Most of being saved from the dogs, but Fagin didn\u00b4t knew that.) \"I think I have to think about this for a moment\" he said while scratching his head. \"I think I take some of the dogs for a walk and try to figure out a way on how to solve it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich two dogs does Fagin take for walk?</span></div></div>",

They just all was staring at Oliver, and Oliver didn't know what to do. Every time he tried to talk to any of the dogs he just got an angry stare that made him quiet. He was wondering what was going to happen to him when Fagin come back with Dodger and Rita?<br>\r\nWhere they going to let him go?<br>\r\nWas he going to live with them?<br>\r\nOr was something terrible going to happen to him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden the chihuahua one snapped. \"Why are we doing this!?

Francis <u>could</u> do something, but he know from experience that it was just a waste of time. He could throw Tito around the room, but the little dog was like a little rubber ball that would just bounce back again. So he just said \"Sure, do it. But it is on your own risk.\" He then told Einstein to not do anything either, so that if something bad would happen it would be all Tito\u00b4s fault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTito took some steps towards Oliver, who started to try and run away with Tito just behind him.</span></div></div>",

That little bit of distance that was between them also seemed to get smaller to Oliver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the sudden Oliver made a wrong step and fell. All Oliver could do now was to curl up and hope or the best. Tito, how had now finally caught up with the cat laugh evilly when he saw how scared the little kitten was. He suddenly stopped laughing witch's made Oliver take the paws of his face to see why. Only to get his face clawed by Tito!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll while Tito started to walk around the scared little kitten he continues to laugh and talk superior about how Oliver is going to be his meal. What he didn't know was that while Oliver was covering his scarred face something in his head snapped. When Tito had hit him he felt how his psyche had made him first now realize that he was much bigger then this dog. It had made him feel more stronger and more furious. The dog was going to pay for what he'd done against Oliver. And with an evil smile behind his paws he knew just how.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Tito didn't notice Oliver made a run towards a stack of junk. Tito took off after the cat, knowing that he could never forgive himself for letting a meal get away that easy. Oliver started to run up the stack and Tito followed him. When he reached the top of it he waited until Tito had almost catch's up to him, before he jumped down back to the floor. Tito who was being a bit tired from chasing him knew that he needed to be quick to follow the cat if he didn't want him to get away. But what he didn't know was that as soon as Oliver had landed and Tito had jumped after him Oliver stopped and turn around to face Tito still in mid-air. Tito could then see when he was falling against the cat that he open his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Tito could think he fell head first into the cats open mouth. When Oliver closed his mouth he could see that Tito's hind legs and tail still was outside him and trying to wriggle their was out. Oliver looked at Francis and Einstein who just was to shocked for the moment to do something. He gave them a evil looking smile and swallowed the rest of the little chihuahua. He then laid down on the ground with the wonderful felling of having the little dog kicking in his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's the thing you told before that is called <i>Irony</i>?\" Einstein said about the situation. This made Francis to wake up from his shock and realize what just happen. The kitten that had just fallen in to their home had just eaten their friend whole and alive. This made him really angry, and Oliver could see that it was best to escape now.</span></div></div>",

It was very distracting to have all that movement inside going around when trying to escape the place, but Oliver just had to keep it together for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he dodged away from Francis Oliver made a quick dash towards the stair and the main exit out of the boat. It was guarded by Einstein, but he could see that the dog was pretty slow in the head so he had a good chance. With all his power he run up towards the Great Dane guarding, and escaped by running through the gap in between his legs. To make things better Einstein didn't even have time to try and stop him until Francis (who where cashing Oliver) was on his way of doing the same thing. This lead to Einstein pinning down the bulldog, and Oliver escaping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look what you have done now!\" Francis barked angrily at Einstein. \"That cat just ate our friend, and now he's escaped.\" \"But what should we do?\" The Great Dane asked. \"We go after him of course!\" Francis said, and he was on his way to run after the cat when Einstein stopped him again. \"But what will Fagin think when he comes back with Dodger and Rita if we are gone?\" He asked. \"If we wait we can lose the trace of the cat!\" Francis said. \"But if we wait we could be more looking for him.\" Einstein said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will they choose?</span></div></div>",

While Francis was a bigger dog and therefore faster he was also more clumsy in taking turns. The door and the windows where looked. So that gave Oliver as his only way out the same window from where he had entered the houseboat from the start. The only way for him to get up there in his condition and limit of time was to race up the same junk stack that he had used for to eat Tito. He had to get to the top and jump from there to reach the edge of the window. This was his only chance of escaping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe started his plan with running to the place where he had slipped when Tito was chasing him. If he could make Francis slipped to he would get a head start. He came to the slippery part and made sharp turn. Lucky for him Francis did fall, and those seconds it took for him to get up again was like hours for Oliver. He started to climb as fast as he could, and saw that Francis had started to run faster. At first Oliver thought it was to catch up, but then he realize that this was a part of a plan Francis had. He had figured out that Oliver tried to reach the window in the celling by climbing the junk stack. So to stop him he was going to ram the stack to make it collapse. Thereby ruining the cat's only escape route.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver realized that any moment now Francis was going to hit the stack and make it crumble. He saw that his only way of having any chance making it away was to jump now, even if it seemed to not be high enough. Just as he jumped of he saw how the mark he had stood on disappeared. Flying in the air he tried to reach for the edge of the window. And he got it. While hanging from the window he found another problem he hadn't thought about before. With Tito in his stomach he was much more heavier then before. Which made it much harder for him to heave himself up. He felt so heavy that he actually could almost feel himself losing his grip. He looked down to see the bulldog watching him hanging up there, liking his lips and opening his mouth wide. That was what he was waiting for, if Oliver didn't manage to heave himself up this was going to be the end of him. He hold on for what he felt like an eternity, when the most horrible thing that could happen, happen. His paws lost it\u00b4s grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was falling he manage to turn around in the air, facing face down to see all the way down the bulldog's inside. Because he was in a much smaller size then the dog he went straight down without Francis having to even swallow, he just went from one second being in the air to deep down into a bulldog's stomach. The sudden impact it made with Oliver landing hurt Francis a little bit, but then he had such a wonderful feeling of being massaged from the inside. He then laid back and put one of his paw on the round bulge on his stomach and just stroke it feeling so relaxed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat\u00b4s next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Does that feel good?\" Einstein asked Francis. \"Yes, that feels s<u>ooooo</u> g<u>oooo</u>d.\" Francis answered in a tone that sounded like he had a combo of all the best massages there was at the same time. What made Francis version of the massage better then Oliver's was that while Oliver just had Tito giving him a inside belly massage, Francis could feel both Oliver's paws and Tito's pressing against the cat's belly walls in a try of escape. Seeing how absolutely gorgeous that feeling must be to Francis, Einstein wished that he to could have a try to get the same treatment. But how?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEinstein's brain wasn't used to think too much because he usually just did what the other dogs in the gang did, or did the things they told him to do. But now he had his brain working at full speed. He wanted so much too get that same god pleasant feeling like Francis. \"The must be some way to get that felling as fast as possible.\" His brain thought. It looked like the only way for him to get the feeling was to have him eat some other living creature whole and alive. But the only living thing he could eat here was... Francis!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first he was 100% against eating Francis, He was his friend after all. But seeing how much the bulldog seemed to love how he was now feeling made Einstein's curiosity insane. He could feel how his good conscience started to drop, even if he still felt how he would never do a thing like eating such a close friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then he started to think about some times in the past when Francis hadn't been so very nice to him, like don't sharing food or making fun of his lack of intelligence. This made him want to eat him more, but he was still thinking that eating him would be such a bad thing to do. Einstein had about 30% conscience left by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEinstein felt inside his head how he was about to completely lose control over the situation. He tried to look away from Francis to stop thinking about it, But then it was the moans. Francis didn't only stretch and rolled like he was bragging of what luxury he had, but he was also moaning loudly about how wonderful it felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Einstein almost losing it. Just barely keeping himself from throwing over Francis and rip him to pieces. It must be about one last percent of conscience left when something happen. His own stomach growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this thought about eating had made him hungry, like seriously hungry. This was all that was needed to make his decision. He was going to eat Francis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Francis laid on his back holding both paws on his stomach with his eyes closed, could he never guess what Einstein was about to do. All of the sudden the light from the celling was blocked. Francis opened his eyes to see Einstein staring back at him. \"Oh, hi...\" was all he could say before he saw the look Einstein was giving him. \"W-What is it?\" Francis asked a bit nervous. Without answering him Einstein opened his mouth wide and put Francis head into his mouth and swallowed. Francis would have done something quicker but the downside of having such a long massage and rest was that it made his body much slower when it came to reactions. That had done that Einstein now had the advantage of the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't do this! It's impossible!\" Francis muffled screams said inside the beginning of Einstein's throat. He was right in that it seemed impossible because of their sizes. Einstein discovered it the hard way when he had swallowed Francis up to his big belly. It seemed hard to get this part of him through because it was the biggest part of him. He even seemed kinda stuck in there. Einstein could feel how it was getting really hard to get any air, and if he didn't manage to swallow the rest of the dog soon he would probably choke to death. Francis hind legs and tail was the only thing still hanging outside of Einstein's mouth. Einstein saw the legs and one of the walls on the house boat and got an idea. The only thing he had been known to be good at was to slam his head to walls and other hard objects. So he ran against the wall with the goal to hit it with the legs hanging out of his mouth. He managed to made a perfect hit, sending the belly and legs through his throat and down to his belly in one big motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was so full and so heavy now that he had to lay down and roll over on his back. His belly was so big that it almost touched the ground when he was standing on all four. He had an entire bulldog stuffed inside his belly, with a cat inside that dog's belly, and an even smaller dog inside the cat's. Einstein could now get to feel this feeling that Francis had made him so curios about, and it felt even better then he could ever imagine. It was even better then what Francis had had because Einstein had now instead three living beings massaging him at ones because of him eating Francis. Einstein became so overwhelmed by the amazing feeling that he fell into a relaxing sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he woke up he found...</span></div></div>",

But Georgette was done talking; it was time to eat, she opened her jaws and lunged at Oliver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Oliver could do was whimper as the darkness of Georgette\u2019s fleshy mouth enveloped his head. He was coated with Saliva as the tongue licked over his furry body; he tried to claw it away but found his paws pinned down underneath. \"Wait, no! You\u2019re eating me\u201d he shouted as the jaws jerked forward again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgette rolled her eyes and continued devouring him. Any reservations she had disappeared as the cat\u2019s succulent flavour flooded her mouth. She closed her eyes and let out a loud moan, the cat tasted like nothing she had ever eaten before. But it wasn\u2019t just the taste Georgette enjoyed; it was the kicking, the whimpering, the sheer power she felt from eating another creature made her feel incredible. She wished she could have a bit more time to mess with the cat, but time was running out. Georgette swung her muzzle up to the ceiling and bolted down Oliver with two quick gulps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanic filled poor Oliver as he was dragged down into Georgette's stomach, all of his instincts were telling him to escape but he couldn\u2019t, he was trapped. He retched at the smell inside the belly, it smelled like dog food. As he felt the stomach acid burn his muscles he realised that was what he had become, dog food. The realisation of this and the lack of air inside the stomach made the young cat feel dizzy, he stumbled around, his vision blurring, before finally collapsing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stomach worked over him for the next few hours, attacking his muscles and turning him into a mushy soup. Soon all that would be left of Oliver would be an extra layer of fat on the poodle\u2019s stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the poodle in question was licking her lips for the last remnants of Oliver\u2019s flavour. She placed a paw on her enlarged stomach, feeling Oliver trying to claw his way out. \u201cOh shut it, nobody\u2019s coming to help you\u201d she belched, the taste of cat still on her lips, and lay down in her basket. The ecstasy of eating another animal and reducing it to fat beneath her skin had exhausted Georgette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fell asleep to the sounds of her stomach gurgling happily; working hard to digest the meat it had been given...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He had been the only kitten not to get adopted by a kid. He had barley had any sleep last night because he had a hard time finding a place to sleep where he was protected from rain, and when he woke up he had to deal with people, cars and an angry hot dogs salesman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiding in an alley Oliver thought that things couldn\u2019t get any worse. That\u2019s when he heard a voice from behind. \u201cOoh, you sure picked the wrong guy to get hot dogs from, kid.\u201d Oliver turned around and got a little scared when he saw that it was a dog. Other dogs that he had meet earlier had barked and tried to chase him, so he was on his guard a little against this strange. He might eat him. \u201cG-Get away from me!\u201d Oliver said trying to sound aggressive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa! Chill out, man.\u201d Dodger said, \u201cI don\u2019t eat cats. It\u00b4s too much fur.\u201d (This was actually a bit of a lie. He hadn\u2019t ever tried to eat a cat, but that doesn\u2019t mean that he wanted to someday get a chance to taste one. The thought of tasting one had been in his mind for a long time, and it was very rare that he would find an ownerless kitten wanderings around in an alley. This was the chance he have been waiting for. He could eat him right now, but then he got an idea. Maybe he could use this cat to help him before he made him a meal.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut listen here\u201d Dodger said, \u201cAll you need to do is to make a distraction, and I\u00b4ll do the rest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Dodger started barking and chasing Oliver out of the alley. (This was all a part of Dodgers plan but Oliver didn\u2019t know that.) In a try to escape the dog and get protection Oliver run up to Louie (The hotdog salesman) and started to climb up him. Dodger wasn\u2019t fare behind as he started to run around the man and bark like mad after the cat. This caused the man to lose balance and fall into some garbage cans, and Dodger took the chance to take a trail of connected hotdogs and strap them around his neck as a neck less. Turning around he saw that the man wasn\u2019t even looking at him. He was to busy trying to catch the little kitten. \u201cThis cat made things more easy for me then I thought.\u201d Dodger thought and made a simple walk away with the hotdogs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater on in a construction-building site Dodger was sitting and counting on how to spilt the hotdogs with the other dog at home, when he heard something walking up behind him. It was Oliver and he didn\u2019t look happy. \u201cOh hay there kitten.\u201d Dodger said when he saw him. \u201cWhy did you leave me behind?\u201d Oliver asked angry. Dodger answered calmly \u201cIf I had to turned back and help you, Louie would have been able to take back the hotdogs.\u201d \u201cSigh. Guess you\u00b4re right:\u201d Oliver said. \u201cAnd besides, you manage to escape from him.\u201d Dodger said. \u201cYeah, but only barley.\u201d Oliver said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the hotdogs made Oliver\u00b4s stomach growl. There were eight of them. All of them were about the same size as he was. \u201cWonder if I can finish even one?\u201d Oliver thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDodger saw and heard Oliver\u00b4s hunger for the hotdogs, and that reminded him of his own hunger. He could just eat this little kitten right now and then return with the hotdogs to his friends. Or he could stuff the kitten with one of the hotdogs before eating him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat would he do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAs tempting filling the little kitten with sausage\u2019s is I can\u00b4t do it under this circumstances.\u201d Dodger thought. \u201cMy friends are starving and needs all the food I can get. I have to hope that in a brighter future I can get a new chance to test this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing back to reality he saw that Oliver was on his way to eat one of the hotdogs. With a quick tug he dragged the hotdogs away from Oliver and throw them around his neck again. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Oliver asked annoyed for what happened. \u201cIf you want them, come get them.\u201d Dodger said and run of. Oliver (Who was really obsessed of eating the hotdogs now.) runs after him shouting, \u201cCome back! I helped you get them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chase went on for a little while throughout the construction\u2014site. (Dodger didn\u2019t want the cat to know his plan right away,) After making a quick look at the site Dodger saw the perfect place to have his meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ran up some stairs and then went out on the third floor on a building with Oliver not far behind. Dodger had seen that a pile of sand was laying outside of this unfinished building, and made his way towards the sand heap. He jumped out of the building and landed safely on the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned around and saw that Oliver was on his way.  He could see in his eyes that he wanted this hotdogs more then anything else right now. He took a leap against Dodger looking like a lion throwing itself against its prey. With Oliver in the air Dodger saw his chance, and opened his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a blink of an eye Oliver went from a furious and hunting predator to a scared and panicking prey. He knew that now when he was falling down towards Dodgers opening gap he was as helpless and vulnerable as possible. The only thing he could think out to do during this little time he had left before getting eaten was to try and attack Dodger in some way. He was going to give the dog a fight all the way into the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDodger seeing this decided to not take any risks and opened his mouth more. This had the effect that when Oliver entered his mouth he went down his throat directly. There was a risk of Dodger hurting his stomach because Oliver was falling down at a very quick speed. Luckily (for Dodger at least) Dodger\u00b4s throat muscles manage to slow down Oliver\u00b4 speed enough to only make his impact feel to Dodger like had swallowed something heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down Dodger could see a small bulge on his belly that was Oliver. Apart of the slightly pain of Oliver landing in his belly he felt good. And with this meal he wouldn\u2019t have to eat in almost a day.<br>\r\nOliver on the other hand had it far worse. He was now in a place that is dark, wet hot, and with very little air. He tried to claw his way out but the lack of air made his effort worthless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of the sudden he felt his whole prison shake. Dodger had been given his belly a slap. \u201cHope you\u00b4re happy now kitty.\u201d Dodger said in a irritated tone. \u201cBecause you had to play \u201cMr tough guy\u201d I lost my chance on getting a great taste of you.\u201d \u201cPlease let me out.\u201d Oliver pleads from Dodgers insides. \u201c \u201cSorry little friend.\u201d Dodger said. \u201cBut this city is known as \u201cThe city jungle\u201d, and in the rules of the jungles it all about the predator eating the prey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Dodger stopped listen to Oliver and thought about what to do now. If he was going to rest and return home once Oliver was digested. Or was he going to take the hotdogs and return now?</span></div></div>",

She had a beauty and elegance that no other dog or other pet ever could match (At least that what she thought.). So she could not imagine what was going to happen on what seemed like an ordinary day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house butler Winston came in to her room and turned on the light at 12:00 noon as usual. She was in need of her \u201c16-hours beauty sleep\u201d. She then had her daily musical number of how \u201cPerfect isn\u2019t easy, but is Me.\u201d Just to show of for the other dogs in the neighbourhood. After putting on makeup and dressed herself with a nice rosette she went down to the kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she walk in to the kitchen and saw a little kitten, eating something sloppy and messy that Jenny had made from her finest food bowl. The cat also looked so nonce ant about eating in someone else house. She walked up to the cat who now had realized that someone else had made him company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgette decided to act as \u201cnormal\u201d as the cat to a start. \u201cAnd who do we have here?\u201d Georgette asked so nicely she could, and smiling so the cat could see what sharp teeth\u2019s she has. \u201cO-Oliver.\u201d The cat answered a little nervous at the much larger dog. \u201cDo you know who\u00b4s house this is?\u201d Georgette asked grinning a little bigger. \u201cJ-Jenny\u2019s?\u201d the cat answered a bit scared of the dog\u00b4s constant grinning. \u201cHe he Yes,\u201d Georgette said chuckling a little. \u201cBut everything that is lower then the kitchen table is my property. That means that the food you\u2019re eating and the bowl is mine!!\u201d Georgette said, getting more and more furious by the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver was starting to get really afraid by the blue poodle. He was starting to think that he preferred when she was acting nice. He had two choices of what to do. Eder he could try to run of the house, and perhaps escape this crazy dog. Or he could try to convince her that he been adopted by Jenny as her new pet. Even if the poodle didn\u2019t looked so willing to listen right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat shall he do?</span></div></div>",

When she had come to part were she had her close up to Oliver, so had she placed herself at the other side of him. Oliver had now got the food-bowl at his back when he tried to back away from Georgette when she was getting closer. Oliver stood on his back legs when he tried to lean himself away from the head of Georgette that was getting closer for every word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had pace for moving a little bit for every word. So when she pushed her head really close and quickly when she said the last word Oliver lost his balance, and fell into the food-bowl. It was twice as big as Oliver, So it was big enough to be like a mini pool for him. But instead of water to swim in, Oliver was swimming in the food that Jenny had made. To make things worse so had Oliver not have time to eat so much because of Georgettes interruption. He discovered also that the food was dragging him down like quicksand. If he didn\u2019t do anything quickly he would drown in his own food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll he could do was to start eating for his life. Georgette just stood and watched the little cat struggle. For her this was a win/win situation. Either the cat would be killed by the food, or she would do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seems like an eternity for Oliver he could finally feel that he had reach the bottom of the bowl and that his head was over the surface. But it wasn\u2019t only his head that was doing that. All that eating had been giving him a big round belly that looked like a big island on this sea of food. He started to feel pains from his stomach of being to full. He started to rub his stomach with his paws when he felt something wet dripping on his stomach from above. Looking up he saw that it was Georgette drooling of the sight of Oliver looking like a stuffed turkey. He realized that she was going to eat him. He also realized that he would have no chance to escape from the bowl. (Being that he was so pinned of his enormous belly, and slippery of all the food he had over his body.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas this going to be the end for Oliver?</span></div></div>",

But when Jenny left he had tried his best to hide from Georgette, but eventually was found under Jenny's covers. Laying there horrified about what would happen next and eventually she said, \"Don't worry, I'm sorry about yesterday, I thought you were an intruder lying about being Jenny's pet to get some free stuff.\" After thinking about it for a minute he decided that what she said made since and believed her (something he would regret later). Afterwords she invited him downstairs for a banquet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they entered the kitchen they were greeted by a large feast, filled with the same glop of stuff that Jenny made yesterday,  2 hot dogs, and a salad. \"Wow! This is all for us,\" said Oliver. \"Yup, welcome to the sweet life kid,\" said Georgette. Oliver immediately went to the hotdogs and scarfed one down, \"do you want one or can I have the other hotdog,\" Oliver asked. \"Mmm no thanks I'll just have my salad and, special desert you can have everything else you see,\" she said slightly maniacally. Oliver of course just shrugged this off because 1 he was too naive, 2 he was too exited by the fact that he could have everything but the salad (which he didn't want anyway) and scarfed down the second hot dog and went straight to the messy glop. Watching him carefully thinking about how delicious he would be when she ate him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she had finished her salad Oliver was about half done with his food and pretty full, \"Man am I full,\" Oliver said. \"Oh come now,\" Georgette said, \"you still have half a bowl left you can finish it.\" \"But I'm full,\" Oliver said. \"Now listen here we finish all our food no matter what,\" Georgette lied. Oliver thinking she wouldn't betray him started eating, meanwhile Georgette snuck up behind him, \"Oh come now get on in there.\" *splash* once again Oliver had fallen in to the large bowl feeling a science of d'j' vu, but this time Georgette had pushed him in. \"Hey! What was that for!\" \"Please just do what you had done yesterday.\" Left with no other choice Oliver started eating his way out, once again he got a full and rounded belly before he had his head above the food, once again feeling the pain of being too full only worse this time with 2 hotdogs stuffed inside him. \"Ugh what was that for.\" \"Well I needed my special desert too be as big as possible before I ate it,\" Georgette said with an evil grin. \"What! But I thought you said that you WEREN'T going to eat me!\" \"Yes and you were foolish enough too believe me\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please don't eat me I don't taste good!\" Oliver said panicking. Then Georgette went down and tasted his stomach, \"Mmmm... you taste just perfect to me,\" she said with an evil smile. Oliver started trying to climb out but his gut was too big.

Oliver tried to not gag at the smell of her breakfast on her breath, she said to Oliver to go to the kitchen where there was a special meal prepared by Georgette for Oliver. This was of course a lie by Georgette to fool Oliver into her plan. As Oliver and Georgette entered the kitchen, Oliver was surprised to find only Georgettes food bowl suspiciously moved to the middle of the floor, and that there was no meal that Georgette had mentioned to him earlier. Meanwhile Georgette closed and somehow locked the (only) door to the kitchen. When Oliver turned around and looked at Georgette, he questioned her saying \"What is this Georgette? There's NO food in here?\". To which Georgette replied with \"Oh, silly me. Did I say there was food for you.\" Georgette grinned evilly- \"I meant to say that there was food for me\". Georgette licked her lips as Oliver now realized what her intentions were, he panicked. He tried to run to Georgette blocked him every time. She said \"Come on Oliver, just climb into my food bowl and I'll do the rest, besides you're all out of options\". Oliver realizing that he was all out of options said \"Ok, you got me Georgette\". So Oliver climbed into Georgettes bowl and Georgette walked over to him in her bowl. Standing over Oliver in her bowl, she looks at him and says \"Goodbye Oliver\". Then she opens her mouth and lowers her head into the bowl and scoops up Oliver into her big poodle mouth in one big bite. She then picks her head up out of the bowl with Oliver still in her mouth and she then tilts her head back and swallows Oliver down her throat into her stomach. With Oliver now in her stomach, Georgette licks her lips then because her stomach is so full with cat as well as her breakfast from earlier that day, she can't help but burp. After she burps, she excuses herself even though the only thing that heard her burp was what was inside her stomach, Oliver. Realizing this Georgette burps again only a lot less lady-like the second time around. Georgette then goes up to her bedroom to sleep and digest Oliver only to be waken up later by the sound of the family returning home that afternoon. Georgette yawns as her stomach has now completely digested Oliver, proven by the fact that she then burps a third time with Oliver's fur being burped up by her poodle dog body on the third burp. She then heads downstairs and greets the family as her stomach is now hungry again, so Jenny feeds her and assumes that Oliver was just gone for a lone walk. As Georgette eats her supper, she lightly burps some more of Oliver's fur up but the just re-swallows it with her food that night.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

He was small enough to become a decent meal, he seemed to be able to go down almost without chewing, it would not be leaving any traces once he was gone, and to top it all of Georgette started to feel a little hungry herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the small kitten play with some yarn to himself another thought made it into Georgette. \"He seems so sweet and innocent that he would probably be easy to <i>trick</i>.\" It was with this last word that a new plan started to form inside Georgette's head. It sounded too stupid to work at first, but the cat looked so gullible that he might fall for anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgette started her plan by pretending that she had a horrible pain in her teeth's as she walked up to Oliver. \"Ow! Ow! Ow!\" she said pretending to be in pain. \"What's wrong Georgette?\" Oliver asked worried. \"I don't know Oliver. I just had a snack and all of suddenly I got this pain in the back of my mouth, like something is stuck there,\" Georgette said in a fake whine. \"Is there anything I can do to help?\" Oliver asked really wanting to help. \"Well, I can't reach the thing inside with my paws so maybe you can get inside?\" Georgette asked. At first Oliver looked like he didn't want to and Georgette thought that this plan wouldn't work, but then he said \"I'll do it.\" and Georgette laughs inside, \"This cat doesn't realise how easy he's making it for me.\" She thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Oliver, I'm lowering my head and you climb inside.\" Georgette said and open up her mouth wide. With her head low enough Oliver managed to climb inside and started walking on her tongue through the mouth. \"I can't believe that he's falling for this!\" Georgette thought while keeping still. (She didn't want to eat him directly, but to see just how far she could take this.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Oliver walked through the mouth he looked at all the big sharp teeth's that Georgette was sporting but he didn't think anything bad about it. \"Georgette is in pain and needs my help, I can't back away just because this looks scary.\" Oliver thought to himself. As he walked he couldn't seem to find what was causing Georgette this big pain of hers. When he reached the end of Georgette's tongue to where the throat started he stopped. Georgette felt that and wondered if he was going to realise now that this was all a her trap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nListening closly she heard Oliver say from the inside...</span></div></div>",

Georgette just sat there with her mouth still open, wondering if she should just end it now and swallow, but a small voice inside her told her to keep still and see if this will go all the way.

For Georgette this started to become a torture of Oliver teasing her, and making her want to close her mouth and swallow him herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after what was starting to feel like an eternity (for Georgette), Oliver took one step to far and lost balance and fell down.

All kinds of breeds and races had once in her life been there by her side. Blinded by her beauty and willing to do anything for her. That had for many of them cost their lifes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany female dogs know that there was some things that wasn't right with her. They all knew stories about her tricking males to live with her. They would first look like nothing was wrong with them, living happely like any other couple. But after some time there would be a day when after a daily walk outside they would both walk back into their home, but only Georgette would be seen again the next day. Some dogs belived that they simply didn't like each other any more. and that the male would be leaving the house by night. But some dogs would say that they had been staring at their house all night and never seen anyone leave the house. This mean that the male had simply dissapeared. Their was many rumors of it all going around about what Georgette could have done with them. But nobody could ever guess the big dark secret that was the reason to why Georgette had made the them dissapeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe enjoyed eating men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was something that even she herself couldn't belive some times. She could barley even remember why she had even become this in the first place. But now it was like a huge addiction to her. She enjoyed the taste of them, and even more the part of tricking them into living with her. It was like a big acting role for her, to play the sweet innocent lady that would be in the need of a big strong man to protect her. \"But none of them could ever guess that <u>they</u> were the once that needed protection.\" Georgette though evily to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had have everything from Goldens and Labs to Rottweilers and even male Poodles as her victims.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sleeping in his usual sleeping corner Einstein just tried to relax. Being known as a dog with not so many demands, he usually would always find himself doing things for other without any second thoughts. He didn't see anything wrong with helping his fellow friends. They always asked him nicely if he could help them, and afterwards he would always be thanked by them for helping them out. Everybody he knew always had this nice attitude towards him...well almost everybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one in the group who would, (just because Einstein was a bit slow) treat him like an idiot. And that one was TIto. The little chihuahua had some nerves always yelling for Einstein to help him with something. He never asked nicely, and never thanked him afterwards. And being that he was the smallest one in the group meant that he needed help more then everyone else. It could be anything from reaching up to something, to move something that was blocking his way. And almost every time he would go and force Einstein to do it beacuse he was so easy to convince. Einstein himself found it some what irritating that Tito never could ask nicely, but he didn't say anything becuase he didn't like to hold on arguments that wouldn't lead to anything. But for every time Tito came and forced him to help him Einstein could feel a clear feeling of rage growing within him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd on this very moment Einstein had previously been helping Dodger and Rita with big things like holding up a garbage container lid while Dodger and Rita searched through it, and then carrying several big and heavy garbage bags on his back all the way back to the boathouse. Dodger and Rita had asked him during the walk back if he would like to have them carrying some of the bags for him. He had told them that it wouldn't be necessary, since he was so very strong (Actually it was because he was so kindhearted that he wouldn't let them have to put on so much pain just for his sake.). When he finally came back home he was completely exhausted, and nothing would be more realxing then to lay down and strech out his worn out body. Getting himself comfortable and tossing his own blanket over him, Einstein was feeling ready for some sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut right on queue the little Chihuahua walked right up to his sleepy head and started shouting orders. \"Hey YOU! What are you doing laying down sleeping in the middle of the day?! I need you to help me reach the remote!!!\" \"Please, can't it wait? Can't you just ask someone else to help you?\" Einstein asked with a bit of irritation in his voice. \"NO! I'm asking you, so you help me!\" Tito said, stomping his little paws into the floor with great force. \"Please, I have been doing some really hard and exhausting\" work today. My body is feeling really weak right now, and i would like you to ask someone else from the gang to help you with you're problem.\" Einstein asked in a bit more demaning voice now. Tito simply took this as an insult and walked away, mumbling loudly about \"how much of a weakling Einstein is\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the last straw for Einstein. He had always been there helping Tito. No matter how simple or stupid the task asked was he would always do it without any complains, and everything he would get back from Tito would be more and more scolding on him. Never had that little irritation ever showed him some love and respect. Not even at his own birthday party. He remembers it so well. He had been given for a birthdya treat a big nice juciy bone that Faggin had found in a trashcan behind a butchershop, and even then the little pipsqueak had told him that he was going to share half of it with him, because \"that is the right thing to do\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe right thing to do. \"That little manpup doesn't even know what the word rigth even means!!\" Einstein thought angerly to himself. He was super furoius now. He wouldn't be able to go to sleep before teaching that small dog some manners. \"Sharing half the bone with you! That bone was probably twice as big as you...\" His belly gave away a sound of hunger indicating that all the days hard work had left him pretty empty, and thinking back to that big bone didn't make things better. That's when his brain got a nasty thought. The anger towards the small chihuahua mixed with the hunger of having done hard work all day formed a very sinister plan in his head. \"Why not solve both problems?\" His brain thought. \"The only question is, when to do it?\"</span></div></div>",

Wearing a beige collar he showed that he was owned by someone, but still he seemed to be in some kind of debt that not even his owner would be able to protect him from, and was forcing him to run around alleys at nigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he reached the place he was told to meet in he looks around seeing nothing but the tall dark wllas of building, towering over him and almost blocking the moon. All of the sudden he could feel how a arm reached out from one of the walls and grabbed him by the collar. Getting up in eye level he saw that what he had believed was one of the house wallls, was instead one of the two dobermans he had been in dept to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis plan before had been to get to them, tell them at a safe distance that he couldn't pay them, and then run of. Now he found himself caught in one of these monsters of dogs grips instead. He had before only heard rumors about the size of them, but that was nowhere near how big they where in real life. Hanging of his feet he could compair and see that the height of them was about three times his own lenght, and they looked like they weight about the same as thirty dogs like him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the red collar the creature was wearing he guessed he was the one that goes by the name Roscoe. \"Oh, How nice to see you here, I hope you brought a lot of food to us, since we are both starving.\" He said in a diabolical way, almost sounding like he would he him instead. \"W-Well the thing is...\" The german shepherd started to say, looking up into Roscoe's face he could see that the doberman was already knowing what he was going to say. \"Go on.\" He said in a deep anger voice. \"I-I have been giving you both food for the next month or so, and I think my master is starting to find out, and the situation is soo bad that he has and I'm not kidding here, been puting on a lock to the fridge. It is only he and I living together so he knows I'm the on taking food at night. I just don't know what to do in that kind of situation...\" He stopped talking as he could see that Roscoe wasn't buying his excuses at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we seems to have a problem here. You are telling us that you can't fix any food for us, and here Desoto and I are starving. What are we going to do about that?\" Roscoe said and looked back at his partner in crime. Desoto didn't answer as his stomach spoke for itself, and he himself leaned towards the german shepherd grinning his teeths at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you can't fix any food for us...You have to become the food!\" Roscoe said dramatically, and saw how the panic in the smaller dog's eyes was showing. As he heard his own gigant stomach growl Roscoe takes another look at the poor dog before saying. \"I'm going to be really nice to you now and ask you which of us two you would rather become food for. You can choose either one of us and get swallowed whole, or you will be torned in half as food for us both whichs will be really painfull on your path. So who of us are you going to choose?\" Roscoe asked the dog, who was thinking sadly for a moment before deciding... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(A picture of the scene)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/view/11094640/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.furaffinity.net/view/11094640...</a></span></div></div>",

Instantly the cat\u2019s delicious flavour spread throughout his mouth as his cheeks puffed out, filled with juicy meat. \u201cmmmm\u201d the lion purred, shaking his jaws from side to side like he\u2019d seen his Father do with zebras, before jerking his jaws forward and packing more of the cat\u2019s meat into his thick jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the mouth, Oliver wiped the saliva from his eyes as the lion swallowed again, pulling him further towards his demise. He could smell hot breath pushing past him, smelling like the meat that Simba was used to eating, he couldn\u2019t detect any cat in there but that would soon change. \u201cPlease let me go!\u201d He shouted, barely audible over the sick sucking and smacking sounds that surrounded him, at least the lion wasn\u2019t munching on him. It was a sickening experience for the little cat, surrounded by the moist flesh of the lion\u2019s maw and the sickening sounds of him purring,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSimba on the other hand, couldn\u2019t have been happier with his little snack. The cat was surprisingly delicious and just small enough to bolt down with no hassle, which was perfect for the hungry lion. He\u2019d never really enjoyed tearing his prey apart, it was more fun to swallow them alive and feel them waste away inside of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as much fun as he was having, Simba\u2019s hunger still needed to be sated and it was almost time to finish. All that was left of the cat now was two frantically wriggling hind legs and a stubby tail sticking out of the cub\u2019s jaws. Simba\u2019s tongue flicked out again and rolled over the juicy paws, tasting them one last time, before he swallowed once more and sent the cat down to his waiting belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOliver\u2019s face lit up for a moment as the lion prepared himself for the final swallow, he was being let go! But this relief only lasted for a moment as the jaws jerked forward once more and he was pulled down the predator\u2019s throat, the oesophagus walls trying to push in on him and make him easier to digest. But Oliver was too big a package for the walls to completely crush; instead he was pulled down whole and alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Oliver landed in the belly, Simba rolled on his back and rubbed the bulge in his stomach where the cat lay, already stewing in digestive juices. \u201cYou might as well stop fighting\u201d the lion said \u201cit isn\u2019t going to do you any good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the cat didn\u2019t listen and continued to struggle, the digestive acid already burning his skin and the stomach walls contracting around him. \u201cPlease\u201d he shouted \u201clet me out!\u201d but the lion didn\u2019t respond, all Oliver could hear was the bubbling and gurgling of the stomach as he passed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling his meals struggles come to a stop, the lion belched and sat back up, but just as he did he heard a voice shout out:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou better have a good reason for being here, and you better tell me where my little friend is before I get mad.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho is it?</span></div></div>",

He had now the Oliver filled belly inside his mouth, and he could swear that he felt it jiggle a little on it's own when his tounge was touching it. \"Probably must be Oliver trying to get out, and now I'm only putting him in an even harder prison to escape.\" Dodger sadly thought as he swallowed yet again. With the big bulge of the stomach in his throat Dodger knew he had to finish quickly if he didn't want to choke to death, and with that he even sent Simba's feet and tail down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down the dog saw that he too now was sporting a belly that was bulging out nicely, and inside it was a spoiled little lion prince sitting trapped for what he had done, and sadly also his friend Oliver to. Really wishing he could save Oliver Dodger got an idea. It wasn't a good one, but still better then standing around doing nothing. \"Hey you inside!\" He shouted at his stomach, but didn't get any answer. He knew that he had just recently swallowed the lion cub, so he would still have plenty of air inside so he tried again. \"I know you can't go anywhere else so answer!\" He said just as loudly as last time, and this time he got an answer. \"What?\" It sounded very muffled but Dodger could still make it out. \"You still have my friend inside of you right?\" He asked. \"Yes.\" The cub answered from inside, sounding very annoyed over the dog talking to him when he was about to get digested. \"And he's still alive?\" \"Pretty much.\" Simba answered after feeling his own stomach for a moment. \"Then I have a deal I would like to give you.\" Dodger said to him. \"And what's that?\" Simba asked, sounding a bit interested over where this was going. \"I am prepared to spare your life, if you yourself takes and spares my friend's.\" Dodger said. \"And if I don't want to?\" Simba asked, still sounding like <b>he</b> was the one on top here. \"Then you will both die here.\" Dodger said and gave his stomach a pat with his paw, sending Simba (and possible Oliver) shaking around inside. \"Have I made myself clear?\" Dodger asked, while stopping his stomach from shaking anymore. \"Yes! Yes!\" Simba shouted from the inside, starting to feel sick from the ride. \"Good. Oh, and one more thing.\" Dodger said. \"Sigh\" \"What?\" Simba asked, feeling he wasn't going to get out of this easy. \"I want you to throw up your little meal before I throw up you.\" Dodger said, and then added. \"And don't think about cheating. My stomach can easily feel when there is <b>two</b> living things inside me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what will it be?\" Dodger asked Simba sitting inside of him.</span></div></div>",

Her parents had gone away on a business trip and Winston was on his holidays, so now she was alone with two dogs and a hungry wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDodger put his nose in the air and sniffed deeply, following the tasty scents to where Tito and Georgette slept. He silently nudged the door open, it was dark inside but thanks to his heightened senses Dodger could see almost everything in the room, including his little Chihuahua snack. He looked over at Georgette, who was wearing earmuffs to help her sleep and wouldn\u2019t be able to hear Dodger eat her boyfriend. Everything was working out perfectly for the wolf, now all that was left was to start feasting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe moved towards Tito, the tiny dog looking and smelling delicious as he slept.. Dodger salivated as he looked at his little snack, a small droplet of drool dribbled down his cheek and splashed onto the Chihuahua\u2019s face. \u201cDamn it\u201d Dodger thought as Tito started to stir \u201cguess it\u2019s time to eat.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cwh-\u201c Tito tried to say but was interrupted as Dodger opened his jaws and quickly enveloped his tiny head.

He also fought a lot harder, kicking his tiny feet as he hung from the wolf\u2019s jaws, not that it did much good. \u201cmmmm\u201d Dodger growled as he sucked and gnawed on Tito, enjoying every single bit of his little form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing Georgette start to stir awake, Dodger quickly gulped his little meal down, feeling him struggle and whine all the way down to his wolf stomach. A stomach which made quick work of the Chihuahua, digesting him in a matter of moments and leaving Dodger to focus on the poodle awaking in front of him. <br>\r\n \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Georgette asked, struggling to see in the darkened room.

Georgette had a natural flavour of dog that Dodger has only today discovered a taste for, but she also had a slightly rich undertone to her taste which was probably due to her diet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgette wasn\u2019t enjoying the trip nearly as much as Dodger was judging from how much she was kicking and screaming. \u201cStop, I\u2019ll do anything!\u201d she shouted, her voice barely audible over the growling and sick sucking sounds of the wolf\u2019s jaws, not that he was listening to her anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDodger quickly gulped through his meal, eventually arriving at the poodle\u2019s long hind legs and sucking in her little furry tail. \u201cWell it\u2019s been fun, but I should really be getting too little Jenny\u2026\u201d he thought to himself and quickly swallowed down Georgette\u2019s slender legs, licking over her little feet before gulping them down as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wolf fell on his back, his belly bigger than it had ever been before, and growled loudly with pleasure. \u201cMmmm, delicious\u201d he said as the poodle inside began kicking the stomach walls in a futile escape attempt. But within minutes she too had succumbed to Dodger\u2019s strong wolf stomach, although he\u2019d still be working off the fat she\u2019d give him for weeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cbut now it\u2019s time to move onto the main course\u201d Dodger thought \u201clittle Jenny.\u201d <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
