In the meantime, you've got a few months of freedom before you have to go. Although, this could lead to potential boredom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, one afternoon, you come home from gym and find the hilt of what looks like a one-handed katana on your bed. There's also a note attached. You pick up the hilt, and find a red button, as well as a rotary dial on the hilt. Strange, you thought. You picked it up, and out of impulse, pressed the red button. It's a good thing you were pointing the hilt away from you, because no sooner had you pressed the button than a white, glowing blade appeared to spring out of the hilt. You looked out the window to see a flock of birds, frozen in mid-air. Confused, you look at the note that came with the sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations! You have been chosen to be the master of a unique object - the Reality Altering Laser Katana, or RALK. It is a sword that has several settings, but all follow a similar premise of cutting any body part but without repercussions of death or serious injury. What makes this sword special is that it allows the wielder to alter reality itself by stopping time and then making changes within the frozen time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo enter reality-altering mode, press the red button. Time will freeze, and any changes made with the katana will become reality once you press the red button again. Bear in mind that merely cutting in any setting will not cause the parts to detach - if you want the parts to detach, you will have to move them. Moving a detached part will cause, in the new reality, the part to be treated as a separate part of the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a cut is made in reality-change mode, a glow, corresponding to the setting of the katana, will be visible on the cuts made. This glow will disappear once time has started again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese are the following settings...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhite - Standard detachment mode. If a cut made by the blade isn't separated, the new reality will have the person be able to detach at that point (ie, if you slice through someone's neck, but don't separate the head from the body, the person will gain the ability to remove and reattach their head at will).<br>\r\nGreen - Sentience mode. Any cuts will give a part not attached to the brain a mind and personality of their own. The affected part's personality will be similar, if not identical to the person it has been detached from. If it is not moved, the part will remain attached to the person, still with its own mind and personality, but will be able to communicate psychically with the person it's attached to.<br>\r\nPurple - Vanishing mode. One side of the blade will glow a deep purple in this mode, and when time is started again, the side which the glow was pointing towards will disappear (ie, if you were to cut off someone's arm and the glowing side of the blade was pointing towards their hand, the arm would disappear once time has restarted). This setting can also be used to make separate parts disappear by merely stabbing them.<br>\r\nBlue - Duplication mode. Moving an affected part will cause a duplicate to appear, which can be reattached to the person you used the katana on, or to something else. Stabbing someone in this mode will give them the ability to create duplicates of themselves. If a cut made by the blade is not separated, the person will gain the ability to split into whole duplicates taking up the mass of the separated part (ie, if you cut someone's arm off, but don't separate the part, the person will split into a slightly smaller clone, and a clone around the same size as the arm)<br>\r\nYellow - Replacement mode. One side of the blade will glow yellow in this mode, and the part it is pointing towards will be able to be replaced by another object, or even another body part. When you start time again, everything will return to normal, except the body part you replaced will take on the traits of the object or body part you replaced it with (ie, if you replace someone's feet with hands, their feet will become as dextrous as their hands).<br>\r\nPink - Stretch mode. Moving an affected part will not detach them from the body, but instead create a new patch of flesh connecting them to the original owner, which can be as long as desired for the user, which will remain at that fixed length in the new reality. If a part is not moved, the person will be able to elongate that part at will. Stabbing someone in this mode will give them full-on stretching powers. <br>\r\nRed - Gore mode. Functions similarly to standard detachment mode, except all cuts will be open wounds, and will give the wielder of the katana the ability to pull out internal muscles, bones, organs, etc. Any natural blood that comes out whilst time is stopped will be cleaned up once you start time again. Don't worry, removal of vital organs, or detaching them to something else will not cause death or serious injury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoy your new gift. Use it wisely.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou press the red button on the hilt. The blade retracts into the hilt, and the frozen flock of birds resume motion. The hilt is also compact enough to fit into your pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis could be fun, you thought. But where can I use this?</span></div></div>",

The storyline where he hooks up with Chloe is an alternate reality where he doesn't have a girlfriend.)</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought maybe your girlfriend, Ashley, would be a worthwhile test subject. You had been going out with her for about six months, and she was fully aware of your fetishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\"<br>\r\n\"Hey Ash, is it okay if I come over?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure, my parents are out of town for the next two weeks. I'm sure we can have fun together.\"<br>\r\n\"Cool! See you soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf an hour later, you were at her house, and she was at the front door.<br>\r\n\"Hi babe!\"<br>\r\nShe greeted you with a big hug. As you hugged back, the gears were already turning in your head - you had some weird fetishes, and Ash was aware of them, but she was completely okay with that. Before now, those fetishes couldn't be realised outside of special effects, but your katana could enable you to have your cake and eat it too with your girlfriend. The question was, which setting would you use?</span></div></div>",

You were a little nervous, but you made a quick, clean cut across Ash's body, about an inch under her belly button, and the cut began to glow white. Ash let go of her shirt, causing the fabric to fall over the glowing cut, but the fabric didn't do anything to hide the glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that bit works,\" said Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded, and held the katana out so Ash could hold it. \"Now for the moment of truth. You ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell no,\" said Ash as she grabbed the katana. \"Let's do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pushed the red button, restarting time. You didn't notice anything different, but Ash blinked a few times and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Ash. \"I just suddenly gained a whole lifetime of new memories I didn't have a few seconds ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember putting on this pair of gloves earlier this morning, but I also remember not having these gloves before we tried the katana,\" said Ash, holding her hands up. She was now wearing a pair of black gloves, and you also noticed that her arms appeared to be more muscular as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess it really did change reality,\" you said, looking at the katana hilt in awe. \"This is now completely normal for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it is, except it's only been normal for me for less than a minute,\" said Ash as she sat down on your bed. She then placed her hands on her hips and pushed, and her top half detached with a soft pop. She lowered her top half onto the bed, then stood her legs up and walked around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is so cool!\" you said, unashamedly watching her ass as she walked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nothing,\" Ash said as she placed her palms on your bed and started 'walking' around on the bed with her arms while her legs continued to walk around the room, her hips swaying even more when she noticed you watching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you can control both halves at once?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" said Ash. \"As of a few minutes ago, I've done this my whole life. I can still remember my life before you used the katana on me, but I also remember all the things about this new reality.\" Ash brought her legs to a stop in front of the bed, and Ash rested her upper body on the bed as she folded her arms on the smooth surface of her lower half and rested her head on her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how much is different about this reality?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not much,\" said Ash. \"It's pretty much all the same, except I discovered I could detach my two halves when I was about five. My parents freaked out a bit, and told me to keep it a secret. We've been dating each other for about six months, just like before, but this time, when you told me about your fetishes, I was absolutely relieved to find out that there was someone who wouldn't think I was a freak, so I showed you this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... wow,\" you said. \"Wonder why I don't remember any of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably because you weren't altered,\" said Ash. \"I'd bet my parents don't remember when I couldn't do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" you said slowly. \"Well, we know the katana works. Do you want me to undo this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding me? This is awesome!\" said Ash, unfolding her arms and walking her legs over to you. \"And since you've had your fun with me, I think I should get a go changing you with the katana.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fair, I guess,\" you said, placing the katana on the smooth surface where her lower half ended. Ash walked her legs back over to where she was resting on the bed and grabbed the katana. With her butt still facing towards you, she lifted her upper body onto her legs and reattached seamlessly, despite the fact that her upper body was now on backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ta-da!\" Ash said, then laughed as your jaw dropped and your eyes went wide in amazement. She took a few steps... backwards? Forwards? Anyway, she walked towards you and grabbed your hand and placed it on the katana. She pressed the big red button, and time stopped once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, what to do with you?\" Ashley said as she looked you up and down...</span></div></div>",

Your girlfriend of course is a bit skeptical, giving you a look of utter disbelief, until that is you decided to show her the blade, holding out the hilt of the katana and having her place her hands on it, then pressing the button, causing the bright white blade to shoot out, narrowly missing her nose. \"Yikes! Hey, learn to aim that thing will you! You nearly took my head off!\" she screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh! That's the idea! \" you laughed, amused by her reaction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, so you managed to get a hold of a fancy flash light, big deal. I know your into this sort of stuff Jason, I am too, but even you can't really believe that this thing is magic.\" Ashley argued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no? Then why not take a look out the window?\" you suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAshley shrugs, and turns to do just that, her eyes widening in shock and disbelief as she realizes that everything, aside from the two of you that is, appears to be frozen, cars, pedestrians, everything, even one of the local felines frozen in mid air after jumping off the to of a nearby fence post. \"<font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">No way!</font> she whispered, rubbing her eyes and blinking a few times to make sure that she isn't seeing things, even going so far as to pinch herself to make sure that she's awake and not dreaming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes way.\" you said, coming up behind her, slinging one arm around her shoulders, the katana still clutched in the other. \"And, if we can believe what the note says, this is the least of what this thing can do.\" you added, holding the glowing blade up for your girlfriends inspection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so you haven't actually tested it yet?\" Your girlfriend asks, Slipping out of your grip and turning to face you, a pensive expression on her pretty face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not yet. Actually, I was sort of hoping that you could help me with that.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, like how? Ashley asked, her green eyes narrowing in suspicion.Clearly she's wary of being used as your guinea pig, something that you can't really blame her for, as the Katana could still be dangerous. It could be broken, or the note could be a fake, and the thing is actually some sort of experimental weapons prototype, designed to be similar to the light sabers from star wars. Unwilling to subject your girlfriend to that sort of risk without at least testing it yourself first, your quick to reassure her. \"Relax Ash, I don't plan to use you for a guinea pig, I just want you standing by when I test this thing in case something goes wrong.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. Well, in that case, go ahead.\" Ash replied. \"But be careful alright? I don't want you doing anything crazy, like chopping off your head or anything like that.\" she cautioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, that could be... bad.\" you agreed. Instead, you decided to start with something small, something that wasn't life threatening, and that you could afford to lose if something were to go wrong. Sitting down on the couch and placing your left hand on the coffee table in front of you, fingers spread as wide as you can manage, you carefully lined up the blade of the katana and pressed down, slicing through your pinky finger, a glowing white line appearing along the surface of the cut. Withdrawing the blade, you note that there's no blood, nor any pain at all, the only sensation you'd felt during the actual cut having been a slightly ticklish tingling  sensation, which seemed to be quickly fading now that the glowing blade of the katana was no longer embedded into your flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, everything looks good so far. You said,  smiling reassuringly up at your girlfriend, who had been staring down at you the whole time, closely watching the proceedings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad, I'd hate to see you hurt.\" Ash responded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, that makes both of us!\" you said with a chuckle. \"Okay, moment of truth time.\" you said, pressing the red button on the hilt once more, causing the blade to vanish as time reasserted itself, the white glow along the base of your finger vanishing as well. Remembering what the note said should happen, you took a deep breath, grabbing hold of your finger and pulling on it, willing it to come off, which it did, much to your surprise, leaving you holding the detached digit in the palm of your hand. Glancing back and forth between the finger and the stump where it used to be, you note that there's still no blood, nor is their any sort of pain, and you can still feel your finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObserving this, Ashley asks \"So, uh, can you still move it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour curious about that yourself, and attempt to do so, causing your finger to flex a bit. You grin. \"It looks like I can. Hmm, I wonder...\" Setting your severed finger down on the table, you begin flexing it, your detached digit slowly squirming across the table until it's reached the other side. Satisfied with your testing for now, you pick the finger up, pressing it against the blank patch of skin on your hand where it used to reside, and concentrating on having it reattach. You feel a brief ticklish tingling sensation as the two pieces connect. Once it's faded, you let go, your finger remaining in place. You wiggle it a bit, just to make sure that everything is in good working order, before looking up at your girlfriend, a wide grin splitting both your faces as you consider the possibilities available to the two of you now that you know the Katana works as advertised. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, looks like it works. What do you want to try first? Uh, you do want to try it don't yo?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding?! Of course I do! That sword of yours is just about the coolest thing I've ever seen!\" Ashley responded, practically jumping up and down with excitement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I guess that means you won't have a problem with me using it on you them?\" you ask.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try and stop me!\" Ash Challenged. \"Not the regular setting though, we've already tested that one. Didn't you say something about some sort of vanishing mode?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I did, but, are you sure you're ready for that? It seem a little extreme for a first try.\" You asked, wanting to be certain she knew what she was getting herself into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yea, but what part of this isn't extreme?\" she responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Point.\" you agreed. \"Alright then, vanishing mode it is.\" you said, turning the dial to the appropriate setting. \"Now, I guess the only question is, Just what parts do you want to loose?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTapping her lips with her index finger, Ash begins to ponder the question for a moment before finally she answers \"Well, for starters I think it would be pretty cool to_____________________?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ash thinks for a moment, tapping her pursed lips with an index finger as she ponders the question. After a moment or so, she seems to come to a decision. \"Well, for starters, I think it would be pretty cool to see what it's like to be headless, just for a little while.\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Headless really?\" you ask, a bit surprised that she'd want you to do something like that to her when she'd just cautioned you bout that very thing just moments earlier. Of course, that had also been before the katana had been properly tested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, it's what I want. You're not going to try and talk me out of it are you?\" Ashley demanded, crossing her arms under her breasts her and staring at you stubbornly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh. \"No, I'm not going to try and talk you out of it Ash, I've learned long ago that sooner or latter you'll get what you want, regardless of what any body says. I do think we need to set a few ground rules though.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What sort of rules?\" your girlfriend asks, relaxing a bit now that she's been reassured that you won't try to talk her out of her intended course of action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rules to help keep you safe mostly. I figure we need a system, some way for me to know when and if you want your head back or not, maybe some sort of time limit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, I guess that makes sense. Hmm, I probably won't be able to hear or see, so I guess verbal communication is out. Maybe you could trace what you want to say on my belly or something?\" Ashley suggests, gesturing towards her stomach, left bare by the tight white midriff baring tank top she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, that might work, provided you can pay attention long enough to figure out what it is I'm saying. You are pretty ticklish you know.\" you answered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yea, but that what makes it fun.\" your girlfriend said with a giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay, suit yourself. Well also have to have some way for you to communicate back. I figure a simple thumbs up or thumbs down will do for yes or no questions, and a pen and paper should take care of anything more complicated.\" you suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Works for me.\" Ash agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with your preparations, You motion for your girlfriend to take a seat, then have her hold onto the hilt of the laser katana while you press the button, so as not to have her forget having ever having a head in the first place. The blade shoots out, a brilliant purple this time, and Ashley lets go, granting you full control over the blade once more. Lining the edge up with the base of her neck, glowing side up, you swing, the glowing sword passing through Ashes neck, the fact that she keeps her reddish blonde hair in a short bob cut making it easy as there's no hair in the way, causing her to giggle. \"It tickles!\" she exclaims, squirming a bit as the blade passes through her. Once the deed is done, you withdraw the blade, leaving a glowing purple line around your girlfriends neck just above her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place the hilt of the katana where your girlfriend can see it, and placing your finger over the button. Last chance to back out.\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it.\" Your girlfriend orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you did give her a chance you think, and press the button, restarting time and causing your girlfriends head to vanish as though it had never been, just smooth shoulders remaining where her head used to be. The sight of your girlfriend, sitting there headless is truly amazing, her chest continuing to rise and fall, her D-cup breasts barely concealed by the fabric of her tight tank top, long sexy legs, clad only in a pair of jean shorts cut off just below her crossed daintily in front of her. though you desperately want to rip her clothes off and fuck her right then and there, you continue to wait, wanting to see how Ashley will react to her newly headless state before getting to carried away.

After allowing her to continue her explorations for a moment longer, with Ash getting more and more into it, rubbing away hard and fast at the blank space between her shoulders, you decide it's time you got her attention, reaching down to her belly and tracing \"<i>Head?</i>\", causing your girlfriend to wiggle and squirm, attempting to slap your hand away. \"Hmm, she really is ticklish.\" you mutter to yourself. Still though, you need to make sure that Ash is okay with this, so you try again, trying not to tickle her too much this time. Fortunately, this time she seems to understand, for almost as soon as you've finished tracing the words, the give you an empathetic no in the form of a double thumbs down, letting you know in no uncertain terms that she likes this, and wants to remain headless for a while longer, something you're perfectly okay with. Plus, if you're lucky she'll.... Yep, looks like she's ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch in fascination as your headless girlfriend begins to strip, which doesn't take long as she wasn't wearing much to begin with, before laying down and making a come hither gesture towards you, leaving you with absolutely no question as to what she wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly shucking your own clothes, you climb on top of her, Ashley spreading her legs to accommodate you, then begin groping and squeezing her breasts and sucking on her nipples. You do this for a little while, before moving on, your hands slowly tracing their way down her beautiful body as you begin to kiss her neck stump, something that Ash seems to enjoy almost as much as having you suck on her breasts. Deciding you've played around enough, you prepare your self for the main event, grabbing hold of your dick, already rock hard, and shoving your way into your girlfriends dripping hole, pounding away at her tight snatch until she orgasms, her pussy squeezing around you like a fleshy vise, clenching and clenching rapidly, milking your cock, and forcing you to cum, shooting your hot load deep inside her. It's a good thing your girlfriend's on the pill, otherwise the two of you could be in trouble after that kind of load! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving satisfied yourself and your partner sexually for the moment, you turn your attention to other matters, namely restoring Ashley's head so you can find out how she enjoyed her first taste of headless sex. Picking up the katana, you press and hold the red button for a moment, causing reality to reset itself, just as the paper said it would, something that you honestly weren't sure of until now, and causing you to breath a sigh of relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh however looks a little miffed, something she soon confirms as she complains \"Awe Jason, did you have to? I was really enjoying being headless!\" she says with a pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks so cute when she's angry that you almost laugh, though you can't quite hide your grin as you explain \"Sorry babe, I just had to know how you were doing. I take it from your reaction that you enjoyed yourself?\" you teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face adopting a blissful expression, Ashley replies \"Oh my God yes! I couldn't see or hear anything, but my sense of touch was just out of this world! You should really try it sometime!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, maybe later.\" you reply noncommittally, unsure if you're really willing to give up your head or not, even if it is only temporary. \"Anyway, what would you like to do now?\" you inquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer face taking on a thoughtful expression, Ashley replies \"Hmm, well, I'd really like to be headless again, but we already did that, so that can wait.

Silly me! Uh, you'd better hang on to this while I press the button. Wouldn't want you forgetting the real me would we?\" she says with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I guess not. Wouldn't be much point trying to surprise me then would there?\" you agreed, the two of you holding onto the hilt of the katana as Ashley sets it to duplication mode and presses the button, causing time to freeze around you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the now active laser katana from you, your girlfriend instructs \"Wait here, I'll be right back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing. Just try not to take too long alright? I'd miss you.\" you replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Ashley reassures you, \"Don't worry, I'll be back before you know it. Just be patient alright?\" she says before sauntering out of the room, shimmying her bare hips and ass in a most enticing manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait impatiently for a couple of minutes before Ashley returns. Looking up at the sound of the door opening, you can't help but be blown away by the sight of your girlfriends sexy new form. \"Whoa!\" you gasp, barely able to believe what it is you're seeing. You'd thought you'd been prepared for most anything, figuring your girlfriend would come back with an extra head of two, a few extra arms or legs, or something else of that nature, but this.... \"Ash, you look incredible!\" you exclaimed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she blushes a bit at your complement, Ashley doesn't otherwise respond. Considering the nature of the modifications she's made to herself she's probably unable to. Now sporting not one, not two, but three pair of breasts running down her front, this is but the least of your girlfriends self made alterations, as she's also created a copy of her pussy, which now sits proudly on her face where her nose and mouth should be, both of the latter parts having apparently disappeared, courtesy of the katana's vanishing mode. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving in close and wrapping her arms around your neck ash pulls your head down, delivering a very strange, but most passionate kiss, pressing her new pussy lips hard against your own more normal ones. Knowing what's expected of you, you eagerly return her gesture, using your tongue to tease inside and around her sensitive folds, paying special attention to her clitoris, causing Ashley to squeal and moan, two of a short list of sounds she's still capable of as you'll later discover. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continue teasing licking and sucking away at your girlfriends new hole her body shudders as she cums, a fountain of girl juice dripping out of her mouth pussy the hot slightly sticky fluid thoroughly covering both your faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling back a little, you lovingly stare down into your girlfriends eyes. \"This, this is wonderful Ash, I'm so glad you did this! Though, I am soft of wondering how I'm suppose to handle all these boobs. I only have two hands you know.\" you pointed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling with her eyes, Ash holds up one finger before presenting you the katana. \"Oh yea, of course!\" you said, placing your own hand around the hilt and, after making sure it's set to duplication mode, activating the blade, using it to give yourself six more arms in two rows down either side of your torso for a total of eight, as well creating a disembodied clone of your cock and balls, allowing you to screw both your girlfriends cunts at once. After that things get really freaky as you and Ashley spend hours fucking in every possible position, as well as a few impossible ones, only available to the two of you due to the modifications you'd made to yourselves with the katana.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally satiated and thoroughly exhausted due to your lovemaking, the two of you are lying together in bed, Ashley's smaller form cradled in your many arms. Sighing, you inquired \"So Ash, ready to be turned back to normal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening her eyes and staring sleepily at you, Ashley gently shakes her head no. Noting her response you exclaim. \"I love you so much Ash! You're kinky as hell, and just about the best girl a guy could ever ask for!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling with her eyes, Ashley raises herself slightly, softly kissing you on the lips with her face cunt. Kissing back just as softly, you gently pleasure your girlfriends pussy mouth with your tongue while softy stroking her numerous breasts as her own soft hands burrows between your legs, softly stroking your shaft. Despite being far to drained and wore out to get it up again, it feels good nonetheless, the two of you continuing to stroke and tease one another until drifting off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning______________________?</span></div></div>",

Turning you see Nadia and Rodney already in the middle of a large pizza waving you over.  \"Fancy seeing you guys here.\"  Rodney says warmly.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why don't you two have a seat?  We were just in the middle of an epic conversation.\"  Nadia said, patting the seat beside her.  Nadia and Rodney were to of your best friends and had a rather... interesting relationship with one another.  While neither one of them ever identified the other as a significant other you had received a fair number of texts accidentally sent to you instead of one another that implied that they had hooked up on a numerous occasions.  They seemed like really close friends IF nothing else, though you suspected there was a whole lot of something else behind closed doors.<br>\r\nPushing those thoughts aside for now you set Ashley down in the chair opposite you and adjacent to Rodney while you sit down next to Nadia, noting that luckily the chair had arms so you didn't have to worry too much about Ashley falling over.  \"So, we were just talking about that new <u>Dragon Slayer</u> movie and Nadia's got this crazy theory.  I want you to hear this because this is gonna blow your god damn minds!\"  Rodney says, giving Nadia center stage.  As you listen you take a slice of pizza off of the tray and set it in front of your girlfriend, using your fork and knife to chop it into bite sized pieces and feeding it to her.  It's actually a bit fun, in a weird way, and you find yourself enjoying the sensation of taking care of her.<br>\r\nAs she finished her slice Ashley flashes you a mischievous smile, mouthing a single word.  \"Katana.\"<br>\r\nYou return the smile, standing up slowly while wrapping your fingers around the hilt in your pocket.  The idea of experimenting on your friends was too good to pass up, especially since you had more than half a dozen modes that you had yet to try out.  You use the blade on...</span></div></div>",

Ash reached out with her foot, and took the katana between her big toe and her second toe, and used her smaller toes to wrap around the hilt. She straightened out her leg and sliced through Rodney\u2019s wrists, and his hands glowed purple. Ash then held the katana out to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you set the katana to duplication mode?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure,\u201d you said, taking the katana from her. You tried to twist the dial, but it wouldn\u2019t budge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on,\u201d you said, trying again, twisting the dial the other way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Ash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t get the dial to turn,\u201d you said. \u201cIf you want duplication mode, we\u2019ll have to restart time and then stop it again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Ash said. She walked a few steps closer to you and lifted her foot up to grab the katana. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pushed the red button once, and time started to flow again. You quickly pressed the button again, stopping time. Rodney and Nadia hadn\u2019t moved much between button presses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you change the blade now?\u201d Ash asked, lowering her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned the dial, and this time it moved, flashing through different colours before arriving at blue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what did you want to duplicate?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCut through Rodney\u2019s neck, then put a duplicate of his head where his hands were,\u201d she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh,\u201d you said. \u201cI like the way you think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lined the blade up with Rodney\u2019s neck and sliced through it easily. The cut started glowing blue, and you set the katana down on the table and grabbed Rodney\u2019s head with both hands. You pulled off a copy of his head and attached it to his left arm, turning the duplicate head around so that his face would be facing in the same direction as his palm would have. Once the first duplicate is in place, you pull off a second duplicate head and attach it to his right arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright,\u201d you said. \u201cNow for Nadia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea struck you, and you picked up the katana, which was still in duplication mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsh, can you take off Nadia\u2019s shirt and bra?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat? Are you going to do something with her breasts?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d you said unashamedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerv,\u201d Ash said, rolling her eyes with a smile. She reached up with her foot and used her toes to grab the hem of Nadia\u2019s shirt and lifted it up. However, since Nadia was holding a piece of pizza to her mouth, getting the shirt off Nadia\u2019s arms proved to be a bit difficult.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUm, little help?\u201d Ashley asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put the katana down again, and helped Ashley take Nadia\u2019s shirt off. Once Nadia\u2019s shirt was off, you quickly removed her bra and then picked the katana back up again. You carefully used the tip of the blade to slice through her left eye socket, then did the same with her right eye. Holding the katana in one hand, you used the other to pull a copy of Nadia\u2019s left eye out, and then placed the duplicate left eye on her left breast, covering her nipple. You then did the same with her right eye and breast. Once the two duplicate eyes were on Nadia\u2019s breasts, you then used the katana to slice through both her breasts. You pulled a copy of Nadia\u2019s breasts off, and noticed that the duplicated breasts also had eyes on them. You placed the duplicate breasts on Nadia\u2019s back, then stepped back to admire your handiwork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRodney now had copies of his head where his hands used to be, and Nadia now had a pair of breasts on her back, and all four of her breasts had an eye instead of a nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh,\u201d said Ash. \u201cThat\u2019s... actually pretty cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI figured you\u2019d like it,\u201d you said. \u201cNow, we\u2019d better get back to where we were before we paused time, otherwise they might figure out something\u2019s up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight,\u201d said Ashley, and the two of you took your seats. You knelt under the table and held the katana out, allowing Ashley to wrap her toes around it as you restarted time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you noticed when you restarted time was that Nadia\u2019s shirt and bra, which you had just dropped on the floor, had disappeared. You pocketed the katana and climbed back out from under the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what was that about?\u201d Rodney asked with his main head as he used the head on his left arm to pick up a slice of pizza and the head on his right arm to eat the pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, it was just Dad,\u201d you said. \u201cHe wanted me to pick up a parcel for him later.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, okay,\u201d said Rodney, paying more attention to the food in his mouths rather than to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNadia swallowed a mouthful of pizza, then turned her head to look at you, while also keeping the eyes on her front breasts fixed firmly on Rodney. \u201cAre you guys doing anything later?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you say?</span></div></div>",

Her name is Marilyn Barns, and she's been married for 16 years. She's 38 years old, and has two sisters with a niece and two nephews, respectively. She's a Loan Officer for a local bank, although she thinks she's due for a promotion. The rest of her life seems pretty mundane, as far as you can tell. Still, you're only getting half of it. You can't find any memories of her home life, and you don't know any recipes. You do know the names of hr best friends, however, so that's a plus. 'So, I'm Marilyn Barns,' you think to yourself. 'Well, not technically. I'm half Jason, so I'll need a new name that combines Jason and Marilyn.' You decide on Jacqueline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou spot a restroom and decide that you want to see your reflection. You guide Kelly in and tell her that you want to touch up your makeup. You look in the mirror and see that your face is split evenly with Marilyn's, your features contrasting greatly. One side of your head sports your shaggy hair, while the other has Marilyn's shoulder-length curls. One side of you lips has coral lipstick on it, while the other doesn't. She has a cleft chin and you don't, creating a bizarre-looking half-cleft. Your jawline is also much heavier than hers, and she has higher cheekbones than you. But, your half has less wrinkles, which makes you happy because you'll have to wear less makeup. Wait, what? It seems like Marilyn's thoughts are mixing with your own, which makes sense, you suppose. Her consciousness had to go somewhere, after all. Looking down, you saw that you had one breast, and the left side of your bra attached tightly against your male chest. Your t-shirt had fused with her red blouse, and your right hand had royal blue nail polish. You don't even want to know what's going on with your crotch; you'll check once you get home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to your face, you notice that your lipstick could actually use some touching up. You take out the tube, but you don't think you could pull off only refreshing half of it. So, you just cover your entire lips. You take Kelly and text left-Marilyn to meet with you at the location where you split. You decide that you like this experience, and you want to stay as \"Jacqueline\" for a while, but you aren't sure how left-Marilyn will receive you. 'Let's hope it goes well,' you think. 'But, if not...' you pat your back pocket, which contains the hilt. '...this should help.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does left-Marilyn react to you?</span></div></div>",

Hi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went up and hugged you. Your relationship with her was purely platonic, but she loved to give hugs to anyone she felt was deserving of it. You could only imagine what her boyfriend experienced, because the hugs she gave to you were nothing short of affectionate. You shrugged and hugged back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How've you been?

You wanna hang out?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that'd be great.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, Chloe had no idea what she was in for.

You slowly and carefully cut a straight line from the bottom of her skirt to the top of her head. This created a glowing white line that separated her left side from her right side, but was otherwise whole, at least for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then pressed the red button on the hilt and put it away as soon as time started up again. The world got a little fuzzy, but everything cleared quickly. Chloe now had two bags over her right shoulder, and the glow where you made the cut was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you want to do today?\", she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you heard two cell phones ringing at the same time. Chloe reached into one of her bags and pulled out a phone. As soon as she answered it, the other cell phone stopped ringing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello?\" she asked. As she listened, her happy expression changed to one of disappointment. \"Oh. Damn. Sorry to hear about that.\" Then she listened more. \"Oh, I was just about to hang out with one of my friends.\" But then she heard something on the other line that made her smile. \"Oh, cool! I'll be there soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was work, Jodie called in sick, so I have to cover her shift. I'm gonna have to split.\"<br>\r\n\"You have to leave already? Aw, and I was so looking forward to hanging out with you.\"<br>\r\nChloe chuckled, as she moved one of her shoulder bags to her left shoulder. \"Not that kind of split.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she proceeded to split in half. Left-Chloe then went up and hugged you. Surprisingly, Left-Chloe's one-armed hug felt just like one of Chloe's whole hugs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jodie's shift ends at about 4, so I'll see you guys later. Bye!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeft-Chloe then hopped away on her one leg to her shift at the stall. Well, not so much hopping, because her locomotion looked pretty smooth, almost akin to walking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight-Chloe was waving goodbye as if this was a normal departure, whilst you could only stare dumbfounded, though you did nervously wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis did raise a logical question - did the change you just made tamper with the universe in a different way, in that, if you hadn't made the change to reality, Jodie would have been perfectly fine and doing her shift as normal? Or would it have gone just the same way as what just happened, except Chloe, as a whole person, had to fill in? But then again, that would lead to another logical question - how is Chloe able to be so casual and nonchalant about publicly splitting in two, not to mention that this was likely her manager's idea? For that matter, what's keeping her clothes on? How can either half walk with just one leg and no crutches? How can either half speak with only half a mouth? The magic of the katana may be more powerful than you thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight-Chloe then turned to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, sorry about that. Did you have anything in mind for something we could do today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou said...</span></div></div>",

I'm sorry to hear that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, he wasn't comfortable with having a splitting girlfriend. I've only been completely public with my ability for about three months now.

Watch this.\" Chloe splits, and her left half becomes a cloud of smoke which quickly merges with her right half. \"See?\" said Chloe. \"This way, we can merge without creating another person. This also keeps my brain whole, so I can think independently when I'm merged.\" You were speechless. \"How do you do that?\" you ask. \"It's easy. All you have to do is think about it.\" You decide to try it for yourself. You split, and then think about your right half becoming a cloud of smoke. It goes 'poof!' and merges with your left half. You have all your memories, and your brain feels completely normal. \"Hey, this is cool!\" you tell Chloe. She smiles and walks over to you. \"Do you want to merge so that we get an idea of how we'll look at the party?\" she asks. \"Why not?\" you reply. She merges with you, and the first thing you notice is that your minds don't meld. You prefer this already, because you have a clear idea of who you are. You can feel your shared mouth moving. \"Hey, Jason? Can you give me control of our legs?\" Chloe asked, her voice a combination yours and hers. \"You control our entire body right now.\" \"Yeah, sure, no problem,\" you say. Chloe stands up and walks over to her mirror. She makes your mouth smile. \"Oh yeah, we're a cute couple,\" she says, with her hand on her hip. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou un-merge, restore your right half, and become whole again. \"I'd better go.

You find that they were oppressed throughout history, although they're pretty well-tolerated now, aside from a few hate groups. You also read about your new abilities, and you learn that a large amount of splitters dividing can cause nearby splitters to unintentionally divide as well, which you thought was interesting. \"I wonder if that would cause a chain reaction,\" you mutter. Seeing how splitters weren't exactly common, it wasn't likely. However, in this new reality, a few of your classmates were splitters, most notably Angelina, a girl who you'd consider to be a slut. She splits all the time, and uses her halves to hit on two guys at once. At parties, she had a habit of merging with wallflowers and making them more enthusiastic about the party. Your new life is really interesting, and you decide to leave the katana at home. You want to experience this for a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrive at Chloe's house wearing a red dress shirt, khakis, and black dress shoes. Chloe and her parental hybrid are sitting in the living room. She's wearing a red cocktail dress and black 1-inch heels. She's wearing red lipstick and has black eyeliner. \"Hey! We match!\" she says. You smile. \"Shall we?\" you ask, as the right half of your body disappears. \"Let's.\" Chloe's left half disappears and you two merge together. This time, Chloe has control over your shared body, but she gives you control over your torso. \"I know that you can't walk in heels, so I'll cover it.\" she says. \"I wish I could kiss you,\" you tell Chloe. She laughs and says \"Later Jason, later.\" You pile into the car and the parental hybrid drives you to the country club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe party is massive. There's at least 100 people; well, 200, since almost all of them are merged splitters. The most common merge seems to be male/female, although not by a wide margin. There are plenty of male/male and female/female merges too. Chloe walks over to a group of splitters and starts socializing, which means that you get to know her friends. From their conversations you learn that there are members from some religious group protesting outside the building. They don't appear to be violent, but the host of the party has told the security to be vigilant. One of Chloe's friends (Shayna and Julie, a black girl and a white girl, which looks a tad strange) looks at the stage and says \"Speaking of the host, there he is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe host is whole, and appears to be in his late thirties.

Soon enough though you figure it out, as the armless girl easily solves the problem by the simple expedient of bending over, taking the edge of the tray between her teeth, then standing, being careful to keep everything as level as possible, then walking over to where you're sitting and repeating the process in reverse, all without spilling so much as a single fry or drop of her soda. So amazed and impressed by her ingenuity are you that you can't resist clapping. \"Bravo! Bravo!\" you exclaim, smiling a little so as to let her know that you're not being sarcastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, thank you!\" Chloe says, taking a bow, adding \"And for my next trick, eating without hands!\" she says, actually seeming mildly amused by your own antics. \"Speaking of which, aren't you going to eat?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, having forgotten all about your own meal, having been far too busy watching the armless girl in action. \"Oh, uh, yea, let me get something real quick.' you said, your growling stomach reminding you that you haven't eaten recently either. After doing so, the two of you begin to eat, though a great deal of your time is also spent watching Chloe eat, her legs flexible enough and her toes cunning enough to allow her to eat her meal just as easily as a normal person with hands, or nearly so at any rate. once the two of you have finished you__________________________?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

To your surprise both halves remained where they were, a thin line across her stomach area though nothing noticeable.  You waited and still the half remained, though as you watched you noticed a faint purple aura emanating from her legs.  Deciding to see what would happen when time resumed you retracted the blade and slid the hilt into your pocket, pressing the button on the base as you did.<br>\r\nthe aura intensified immensely as you hit the button, nearly blinding you in the process.  When you lowered your hand you saw Chloe... well, half of her anyway!  Chloe was deftly balancing on her hands, her arm muscles more pronounced than before as a result of using the limbs as her primary means of transportation now.  She was still wearing the half of her uniform that she had on before but you noticed that she now had rugged black gloves on, likely to protect her fingers from damage as she walked on her hands.  She also had on some sort of black covering for her torso stump, likely so she could rest on it more comfortably.  \"Is something wrong Jason?\"  Chloe asked, noting how you had shielded your eyes and were now looking at her with an odd expression.<br>\r\n\"Uh, no.  Just some dust in my eye.\"  You cover up, rubbing your eyes to get the pretend specks out.<br>\r\n\"Oh.  Yeah, they really need to clean this place more often.\"  Chloe agreed, raising her left hand to inspect the glove on it finding that indeed there was a bunch of dirt on it.  You tried to hide your amazement as Chloe easily stood on one limb, barely even swaying as she did so.  She then put her hand down and turned her attention back to you.  \"Anyway, I have to head back to the lab for more tests later today, but I still have more than an hour to kill, wanna hang out?\"<br>\r\n\"Test?\"  You ask, her sentence having caught you off guard.<br>\r\nLuckily Chloe misinterpreted your response and began laughing.  \"I know, right?  Even after all these years they're still trying to figure out how I'm able to live without a lower half.  It's getting a bit ridiculous but I guess that's the cost for being a medical marvel.\"  She responded.  \"So, what do you say?  Do you want to just hang out until then?\"</span></div></div>",

The short shorts clung tightly to her thighs and ended about half of the way up them, and her T-shirt bared her midriff.

Low-Chloe just said a really funny joke, you know how she is.\"  She responded between gasps.  \"Anyway, she wants to hang out with her boy-toy right now so I guess I'll give her control of herself again.\"  She says.

It appeared that the katana actually affected you as well, though not your memories.  \"Hey Jason, how's my boyfriend doing?\"  Low Chloe asked.  Holy hell, while your relationship with Chloe had remained the same it seemed like you had become the partner to her lower half, the very slight differences in personality likely causing her to be less reserved towards you.<br>\r\n\"Uh, alright I guess.  A little out of it today, might be coming down with something.\"  You respond, hoping to pass off any odd behavior due to your lack of knowledge of this reality as mere sickness.<br>\r\n\"Well don't you go dying on me, at least not before next week!\"  She playfully says, lightly poking your shin in an endearing manner.<br>\r\n\"What's so special about next week?\"  You ask.<br>\r\n\"Our six month anniversary you knucklehead!  Don't tell me you don't have something special planned.\"  Low-Chloe told you.<br>\r\n\"Huh?  Oh yeah!  I have something big in store for you, just you wait.\"  You lie.  Well that was something new to figure out.<br>\r\n\"You better...\"  Low Chloe said before stomping her foot menacingly.  She turns to Chloe and signs \"So, me and Jason are just going to hang out a bit.  Care to join?\"<br>\r\nChloe scratches her chin in thought, balancing on one arm with ease.

As they do so, you she Chloe's face change ever so slightly. Standing up straight, she stares adoringly at you for a moment, then grins. \"Hmm, this is nice! It's not often that I get to look my boyfriend in the eye.\" she says as she steps over towards you, embracing you then standing on tiptoe and leaning for a passionate kiss! Having always thought of Chloe more like a sister than a potential girlfriend despite her obvious attractiveness, you froze at first, uncertain how to deal with this, but not for long, the soft lips and intoxicating scent of the beautiful girl in your arms swiftly overwhelming any reservations you might have. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Chloe pulls back from you, allowing you to breath again, the kiss the two of you had just exchanged having left you breathless, and as you meet her gaze, you can't help blushing a little.

You kept them in your peripherals as you pondered what to do to them. You then heard one of the girls say, \"Okay, nobody's looking, time to eat.\" Of course, hearing this you immediately turned your head to look, and saw a sight you didn't expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of the girls had removed their heads and were stuffing their faces with their burgers and fries. Their necks were still on their bodies, and were completely covered in skin, as if a head had never been attached. It took you a moment to process this, and were even more confused than ever. You checked your backpack, and saw that the laser katana was still where you had left it, so clearly you hadn't done this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, you went up to the group of girls. They were shocked to see somebody saw them without their heads, but they were too busy stuffing their faces to care. You sat down at their table, and waited for them to finish eating. When they had finished, they placed their heads back on their necks, and they attached again. \"So, you know our secret now,\" said the tallest. She clearly was the leader of the other two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yah, but I don't really care, I just want to know how this happened to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh,\" the tallest said, shocked at your response to the impossibility of their situation, \"Well, ...</span></div></div>",

But the odd thing was that she was missing the entire right half of her body. Odder still was the fact that her tray still looked rather neatly set up - you would expect someone simultaneously carrying a tray with one hand and hopping on one leg to drop her tray, or spill some of the food, but then again, the note did say something about people altered by the katana perfectly adapting to their situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA minute later, you saw what you quickly figured out was the right half, with her own tray. She had a burger from the Burgerois, a big piece of chocolate cake and a large cola. Again, despite having only one arm and one leg, she didn\u2019t spill anything and sat down at the same table as the left half.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally? I thought we agreed to cut back on that sort of food\u201d the left half said.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, lighten up. This is a special occasion.\u201d the right half replied, not missing a beat.<br>\r\n\u201cI know, but it\u2019s just that any weight you gain from that, I\u2019ll gain half of it when we rejoin\u201d<br>\r\nThe right half rolled her eye.<br>\r\n\u201cGeez, why do you always have to embarrass me in public every time we go out?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I just sometimes get a little concerned for you.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever. I guess I could just burn it off at gym.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, the two halves had different personalities - at face value, the left half was more logical and rational, whilst the right seemed more emotional. It wasn\u2019t that the left half wasn\u2019t emotional at all, or that the right half completely lacked logical thought, just that their personalities were dominated by how their half-brains operated. You guessed that maybe skills, knowledge and experience were shared by the two halves whenever they separated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir eating styles were also different - the left half was very neat, as if she was in a fine restaurant, not spilling anything, whilst the right half was a tad sloppier. A bit of burger spilled onto her chin, and she picked it off with her fingers. Neither one spilled anything due to the lack of a full mouth, presumably because they had likely eaten when halved before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were both done, the two halves rejoined each other and became one whole woman again. She grabbed both her shoulder bags and went on her way. Meanwhile, you were contemplating what to do next, and now you had already decided what to do...</span></div></div>",

Your vision blurred for a second, and when the blur faded, you got a good look at Sarah's new body. She was still wearing her hoodie, but the clothes she was wearing on her new humantaur legs were completely different. Instead of a pair of jeans, she now wore a skirt that was draped over her humantaur body, which was probably the only thing she could wear that wouldn't be indecent. The skirt ended at her knees, showing off the sneakers she was wearing on all four feet, and the long stockings she was wearing to cover up the rest of her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god,\" Sarah whispered as she ran her hands along her humantaur body, lifting her four legs up one at a time. \"This is so cool! Thank you so much!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" you said with a smile. You then pressed the red button on your katana hilt, activating the blade and stopping time. \"Now, what do you say we start changing some of the other people in this food court?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah also smiled, and activated her own saber. \"I say we go for it.

You attached the left hand to the woman\u2019s left leg with the palm facing down, then pulled off a copy of her right hand and attached it to the stump on her right leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre we doing the same to the redhead?\u201d Sarah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, we\u2019re going to do the opposite,\u201d you said. \u201cVanish her hands, and replace her hands with copies of her feet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoh, nice,\u201d said Sarah, kneeling down with her front legs while keeping her rear two legs standing.

But you really wanted to do more than just a finger. You look towards the computer on your desk. Searching the web for random stuff earlier, you had come across an interesting video on conjoined twins. \"Hmmmm... what would it be like?\" you ponder out loud. \"Even if it is too weird, I can just duplicate the rest of my body and have a identical twin.\" Before you could talk yourself out of the idea, you rest the blade on the top of your skull. You could feel the warmth of the laser. Delicately, you guide the blade down, cutting through your head. You crossed your eyes inward as the blade sliced through the middle of your skull and face. It was weird to see half of the blade sticking out between your eyes. You continued until the blade cut into the top of your rib cage, just below the base of your neck. \"I think that is enough.\" You pull the blade backwards, sliding forward and away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully there was no pain during the whole process. Carefully setting the katana on your bed so it would not slice through anything else, you walk towards your mirror. A blue scar-like line ran down the middle of your face, dividing it as evenly in half as possible. \"Okay, so now I pull...\" You bring your hands to either side of your head and grasp your ears. You hesitate for a moment before you slowly begin to pull the two halves of your face apart. It was the strangest sight to watch your head divide. As you pulled your nose and mouth seemed to stretch, before beginning to rip apart. A third eye too shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped, suddenly getting an even more peculiar feeling. At this point, you had three eyes, two noses, and one strangely wide mouth with almost two tongues. But the weird thing was that your left most eye was blinking on its own. \"Wha isss go-in on?\" you tried to say, but your words slurred. You could not manipulate your hole mouth. The left side did not really respond. Your right tongue brushed against your left, and the left tongue pulled awkwardly away. \"Thi is sooo werd.\" Your left mouth seemed to say on its own. Your middle, shared eye spasmed as you tried and failed to have sole control of it. \"Kee puling\" You tried to say, but your left side seemed to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour two sides continued to pull your partially duplicated head further apart. As you pulled, your single neck and part of your chest also began to divide until there were two identical heads on your broadened shoulders. You and your twin, or other head as you really were not sure what to call your left head, stared at each other from the mirror. Your other head began to move, completely independently from you. It brought your left hand up to its face. You could not help but stare. The hand your other head was using was not yours anymore. You could not feel or control it. The other head turned to look at you in the mirror, \"So what do I call you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? I'm Jason. What should I call you?\" you asked, looking back at your other head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be Jason, because that's who I am.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm Jason you're...\" You realized this was getting nowhere fast. You both could be Jason as you had just divided your head in half evenly. \"We can figure out names later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, you're right.\" The other you paused. \"Can you feel that?\" He asked as he tapped your outstretched arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can feel you touching my arm, but not the arm your using.\" You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, this is so trippy!\" you both say at the same time. You then notice the glowing blue scar line still there. Time was still frozen and the blade's reality effects have not been set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning slowly, you and other you face your bed. The katana stilled glowed blue. \"Should we try this new reality out? I mean, we can always...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duplicate the rest of ourselves later.\" The other you finishes. \"Yeah, might as well try it out.\" He reaches for the blade and hits the red button. The blade retracts into the hilt, and time started to flow once again. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Once time starts flowing again, you and your new twin turn your heads inward to look at each other. \"So, now that we have two heads on one body, what should we do?\" Your twin asks you. You think for a moment, then answer, \"Well, we should try getting used to sharing a body. We need to learn how to work together since we only control our half of the body.\" Your twin nods his head,  and responds,  \"I agree. Let's practice walking.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and your twin were already standing, and the sensation felt very weird to you. It feels as if you're  leaning against an invisible wall 24/7. You each controlled a leg, you the right leg and your twin the left leg. Because of this, your coordination is very poor. \"I'll try to take the first step.\" You say. \"Sounds good to me.\" Your twin responds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly lift your leg and try to step forward, but you lose your balance, causing both of you to fall over. \"What happened, bro?\" You ask your twin. \"What do you mean?\" He responded. You tell him, \"You have to plant your foot in the ground when I take a step so we have balance.\" He nods his head in understanding and says, \"Oh, ok. You're right. Let's get up and try that again.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up would prove to be a challenge as well. You and your twin converse with each other, and come up with a plan. You say, \"I'm going to shift our  weight to my side and lean on my arm and leg.\" He nods, and responds, \"Right. Then, I'll slowly lift my side up and shift the weight to my side. Then you can lift your side up with me.\" \"Sounds like a good plan.\" You say. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two slowly but surely execute your plan, and it eventually works. You and your twin are able to get up from the ground. \"God, that felt weird dude.\" Your twin says. \"Yeah, it did. It seems that we both have control over our torso and hips, but we both have to move them in sync in order to move correctly.\" You respond. \"That's gonna be annoying. We'll have to be in almost perfect sync with each other at all times.\" He says. \"You're right. But for now, we'll have to learn to deal with it.\" You say back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two go back to attempting to walk. This time, however, when you go to take a step, your twin is  successful in shifting your shared weight to his side in order to keep your shared balance. Then, you do the same as he goes to take a step with his leg. After practicing for a couple minutes, you and your twin are slowly able to get the hang of coordinating with one another. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that we've gotten the hang of walking, what should we do?\" Your twin asks you. You think for a moment, and say, \"I think we should walk over to a mirror. I want to see what we look like in the mirror. \"Alright, let's do that. I'm curious to how we look as well.\" You both nod your heads towards each other, and slowly make your way over to the mirror located in the hallway on the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both look at your shared body in the mirror. Your shared body looks like a normal body, except that your shoulders are slightly wider in order to be able to accompany both you and your twins heads. Your heads are about 6-8 inches apart, which isn't a lot of room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a strong curiosity over what was going on under your pants. You look at your twin and blush. He looks at you with a confused expression and says, \"Why are you blushing? What's the matter?\" You hesitantly respond, \"We share a body, obviously. That means that we probably only have one package down there.\" Your twins eyes widened, and he immediately blushes. \"Uhhhh, right.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he says that, he slowly reach his hand under your shared pants. You were wearing pajama bottoms, and no underwear, making it easy for him to reach his hand under them. You didn't notice until now the obvious bulge outlined under your pjs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flinch as his index finger makes contact with the head of your penis. You reach your hand down and pull your pjs forward so that you both can get a clear look under there. You both grew shocked expressions when you saw two identical penises side by side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\" You both say in unison. You say, \"I was honestly expecting that we were gonna have to share a penis. I didn't think that my penis would get duplicated when we got a second head.\" Your twin moves his hand away from your penis, and instead grabs the left, which was his. He says, \"No wonder why I couldn't feel it. I was, um, touching your penis instead of mine. Sorry dude, I also thought that there was only gonna be one under there.\" You respond, \"No, it's alright. You didn't know.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looks at you and says, \"This is probably for the better. We already share a body, it would've just made things way more awkward if we also shared a penis.\" You say, \"I agree. But,\" as you say this, you lift your penis up, and look at you testicles, \"we still only have two balls. I have the right one, you have the left one.\" He responds. \"Well, that's a little awkward, but I'm not as worried about having to share balls.\" \"Neither am I.\" You say back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thought then came into your twins head. He hesitantly said, \"I kinda wonder what it would feel like if we did only have one penis, though.\" You're surprised by this, and say,\" Well, it would obviously be awkward. We'd probably have equal sensation and control over it.\" You both then look over at the blade in your bedroom, and you both turn your heads to each other. \"We could use the blade to split the right half of my penis off, and the left half of your penis, and then combine them together.\" Your twin awkwardly suggests. You respond...</span></div></div>",

You both were not completely in sync, but walking was not as much a chore. Stopping in front of your bed, your twin reaches for the katana handle, and you lean forward with him. You watch as he switches the dial to purple and activates the katana. The blade glowed bright white, bathing the walls of the bedroom with light. \"Can you hold them steady while I make the... incisions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...\" Hesitantly, you grab your twin's penis, and he visibly flinches. He quickly recovers and carefully moves the blade into position and make a precise cut the base. You then hold your own penis steady, and he makes the same exact cut as before. Awkwardly, you place both limp muscles on the bed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that looks weird.\" Your twin was staring at penis-less your testicles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come one, we still have to put the finishing touches. We don't want to be stuck with out any dicks.\" You smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour twin switches between the purple and and yellow modes as you assist him in joining your dicks together. Finally, you carefully fasten the single organ into place. You release your hold, and thankfully your now shared dick stays. With a nod to your twin, he hits the red button and the blade retracts and allows time to flow once again. The two remaining, unattached halves vanish from your bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, well there it is. We are officially sharing one penis now.\" You say to your twin. Both of you stare at it, unsure of what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour twin hesitantly moves his hand and taps the tip with his index finger. Both of you jump at the touch. \"Wow!\" you and he say at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its more sensitive then I remember.\" He says. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'll say.\" You nod. \"I guess we should kind of test it out and see if we share complete control and sensation. Can you feel this?\" You give your twin an inquisitive smirk as you gently rub the right side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour twin nods, \"Yeah, but its a lot fainter.

He asks, \"Can you feel me rub the left side?\"  You respond, \"Yeah, but like the right side for you, it's fainter.

He gives you a devious grin back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your surprise, your twin had already started to go to work on your shared dick, even before you and him reach the bathroom. He gripped it with his hand, and began to stroke it, which was very pleasurable for both of you. You used your hand to grip your shared testicles, and begin to fondle them in your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou two did this while still walking, causing you both to stumble around a bit as you both focused on masturbating. In a way, this was like mutual masturbation, except you both masturbate with a mutual cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight before you both reach the bathroom, you lose balance, and fall over.

You keep your lips locked together as you both continue to work each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis goes on for about 30 seconds before your twin breaks the kiss. He looks at you and says, \"This is wonderful. But since we share it, we should get to take turns with it. It's my turn again to work our cock.\" He releases his stranglehold over your shared balls, and grips the cock in his hand, both of you now holding it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head at him and say, \"We've each gotten one turn bro.

You and he glared daggers at each other from across your joint shoulder, just a few mere inches. Both of you kept a vice grip on your single dick, neither you or your twin wanting to relinquish control. You tugged on your dick, harder than you intended, and pulled more toward your side. Somehow, you thought that pulling it closer to you meant more ownership of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour twin must have had a similar thought process because a moment later you felt him yank, harshly, your shared dick to the left. This back and forth kept going for a many long seconds, with no winners. \"Stop it...\" You paused, still not sure what to call your other half. \"Just stop it! Let me finish. You're going to make us lose our boner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You stop!\" He exclaimed. \"Its my turn!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were barely able to remain standing. The two of you had changed tactics, trying instead to pull your entire body in opposite directions. All the while, your shared boner was slowly receding. \"We're loosing it! Your twin stopped abruptly, and the two of you toppled to the ground. \"Stop fighting me for a second!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stopped trying to pull your shared penis and half of the body away. \"What?\" you questioned, still noticing your twin's strong grip on your penis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We both work it, okay? Fighting each other is not helping the situation. We share it, so we should share responsibility, deal?\" Your twin said breathless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\" You agreed. The two of you, verbally agreed to let go at the same time, and move to the toilet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in front of it, you both grip your penis again, but this time try to synchronize your efforts. Within a few moments, you were back to a full boner. Reaching their climax, they angled their dick towards the toilet bowl and pumped vigorously. Their ejaculation felt twice as good, maybe even better since they were working together. They stood their for a moment with matching grins. \"Okay\" You finally say, \"That felt amazing. Fighting wasn't fun, but that last part...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was great!\" your twin finished. \"It was better than when we were...\" He paused, appearing not sure how to phrase the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou knew what he meant thought. \"It was way better than when there was only one one us, before splitting ourself into two... or somewhat two people.\" You shrugged. \"Anyways, your idea of joining our dicks was good. I wasn't sure at first, and our fighting didn't help. But, it did work out. If we can learn to share it, then I wouldn't mind only having the one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour twin beamed; he seemed to like that idea. \"Good, then you can share in the clean up.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou chuckled, but helped your twin. Finished, you both turn and walk, which was a little easier to coordinate, back to your room; the katana handle was still lying on your bed. You looked inward to your twin, \"You know, I still don't know your name, our names. We can't both be Jason, so what are our names?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a new reality. Let's check things out around the house, maybe we'll get that answer.\" He offers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good a plan as any.\" You say. Before the two of you go exploring though, you agree to hide the katana, placing it into a drawer and locking it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After locking the katana in the drawer, you and your twin took a few minutes to look around the bedroom you now obviously shared. Neither of you had noticed the subtle alternations to the room previously. On the wall above the computer, pictures and news articles of your high school robotics team were neatly hung, but now you and your twin were both in the shot. \"Wow that is weird!\" You both say in concert by accident at one of the most recent pictures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour twin then takes one of the news clippings from the wall. \"Another victory for the local high school robotics team.\" He read aloud, but then stopped to comment, \"I guess we are still on our high school team.\" He then continued, \"After their hard earned victory, two members proudly hold up the trophy, Twins, Jayden (left) and Jaylen (right)...\" He turned to look at you, with a sheepish smile. \"Mom and Dad were not creative at all. Jayden... Jaylen... We have practically the same name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least we don't share a name or have to argue over which of us is Jason.\" You then reread the article yourself. \"Wait didn't we... when we were just one person... didn't our team lose that competition.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour twin, Jayleen, looked at you puzzled for a moment before his moth opened in awe. \"Your right. We did lose that competition!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Assuming nothing else has really changed, I guess having both of us on the team somehow helped us win that time.\" You smiled as you helped Jaylen, put the news article clipping back on the wall. \"Two heads are better than one and all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever... Jayden.\" Jaylen said, seeming to test out your name. You watched as he turned back to look at the pictures. \"Do you get a weird sense of deja vu looking at the pictures? I mean... I remember that competition when we were one person, and... I kind of remember it like how we are now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nodded your head. \"Yeah.. its like a dream. But, its starting to become clearer.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that makes sense that we'd start to get new memories of this reality. Lets check out the rest of the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping back into the hallway, you both agreed to head downstairs as there probably would not be a whole lot more different in your parents' master bedroom or the guest bedroom. The family pictures that lined the wall did catch your eyes. They showed several pictures you and you Jaylen through the years with your parents. \"Huh, I guess we've had pretty normal lives. Nothing seems to be that different.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you and Jaylen step onto the ground floor, you hear a voice from the kitchen. \"Jaylen, Jayden... is that you?\" It was your mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrozen, you stare at each other, unsure if you should say anything. You knew that she only remembered you and your twin sharing a body, but both of your could not help feeling embarrassed about being seen. Comically, Jayleen tried taking a step upstairs as you tried to slip into the adjoining living room. Your body pivoted back and forth as you were physically unable to go both ways at once. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your mom rounded the corner, you and Jaylen stopped the fruitless attempt of avoiding her. \"Hey Mom.\" You unitentically spoke in concert again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still in your PJs! Its three in the afternoon!\" Your mother exclaimed. She raised a hand to her forehead as she shook her head. \"Enjoy your time off while you can. If your Dad and I are paying for your college, I expect you boys to be working your ass off during your classes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah...\" You said, pausing for a moment as you realized what your Mom had meant. You had heard it said plenty of times before about working your ass off. But, you had not heard someone telling you to work the butt off which you literally shared with your brother. You turned your head to look inward towards Jayleen. \"We didn't realize anyone was home yet. We'll get dressed in a second.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour mother seemed satisfied with the answer and walked back into the kitchen, leaving you and your twin on the foot of the stairs. Jayleen quietly commented, \"Okay, I know she would only remember having twins, but it was still weird for her to have zero reaction to her sons only having one body.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, or that we are going to be working our ass off, and not our asses off. Its strange hearing the idioms adjusted.\" You rubbed the back of your neck, thinking back about the last few minutes. You stifled a laugh when you remembered being in an awkward tug of war with Jayleen about where to hide. \"I know it wasn't exactly funny in the moment, but us trying to move in two separate directions was like straight out of a cartoon. Do you think that happens often?\" Several new memory popped into your mind, as if to answer your question. A memory of when you and Jayleen were young kids stood out though. During a little league baseball game, you remember that your team needed two runs to win. After much deliberation, the referee allowed for you to score double runs if you made it to home-base, but you would also count as double outs. You and Jayleen had easily hit the ball far enough so you could make it past third base. But trouble started when an opposing team member was running up to you with the retrieved ball. You and Jayleen stubbornly tried to run in opposite directions; one towards home base and the other towards third. Your argument effectively paralyzed you and cost your team the game. You and Jayleen never fought against each other that much again, at least not so publicly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJayleen also grinned, seeming to remember a similar moment. \"If we stay attached, I guess it will come with the territory.\" He paused as if just thinking about what he had said. \"Do you still want to share a body? I don't really want to, but we could use the katana to duplicate the rest of ourselves, be normal twins and all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could tell from your twin's tone, that he really wanted to stay joined. You answered, \"....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You could tell from your twin's tone, that he really wanted to stay joined. You answered, \"Yeah, lets stick together for now.\" In that moment, you had come to realize that you were strangely enjoying sharing a body with your twin. While using the blade to slice your head in two had been an impulsive, crazy decision, it was one that you were glad you followed through on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaylen smiled, seeming happy that you both were on the same page. \"Well lets get dressed since you told mom that we would, or she might actually start kicking our ass now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou mirrored your brother's smile, \"Yeah, yeah.\" Jaylen and you climbed back up the stairs and entered your room. In front of the mirror, you helped each other take off your plaid PJ top. Coordinating was becoming easier, but you still struggled to pull both of your heads out of the top. The bottoms were removed more easily, and you used your foot to kick them to the side. You were going to head back out into the hallway, but Jaylen stopped you. He had pulled slightly away, creating a tightness in the center of your chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jayden, check us out.\" Your twin said as he pointed at the mirror you still stood in front of. \"We actually have abs.\" He smiled as he traced his fingers down the length of your abdomen. While not a six pack, you could see the definition of your torso, which you had not noticed before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you felt the touch of Jaylen's hand on your abdomen, you were reminded that it was still odd for you to only have sensation on your half of the body. You looked at your brother's reflection in the mirror with a sly smile, \"Guess having to drag you around all the time has made me pretty buff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My side looks a lot more muscular...\" Jaylen pulled his hand away and flexed his tricep, \"I mean look at these guns.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you mean gun. You only have the one arm, remember.\" You flexed your own arm to match your brother\u2019s positioning. \"But together, we are pretty fit.\" As you gazed at your reflection in the mirror, it made you again wonder about what other changes occurred because you and Jaylen shared a body. You decided to worry about figuring that out later. Dropping your arm to your side, you said, \u201cEnough posing, we need to get into the shower.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAgreed. You do stink.\u201d Your brother commented as he moved with you to the bathroom, only stopping to grab the towel, which hung behind your bedroom door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided not to give a retort to his statement. Instead, you focused on cooperating with Jaylen to jump in the shower. Water combined with soap and shampoo made the bathtub slippery, and you both needed to pay attention so as not to crash. Minutes later, you stepped out of the shower with a clean body and only a few extra bruises. Jaylen helped you dry your body before wrapping the towel around your waist. You took notice of two sets of most toiletry supplies, which you were thankful for. You did not want to have to share a toothbrush or razor with your twin. Though after a quick discussion, you both agreed to forgo shaving. As you and him were still working on coordination, sharp objects were not something either of you wanted to handle right now. You and Jaylen quickly finish up by brushing your teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the towel still around your waist, you both step back into your bedroom and close the door. \u201cThat was not so bad.\u201d Jaylen noted. \u201cI with think we are starting to get the hang of sharing a body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod in agreement, \u201cYeah, and it helps that these new memories are slowly coming. Its like before; its foggy but I remember doing this hundreds of times.\u201d Thinking back to the changes between realities that you had not noticed, your eyes scan the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooking for anything new that we had missed.\u201d Jaylen said while watching. You turn and raise your eyebrows. Before you can comment, he continues, \u201cI was looking for anything that jumped out at me too. Its weird how some things we do not even think about is different now.  And there are probably huge changes that we are not aware of yet. Like, I don\u2019t know if you wondered, but our group of friends might be different now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have wondered about that too, but our friends, at least, are probably not too different. I mean, we were in the same robotics club, and some of our best friends were in the group.\u201d You pointed out, but you shared his unease. Several other questions popped into you brain, like girlfriends. You were not sure if you had dated the same girls in this reality, or if you had even dated at all. \u201cLets get dressed and then we can figure out all this other stuff. There might be nothing to worry about.\u201d Jaylen nodded, and he managed a small smile. </span></div></div>",

You've always had a secret crush on her after ll, and what with the abilities of the rapier, you just might be able to do stuff with her that you had only imagined doing before. Glancing at your watch, you see that you only have around half an hour until your due to head over, so you decide to go ahead and leave, as it won't hurt to be a bit early, merely giving you more time to play with your sexy former teacher. Grabbing the tools you expect to need and climbing into the cab of your beat up pickup truck, which you'd acquired second hand from a friend of your dads, you drive over, parking in Ms. Garcia's driveway and getting out. Walking up to the front door, you ring the bell, then wait. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the door opens, revealing Ms. Garcia. She has her hair down, her shimmering dark locks going nearly to her waist, and is wearing a yellow sundress with pictures of flowers on it, her feet contained within a pair of brown platform sandals. \"Ah, Jason! I wasn't expecting you so soon! Please, do come in.\" She said in Spanish, wanting to test your memory of the language she had spent so much time and effort over the last couple of years trying to teach you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling bolder than usual now that you're eighteen and no longer one of her students, your possession of the katana likely having something to do with it as well, replying in Spanish as well, you answer \"Well, I didn't really have anything else i needed to do today, and It's always a pleasure to visit a lady as beautiful as you Ms. Garcia, so i decided to come on over early.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling a little, miss Garcia answers \"Oh Jason, you flatter me! And please, call me Gabriela. After all, I'm not your teacher anymore, and being called Miss makes me feel so old! Now, why don't you sit down while i go and get the list of what I need done. By the way, would you like anything to drink while I'm at it?\" she inquires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, no, merely having the change to drink in your perfection is enough for any man.\" you answer, causing your former teacher to blush, though she also looks slightly uncomfortable with your continued flattery. Hmm, perhaps you should tone it down a little. Wouldn't want her thinking that you're hitting on her or anything, even if that is actually what you're doing. Better simply to play it cool for now until you get a chance to use the katana and maybe then tell her how you feel if you can work up the nerve to do so. And if not, well, maybe you can still have fun with some of her parts without  her knowledge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Jason, you're quite the charmer today. I'll be back in just a moment, please, make yourself comfortable.\" Ms. Garcia, er, Gabriela says, gesturing towards the nearby couch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, you seat yourself, waiting as calmly as you can as Gabriela heads upstairs in search of the to do list she has prepared for you. Once she's well out of sight, you reach into your pocket and extract the hilt of the katana, wondering what you should do with it, and whether you have the guts to tell your former teacher how you feel about her or not. It's true that she's a little old for you, being around twenty five, with a full carrier and a house of her own, while you've only recently graduated and still live with your parents, but on the other hand, it's only seven years, not an insurmountable age difference, and while you don't really have much in the way of prospects at the moment, what you do have is potential, having always been very bright, and done well on your SAT scores, making it likely that you can get into a good collage and manage to acquire a high paying job once you graduate. And then of course there's the katana, something that's sure to attract your former teachers interest. Well, either that or send her running off screaming, but you don't like to think that way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Gabriela returns, you already have a plan in mind, and swiftly move to enact it, taking the katana and turning the dial to ______________________________?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Soon enough you hear the sound of footsteps, as the sexy teacher descends the staircase. Readying yourself, you wait until she reaches the bottom of the stairs, then, before she can see you, you activate the katana, the purple blade springing out as time grinds to a halt around you, allowing you to do what you want, swiftly slicing through Gabriela's neck just above her shoulders with the glowing side of the blade pointed up, something that should, once you press the button again, cause the beautiful educators head to vanish, leaving her unable to see, hear, or call for help, and giving you all the time you need to have your way with her. Figuring that you might as well undress her as well so long as time was frozen anyway, you swiftly do so, before scooping her up and carrying her to the bedroom and undressing yourself, finishing just before time resumes, Gabriela's head vanishing without a trace as she begins to squirm around, feeling the bed and surrounding objects in an attempt to figure out where she was and what was going on. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing your former teachers luscious headless form laid out before you, you drink in the sight for a moment, admiring her long sexy legs and full perky breasts before reaching for her, intending to screw her brains out.</span></div></div>",

Maybe telling the truth wasn't such a good idea after all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, most defiantly punished. Now, if you want your arms back mister Lowery, I'd suggest you do everything I say. Otherwise, I might have to get rough!\" Ms. Garcia threatens. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, knowing that you really have no choice, you reluctantly agree, resigned to whatever fate the busty dark haired beauty has in store for you. \"Alright, fine, whatever you want.\" you agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's whatever you want mistress to you buddy, and don't you forget it!\" Ms. Garcia orders, her tone harsh, though you could almost swear that you'd detected just the slightest trace of humor in her voice as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" you exclaim, only to receive a harsh glare from the beautiful educator. Swallowing, you quickly correct yourself. \"Uh, I mean, yes mistress!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better.\" your former teacher replies patting you on the head, before ordering \"Now stand still, you're not to so much as move a muscle until I give you the word.\" before stepping around behind you and digging around in her closet for a moment. Curious as to what she's doing, you almost turn around, but you manage to stop yourself, remembering that any sort of disobedience is likely to result in an even harsher punishment from your former teacher than she already had planned. You hear the sounds of stuff being moved around, and the rustling of cloth, followed by the sound of silence. Suddenly, Ms.Garcia grabs you by the bottom of your shirt tail,  pulling it up over your head and off, a task made substantially easier by your lack of arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\" is all you manage to say, before your teachers cunning hands begin fumbling with your pants, unsnapping the buttons and pulling down the zipper before dragging both them as well as your underwear down around your ankles. Perhaps this so called \"punishment\" Ms. Garcia has planned for you won't be so bad after all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are however swiftly proven wrong, as your former teacher grabs you painfully by the hair, dragging you over to the bed before pressing you face first into the mattress. Angered by this, you try and turn, intending to complain, but Ms. Garcia's iron grip prevents it. \"No, no peeking Jason, not if you know what's good for you!\" she hisses. Swallowing the retort you had in mind, you instead angrily reply \"Yes mistress.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, you're learning.\" Ms. Garcia says, patting you on the head once more before releasing you. No longer daring to move, you wait, but only for a moment, as you feel a harsh stinging sensation in you backside, Ms' Garcia having just struck you across the ass with a paddle, causing you to cry out. Unfortunately, this single strike is nowhere near enough to satisfy Ms' Garcia's sadistic desires, the wooden paddle striking you over and over again, quickly causing your backside to become red, raw, and sore before she finally relents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, that should teach you better than to try and take advantage of a lady without her permission!\" Ms. Garcia says with clear satisfaction, before commanding \"Now slave, roll over! Let me see your face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoaning in pain, you reluctantly do as you're told, wondering what other punishment the bitch has in store for you, only to freeze in surprise and shock eyes wide and mouth hanging open as you're met by the sight of Ms. Garcia clad in shiny black dominatrix outfit consisting of thigh high heeled boots, elbow length gloves, a tiny pair of panties, and a cup less corset, her magnificent boobs on full display. Though you try to fight it, afraid of what Ms. Garcia might do if she see's it, you can't help but to begin developing an erection, finding the sight of her dressed in such a costume sexy as hell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoting your reaction, Ms. Garcia____________________?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I was too afraid that it'd make things awkward and that you'd reject me due to the age difference.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's Gabriela's turn to be stunned now, as she stares at you in shock, her expression largely unreadable. \"Y-you love me?!

I mean, you're eighteen, and I'm not your teacher anymore, but you're still only eighteen, and I'm twenty five. An age difference like that might not matter that much if you were a little older, but as it is, well, people would talk. Are you really sure you want to deal with that just to be with an old woman?\" Gabriela inquired, though she's smiling when she says it, letting you know that she's only half serious. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me, I'm more than willing.\" you replied. \"The real question is, are <b>you</b> ready to be accused of robbing the cradle?\" you teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing one finger to her chin, Gabriela pretends to consider. \"Hmm, I suppose i could do worse.

Besides, you aren't that much older looking than me. I'll bet you still get carded when you try and buy alcohol of get into clubs, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaughing, Ms' Garcia admits \"Well, I'll have to give you that one. I guess we might be able to make this work, at least on a trial basis. Right now though, I'm more interested in doing more with this magic sword of yours. It's really pretty cool now that I know more about it.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHighly surprised by this, you exclaim \"What?! Really?! I figured, after what I tried to do...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving off your concern, Gabriela replies \"Oh, don't worry about it.

Also, don't tell anyone you know about this, but outside of work, I actually have quite the wild side, and I'd love to see just what sort of trouble we can get into with this thing. So, you game?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou simply can't believe this! You've gone from complete disaster, to one of the best days you could imagine in just a few short minutes, and now, here Ms' Garcia is asking if you'd be interested in playing with her and the katana! \"O-of course I'm game!

Hey babe,\u201d she says through the kiss. \u201cHow did I know you were going to steal my head from me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cOh you know, because it\u2019s me?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s fair.\u201d<br>\r\nBehind you your dog, or at least her front half, runs up to the two of you, licking your girlfriends leg. Her body reaches down and pets it\u2019s head, wasting no time in pulling her head clean off and tucking it under her arms.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, so your sister and I were gonna head to the zoo, and we wanted to see if you wanted to join.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you join them?</span></div></div>",

        "created":1399866960,
        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You have received a mysterious gift, no return address of a Katana capable of altering reality itself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe katana, in its incognito mode, is essentially a hilt with a rotary dial, a red button and no blade. However, pressing the red button will cause time to freeze, and a blade to come out. Depending on the setting (as determined by the rotary dial), it will glow a specific colour, and any cuts made to something will also glow that same colour until time starts again. Press the red button again, and any changes made with the katana will become reality. Hold down the red button in either mode to undo all the changes you have made to reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the blade slices through something, it will remain attached to the person in the new reality unless you move it whilst time is stopped, at which point it will be treated as a separate part of the person. Anyone modified by the katana will immediately adapt to their modifications (ie, removing someone's arms will give them additional dexterity in their legs, feet and any other parts). Any cuts made can be undone by pushing the two glowing parts of the cut together in reality change mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSettings<br>\r\nWhite - Standard detachment mode. If a cut made by the blade isn't separated, the new reality will have the person be able to detach at that point (ie, if you slice through someone's neck, but don't separate the head from the body, the person will gain the ability to remove and reattach their head at will).<br>\r\nGreen - Sentience mode. Any cuts will give a part not attached to the brain a mind and personality of their own. The affected part's personality will be similar, if not identical to the person it has been detached from. If it is not moved, the part will remain attached to the person, still with its own mind and personality, but will be able to communicate psychically with the person it's attached to.<br>\r\nPurple - Vanishing mode. One side of the blade will glow a deep purple in this mode, and when time is started again, the side which the glow was pointing towards will disappear (ie, if you were to cut off someone's arm and the glowing side of the blade was pointing towards their hand, the arm would disappear once time has restarted). This setting can also be used to make separate parts disappear by merely stabbing them. Stabbing someone in this mode will not make them disappear, but they will become invisible.<br>\r\nBlue - Duplication mode. Moving an affected part will cause a duplicate to appear, which can be reattached to the person you used the katana on, or to something else. Stabbing someone in this mode will give them the ability to create duplicates of themselves. If a cut made by the blade is not separated, the person will gain the ability to split into whole duplicates taking up the mass of the separated part (ie, if you cut someone's arm off, but don't separate the part, the person will split into a slightly smaller clone, and a clone around the same size as the arm)<br>\r\nYellow - Replacement mode. One side of the blade will glow yellow in this mode, and the part it is pointing towards will be able to be replaced by another object, or even another body part. When you start time again, everything will return to normal, except the body part you replaced will take on the traits of the object or body part you replaced it with (ie, if you replace someone's feet with hands, their feet will become as dextrous as their hands).<br>\r\nPink - Stretch mode. Moving an affected part will not detach them from the body, but instead create a new patch of flesh connecting them to the original owner, which can be as long as desired for the user, and will remain at that fixed length in the new reality. If a part is not moved, the person will be able to elongate that part at will. Stabbing someone in this mode will give them full-on stretching powers. <br>\r\nRed - Gore mode. Functions similarly to standard detachment mode, except all cuts will be open wounds, and will give the wielder of the katana the ability to pull out internal muscles, bones, organs, etc. Any natural blood that comes out whilst time is stopped will be cleaned up once you start time again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules<br>\r\n1. The blade can only be accessed while time is frozen.<br>\r\n2. Only one setting of the katana can be accessed at a time.<br>\r\n3. Try to use all 5/3/2 options presented to you. If you can't think of anything, leave it as a reader's choice.<br>\r\n4. Try to add at least one paragraph of writing<br>\r\n5. No ending the story.<br>\r\n6. Try thinking outside the box when making an addition.<br>\r\n7. Don't add anything too explicit (I'll make some exceptions for stuff where the katana is in gore mode)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdding is very much appreciated. Swapping is encouraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInspired by:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Longsword (<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1972796-The-Longsword\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1972796-The-Longsword</a>)<br>\r\nThe Guillotine 2: The Rapier (<a class=\"blue2roll\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1683866-The-Guillotine2-The-Rapier-points\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.writing.com/main/interact/item_id/1683866-The-Guillotine2-The-Rapier-...</a>)</td>",
