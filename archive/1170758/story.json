They were in the middle of a divorce, and while both his parents were usually happy rational people, they just didn't get along anymore. Eric completely understood this and knew that this was for the best, but their constant fighting and bickering was not making for a good environment. So while his parents finalized their paperwork and went through with their divorce, his uncle Geoff had kindly extended his home to Eric, as a place where he didn't have to withstand constant arguments. His parents, usually suspect and suspicious of anything Geoff did, eventually accepted, thinking it would be best for Eric not to be around.  Eric was eager about the situation, he did have friends back at home he'd want to keep in touch with, but it wasn't as if his Uncle lived miles away. And this would give him a chance to meet the uncle he never knew. So Eric, with his packed bags waved off his families car, and walked toward the mansion with a growing sense of uncertainty. Reaching the door, after crossing quite a large courtyard, Eric rings the doorbell, only to be answered by,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

His height is only a contributing factor, he must be 6'7, maybe 6'8; but the real effect to how big he is, is the size of his belly. His gut is a large round mound of flesh, hanging a few feet in front of him. His stance is wide, and body is thick. He's wearing a collared button up dress shirt that stretches out over his gut, and looks tight around the apex of it. His slacks look neat and tailored, but they have to be custom made. You don't know anywhere that would sell something close to this size.<br>\r\nHe Greets you enthusiastically with a handshake, which you take, surprised by the crushing grip he has.<br>\r\n\"Eric! It's been so long! Come on in.\" He says and lumbers to the side to allow you entrance. You step forward, getting your first view of the entrance to the enormous house. Inside there a huge opening, a grand hall would describe it. with two large staircases that lead up to a balcony second floor. there are multiple doors and hallways just in the entrance. It'll take you ages to figure out where everything is.<br>\r\n\"Huge place you got.\" You say trying to ignore the imposing figure behind you.<br>\r\n\"Oh yes, I made a fortune from working out of my labs.

And a large balcony. The bed is large and soft, it could probably hold 5 grown men and still have some spare room. It's even electric and can be elevated to a sitting position, facing a large TV on the wall.<br>\r\n\"This is awesome,\" You say.<br>\r\n\"glad you like it. I must leave you now, have to study something in the lab. I'll see you again for dinner at 6 pm in the dining room. If you don't find it ask one of the waiters, they should be around somewhere. If you need them just push the red button on the remote.\" He points to the bed and you notice a remote hanging in the air so you can just grab it when you wake up.<br>\r\n\"With that I wont have to leave the bed at all.\" You say jokeingly.<br>\r\n\"If you want, thats fine with me, you can do whatever you want, except going into my lab.

All different types, but all of them have something that you notice and find a little funny. All the main characters are in some way shape and form, big. There's an RPG game that catches your eye. It claims that it lets you upload an image of yourself, that it can turn into a 3D model that you play as your character. In the demo footage, it shows a really thick chubby character exploring a cave, fending off witches, and other such fantasy pursuits. But in each subsequent shot of the same character, he looks fatter and fatter. The game is enticing, and Eric debates what he wants to do. He decides to, </span></div></div>",

Itching your chin, you think to yourself what to do next.  The restaurant does look interesting, but there's also an entire world of monsters and dungeons down the road as well!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should you do?</span></div></div>",

You're experienced enough to know whether or not to go out into action when your stats are low.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go into the restaurant.  It's surprisingly very well-made; the resolution is amazing, better than you've seen in Skyrim.  You go up to the counter.  There are a few patrons already sitting down, but you notice that many of them are overweight, and have large amounts of food in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, what can I get for you?\" the bartender asks.  A list of responses appears on the screen, prompting you to chose one, which you do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I get something to eat?  I'm starved,\" your look-alike character says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" replies the bartender.  He turns back and calls to the kitchen.  \"One order of fried chicken on the house!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, thanks,\" your character says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" says the bartender.  \"I can tell you're new around these parts, so I got you a free order.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" your character says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.  Go on and have a seat while we get you your food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit your character down at a table.  All of the tables are unusually large for some reason, but you pass it off as just a flaw in the game design or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the food comes in.  There are tons of plates of fried chicken, roasted duck, pie, cake, and burgers galore.  There are 4 or 5 large platters stacked with the food, and you know for a fact that if this were real life, you wouldn't be able to eat nearly this much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is this a flaw in the game too?</i> you wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bartender and the cook set all of the food down in front of you, covering the entirety of the large table that you're sitting on.  Although you would have left this feast normally, your food bar is still very low, so you stay anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dig in!\" they say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you enter the command to begin eating, your character digs into the food ravenously, swallowing slice after slice of blueberry pie.  As it happens, you could swear that you feel the taste of blueberries in your mouth and the sensation of food going down your throat and into your stomach.  You try to stop the feeding, but you can't stop now that you've started.  Your character, against your own wishes, is stuffing his face full of more food than you could possibly ever handle.  You look down and your own belly and see that it's strangely filling up with something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour character and yourself are connected, you suddenly realize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frequently try pressing buttons, but it does nothing as your character continues to feast and feast, his own belly swelling with yours.  You can do nothing but watch as your character swallows the rest of the feast, bigger than you could possibly eat normally.  By the time he's done, his belly hangs out 2 feet from the rest of him, the size of a beach ball.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so is your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to turn off the game, but you can't for whatever reason.  You also can't leave the room, as some invisible force is keeping you in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike it or not, you're stuck playing this game.  Now that you've started it, you can't stop, and thus you have to decide what to do next.  But what should you do?</span></div></div>",

It's not too far a walk, and you find it odd that none of the NPCs comment on the obscenely large gut protruding from your hero. In fact, a couple had dialogue that said you looked thin! You make it to the guard quarters and walk in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a desk is a man writing on papers, as you approach he looks up from them and says, \"Can I help you citizen?\". You scroll through the list of dialogue options to the one asking about working as a temporary guard. \"Ah, finally someone with the nerves to protect this place.\" He turns and opens a chest then pulls out some gear with the crest of the kingdom on it. \"Here, go change into these then come see me so I can put you to work.\" he turns back to his papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your inventory screen and it shows all you have.

Don't worry about the fit, you'll grow into it.\" In reality you rub your gut and look at your in game hero in non-belief that they don't think he looks off. \"Right then, you're on rounds today. Go on then, and be on your guard for anything.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk through the streets, somewhat aimlessly due to you not knowing exactly what to do as this quest doesn't have much detail other than just wander the street. NPC dialogue pretty normal, though every now and then someone comments on you being \"too skinny\" for a guard.

Your gaming instincts kick in and you press everything on the controller until something happens. It seems to work as you quickly draw your weapon and raise it against the beast. The UI adjusts to take in the new foe, showing a health meter, and a name; Jelly green slime. You raise your shield and approach and wait for a blow to be made and a good thing too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe battle ensues with the slime spraying itself hard at your head, but with your shield raised it does little damage. Once it looks like it's died down, you lower your shield and raise your weapon to attack. The blow lands, but... the meter remains the same! You try again and the same, no progress. Is this unbeatable? Is it out of my level range? No... the quest said it only needed lv 1... Then you realize, slimes just take blows! You'd need magic or an enchanted weapon to actually hurt this thing!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your shield to defend, and it works temporarily. Eventually you loose your ground and stagger, your health meter going down slightly. Then the slime steers itself again and shoots itself again, at your face; or more specifically, your mouth. Your hero staggers again then falls back on his ass, and in real life you feel as though a hose is being placed in your mouth and it's pouring down your throat and filling your belly. <i>\"Damn, again?!\"</i> you think in real life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slime relentlessly continues it's focused stream into your hero's belly, his hunger meter gradually filling, along with his belly. It begins to to fill the space between his legs, and the same begins to happen to you. You lean back on the bed giving your gut more room to grow, it flows down your legs and begins to blow beyond your knees. Soon your vision is obstructed by your belly as it grows larger and larger, your shirt now becoming a bra more than anything. Soon it stops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand upright, nearly falling forward as your new larger gut hangs lower to the ground; just past your knees and sticks out at least 5 feet. It has a firmness to it to show that it's vastly full, however, it also is soft like jelly; rippling and jiggling at the slightest touch or movement. Your hero looks much the same as you. Suddenly the belly on your hero starts comically shaking, and the screen starts to shake, and you feel something else in your gut. Soon the shaking is violent and you feel it having an effect on your body. Simultaneously with the game, the loudest burp you've ever done emerges; it lasts 15 seconds but is deep, unbelievably loud, and actually hurt at one point. After you've settled that down, you place a hand on your gut and look back at the screen and see new dialogue \"Quest complete!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk towards the door, you gut swinging heavily and even gaining momentum. You try the door, and find it's still locked. Back to the game. Something catches your eye as you walk back to the bed. A mirror. You see yourself in full belly glory. You take a long stare at your new figure, as it jiggles and sloshes around. And you realize... you kind of like it... You think this game might be fun for you in the long run. You make your way back to the game, taking the controller back to the headboard and lay on your belly, your legs hanging in the air and your knees digging into the jelly filled gut. You resume play and head... </span></div></div>",

Eric thought he looked liked a wrecking ball with arms and legs. \"yes sir?\" Smedley said between huffing and puffing desperately trying to catch his breath \"I want you to go fetch the the special burger Geoff made for Eric earlier please\" \"certainly master David\" with that Smedley scuttled off as he did this Eric noticed the fabric of his tight butlers trousers getting bunched up between his gigantic jiggling ass cheeks, Eric saw this and almost gagged \"how could these people let themselves go like this? it's disgusting\" Eric though to himself. \"you don't have to get me food David I ate before I came here\" Eric breathed out with a sigh of exasperation, \" oh nonsense little duck! you have to try Geoff's cooking!

David shot an approving glance at Smedley who then ran off to get more food. over the span of the next few hours Eric ate himself into a stupor and passed out on the dining room table.

He is a young man, probably around 25 with a cute face and an amazing body. Lean hips, broad shoulders and muscular arms. The tight fitting uniform, shirt, waistcoat and trousers shows off his features great and you nearly stop to look.<br>\r\nThe beautiful servant stops and says: \"Mister Geoff sent me to fetch you, dinner is being served and he doesn't want your food getting cold.\"<br>\r\n\"Ok, great. I'm comming.\" You say.<br>\r\n\"Good sir, please follow me.\"<br>\r\nAs you follow the servant down the stairs, through a door to the left and halfway down another corridor you find it hard to take your eyes of his firm rounded but. You've known you were bisexuall since you were 13, but you didn't know your gay side was this strong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe servant opens a door and let's you into a cozy dining room. Uncle Geoff is seated at a wide reinforced chair at one end, while a normal chair is waiting for you at the opposite side. You've hardly had time to sit down before three servants appear with food and drink. The hotties who followed you down has a large tray of beef stroganoff. An equally hot servant has a large tray of mashed potatoes while slightly older servant, probably 30-32, and sporting a ball sized gut on an otherwise muscled body has two large pitchers of beer.<br>\r\nThey move quickly and before you've been able to say stop they have placed a portion on your plate at least twice the size of your normal dinner and disappeared.<br>\r\n\"Dig in Eric, I got a great cook.\"<br>\r\n\"This is way to much, I'll never be able to eat all this.\"<br>\r\n\"Thats okay, just eat as much as you want. And remember to save room for dessert.\" Then your uncle begins to eat his own portion, which is even bigger than yours.<br>\r\nYou take a bite, and it really is an excellent stroganoff.</span></div></div>",

But looking down at yourself, your bloated stomach is the proof that you need.<br>\r\n\"Ooof,\" you sigh out. \"I can't believe I ate that much!\"<br>\r\n\"I told you I have a good chef.

Another servant clears your place and he sets down the tray to reveal a huge piece of what looked like a brownie with ice cream and caramell sauce in front of you. You can't help but note how fantastic it smells, but you are so full it hurts to breathe. Still it looks good. Too good to waste,  so you take one small bite, just to taste it. It's not a regular brownie you discover, it has more chocolate then normal, and instead of nuts it's filled with caramell fudge. It is among the best, if not the best, thing you have ever tasted.

Breathing in the scent of the room, you're about to get out of bed and start putting on your clothes when you suddenly notice the new size of your belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen as you notice that it's now much flabbier, with even more padding than you've felt before, and also a bit plushy.  You reach your hand down to feel it, and it actually curves under your touch, just like a pillow.  Your chest has grown too, developing some smallish man breasts overnight, and your arms, butt, and legs have also taken in some flab as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, your belly is still the fattest part of your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, at least...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up and put on your clothes.  They're a bit tighter now, and your shirt has ridden up a bit to expose some flesh.  Although they're not THAT tight, they have gone from loose to snug in only one night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breakfast!\" called Uncle Geoff, and you step out of your room and down the stairs.  When you finally get to the kitchen, you see your uncle with a huge spread waiting for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this?\"  you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buttermilk pancakes and Belgian waffles topped with butter and high-calorie maple syrup, candied bacon, French toast with butter to dip it in, and strawberries dipped in chocolate and topped with whipped cream,\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the enormous breakfast before you, drooling a bit.  It looks big enough to serve three, and the portions are even bigger than you had last night.  The pancakes and waffles are in a huge stack, going up about a foot each.  The sticks of French toast are arranged in a small pyramid, and the butter dish to dip them in is really big.  The bacon has formed a pile on top of its plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour hand moves to feel your fatter belly, and you're anxious about whether or not you'll even be able to finish it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven though it <i>is</i> a lot of food, it still looks delicious.  You start to drool a bit as you stare at the glistening syrup, the butter covering everything, and the smell of it all is nearly overpowering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, what are you standing there for?  Dig in!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't waste any time as you take a seat and begin to stuff your face full of the food in front of you.  Your fork rapidly moves from the pancakes and waffles to your mouth, you shovel food into your mouth like crazy.  You only taste the syrup, grease, and butter as you stuff French bread, waffles, pancakes, bacon and the occasional strawberry down your throat.  Your belly gets even more stuffed than before, now pressing out of its comfort zone farther than you've ever experienced.  You almost feel possessed as the food in front of you disappears into your belly more and more, until finally, you've eaten everything in front of you, and both you and your two-foot-in-diameter belly are exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't move...\" you groan.  \"I'm stuffed...\"  Your shirt has ripped under the pressure of your huge belly, and only the top part of it remains.  You also have to take off your belt, as it has gotten extremely uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem,\" smiles your uncle.  \"I can take care of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gets a few chubby-bellied helpers, who lift you up and carry you into your large room, heaving you onto your bed.  Apparently, your belly was creating additional weight for them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just rest here,\" said Geoff.  \"After a short nap, you'll be awake in time for lunch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey leave, and you rest on your bed, tired.  You look down at your belly, bigger than you've ever seen a belly stuffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub it, hardened and packed full with tons and tons of breakfast, obviously not in the condition to hold anything else.  <i>How was I able to eat all that?</i> you wonder.  <i>Something in the food?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sigh, and your heavy eyes droop lower and lower as you drift off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

As you take off your shirt, you realize that it's covered in food stains on the front. You must have made an absolute pig out of yourself, and blush thinking about how Charles had to guide you back to your room. In fact, you swear to yourself that you won't ever let yourself gorge like that again, no matter how good it felt. You remember hearing your parents talk about Geoff having a private pool on his grounds, which might not be a bad idea to check out if you planned on continuing your athletic swimming on through college. You start getting ready for your morning swim, gathering the speedo you wore for your swim team, a towel and your goggles. You pass by a mirror in the bathroom, and you take a look.  After the meal yesterday you almost worried you would wake up fat, but as far as you can see there's not much change, your abs might be a little bit less visible the bottom two sort of blending into each other, but thats nothing you worry about.<br>\r\nYou take the towel over your shoulder and head downstairs. You're not sure which is the closest exit to the pool, so you take the main entrance and begin to walk around the building. \"Wow, this place is huge,\" you think as you make your way down to the corner. Once around there is not that far to the next corner, the mansion is long, but rather narrow so that every room can have windows. The exception is by the entrance, you suspect there to be some kind of ballroom there, or maybe even Geoff's lab he keeps mentioning. You round the next corner and enter the garden behind the mansion. The pool is big and even has a diving board and a small waterslide. You notice there is someone else there. </span></div></div>",

I know how much teenage boys like to eat - I remember being 18...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeoff said a brief grace, then sat down with a flourish.  Eric seated himself at the other place set at the table, and took some food...noting as he did that Uncle Geoff had piled his plate high.  The plates, too, seemed bigger than normal to Eric.  Eric took a few bites, and found everything tasted wonderful.  He was suddenly very, very hungry, and loaded his plate up a second time, then a third.  This didn't worry him - his sport, his workouts, and his teenage metabolism had always meant that he could eat whatever he wanted and stay in his swimmer's physique, even when he had the occasional gorge with friends.  Still, this lunchtime he outdid himself, and Geoff noted approvingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A good lunch, wouldn't you say?\" Geoff asked as Eric finally laid down his knife and fork.  The table looked much emptier, and the cheesecake near Eric had been devastated.  \"I see you have a sweet tooth, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes,\" replied Eric, \"but that cheesecake was great!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, good,\" said Geoff, and Eric wondered vaguely how much his uncle had eaten.  \"Now, time for ....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Supposedly the stuffing had started out as some kind of initiation, but I guess they liked it so much that they kept going.  At first he resisted, and tried to leave to do some work, but the others just kept him there.  Eventually, he just stopped resisting.  Actually, he's even begun to enjoy it.  It didn't take long for him to become a leader figure for the other servants.  Now whatever he asks them, they go and do.  Mainly he just asks for food.  All things considered, it's no wonder he's gotten so much bigger than the other servants... I'd say they just enjoy being able to see him get so dang fat.

They're huge!  They'd been staying here initially because they used to be a luchador team who was training up their weight to become better fighters in the ring.  I say \"used to\" because they enjoyed your uncle's food so much, they never wanted to leave.  So they're now retired.  They still hold regular \"matches\" against each other, but they're too fat now to ever go back to <i>professional</i> masked wrestling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how big are they?\" you wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be surprised when you hear this, but Rodriguez is about 1,300 lbs, while his partner, Antonio, is pushing 1,400!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" you exclaim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel chuckles in response.  \"I suppose that's a pretty normal reaction.  They could be documented as the world's fattest masked wrestling duo, but they're not really in it for the publicity.  You would also probably be surprised to hear that even fatter people have lived within these walls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just stand there, mouth agape.  You finally snap out of it, and ask another question.  \"But... how do they have matches?  Aren't they too big to move?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They would be,\" replies Daniel, \"but your Uncle has created a rope-and-pulley system over their ring that helps them support their fat.  He's even had seamstresses make them these gigantic wrestling costumes to fit their massive bodies.  Their weekly matches are pretty impressive.  They even have an excuse to gain weight for it, since they need to compete in both weight and strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When's their next match?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tomorrow night.  If you want to see them now, then that's fine too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and then pause for a second to think.

I'll wait until their match.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, you won't regret it,\" winks Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do I do while I wait for the match?\" you then ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eat!\" chuckles Daniel.  \"You're Geoff's nephew, I'm sure he would appreciate it if you had the resolve to pack on a few.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, and head to the dining room, where you try as best you can to stuff yourself with some good food.  Although the food is good, you don't get really far.  You're simply not used to eating very much.  <i>Maybe that will change while I'm here...</i> you hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter lunch you swim around in the pool and socialize with some of the other residents of the mansion. The place is huge, and the community of residents and servants living within form a small town of sorts.  After dinner you head right to bed, more than a little excited for the match to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, you're sitting among the rest of the residents in the rec room, which, according to Daniel, Geoff had converted into a \"wrestling room\" a long time ago.  A gigantic ring stands in the center of the room, much, much bigger than any other wrestling ring you have seen.  Also around the room are various weights, all lined up at the back end of the room.  \"Antonio and Rodriguez train here every day,\" Daniel says.  \"In fact, most of their current weight has been gained here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncle Geoff finally steps out, wearing a ref outfit and a bright smile.  \"May I bring your attention to the left side of the ring, folks.  In this corner!\"  Geoff points to the left end of the ring.  Our challenger tonight is currently the lightest of both luchas.  But don't let that fool you, he still packs some punch in those massive thighs!  Round of applause for:  Diablo Rodriguez!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights come up, and your eyes widen as you see the heaviest masked wrestler you've ever laid eyes upon.  Rodriguez is truly massive, his belly hanging several feet in front of him, just barely over the floor.  His belly alone is twice as big as you are, and his bright red wrestling outfit leaves his belly naked and out for everyone to see.  The outfit itself is indeed massive as well, something that even a person who could barely stand wouldn't be able to wear.  Roduiguez's main quality, though, is his titanic rear end, exhibited by the red hot flames of his tights. His buttocks are enormous, two globes of jiggling flesh, like bean bag chairs attatched to his legs.  His legs are pretty huge as well; not covered at all by his costume, they are each wide, the fat flesh of each leg rolling slightly at the knee, and then a bit more at the ankle.  Each leg looks like the same width as four of your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're at first perplexed how Rodriguez is able to hold up all that weight, but Daniel reminds you that he can stand with the help of Geoff's pulley system.  He points at a few ropes coming off of Rodriguez that go up to the ceiling.  \"Without those, he can't even stand,\" explains Daniel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's let himself get this big even though he can't stand normally?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaniel shrugs.  \"He and Antonio are just in it for the matches.  That, and they really love being so huge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And in this corner!\" shouts Uncle Geoff.  \"We have the fatter of the two, the big-bellied, our hungry champion, Gordo Antonio!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lights come up on the other end of the ring, and you are baffled to see that Antonio, dressed in green, is even fatter than his pear-shaped partner.  Antonio's strength is obviously in his belly, completely overshadowng Rodriguez's, whose you thought was massive already.  As opposed to Rodriguez's exercise ball, Antonio's belly is clearly even heavier, a tremendous sack of flab that his costume is barely even able to contain.  Antonio smirks as he rubs his unbelievable stomach with a flabby arm bigger than your own waist, which jiggles as it moves back and forth.  Antonio's rear is pretty huge too, and although it isn't as full and large as his bottom-heavy opponent's, it's still fairly formidable in its size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext Geoff says:</span></div></div>",

You hate suits - they never seem to fit, and the shirt collars are always to tight against your muscular neck.  You blurt out, \"But if I wear that, I'll look like you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, Master Eric, you'd need at least another 200 pounds to look like me!\" Bradley replied, chuckling.  \"Now, try it on - I know you young guys, if it's 'too tight' it can be adjusted.

Upon reaching the corner, Eric spotted a small table next to a pot plant.  On it there were a few bowls filled with different coloured candy.  Pulling out the map, he quickly saw that this corridor was named Gumdrop lane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" he said while peering at the candy, \"It looks like I'll always be able to orientate myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at the bowls he noticed that the gumdrops have been sorted into different colours.  He tried the blue one first and found that it just melted in his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.  Kind of tastes like a blueberry.\"  He grabbed a light yellow one next and found that it just dissolved in his mouth without any flavour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe I need a couple more of those.\"  He took another 5 and put them all in.  Like the first, he couldn't detect anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, this must be how they *urp* get you to finish a whole bag.\"  He said as he grabbed a whole handful, determined to figure out what they must be.  Putting them all into his mouth, they dissolved with a bit of a fizz, but once again, no flavour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is such a rip off.  *urp*\"  Eric found himself stifling another belch.  Feeling a little bloated, he patted his stomach and noticed that it had begun to curve outward.  Looking down, he realised that, while small in comparison to Bradley's gargantuan gut, his belly was noticeably distended.  After a second of panic he shook his head and laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, this must be that gag stuff they sell in novelty stores.\"  He remembered all the pranks he and his friends would pull on each other with  stuff like red hot chewing gum and fart candy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over at another bowl filled with brown gumdrops.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This better not taste like dog shit or something.\"  He cautiously put one in his mouth, and found a familiar flavour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beer!  Hell yeah!\"  He cried as he took a handful and popped them all in.  As they melted, Eric grabbed another handful which was followed by another, and then another.  By his fourth, he found himself a little buzzed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, they *BUUUURP* really strive for authenticity with these.\"  He looked over at the last bowl filled with plain white candy.  He picked up one and sniffed it, hoping to guess the flavour.  He couldn't place it but decided to try it anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Down the hatch.\"  As soon as it hit his mouth, it melted without any flavour.  Unlike the light yellow one however, there was no fizzing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another dud.  Those beer ones were definitely- the fuck?!\"  Eric exclaimed as he looked down at himself.  His belly had swollen out considerably more than before and it didn't look like it was just bloated.  Although snug against his shirt and cummerbund, his belly looked like a serious beer gut.  Poking it, he realised that it was fat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother sensation hit him before he could properly analyze the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've gotta take a wicked piss.\"  Not knowing what lay behind each door, he stepped in front on the pot plant and undid his fly.  Once he started, it seemed like he couldn't stop and his stream was joined with a chorus of long farts.  While he was used to something like this after a night out, it was only after he'd done some pretty heavy drinking.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it all finally ended, he found himself more clear headed.  Looking down, he saw that his regular six-pack had returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was weird.  Must of had some kind of reaction or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric figured that it was time to get a move on and go to the hall.  He reached into his back pocket and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As his Uncle started to squeeze him in the hug, Eric barely had time to notice that his hands didn't really meet behind his uncle's back, while his Uncle's arms definitely met behind his.  Geoff squeezed firmly, and Eric, not one to back down from a challenge, wrapped his arms harder around his uncle, only to be met with Geoff applying a crush.  Eric ceased breathing and held his chest firm, while trying even harder to squeeze, then realisedafter a moment that his Uncle was releasing his hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good strength you've got there,\" remarked Geoff, while Eric took a deep breath and regained his composure.  \"Not my class yet, but with time...  that is why you're here, you realise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

And, I do not offer that much monetarily, it is just that so many of them feel obliged to help even after they have done their time. Using other tricks of magic, they are never so far from home as to be suspicious- they can simply drive out of the garage and be home when they need. Only Bruno lives here with me, and only he has received a steady pay-check the entire time. Don't get me wrong, the other staff members get paid for home, too, just not for as long a period of time. Bruno has been my closest companion since childhood, and I would have felt guilty had I not provided him a steady flow of money, and my services. But we should eat- Bruno has our plates ready,\" Geoff finished with a flourish of his hand and by picking up his fork. Bruno had put about five well-covered plates in front of him, and then gave about three to you. You were still rather shocked by the story, but decided to just eat and see how things went along. Maybe he was being honest, maybe he was totally insane- regardless, he was freaking <i>loaded</i>, so why not listen?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0A long while later, you had finished eating.

He nodded to Bruno, who picked you up out of the chair and followed after Geoff, surprising you, \"I'll go to the library, as it would be most fitting for a demonstration of arcane might.\" You decide to work up the courage to speak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"How can I be sure that what you're doing is magic?

In any case, your clothes seem to have grown with you, and you are indeed about 260 lbs- at least, that's the weight you'd guess he'd be, considering the amount he said was about 50% over his body weight- 50% over 260 is about 390, which is nearly 400. In any case, you take the book from Hugo. You flip to a random page and wonder what to make him gain- you could be mean and fatten him, but you do actually kind of like this new weight, even if you haven't admitted it out loud.

The room is fairly basic. Hardwood floors and a bit rug on the floor, a painting of a landscape on the wall, a book shelf with a handful of books next to a bed and night table. On the opposite side of the room is an old wooden dresser and a doorway to a closet.

You dismiss it as one of the perks of being wealthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIan tours you around the mansion, the first stop is at the opposite side of the hallway, a double door room which he tells you is your Uncle's room. He then leads you around the house pointing at storage rooms, little TV rooms, all the bathrooms, staff rooms and more. Ian tells you that the staff rooms are for small office things. You reach the ground level and walk into a massive kitchen and Ian finds it strange that your Uncle isn't in the kitchen and leads you to the massive dinning room that could fit a table of 40 people in it. You then reach the living room which has a massive projection screen and Ian tells you about the various things that your Uncle Geoff has plenty of movies, video games and such. You wonder why he knows this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Ian brings you to the library and it's a massive 2 level room with staircases and more books then your hometown's library and high school library had combined. You then see a man sitting on a couch reading a book.<br>\r\n\"Sir, your nephew has arrived,\" Ian tells the man. <br>\r\nYou realize that the man sitting down is your uncle.

Despite his size, Jimmy sets a good pace up the stairs, which curl around to the left to an upper balcony that surrounds the massive entrance hall. Eric has no trouble keeping up, despite hauling his bags, but Jimmy moves faster than his size had led Eric to expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Eric follows Jimmy along the balcony, then down a hallway Jimmy says, \"So you're Geoff's nephew? Geoff's mentioned you, but you never came to visit, so I didn't know if there was some problem - I do know that he's very glad to have you here.  You're probably wondering why I'm wearing this odd get-up? Your uncle and I are into RenFairs, Creative Anachronism, all the Medieval stuff, and I was just trying on this costume for a RenFair next month when you got to the door.  The sword is real, and I made the pants myself - I've outgrown the last ones!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the walls of the hallway are photos, some of them quite large, of folks in Medieval costumes like Jimmy's, and other odd clothing.  \"Who's all these people on the walls?\" Eric asks, puzzled because all of them seem to be fat - and some of the clothes are just strange. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, those are all people who've stayed here for RenFair, or for cosplay - Geoff always take photos, and puts up the best one, the biggest ones, the best costumes...do you cosplay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe biggest ones is certainly accurate, Eric reflects as he sees some truly large folks in the photos!  \"No, I don't cosplay, but I'd like to try,\" he replies.  He thinks that this might be something new to try this summer - and he'll try anything that will keep him away from his bitterly bickering parents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, we'll have some fun this summer,\" Jimmy enthuses.  \"Be good to have some young blood around the place too.  Here's your room - there's a phone, just pick it up and press '1' if you need anything, it'll call my cell.  Lunch is in an hour - settle in, explore if you like, then come downstairs to the dining room for 12 noon sharp!  We play a gong five minutes before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, Jimmy shifted his substantial self away back down the hallway, leaving Eric in the doorway to ...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">Erics parents are in the middle of a divorce. It's been a long time coming, but the stress is getting to him. So on his last summer vacation before he transfers out of state for college, his family sends him to live with his mothers brother. Uncle Geoff. The family doesn't talk about him much, and whenever he showed up to family gatherings and events his parents quickly shooed him away. All Eric knew about him, was that he was obscenely rich, and excessively eccentric. Eric is going to find out just what his family means by eccentric, and he might even join in on the fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric is 5'11, has blonde hair he keeps buzzed, and is in great shape due to his time on his high schools swim team. He's toned and fit, and prides himself on his good body. He can come off as cocky, but he's genuinely interested by the people around him. And is eager to connect with his uncle he's never really known.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUncle Geoff is a strange character for sure. Depending on the chosen path, he has multiple interests, and multiple intentions. Some of them quite sinister. He is bound to make a huge impact on Eric's life during his stay at his home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a weight gain story, where you can use any means to fatten up our characters. Magic, science fiction, forced feeding, kidnapping, natural weight gain, sabotage, anything you can think of. Sex is all right, gay sex is preferred, but I will make no judgements. I will also be straightening up some sections, adjusting them to read cleaner, or expanding on certain scenarios. If you add chapters, please try to be detailed and a certain amount of depth to the reading. Enjoy the story folks.</td>",
