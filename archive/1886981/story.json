            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a cold night in the woods of Kanto. The trees shivered along with the fleshly things as the chilly breezes whistled by and nipped at it with icy fingers. The moon was being passed by gray clouds and misty vapors, and in the song of the air a Pidgeyl or Spearow could be heard joining in to the melody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had been a long day for Pokemon trainer Ash Ketchum and his friends. The battles they had been in with both Team Rocket and fellow trainers alike were tiring them out, and they needed a vacation from all the stress. Traveling through the woods they had come upon a lovely area of woods and forest land that would allow them a short cut to the next city, and for Ash, the next Kanto League Gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe humans and their Pokemon friends made camp around a brightly burning, courtesy of Ash\u2019s Charizard. All of the Pokemon had been released from their confinments, including Brock\u2019s assortment, so the three teens and their sixteen Pokemon friends encircled the fire and had a late-night supper. The food as normal was provided by Chef Brock, and tonight he had given them a special treat of sub sandwiches loaded with greens and white meat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis dinner, however, Misty pinched off little bits of bread and lettuce from Pikachu's portion when he wasent looking , and the orange haired gym leader gulped them eagerly and greedily, sitting besides Ash's beloved Pok\u00e9mon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yellow mouse Pokemon had been the first Ash ever acquired, and as such he was the most powerful in terms of level and experience to all of Ash\u2019s team. He didn\u2019t look that tough and was not horribly intimidating at a height of two feet with his cute shining black eyes, but beneath the fur and the long pointed ears he could power half a city with the voltage from his electric-charged cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty had always been...jealous of Pikachu in a way. While she was constantly at odds with Ash's stupidity to get closer to him, he and Pikachu were as thick as thrives. So, she had no qualms about stealing some pesky little mouse's food. After all, she was a growing girl, and she needed energy to support herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the greatest joy of Misty's life being with Ash and his Pok\u00e9mon, though. There were few Persons on earth who could say to have the amazing adventures and experiences that Misty did. She had traveled the region, had seen amazing secrets of the Pokemon universe and even witnessed some of the rarest Pokemon ever to exist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only he wasn't so stupid. So annoying stupid. So naive about evreyone and always looking for the best in people and being so dang attractive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty rubbed her stomach contentky, satisfied with the leader amount of food that was given to her. She had noticed that she had been eating more and more recently, in larger and larger portions. Her new eating habits had developed a slight pot belly, once rail thin, now had a sizable amount of pudge. But she didn't care, she was too annoyed with Ash and Pikachu to care. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, they were laughing at a joke Brock Harland told in perfect unison, their chuckles being totally in sung with one another. On one hand, it warned Misty's heart to see such a living relationship between Pok\u00e9mon and Himan, but on the other, it made her sick, because she was supposed to be the one laughing with Ash, not some stupid yellow rat. They were almost like brother's for pete's sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes she wished she would just eat him up so he would have to pay attention to her for a change.</span></div></div>",

I cleared out the entire buffet today for the first time (I\u2019m so proud!) and they had it restocked in less than an hour. It\u2019s much to my shame to admit that I was too full to continue and so retired from the dining hall to rest my poor, stretched belly. This cruise is probably the best gift I\u2019ve ever been given. Who would have thought becoming the champion of Hoenn includes going on an all expanse free trip to Alola? I must have gained at least one hundred and fifty pounds since I set foot on deck and all I can say is, thank Arceus for the ship gift-shop! After the incident it\u2019s good to know they have bikinis going up to 12x. No more public nudity for this gal! The S.S. Plenty is making a stop at one of the nearby islands to stock up and I assume they\u2019ll bring on a little extra food just for little me!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I know the doorways are a little on the small side but my fat arse is struggling to get through! This morning after breakfast I managed to wedge myself firmly into the frame and it took two of those strong sailor boys to get me free. I thanked one of them personally later on today. Who wouldn\u2019t a piece of all this though? Poor thing, I don\u2019t think he expected such a challenge; having a six hundred and fifty pound land whale straddling your pelvis is probably a little rough and...well when she collapses the bed halfway through I can sort of see why you might want to visit the ship\u2019s doctor afterwards. He was a real trooper though, managed to fight on through despite the fractured rib! I don\u2019t doubt he\u2019ll be back for more once he\u2019s all healed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m really loving my new shape. The more I stuff myself the more rolls I find. My poor jeans are really struggling to keep back the tide of belly trapped within them and I don\u2019t think my shirt has much more life left in it. It\u2019s a little bit embarrassing to walk around and have everything slipping out left right and centre but at the same time the funny looks and whispering behind my back is kind of hot! I\u2019m without doubt one of the largest living thing on this boat, human or otherwise, and I bet I\u2019m at least as big as five of the skinny little girls that lounge about on the deck. I love how I can feel my body wobbling with every step and how out of breath I get just climbing a few stairs. My thighs are packed with cellulite and my boobs are so full and plump, Arceus knows what I\u2019ll do when my bras give up the go. Maybe I\u2019ll just go au naturel and let them sit loose under my shirt. Don\u2019t want to give too many people nosebleeds though!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis afternoon I\u2019ll probably head out for some more lunch and then waddle up topside for some sun bathing. Hopefully they\u2019ve reinforced a few of the recliners\u2014or at least widened them. I had to use one for each arse cheek last time...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Day Thirteen<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh gosh, disaster strikes! I was minding my own business yesterday on three (so what if I had a big lunch!?) of those deck chairs when a few sorority girls came past me. The group was nattering away and giggling and of course once they saw me, well that was it for peace and tranquility! I\u2019ve been called a whale before, it\u2019s hardly inventive or new but when you\u2019re called it over and over again it can rub you the wrong way. Now, I\u2019m a fairly passive girl by nature! I don\u2019t like conflict but when someone upsets me enough I will take action. Yesterday was one such instance where I could not sit idly by and just let them laugh at my expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take too long to get my own back; after lounging about the poolside for a while they eased themselves into the water and made a beeline for the centre, where it was deepest. As they trod water and tittered I hauled my enormous self up out of my recliners and waddled awkwardly towards the diving platform. It must have been such a sight; my enormous body jiggling and wobbling as I hauled myself up the ladder, each run groaning uncontrollably under my big, fat hands. My bikini bottom kept easing itself down my derriere until the skin-tight band was resting at the base of my thighs, the entirety of my almighty, dimpled posterior on show to the world. After much huffing and puffing, I managed to make it to the top and was rewarded for my tenacity with the spectacle of my prey far below. It was only until one of them looked up and pointed at the colossal, sun-blocking monster above her that I made my move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo be honest things didn\u2019t pan out exactly how I had wanted them too. My plan was to dive into the pool and wash them out on the back of a tidal wave. Six pissed off college girls and one enormous husky in a wet t-shirt, everyone wins. Unfortunately, as I stepped onto the diving platform I didn\u2019t even get a chance to bounce once before it snapped under me. When a near-seven hundred pound blob of lard falls twenty five feet onto a couple of ninety pound jackal girls, the outcome is pretty much predetermined. The first girl was lucky enough to catch a glancing blow with my gut and although she was trapped underneath my massive belly rolls, she probably would have been all right had she not knocked her head against the floor of the pool and knocked herself out. The second chick had even worse luck. Instead of colliding with my butt cheeks or my thighs she stood, pencil straight and stared up at the oncoming bringer of her annihilation. It all happened in the space of a second but I felt a sudden insertion into my sphincter and then up she went, straight into my rectum. It felt so good that my primal urges immediately took hold and although I probably could have squeezed her back out I decided instead to pull her up, up and hold her until she stopped struggling. She would do well to digest inside me but I was so turned on by this point I wanted to do more damage! I wanted to feel the pointless resistance of those skinny little things turn to nothing under the elephantine expanse of my blubbery body. I picked up my gut and heaved it above the girl who was desperately panicking, trying to relieve herself and return to the surface for air. Just as she thought she was free I brought it back down and eased myself forwards; rolling on top of her like an unstoppable boulder. It didn\u2019t take long for her to cease fighting and then...I ate her. I couldn\u2019t help myself but as I drew closer and closer to orgasm I felt the uncontrollable urge to consume her, to have her drop into my gut, to feel another living creature turn to fat and swaddle me with ever more lard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little accident became a frenzy and by the time the waves had subsided and the pool water had mostly been displaced over the edge of the deck and into the sea there was no one left in that empty vessel but me: an incredibly satisfied Hoenn champion my gut bulging and gurgling without respite as I ran my chubby hands over my rolls, moaning as I gushed between my two enormous thighs, a puddle of my liquids leaking out from underneath me. Of course the issue now is what if I was seen! I shall have to plan what to do next and how best to proceed. No one can know what I\u2019ve done; what if they turn the ship around and cuff me? I can\u2019t let that happen<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A couple of cabana boys and a few female guests are all currently sitting tight in my intestines, awaiting their fate. It was easy enough to lure them into my quarters: who knew so many people were turned on by eight hundred pound blubbery behemoths? Not that I can blame them, there\u2019s so much of me to love that even three of them pleasuring me at a time wasn\u2019t enough. Putting them away inside of me was fairly easy; the boys just got a blow job each and I made sure to gobble them up just before they came. The girls, well what is a tiny little Alolan lady going to do when I block the door and beach myself on top of them. It was a nightmare when one of them\u2014herself plump by most standards\u2014 managed to get stuck between my two biggest rolls. It was an incredible feeling as she sank deeper and deeper, gasping for air as my flab closed in around her, only to snatch her free at the last second and drop her down my gullet. The only issue of course, is that others will come looking for them, and then what can I do? I think I need to have a feast</span></div></div>",

I was going through the engine room looking for one of the mechanics that had, until then, eluded my clutches. I think the S.S. Plenty had turned into the space ship of alien movies...just replace a creepy alien thing is with a ravenous one tonne blob of human, the principle is the same. I slowly go from room to room, feasting upon anyone I can find! It\u2019s really fun I must admit. That is, until I managed to come crashing through the floor and flooded the motors. In hindsight I probably shouldn\u2019thave eaten the mechanic but can you blame a girl for being a little peckish? Well any way down he went and so did the ship. We\u2019re bailing out, those of us that are left, onto some little life boats. I feel sorry for the others that are stuck with me, I doubt there\u2019ll be much room left once I haul myself on.

He frowned a bit in envy and countinyed to eat his food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreninja was one of the first Pok\u00e9mon to live with Prof. Augustine Sycamore. Back then he was just a Frokie, youthful and full of energy. He used to dream of getting picked by a trainer and travel around Kalos and making friends. But back then, nobody wanted a crooks as their Pok\u00e9mon. He was called a bunch of nasty names, ugly, disgusting, a waste of space. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe most heart wrenching and ironic part about this tale is by the time trainers started picking Frokie gain, he had already evolved into frogaider. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was illegal for a trainer to have a 2nd evolution as a starter Pok\u00e9mon, which meant that he was deadlines to stay at Peof. Sycamore's lab. Forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreninja sighed again and pushed away his now empty bowl of food. He tried to think of less depressing matters. It wasent all bad living here. The Professor was nice and treated him with respect, and he never had to worry about fighting over a meal. He even learned how to speak human over the years, with help from Sycamore of coarse. But human language wasent the only thing he gained...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreninja rubbed his stomach with his webbed hand. Years of free food and a bit of laziness has led to a slight layer of fat around his normally thin form. He wasent fat per se, just more...plump then regular Greninja's. His once lithe belly had just a tiny more jiggle to it, just enough to be noticeable. His arms and legs were a tad thicker too, even his face behind his tongue felt heavier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he didn't mind. He knew he could work off the pounds with no effort at all, he just didn't feel like it. Greninja riding really see the pudge as a big deal. All of his stats were the same, he still fought the same way. In fact, he might dare say his ways were going up. Just last week, Prof. Sycamore told him that his defense and hp increased, which is weird, because he hadn't done any trading that week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinnaly, Greninja pushed himself away from the table and glistened himself off of the chair.

To many people, for better or worse, they know me as the man who sat behind the desk at the Grestin Border checkpoint. Sometimes i hold their lives in my hands, other times i risk letting terrorists through. Whatever choice i make, however, i more often than not feel as if i made the wrong one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday is March 7th, 1983. It has been two months since the border reopened after the failed terrorist attack by EZIC. Like so many other junctures in my life since i had been selected by the labor lottery, i was once again unsure if i had made the right choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could have helped Ezic with their goals, they made themselves apparent enough. But i ignored everything they had ever said. I could escaped to snowier pastures, live a new life with my family in Obristan. But instead of risking their lives by leaving home to a strange and unfamiliar place, i risked their lives by staying in a corrupt dictatorship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, it seemed that even if i did not make the right choice, i had at least won the game. I had been loyal to Arstotzka, and i have been rewarded for it. I live in a Class 5 Apartment with my family, something many people can not say they have. For the first time in my life we actually had living room to spare. My tiny booth prominently displayed three gold plaques that showed my loyalty. In the eyes of my superiors, i was the perfect model of a citizen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut today, as i wavd to serigu as i walked to my booth, i knew immediately there was something wrong. I couldn't hear the usual murmur of voices and feet shuffling over the concrete wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh?\u201d i questioned to no one in particular. I soon chocked it up to immigrant weirdness and continued my jot. I opened the second door to the left to reveal my sad, and i do mean sad, office. It\u2019s amenities included: A chair, desk, and two guns. Yay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sat down in my uncomfortable metal stool and prepared myself for the endless line of immigrants coming through. After throwing away (Yet another) Pink vice card a poor girl gave me, i cleared my throat and spoke loud into the microphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNext!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026Next?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

At this point i was very, very confused. This had never happened before, the immigrants were supposed to flood in at the start of 6:00 A.M. But it was 6:02 A.M, and no one had come into the booth. I waited four more minutes, just to be safe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter 6 minutes of waiting, I...i decided to do something that i really never done before. What no one has done before really. I slipped out of my office and opened the entry door that leads to Kolechia. The guards looked stunned, but i did not pay them any attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s illegal for people to actually leave Arstotzka, that\u2019s why the booth only has people on the Kolechian side, because once you come, they don\u2019t let you leave. But i wasn't REALLY crossing over, i was just informing myself as to why the immigrants weren't coming. But it never occurred to me the real reason why...until i opened the entry door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI never would have thought that there just wouldn't be anybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked around the barren, grey waiting area, unusually devoid of life. No hoards of immigrants converging on my one, tiny booth. I stood with my mouth agape in the doorway, not moving, before my senses overcame me and i shut the door hastily. After a lapse of judgement, i remembered the daily bulletin. I rushed back to the inspector\u2019s side of the the booth in a flurry, earning more puzzled glances from the guards. I sat down on my uncomfortable stool and pulled the bulletin out of it's slot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInspector,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leaders of the Unified Republic of Hibernia have been summoned for diplomatic discussions on their new admittance to the council of nations in Paradizna. Your map has been Hibernia in the rulebook. Do NOT make any mistakes in the inspection of their papers, or you will suffer heavy penalties. All non-diplomatically authorized immigrants will be travelling through the newly opened Nirsk checkpoint at the seaside. Detain all Non-Diplomats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlory to Arstotzka.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy initial confusion revolving around the absence of people coming today was now replaced with newfound confusion. I had never heard of the country of this \u2018Hibernia\u2019 before. I always knew there were more countries in the world then just the ones in the Seven Members Forum, but my teachers only ever talked about them when I was a child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious, i opened my rulebook and turned to the Map page. Hibernia, from what I gathered, was an island nation in the sea south of Arstotzka and east of Impor and Kolechia. It was pretty far away from the mainland, and I gathered that's why i never hear of it until now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI composed myself and re-organized my punitive desk. I sat impatiently, fiidting my fingers as i waited for the mysterious diplomats to arrive. As i waited, I lamented, spurred by the remembering of my old school, my childhood growing up in Nirsk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShithole, as I had once described to Serigu, was putting the city nicely. The sea bellowed harsh and unforgiving winds, cold and icy and laced sorrow voices that sighed all night long. The populace decided to combat this cold with a city-wide drinking campaign, putting all their money into booze and alcohol so that they may shut the doors on the wintry climate. Nisk was a city of drunkards and alcoholics, who, like my father, struggled to suppress that agonizing pain and misery that rang in everyone's heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever made the M.O.A think that it would be a good place to set up a checkpoint?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy thoughts were interrupted by a sudden rasping at the door, and i found myself rather flustered. I seized the microphone and spoke into it with authority. \u201cNext!\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd i swear to you , after most likely thousands of entrants processed, after thousands more stamps given, I truly thought I could not be surprised by this job anymore than it already has. So as the entrant rose up to the elevated platform inside, I thought that, even though today had started off strange, there would be nothing too different from this diplomat then all the hundreds of them I had already processed. Then, it's shadow reveled it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd I almost screamed bloody murder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho's that Pokemon?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The shadow revealed itself, and no sooner than it did, my vision was obscured as a soft and warm sphere engulfed me and sent me flying. My body was flung back into the flimsy wood wall by the sheer force, enough to make it conform around my body slightly. The entire booth seemed to heave and moan and shake violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI waived my arms aimlessly around the spherical protrusion before lifting my body against the battered wall to inch up past it. As i finally wiggled my way out of the confinement, i found out two things. One, the blob of yellowish fur, which were as soft a bed but heavy like a ton of bricks, were a stomach. Second, the owner of this stomach belonged to bear. Or at least what was similar of a bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt, or really I mean she considering her rather plump breasts, was absolutely huge, in both height and width. Her head pushed through the ceiling of the booth, making it impossible to identify her height. She had this fur, this actual fur on her body: dark blue on her sides and presumably back with a cream tint on her chubby face and belly, which was currently pushing it\u2019s way into the inspector\u2019s window and crushing my desk. And me. Her eyes, i couldn't see, because they were squinted to the point that they were lines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head was abnormally huge, only made bigger by her puffed up cheeks laced with lipids, and had two small, but pointy teeth protruding from her lower jaw. My eyes briefly glanced over to the inbuilt weight scale before turning my eyes back to the creature. I was horrified that it said in bold letters, \u2018ERROR\u2019. The bear like creature gave me a smirk and giggled a very feminine giggle, making her whole body, along with her gut that i was still pinned by, quivering. \u201cOops. Sorry Mr. Inspector, I think I might have put on a few pounds.\u201d she gave me a flirty wink and patted her stomach like it was a prized pet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy cheeks reddened and found that my heart rate increased. I shook my head, with some difficulty, and struggled to compose myself. \u201cP-p-p-papers, please.\u201d I stuttered meekly, with about as much authority as a 6 year old selling lemonade. The bear creature beamed at me. \u201cOh, I have them right here! Almost forgot about them! Haha!\u201d She laughed. She reached from behind her back and produced her papers on the top of her stomach. I didn't want to know where a naked animal would be carrying things around, and i regret that i ever found out later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMiss, I can\u2019t inspect your papers in this...er...particular fashion.\u201d I said as I grabbed her passport and other documents from ontop of her protruding tummy. She maintained her happy demeanor and smile and laughed another hearty bellow. \u201cHaha! Yeah that does seem like a problem doesn't it? Hey, tell you what. How about you just stamp my passport with a nice big, shiny green checkmark, and I\u2019ll be on my way?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...No?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAwww come on! I can\u2019t stay here for long! Don\u2019t get me wrong I love your company.\u201d The way she said love made me feel uneasy, for i was oddly genuine and held no sign of sarcasm whatsoever. \u201cBut I have to attend this big party in a crappy town called \u201cParadisney\u201d, and people are gonna get md if I don\u2019t show up.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s pronounced Paradizna, and It's the capital of Arstotzka.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh...um...sorry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t be.\u201d I said, stealing myself a little smile, which was becoming more and more rare these days, \u201cThe way you described it is considered a compliment.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Snorlax's hunger isn't satisfied until it consumes 900 pounds of food. Once it is full, it promptly goes to sleep. <br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The sun hangs low over the region of Johto, shining brightly in the sky. The yellow ball of light illuminated the tops of leaves and buildings with it\u2019s life giving force, just as it has done for hundreds of years, and will continue to do so for hundreds more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun's rays were especially lazy today. Meaning, the warmth that the the star provided was just so perfect, just the perfect mix between scorching hot and cold, making the inhabitants of the region to mull about there day, tired, content, and sluggish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes it was a peaceful and serene day in Johto...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...it wouldn't stay like that forever though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep within Ilex Forest, Pokemon pranced and played around underneath the cool shade of the canopies. Beedrills sucked at the flowers, woopers splashed by the water, it was a truly carefree day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the ground underneath their feet began to shake. It was a soft tremor at first, but as time went on it became more and more violent. It Seemed like Groudon itself was paying the forest a visit. The forest trees shook and swayed like toothpicks as the earthquake continued to rage on.<br>\r\nAnd then, it stopped. The Pokemon looked around quizzingly. The forest had sustained extensive damage, but it was nothing that they couldn't fix. What really surprised them was the fact that the last time an earthquake was in Johto, the world was still be formed, What could have caused it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi awoke from her slumber, taking a nap on his very lazy day, and flew out of her forest shrine. The Pokemon all asked her questions on what was going on, but she could not answer them. Ilex forest wasn't supposed to get an earthquake for another 300 years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknownst to them, deep within another part of the forest, there lies the source of the giant quake. A giant plume of dust billowed out from a once clean and grassy field. From outside the cloud, one could scarcely see a silhouette of something, but it was too dark to make out exactly what. Whatever it was, it was big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dust soon evaporated from the air and revealed the silhouette. \u201cMmmmm...Yaaaaaaaaaawnnnn~\u201d A feminine voice moaned blissfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a large crater where the dust supposedly came from, was a Snorlax. However, there was some key differences between the Snorlax here and a regular Snorlax. This Snorlax, for one, was not 6.11 but 10.5, making it gargantuan eve for it\u2019s own species. And by it, i mean her, as this Snorlax is clearly a woman, bearing certain lady parts most Pokemon don\u2019t sport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the most obvious thing one would notice about this Snorlax was that it was f  at.  Not Snorlax fat, Guzzlord fat. She weighed exactly double a Snorlax is supposed to weigh, and carried it all in her feminine curves. Her cream furred belly jutted out from her and sagged down her crotch, obscuring her womanhood. It jiggled and quivered as the wind lightly kissed after years of being kep still underneath the Earth. On top of her stomach were breasts that beyond any breast size. They were as big as a heavy load pick-up truck and partially obscured her vision from it\u2019s girth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Snorlax\u2019s thunder thighs and hip endlessly sloshed and bobbed as adipose and lipids blorped inside. They only helped make her ass even more huge than it already was, a staggering size that would need a couch for each cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe SNorlax lady rested her pudgy arm on her gut, making it bounce like a trampoline. She rubbed it and groaned with pleasure. It has been centuries since she had felt her precious body again. She had been sleeping underneath the ground for a good deal of time, ever since she was trapped by those pesky humans. She smirked at the thought, she looked back on the event with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe those stupid apes locked me underground JUST because i destroyed their entire civilization.\u201d the Snorlax frowned a tad, \u201cI mean, it\u2019s not like i was in the wrong. A big girl like me needs to eat, and their cutesy wutesy wittle village looked sooo good.\u201d She licked her lips, remembering her past feast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was it called again? Flalf? Alphy?...eh, doesn't matter, it\u2019s long gone now.\u201d The giant female Pokemon shrugged her shoulders casually. She looked down at herself and gasped in surprise. All those yeras of sleep had managed her to actually LOSE weight? She remembered her old self, her towering body as big as a mountain, burping and gorging the land away. How long has she been under? Suddenly, her stomach brought ter out of her thought by gurgling expectantly.<br>\r\n\u201c...Speaking of food...\u201d The snorlax started to stand up, completely unaffected by her waist size,\u201dI think it\u2019s time for a little breakfast~\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe began to walk her heavy body around, heavy footfalls quaking the earth around her, leaving behind a fat footprint. She only walked a couple of steps before reaching her destination. She stopped in front f the tree line that surrounded the clearing. Thick trees wrapped around the patch of now abrte dirt, almost trying to keep her from leaving so she wouldn't spread her gluttony to other parts of the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Snorlax smiled at the foolish display the plant was making, a promptly took a bite out of it\u2019s branch. She chewed the bark and leaves around her mouth slowly, savoring the surprising amount of taste a tree can offer, before swallowing it whole. She grinned happily, and quickly took another bite out of the tree, this time bigger. Then she took another...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and another..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...and another...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil there was nothing left but the stump. She smiled and patted her flabby middle, now fully engorged as the tree inside her started to digest. Almost instantly, she felt the sorry excuse for a plant melt away, adding poundage to her frame. She shot up another foot, and her entire body got even more fat, and more squishy.<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmm...\u201d The snorlax loved the feeling of fat being poured onto her frame. It was like receiving a big hug from her! She was reminded of her glory years when she was really something to behold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a special type of breed of Snorlax, a sort of evolution for the species. Munchlax's like to eat, Snorlax's like to sleep, but her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe giggled as she remembered the nickname her parents gave her when she evolved so many years ago. They called her \u201cFatlax:, because all she ever did was want to get bigger and fatter. \u201cFatlax\u201d was a rare evolution that only occurred in Female snorlax's af full stats on every level. She went to work immediately after she evolved, eating all day and all night. When her brothers said to leave some food for them, she just ate them too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFatlax unconsciously started to munch on another tree while she was in thought. She never could not be eating food, it was against her nature. She leans against the tree and it almost instantly gets pushed out of the ground into the other trees. She rested her big hip on it, erupting a series of snaps and groans from the piece of timber, but it fell on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, back with Celebi, she heard the telltale signs of tree destruction coming from one of her favorite parts of the forest. She glared her eyes and zoomed pass the foliage a she neared the site of the sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi soon stopped in front of Fatlax\u2019s massive gut, standing (In mid Air) agape as she eyed the creature with amazement. She saw her massive form crash itself into one of her trees and she got angry instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d She said with surprising booming voice. \u201cWhat do you think you're doing?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFatlax broke out of her train of thought and lowered her head down to see who was calling her, only to find her wrecking ball boobs blocked the way. LAughing, she parted them, revealing a rather irate forest guardian.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh~!\u201d Fatlax clapped her hands together, making bosom shake with glee. \u201cAren't you a little cutie! What your name little girl?\u201d She asked in the most demeaning baby talk Celebi ever heard. How she never heard of her before is beyond her mind, but she was to mad to care at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Celebi, and you are crushing my trees!\u201d she fumed, her face red with anger. \u201cI take special care into ensuring the safety of this forest and--DID YOU EAT ONE OF THEM!\u201d She screeched as she saw the empty stump of where a tree once was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, i did. Heh, pretty tasty too!\u201d she slapped her tummy affectionately. \u201cYou-you-you're a monster!\u201d Celebi stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh. That\u2019s funny. That\u2019s what the humans called me too before they locked me underneath this place. Now...\u201d Fatlax moved her fat clawes towards Celebi. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you give Mama Fatlax a hug?\u201d.<br>\r\n\u201cWaht?! No! I'm not hugging you i'm furious with--Ooof!\u201dCelebi was cut off as she was grasped by Fatlax\u2019s hand. She brought her frail body to her massive rack, pressing her into the soft boobage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMmmmm...that\u2019s right little cutie~. Squirm for Momma.\u201d She teased wickedly as Celebi struggled against her fat. She puncehd and kicked by was powerless to do anything against her. She stopped as she heard the ominous growling of Fatlax\u2019s flabby belly. She looked up to see Fatlax\u2019s face, darkened by the shadow the sun casted as it hanged in the sky above.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow give Momma a kiss...\u201d Fatlax breathed as she brought the helpless legendary Pokemon who really should have used her time traveling powers at this point to her lips for a \u2018kiss\u2019.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>But it wasn't a kiss she received. The lips parted to reveal her gaping maw, anxiously awaiting the arrival. Celebi started in horror, but before she could even flinch in protest she was dropped into Fatlax\u2019s maw, and her lips closed shit, silencing any chance at escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swished her tongue around Celebi\u2019s body, revelling in her taste as she was helplessly flung around the Snorlax\u2019s mouth. She tied to hang on to her tongue, but it was to slick to latch on to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFatlax leaned her head back and let the small legendary fall to the back of her mouth, catching her in her esophagus. The fleshy tube wormed it's way around Celebi, who in returned struggled violently to get out. But it was far too late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFatlax traced the lump on her throat as it disappeared past her chest. It had been so long since she had eaten a something live. It was truly delicious. The throat muscles pushed Celebi all the way down her body until she was safely deposited in her soft stomach completely devoid of acid where she would rest until Fatlax let her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust Kidding. :)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFatlax sighed as she felt the new wave of aft hu=it her body. It wa barely noticeable to the naked eye, but she felt it, which was enough for her. She never really got that cute little Pokemon\u2019s name. Oh wait she did! What was it again? Celly? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sauntered off into the forest, happily eating trees along the way, hoping that one day she will come back to her old size and that there would be lots and lots of food in her future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFatlax's thick, wide, fuzzy paws crashed unforgivingly into the forest floor as she lazily sauntered around the vegetation, casually eating bits and pieces of Celebi's former forest. She always enjoyed taking time with her meals, sure she could easily mow the whole place down in an hour, but then all the flavour would be fire or lost, and no matter how many tree's she eats, she always ends up finding a new flavor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Fatlax saw something that wasent apart of the usual forest foliage. Looking over her incredibly large dome of a stomach, she spied a human village nestled quite snugly around a sea of trees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh, humans! It looks like they got a little bit more smart, but they still pick the stupidest places to build their homes. Why would you build a town inside a forest?\" Fatlax spoke to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something...different about this town though. Something that made Fatlax stare down at it longer then she realized. Sure, there was the usual aura of a uneaten feast in their like usual, but there was just something...different in their as well. An emotion that wasn't just hunger or gluttony was rare for her to feel. The last time that she felt anything else was when she was still (relatively) little and living with her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Her dad helped her catch her first meal, a nice fat, juicy Luxray. It made her feel...love. Until she ate them all. Fatlax just felt that there was something in there for her to see that wasent food. With a smile, Fatlax easily trampled down shrubbery as she strolled out of the endless sea of green canopy into the human town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmmh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just like any other morning for Charles, the sun shining into his face as he tried to blanket himself from the light, the smell of the lean, healthy foods floating around his room from the kitchen down below, and the ringing alarm clock to the side of her bed (usually by now thrown against the wall).<br>\r\nNormally the brown haired boy would just dive back to sleep on this muggy summer morning. But today was different...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday was the day that the famous Poke ball maker, Kurt,  wanted to talk to him, so forcing himself from the bed, Charles slowly headed to the bathroom to try to wake himself up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick splash of water, Charles looked in the mirror and saw the same face he saw every time he looked in a mirror. He blinks his dilapidated, powder blue eyes and stretches his arms out in front of himself in an attempt to push out the sleepiness. It was saturday, a lazy saturday too. The pidgey outside his window are chirping contently, the sun filtering into the room brightly, but not too brightly. It was a perfect day in Azalea town to just stay in bed. But for Charles, he knew that he was going to have to fight off those urges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharles leisurely walked to his dresser and assembled his attire for the day. Walking into the hall outside his bedroom, he once again is treated to the pleasant smells of cooked food emanating from the kitchen below, and he can hear the footsteps of his father as he walks about preparing them breakfast. Charles's father had always liked cooking, as long as Charles remembers. He had always hypothesized that he had a love for the practice, or at least he came to that conclusion after seeing the rather under-class food other people had been eating around the town in his school days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharles walked down the stairs and entered the kitchen as eagerly as he could considering he was still exercising off the remnants of sleep from his frame. Upon hearing Charles enter, his father turned his head to see him and smiled warmly<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, hello, my boy! You are just in time to eat breakfast. I found this new recipe yesterday and I wanted to try it out. You would not believe how many sticks of butter there is in this!\u201d he smiled, hoisting the tray up from the oven. He walked over to the kitchen table and sets the dish on it. He and Charles both sat down at the same time. Charles\u2019s father looked eagerly at his son, hoping that he was impressed with his newest culinary creation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharles looked down curiously at the monumental amount of food his father had set before him. \u201cWhat was the name of that new recipe of your, Dad?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, It was the...\u201d Charles\u2019s father pondered for moment before taking out a piece of folded up paper from his pocket. \u201c...the heart-attack snack.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharles could see how it got it\u2019s name. The thing looked to be some kind of bacon-sausage casserole thing, and true to his father\u2019s word, the whole thing was glistening with butter, not to mention it sat in a pool of the stuff, had it slathered on top and in between every layer, and it looked like several layers were just made of deep fried butter if they weren't mistaken. It also looked like it incorporated three full grown pigs' worth of bacon, and two more in sausage. There were other ingredients holding it all together, but Charles couldn't identify them as easily. But he knew this thing could probably clog a Wailord\u2019s arteries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharles took a slice from the tray, a rather large slice by his standards, but it didn\u2019t make a dent in the meal as a whole. After taking one bite, he was overwhelmed by it\u2019s taste. It sat in his stomach like a brick. It was the greasiest, fattiest, most decadent meal he had ever experienced. And he was determined not to take another bite, less he go into a caloric coma.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharles\u2019s father took a bite out of his share and too became full after just the one. His face almost looked pale, as if he was stuffed to the brim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAhh...that was...\u201d Charles\u2019s father began to say, \u201c...not meant for humans...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDad, where did you find that recipe, anyways?\u201d Charles asked, feeling that he had a right to ask how anyone could print such a disaster's instructions on paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI found It torn off from some book on the floor of the back of a bus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c...why were you looking at the floor of the back of a bus? You don\u2019t even ride the bus.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause I like to see what people left behind at the end of the day, before the bus driver has a chance to kick me off. One time I found a week old, half-eaten hamburger. Gross.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCharles refrained from retorting back and began to help put the leftovers away. The casserole needed it\u2019s own entire shelf in the fridge. Charles noticed that his father was visibly disappointed with how his latest dish turned out. He must have accidentally picked up a random recipe from a cookbook for Snorlax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of Snorlax's however...how is ours fairing as of now?</span></div></div>",

She sat next to a eevee girl with a shirt that shows of her clevage they weren't that big just a c cup but they were huge compared to her less then bee stings and from how tall Tammy was she got a look straight down her cleavge. With some junk in her trunk. \u2018It's not fair she might as well be a sex symbol compared to me yet I tower over her.\u2019 Tammy though  to herself. Tammy's stop came and she got off to go to the flea market. Tammy walked around for a bit a pokemon in a robe at the back of the market jesting for her to come forward and she forward her it was easy it the crowd to follow she was the tallest one their. The pokemon in the robe walked into the wood, Tammy followed the pokemon. She stopped at a shack in the woods and entered. The pokemon lowered her hood and reveled herself as a absol. \u2018Hey, my name is shasa welcome to my magic shop where all your dreams can come true.\u2019 \u2018In Iam just have to believe that.\u2019 Tammy said. \u2018Well my tall friend i bet you wish you were just a little bet curvyer.\u2019 The absol said \u2018And Iam just have to trust you.\u2019 Tammy said with a pout. At that moment Shasa reveling her figure. She was wearing nothing but a bikini to small for her huge bouncing g cup barly covering her nipples and large jussy rear with thick meaty thighs. \u2018Well what to you think I will show you and make me even bigger.\u2019 Shasa said bending down reaching for something show Tammy who is red with angry jealousy her a little ass jiggle and grabing a pendent and putting it on as the jewel falls in her clevage she starts expanding. Shasa's ass and breast grow larger getting more meaty per second make her bikini snap off caseing her breasts to smack and jiggle against each then self and ass jiggle. Shasha cups her now large h cups boobs and asks. \u2018Now what do you want my tall friend.\u2019</span></div></div>",

Untill I realised it was simply Lucario's chest. Upon realising this I snuggled closer into the warmth causing him to stir and wrapping his arms around me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally awake huh?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean finally? I always get up at a reasonable time\" I reply with giggle. I look up at him smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you seriously call 1:00pm reasonable?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell excuse me early bird but I need my beauty sleep\" I reply with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that is true, you need lots of it\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nI fake a gasp \"rude\". We both laugh and I wiggle out of Lucario's grasp to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So did you have a good sleep?\" I ask pulling on a pair of black skinny jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup pretty good, had an odd dream though\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah? What about?\" I reply slipping on a loose grey t-shirt. The t-shirt bearing the Pokeball logo To alert people that I was Pokemon Trainer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked up behind me and wrapped his arms around my waist with his head on my shoulder. I put on my glasses as I blush and look away. \"Food.\" He replied simply, his long and slender tongue slithered out from between his muzzle, licking my cherk cutely as he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah...I wonder w-why\" I reply sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm~tasty\" Lucario purred. He brought his arms around my chest and pulled me tighter, nuzzling my head affectionately. This only made me blush harder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on.\" I say, relinquishing my self from my treasured Pokemon's grasp. \"We gotta get ready for the tournament.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww already?\" Lucario pouted. He puffed out his cheeks and folded his arms over his chest, making him look adorable on accident. \"I wanted more time to cuddle. Five more minutes?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright.\" I say, giving into Lucario pout, \"you know I can't say no to that face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime Passes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it\u2019s a beautiful day, ladies and gentlemen, for a Pokk\u00e9n tournament! With all the excitement building, we now stand in the finals match to see who will take home the title of Pokk\u00e9n Master! And it looks like there is some stiff competition for that title!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes Kiev, some stiff competition indeed. While we all expected the local heavyweight Charizard to Rock Smash his way to the top, I\u2019ll bet no one expected his challenger to get anywhere up this mountain!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cToo right Rick! No one ever expected that this particular Lucario would trump all of its competition to reach the finals match, and I gotta say, it pulled off some impressive feats to beat everything that stood in its way. I\u2019m actually a little concerned for the Charizard, as its throne might not be as secure as its trainer thinks\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to see, as this match is about to begin!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the Ferrum Stadium, the competitors were preparing to face off in epic combat. The sky was cloudless for this match, and the sparkling waterfall acted as the perfect background for the battle of flame. On the left Charizard, on the right our lovable Lucario. The orange dragon grinned cockily at its diminutive opponent, his trembling paw holding onto my hand. \u201cCute that you got this far runt, but this is where your luck runs OUT!\u201d the Charizard boasted while grinding its fist into its claw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe relatively small Jackal trembled nervously, but it kept its stance bravely despite its nerves trying to get the better of it. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t luck you overgrown lizard! I\u2019ll beat you down like the Gengar and Braxien who looked down at me!\u201d he retorted with a quivering voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HA! Luck\u2019s luck runt, and I\u2019ll prove it by beating ya in this match!\u201d the Charizard vowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoaring loudly, Charizard took the advantage with an early Fire Punch, his bulk sailing through the air with a flaming fist. Lucario nimbly dodging out of the way, the dragon swapped into its flying stance, his mighty wings catching the air as he spiralled around. Right fist glowing with energy, he prepared to unleash a Dragon Claw as he dive bombed the jackal. Swivelling his wrist, Lucario unleashed a devastating Aura Punch attack, the tornado of blue flames knocking the lizard to the ground hard. \u201cOOOOO! CHARIZRD JUST TOOK A HARD FALL! THAT WAS A NICE COUNTER FROM LUCARIO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrunting loudly, Charizard recovered from his tumble, just in time to avoid a kick fromicario. Snarling lividly, the dragon\u2019s burning rage became an inferno from the smug grin the anthropomorphic Jackal Pok\u00e9mon had. \u201cBetter, urgh, better wipe that smug grin off your face. You got a lucky hit, but now the kiddy claws are off\" Charizard snarled<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c&lt;I TOLD YOU!&gt;\u201d Lucario snapped in annoyance, \u201c&lt;it\u2019s not luck, it\u2019s skill and training. Though it\u2019s not like a brute like yourself would understand that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smug little creature copped a fireball for that remarked, its lithe frame sliding along the hard ground. Grunting hard, its eyes opened only for its body to get grabbed hard by Charizard. Spiralling into the air, they immediately dropped from the air, ending in a devastating Seismic Toss attack. Lucario wheezed loudly from the impact, its body left in a cracked crater as it desperately tried to refill its lungs with air. \u201c&lt;Okay...,&gt;\u201d he groaned weakly, \u201c&lt;maybe there is something to brute force&gt;\u201d he admitted begrudgingly<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis wasn\u2019t looking too good. While it would be good at countering, Charizard had easily more strength and vitality than it did; and without support Pok\u00e9mon, it was very likely that he was going to lose. \u201cHA HA HA!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh come ON! That was just unsportsmanlike. Charizard was laughing hard at him as he managed to drag his body from the crater. \u201cUrgh...\u201d Braixen groaned, its left leg shaking. This was bad, his leg was hurt, and there was no way it could hope to win like this. As much as it didn\u2019t want to, it was going to have to resort to his trainer's...medicine to win this one. Breathing calmly, the Jackal grasped an orange bottle of pills that was hiding in his chest fur. Moving its top carefully, it opened and revealed his trainers special medicine: Two pills, as small as peas, but with powerful effects. Slowly, Lucario downed the two pills, sinking down into his stomach.</span></div></div>",

She always<br>\r\nenjoyed exploring the Earth, and no matter how many times she circles around it, she always<br>\r\nends up finding something new. Looking over her rather large feet she spied a human village<br>\r\nnestled quite snugly around a sea of trees. Humans seemed to find the strangest places to<br>\r\nlive, Mew thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something...different about this town though. Something that made Mew stare down<br>\r\nat it longer then she realized. Mew could sense there was something, or someone, down there<br>\r\nthat she wanted to see. She just didn't know it yet. It was not uncommon for her to feel this way<br>\r\nabout things. She felt the same way about the first time meeting her friend Mewtwo at his home,<br>\r\nshe just felt that there was something in there for her to see. With a smile, Mew easily floated<br>\r\ndown from the sky into the endless see of green foliage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo it was, Mew perched herself on one of the many red shingled roofs of the modestly sized<br>\r\nhamlet. Burr. It was nippy out. It was the last few days of autumn. It wasn't good enough for<br>\r\nsnow to fall, but almost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what's your favorite Pok\u00e9mon?\" Mew heard down below. Mew peered down the roof and<br>\r\nsaw two boys converse among themselves. \"Me?\" The other boy responded, \"Well...there are<br>\r\njust so many! How can you choose just one?\" Mew smiled, she liked this boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...just spit out the first one that you think of!\" The boy impatiently inquired. The sentence<br>\r\nwas so abrupt and snappy that it made the other boy recoil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh...Mew...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mew huh? Why? There's no way you'll ever catch one, you're too weak. You're not even a trainer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you being so mean? I don't even want to be a trainer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's stupid. Everyone wants to be a Pok\u00e9mon trainer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't. I don't like making Pok\u00e9mon fight each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bah! You're a lost cause!\" The boy retorted in a snarky way. Mew glared at the rude youth, he<br>\r\nwas arrogant and had a smart mouth, and obviously doesn't understand how to make friends.<br>\r\nThe other kid, however\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew looked around the landscape of the town. It was very small by human standards, but it had<br>\r\na quaint sense of coziness around it. Humans were good at making beautiful things...when they<br>\r\nwanted at least. She could see why that some Pok\u00e9mon might resent humans for what they<br>\r\nhave done, but each generation of them seems to get more smart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe snarky boy from before leaves his 'friend' alone with a smirk on his face. The boy looks sad,<br>\r\nand walks inside the house she was sitting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy shuts the front door behind him, He sighed heavily and walked up the foyer stairs to his<br>\r\nroom. The inside of his home was cozy, but eerily silent, not a sound in the house. The parents<br>\r\nof the boy, highly trusting of their son, left the boy alone for a month on a cruise. The boy was<br>\r\nresponsible enough to look after himself and the house, and was fine with being left alone.<br>\r\nBut after a while, they boy started to miss his parents. He had very few friends, and the boy was<br>\r\nlonely. The boy made it up the stairs to his bedroom. Not bothering with the door, he collapsed<br>\r\non his bed and buried his face into one of his pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy suddenly burst into tears, a steady flow of water staining the soft fabric of his pillow.<br>\r\nThe snarky boy from before was his neighbor, and one of the boys few friends. They had known<br>\r\neach other since they were toddlers, and has always been good friends. But after he had<br>\r\nreceived his first Pokemon and had become a trainer, he became arrogant, and started to make<br>\r\nfun of the boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, the boy was feeling extra sensitive, after getting a scolding from the teacher at school<br>\r\ntoday. And when his 'friend' made a hurtful jab at him, it was too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the blue there was a slight rapping at the bedroom window sill. The boy turned his head,<br>\r\nbut saw nothing outside. Curious, he sniffled, rubbed the tears from his eyes, and walked to the<br>\r\nglass. He pushed the latch off and opened the window, but there still was nothing outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mew~\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy jumped in surprise and nearly hit his head against the top of the window frame. He<br>\r\nquickly turned around to see what made the sudden noise. And then he froze.<br>\r\nIn front of the boy was a Pokemon. Not just any Pokemon, however. Hovering in the air not 4<br>\r\nfeet away from him, was Mew. The playful thing giggled at the boy before doing a few swoops in<br>\r\nthe air around him. The Boy thought that he was dreaming, there was no absolute way that THE<br>\r\nMew was in his house, in his room, with him! But all thoughts of doubt were silenced at the pink<br>\r\nkitten suddenly got up in his face and licked his nose. The boy gushed and stifled a laugh, but<br>\r\nnot very well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew smiled as the boy laughed. She loved lifting people's spirits. The kitten nuzzled the boys<br>\r\nchest affectionate, making the boy blush even further. Humans always liked it when they got to<br>\r\ncuddle with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I-I can't believe It...It's really you...\" the boy breathed. He suddenly found his balance out of<br>\r\nwhack and his legs feeling numb. He rested against the wall and let his body slide down to the<br>\r\nfloor, holding Mew against him. She was so soft to the touch, the boy swore his heart melted as<br>\r\none of her playful paws kicked up against his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy did not know why she was ere, or why she chose him of all people to let him see her,<br>\r\nand even hold her!m But it didn't matter, either Mew or the Boy wanted to move for a very<br>\r\nlong while, happy and content with just their embrace alone.<br>\r\nThat's when Mew broke the silence with her tummy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGRROOWLLL<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew's stomach violently shook against the boy's chest. He was surprised such a small thing<br>\r\ncould make so much noise! Mew was not so much surprised, as she was embarrassed. She<br>\r\nblushed and offered a sheepish grin t o the boy, slowly rubbing her lithe belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMustering up all the courage he had in his body, the boy decided to actually talk to mew and not<br>\r\njust stare at her. \"Would you...like something to eat?\" the boy asked softly, not wanting to sound<br>\r\nintrusive and drive the Legendary away. Mew looked up at the boy in surprise, and a smile<br>\r\nslowly formed on her face. She brought her hands up in the air to signify her approval, looking<br>\r\nvery cute doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Boy chuckled, got up on his feet, still holding the small kitty, and started to walk downstairs.<br>\r\nHe was already feeling better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew laid back into the Boy's chest and let out a sigh. She was happy she came down to this<br>\r\nvillage. Not only was she getting a free meal, but she also helped someone feel happy, and that<br>\r\nis all that really matters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy walked into the kitchen and set Mew down on the good seat so she would be comfy. He<br>\r\nhad memorized every recipe in the cookbook and was happy to cook for someone. He always<br>\r\nwanted to be a chef more than a trainer. His parents never really understood why, and for some<br>\r\nreason was in outright denial when he brought it up. The boy supposed that all parents want<br>\r\ntheir kids to be trainers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whipped up a few homemade pancakes quickly, and set the plate in front of Mew. The<br>\r\npsychic cat eyed the dish curiously. It was obviously bigger than herself in both width and<br>\r\nheight. She had seen the Humans eat this before but she had never herself. The boy noticed<br>\r\nher hesitation and instantly became worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Do you not like it? I'll make something else for you if that's what you want.\" The<br>\r\nboy offered generously. Mew shook her head, not wanting to be rude. Eventually, Mew took a<br>\r\ndeep breath a took a small bit from the fluffy rises of dough and syrup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then she took another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew was eating the plate so fast she had barely enough time to realize what she was doing.<br>\r\nShe had never tasted anything like this in her whole life, anything this delicious! She just<br>\r\nshoveled bit after bit into her maw, wanting--no, needing more. And before she know it there<br>\r\nwas nothing left on the plate to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy stood amazed as he pieced together what just happened. He had never seen anyone,<br>\r\nmuch less a Pokemon, eat that fast. Mew's stomach, once small and only a little puffy, was now<br>\r\ndistended into a perfect sphere that was bigger then her body. Mew rubbed her gut softly,<br>\r\nenjoying this new sensation.</span></div></div>",

She was<br>\r\nnot paying attention to her body at the time and simply mewed softly as a sense of sleepiness<br>\r\novercame her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy watched in amazement as the creature in front of him slowly but steadily grew outward<br>\r\nand upwards. The sleepy legendary\u2019s rear end slowly formed into a sizable little bubble butt,<br>\r\nslightly enveloping her thickened tail that swished from side to side on the countertop. Mew\u2019s<br>\r\nthighs, already slightly pronounced, now jutted out from her frame considerably, warm jiggling<br>\r\nfat supporting her hind quarters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach had stopped shrinking, but was now replaced with a spherical pot belly tah rested<br>\r\non her lap. Her legs and arms had puffed up as well, once rail thin, now had a healthy layer of<br>\r\npadding. Mew\u2019s chin slowly turned into a double chin, and her cheeks bulged out like a<br>\r\nWatchdog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew didn't seem to notice the gain, surprisingly.

She was starting to regret eating all that food at once.<br>\r\nShe gave out a small burp, and fell back onto the cool, slick tiled surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy stood motionless for a few moments before attempting to pick up the sleeping Mew. He<br>\r\nhad not expected anything like that to happen when she ate his food. But at the very least, she<br>\r\nappeared to like it, or dare he say, love it from how fast she ate it! As soon as he picked her up,<br>\r\nhe noted another difference that he did not notice before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore, the boy was able to cradle the small cat in his arms very easily, considering she was<br>\r\nroughly the size of his chest. But now...it seemed to the boy that Mew grew! It wasn't much,<br>\r\nprobably only 4 inches, but it was still noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy also took into account how much more soft and cute Mew was now. She was already<br>\r\ninsanely cuddly with her super-fine fur, but her added pudge gave her an extra squish and<br>\r\nwarmth that she hadn't had before. Her cute faci features, to the boy, had only increased in<br>\r\nfactors of adorableness, her bloated cheeks and chins only amplifying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Boy looked down Mew sleeping in his arms with a warm smile. It felt nice to have her be so<br>\r\nclose to him, to have someone to care for. The Boy walked out of the kitchen with Mew still in<br>\r\nhis arms. As he traversed the staircase back up to his room, mew tossed and turned against his<br>\r\nchest, trying to get comfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really are cute, you know that?\u201d the boy hugged the sleeping Pokemon to his chest. \u201cYou<br>\r\njust make me want to hug you forever and never let go.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew said nothing in response, but in her nap she buried her head into the Boy\u2019s chest, as if she<br>\r\ncould hear him and she was signifying the feelings were mutual. The Boy made it up to the flight<br>\r\nof stairs and entered his room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy walked over to his bed and pried Mew from off of his chest. He set the cute little thing<br>\r\nunderneath the covers of his bed and tucked them over her small, but fat body, sending her into<br>\r\nfurther warmth and sleep. The Boy smiled and left his room as to not disturb his new guest. He<br>\r\nhad homework to do and he was more then happy to do it outside his room.<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------<br>\r\nLater that night\u2026<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------<br>\r\nMew woke up in the middle of the night at the young human's house. She felt rejuvenated and<br>\r\nrefreshed as she stretched her pudgy arms over her head. She craned her neck from side to<br>\r\nside to get out any pesky thoughts of sleep. She looked around and realized that she had gone<br>\r\nto sleep in the boy's bed. How sweet of him to offer his room to her she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that mew finally realized the results of her overeating many hours ago. She saw her<br>\r\nfattened stomach and poked at it puzzlingly, not knowing where it had come from. It quivered in<br>\r\nresponse, erupting a giggle from the legendary. She also noticed that she was significantly taller<br>\r\nthan before,and her limbs and rear end had thickened up as well. She swished her newly<br>\r\nfattened tail around the bed sheets before wrapping it around herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew decided that the changes were unexpected, but not unwelcome. Besides, the more there<br>\r\nis of her, the more there is to love, right? That's what the humans have always said anyway.<br>\r\nShe hopped off the bed and levitated into the air. She was about to fly out the window, before<br>\r\nlooking back at the bedroom door. Surely, she could spend one minute to see the boy one last<br>\r\ntime, couldn't she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe teleported herself into the downstairs living room and saw the boy. He had gone to sleep on<br>\r\nthe couch and was wrapped up in a blanket. Mew smiled warmly, grateful that the boy gave her<br>\r\nsuch soft sleeping arrangements at the expense of his comfort. She noticed there was<br>\r\nsomething on the coffee table that caught Mew's eye. It was a red velvet cupcake with a note<br>\r\nleaning against it. Mew levitated the note up to her and read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Mew,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThank you for cheering me up today. I really needed it. I hope that i will one day see you again.<br>\r\nSigned, Stan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nP.S I made a cupcake for you if you want It. You like my food so much earlier, I thought you<br>\r\nmight want some more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew remarked on how she spent all this time with the boy without knowing his name. Stan,<br>\r\nhuh? Not the name she would have picked, but a names a name, she guessed. She returned<br>\r\nher stare to the cupcake, eagerly awaiting for someone to eat it. Mew reasoned that it would be<br>\r\nrude to eat the cupcake. She didn't want to give the impression the Bo--Stan was a bad host.<br>\r\nShe floated down to the coffee table and started digging into the dessert greedily. This dish she<br>\r\nwas familiar with, and she remembered the taste with glee. She guzzled down the frosting, not<br>\r\nleaving a single ounce of it smeared on her cheeks. By the time she was finished with the top,<br>\r\nshe was already sucking down the chocolate filling. She munched into the sides of the cupcake<br>\r\nwith happiness, and in a few more seconds there was nothing left but a single measly crumb.<br>\r\nMew belched softly and blushed hard, happy that there was no one around to see her make<br>\r\nsuch a Tepig out of her self. He belly had once again inflated to insane amount, but she didn't<br>\r\nfeel tired like before. Rather, her stomach was anticipating such a large meal and was using a<br>\r\nlot less energy to convert int into proper nutrients.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mew hovered herself onto the couch next to Stan\u2019s sleeping form. She felt heavy and wanted to<br>\r\nsit down before she headed out. She was careful not to make a sound as to not wake him up,<br>\r\nbut as she was getting comfortable in the couch\u2019s cushions, she accidentally kicked her large<br>\r\npaws into his body. Not enough to hurt of course, but enough to wake up a human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan fluttered his eyes open and sat up groggily, not particularly happy to have been woken up<br>\r\nin the middle of the night. He surveyed his surroundings for what woke him up, and his eyes<br>\r\neventually fell on Mew, with a rather guilty look on her face, sitting next to him. \u201cOh,\u201d Stan eased<br>\r\nup, \u201cHello Mew, is there something you needed?\u201d he asked innocently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew was about to shake her head to decline her generous host, but she was interrupted by a<br>\r\nvery low and steady noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Grrrrwwrrll\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew blushed as red as roses as she realized it was her stomach. What was going on with her?<br>\r\nShe never gets hungry like this. Usually she just keeps it under control by using her psychic<br>\r\nabilities and only releases them when she want\u2019s to indulge. But this wasn't natural hunger, this<br>\r\nwas...want. Want to the point her body is telling her she needs food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan noticed Mew\u2019s expression and her belly rumbling. He chuckled softly and got off the couch.<br>\r\nHe carefully reached out for mew to hop into his arms and she obliged, letting him carry her.<br>\r\nStan remained silent and walked to the kitchen, much to Mew\u2019s confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMew,\u201d Stan started after a relatively long silence. They had entered the kitchen and stan had<br>\r\nset Mew down on the countertop. \u201cIf you want I...what I mean is...I noticed you were still hungry<br>\r\nand I\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused and fumbled with his mouth, trying to get the words to formulate. Mew noticed a<br>\r\nextra shade of colour appearing on his cheeks. \u201cWell I Like cooking.. I-I-I like cooking for you.\u201d<br>\r\nMew tilted her head, puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan took a deep breath and turned to the refrigerator, opening It. \u201cIt\u2019s just that...when you're<br>\r\naround, and when I was making food for you\u2026I felt needed. I like feeling needed. My parents<br>\r\nlike to do everything for me and they never let me return the favor. But when I\u2019m with you...I feel<br>\r\nweird. A good weird I think.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew eventually understands what Stan is saying and smiles warmly at him. She hovered<br>\r\nherself in the air and stealthily crept her way behind Stan. \u201cWhat I\u2019m trying to say is,\u201d he turned<br>\r\naround, but as he was about to say something he was interrupted the very cute and pudgy Mew<br>\r\nright in front of his face. She grinned and planted a tiny little kiss on his forehead, silencing him.<br>\r\nStan and Mew stared at each other in silence, both unmoving, unblinking. Some people might<br>\r\ncall what they were doing \u201cAn uncomfortable silence\u201d, but in truth, only Stan was uncomfortable.<br>\r\nMew was rather enjoying herself. And she had a nagging suspicion she was going to enjoy<br>\r\nherself even more soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in one moment, in one tiny nanosecond of a moment, Stan thought he heard someone<br>\r\nspeak to him in his head. A feminine, rather high pitched voice. Mew was speaking to him<br>\r\ntelepathically, and it was the first time he ever heard her actually talk besides saying \u2018Mew\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI'm hungry, please feed me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew gave an almost sultry look and hovered herself back to the counter, opening her mouth<br>\r\nexpectantly to the blushing boy. The young human blushed beyond red, and quickly turned<br>\r\nhimself back around and grabbed some foodstuffs from the fridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew\u2019s stomach roared in impatience as it voiced it\u2019s disapproval for having to wait so long. Mew<br>\r\nsmacked her belly as an attempt to scold it, but all that amounted to was sending waves of<br>\r\nblubber bob along her body, making it gurgle louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan wasted no time in grabbing a grabbing food. He carried from the fridge to the counter<br>\r\nchocolate chip cookies, marshmallow puffs, a full carton of pudding, a carton a chocolate<br>\r\nMooMoo Milk, 2 giant jars of pickles, and last but not least, a beautiful cake! Mew\u2019s eyes<br>\r\nwidened in excitement as all the food was laid out of front of her. It was if someone had turned a<br>\r\nlight inside her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImpossible to contain her excitement, Mew dove into the food without a second thought, or<br>\r\nwithout giving Stan the chance to actually feed her. She started with the cake and tore great,<br>\r\nbig chunks out it with her small paws and cramming them her greedy gullet. She decided to<br>\r\nwash down the cake and fattening butter cream icing with some chocolate milk, drinking the<br>\r\nwhole bottle dry and made sure not to leave a single droplet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she glutted and chomped and feasted, she grew. Her belly just exploded as the food<br>\r\ndigested into smooth, cuddly flab. In a minute it was too big for her haunches and cascaded<br>\r\ndown into the tiled surface. Her rear end and thighs evolved from a cute bubble butt to<br>\r\ndownright beach balls in comparison to her little body. Chins upon runs from ned on her face<br>\r\nand neck as her cheeks blobbed out from her face. Mew laughed happily as the fool told tickled<br>\r\nher warm belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she got fatter and fatter, she also got taller. Stan watched the rapidly ballooning mew<br>\r\ntake up more surface area. Her huge feet got even more huge and were making tiny spider<br>\r\ncracks in the tile under her increasing weight. The flow of growth made her go from being a<br>\r\nsmall foot and a half tall to 2 feet. Then 3 feet\u2026then 4 feet\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStan watched with a mix of fear and awe. Fear because he was concerned if what was<br>\r\nhappening to mew was healthy, and awe because he rather enjoyed swing her so happy. And<br>\r\nby the rim she finished all the fox that he had bright to her, mew was, to put it lightly, huge.<br>\r\nNo longer the tiny little kitten that she was before, Mew had grown to just under Stan\u2019s height,<br>\r\nan impressive 5.5 ft! She was also much, much more heavy then she was before she started<br>\r\neating, once just a meager 8 lbs, now she was a whopping 200! Perhaps even more! She took<br>\r\nup the entire space of the counter top with her form alone, letting her blubber slightly droop<br>\r\nalong the edges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew smiled goofy and rubbed a single paw against her very large and puffy gut, enjoying how<br>\r\nsoft and warm it was. Stan stood in shock, surprised at how fast Mew grew in such a short<br>\r\namount of time, before tentatively placing his left hand on her stomach as well. He ran his<br>\r\nfingers against her oh so soft fur and smiled was Mew let out a happy cry, obviously enjoying<br>\r\nwhat he was doing/<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, both of them heard a strange rattling sound underneath Mew. Stan looked down to<br>\r\nsee cracks branching down from the top of the counter down to the floor, chips of it starting to fly<br>\r\noff. Before he could react, Mew me weight proved to be too much for the poor piece of furniture<br>\r\nand it fell apart, along with mew, to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMew!\u201d Stan exclaimed as Mew landed on the ground with a heavy thud. \u201cAre you alright!?\u201d He<br>\r\nasked, but it came out more like a shout he was so scared. Mew replied with a cough as the<br>\r\ndust settled around yet and she rubbed her head as though it had hit something. Stan got on his<br>\r\nknees and began to inspect the fallen legendary. She seemed fine, but he was still worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you're not hurt? Nothing out of place?\u201d He Asked frantically. Mew waved her paw<br>\r\nin a dismissing notion, her arm flab shaking and giggling madly. She then began to stand up,<br>\r\nwith some help from Stan as support. It was a bit surreal to the human child to see Mew, who<br>\r\nearlier this day was able to fit in his arms, now came up to his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMew smiled up at Stan and gave him and wrapped her pudgy arms and tail around him in a<br>\r\nhug. Stan was surprised at first, but eased himself into it, slowly returning the hig. He figured<br>\r\nthat this was how she was showing thanks for helping feed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Grrrrrooowlll\u2026\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Stan and Mew shot their eyes opened in surprise and looked down t her bloated stomach.<br>\r\nDespite eating enough food to last a family for three days, she was still hungry! Mew blushed<br>\r\nand looked back up to Stan with wanting, maybe needing eyes. Stan slowly smiled warmly and<br>\r\npatted Mew on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStill hungry, huh?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMew\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think there's still some food left in the fridge.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Out from the portal steps out Arceus, the creator Alpha Pokemon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Arceus's body fully entered the forest clearing, the Portal behind him closed shut, making a thunderclap that echoed across the forest. Arceus knelt at the shore of the pond and bent his neck down to take a relaxing drink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see, this particular pond was of very special interest to the Alpha Pokemon. It was one of the only bodies of water that human hands or Pokemon had not touched, his own personal drinking supply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Arceus had his fill of water, he stood up straight and began to wade through the shallow pool. He sat down on his rear and dunked his head in the water, enjoying the plesant coolness washing over him. After a couple of seconds he brought his head back up, letting refreshing water trickle down his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sigh...\" Arceus sighed in content and closed his eyes. Being father of the Legendaries is no walk in the park. Always quarreling over petty arguments while putting a bunch of innocents in risk. He needed to get away from them once in a couple centuries to relax.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a couple of months ago, Palkia and Dialga tried to kill each other over something as childish as 'who's better', and a town got stuck in the middle of them and almost got destroyed! If it wasent for the Chosen one, then that poor town would have...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash...\" Arceus whined to herself. \"Why can't I stop thinking about you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true. Ever since Ash saved him from hurting all those people Michina Town, he had been spying on his life from time to time to \"check up on him\". For some reason, Ash had made an impression on Arceus. His nobility and courage in face of impossible odds was rare in Humans, and most Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the biggest reason Ash attracted Arceus's attention was his happiness. He saved the world like, fourteen times, and he always had a smile on his face while doing it. Joy was a...distant emotion to Atceus. It's not that he's unhappy, he just doesn't have many likes or wants. Sometimes he wishes that he could just talk to him and ask him what being happy likes, but he couldent do that, he's the God Pokemon, he has to keep up an appearance of-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus's train of thought was cut short as he heard something rustle in the bushes nearby. His head shot straight up and glared in the direction of the noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoever is there,\" Arceus snarled, \"Show yourself, or else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn awkward silence fills the air of the shallow pool. Arceus's gaze never left the bushes as he waited for an awnser. Finnaly, a human hand appears out from behind the foliage, using a nearby tree as a support to get up. Soon, the rest of the body came into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A...Ash?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut from behind the bushes came Ash Ketchum, the hero from Pallet Town and Arceus's Chosen one. He had his hand on his head, grinning nervously like a kid getting caught with the hand in the cookie jar. \"Uhhh...hey Arceus. How you uh...how ya doin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus looked down at Ash with...</span></div></div>",

But what are you doing here?\" He asked gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I...um...I was taking a walk in the forest when I heard a Big Bang, and I thought someone was hurt.\" Ash shuffled his legs uneasily \"But I didn't think that I would ever find...you\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus grinned a little bit more. He started to wade across the shallow pond towards Ash. Ash stared agape as Arceus's shadow eclipsed him as the God Pokemon stood over his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing his face like that made Arceus chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash,\" Arceus said working up the nerve to speak to him, \"As long as your here, do you mind if we have a little...talk?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhhmm\" Ash froze up. You would think after spending so much time with legendaries he would be used to talking to them. \"...sure?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus almost burst out lapping seeing Ash's reaction, but manged to suppress it. Suddenly Arceus began to glow. It was subtle at first, but soon he grew so bright that Ash had to cover his eyes. When the light subsided, Ash opened his eyes to an amusing sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus was no longer the towering giant he was before. Now, Arceus was at the height of a little bit over a sawsbuck, not as tall as he was before by a long shot, but still was taller than Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-why did you d-d-do that Arceus?\" Ash stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus tilted his head on his side and smiled. \"I thought that shrinking down to a less imposing level would be more comfortable for you...Unless of course you would like me to change back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Ash shouted. \"I mean 'clears throat' no, uh, I like you better this way. I MEAN, not that I didn't like you before I just-\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus cut Ash's amusing rambling short by bringing up a hoof to his face in a improvised shushing way. Ash immediately fell silent. Arceus then gestured Ash to sit dos on the grass, which he did without hesitation. Arceus walked over to where he was sitting and popped his rear down next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what did you want to talk about Arceus?\" Ash said, regaining his composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" Arceus started to blush, \"this is a rather silly question. But...Ash...what makes you happy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happiness is...very foreign to me.\" Arceus explained. \"And I want to understand what being happy feels like, and how you cause it. So, to reiterate, what makes you happy Ash?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh felt a twinge of sadness for Arceus. Doesn't know happiness? That's no way to live!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, being with my friends always puts a smile on my face!\" Ash exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Friends?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...is there...anything else? I'm not too good at making friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh felt seven more sad for Arceus now. \"Well, I feel good after eating a good meal, but I doubt that you-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean food?\" Arceus suddenly shot up. \"Food makes you happy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a way I guess.\" Ash reached into his backpack he was carrying and pulled out a little cupcake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom packed me lunch in case I would stay out here longer than I planned. Would you like some?\" Ash held out his hand offering the cupcake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus inspected the pastry curiously. It looked decent enough. And it would be incredibly rude to turn down an offer from the chosen one. 'Eh, why not?' Arceus thought to himself. He gave his equivalent of a shrug since he doesn't have shoulders, and took a bite out the cupcake from Ashs hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus's eyes dilated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis whole body froze up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mouth started to drool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh started to worry that there was something wrong. \"Arceus are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus responded only by swallowing the cupcake bite with an audible gulp. He stayed frozen for a couple more seconds, before he clamped his mouth shut on the rest of the cupcake with Ashs hand with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"GAH! Arceus what are you doing.\" Ash Screamned, not expecting this at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus swallowed the rest of the cupcake and started to moan with pleasure His body wiggled with joy as he felt the sweet pastry travel down his through the info his belly. He sat down on the ground dragging Ash with him into his torso. After he stopped shivering he finnaly released Ashs hand, covered in saliva.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...was...PERFECT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"PERFECT?\" Ash questioned. \"Arceus are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, much to Ash's surprise, Arceus quickly wrapped his two front legs around him, embracing him in a hug. Ash blushed tomatoe red. The first thing Ash's mind registered was how SOFT Arceus's fur pelt was. The second thing was 'why is the most powerful Pokemon hugging me?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Ash,\" seemingly reading his mind. \"Thank you soooo much. I haven't felt such emotions in Centuries.\" Arceus's voice had lost his formality and you could her euphoria dripping off it. \"You were right, Food DOES make you happy.\" Arceus rested his head on Ash, knocking off his hat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh was now blushing profusely. Reviving such attention and affection from Arceus made his body go numb, and he couldent tell whether this was a weird experiance or a good one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Arceus's stomach, reacting from eating something after thousands of years, gurgled so loudly that Ash was shook violently up and down. Arceus released his right limb off ash and poked his belly curiously, prompting another gurgle. Arceus giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like I still want more food.\" Arceus giggled. Arceus's eyes were set on...</span></div></div>",

He rolled his tongue over his metallic muzzle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe suddenly sprang up from the ground and pranced like a Deerling to the backpack with a hungry look in his eyes...lightly trampeling Ash under his hooves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW! Arceus! What are yo-'GURK!' Hey!\" Ash cried in pain as Arceus planted his foot, unintentionally, in his mouth. Arceus either paid him no heed or couldent hear him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus jumped up into the air, hung still for a moment, and crashed down back to earth onto of the backpack, like a predator would keep its pray from running away. And like a predator, Arceus dove his head into the satchel and started scarfing down anything edible. Apparently, Delia had packed Ash a whole dozen cupcakes, thinking that he might want to feed the local Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, in a way the cupcakes served there purpose, but Arceus isn't really what you call a local Pokemon. But he didn't care about who they were for, he just wanted to eat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArceus quickly dove into the cupcakes, smearing pink icing on his metal cheeks. He ate with a speed that was unnatural even for him, and in no time at all, the pastries were no more. Another chill of intends pleasure filled Arceus's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I've never felt like this before' Arceus thought to himself. 'Is this feeling...happiness?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The intence sensation as it dances across your tongue, the feeling of it working dos your throat, the fullness you get in your stomach...' Arceus almost fell into another food coma, before his gut brought back his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGUURRGGLE<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise surprised Arceus. It was foreign to him, since he never eaten food before. But guessing from what he pieced together by spying on humans, he assumed that the noise was hunger. And hunger is a mortal thing your stomach does when it needs more food. So, much to Arceus's pleasure, he resumed eating from Ash's sack to stop feeling hunger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the time he was glutting, Ash looked from afar and saw the legendary alpha Pokemon raid is backpack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Maybe I shouldn't have given him that cupcake.' Ash mused. He may be a bit dense, but he could tell that Arceus was acting very different. Usually, he's all serious and intimadating, but now...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...it's like there's this newfound joy in him. Like a kid almost. He was now light on his feet where before he would somberly march. He's...giddy. It kinda made him look cute in Ash's opinion. So cute, that he was having a hard time be mad at him for trampling on him like a herd of bouffalant and raid his backpack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh kept staring at Arceus's display of gluttony. After a couple minutes, he either was full, or ran out of food, because Arceus finnaly raised his head from Ash's now entirely devoid of food sack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrumbs were plastered on Arceus's smiling face. He sat dow on his haunches and closed his eyes, like he was meditating or something. Ash cautiously approached Arceus, not wanting to get glomped on again, even if it did feel nice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Arceus's eyes shot wide open, but this time, ash could see that there was something other than joy behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPain<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AAAARRRGGH!\" Arceus Screamned in pain, a streak a hot water streaming from his eyes. Ash rushed to his side, trying to figure out what's wrong. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arceus? What happened?! Are you okay?!\" That was a stupid question ash thought to himself, if course he's in pain!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrf...my...stomach....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh no' ash thought, 'It must have been something he ate'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash.. \" Arceus wheezed, \"there is a...latch on my..plate wheel.\" He must have meant the ring that surrounded his body Ash thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Release it...please.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh didn't get an awnser. Instead he received another contorted look of misery from Arceus as another wave of pain hit him. Although he was still confused, he got up from the ground and started to insoect the ring. He looked hard and long but he couldent find anything that looked loke a latch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's...on my belly...\" Arceus wheezed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh got down on all fours and crawled in between his haunches. There, he found a veeeeery tiny little hatch on his wheel. He fumbled with it a bit, but he managed to release it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A small pod of wailord, some of the largest living Pokemon that could be found had beached themselves and ultimately wound up perishing on the sandy shores. Rather or not they had been trying to aide the first trapped, fooled on to it by human sonars, or been desperate enough to risk shallows for food, one thing was certain. From the horrid scene of death, arose a nessecary of life for others. In their deaths, the enormous water types provided others with a life sustaining chance for food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn theory at least, for some unknown reason the banquet of precious calories remained untouched by the usual scavengers of the Unovan coast. The mystery handing over the scene for a bit of time before it's answer was revealed. As trees were brushed aside and sudden drop of temperature could be felt, the frozen dragoness that was the Boundary Pokemon Kyurem arrived at the beach. Her mere presence scarring of the usual suspects. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever the sound of beating wings signaled the arrival of a not so typical visitor. Landing on his grey talons, the Rainbow Pokemon Ho-Oh arrived on scene. To the displeasure of the dragon who was less then pleased with the prospect of having to share in the bountiful feast. \"What are you doing here, rainbow chicken.\" The female legend asked with a slight growl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUndetected by the show of aggression. Undercut by the reason the two where here, louder growls from the empty bellies of both Pokemon. \"I would imagine the same as you, hungry for a meal.\" Ho-Oh had paused in his flight at the chance of a meal, having just underwent the long flight from Johto to Unova. A wing was raised and waved over the scene, \"Surely there is more then enough for is both to have our fill.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps, am hungry. Can surely eat more then a bird.\" Granted Ho-Oh was even larger then her, but the younger legend was not to keen on the idea of having to share. Excess of food aside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slightly older Pokemon however appeared to know how to deal with his unruly dinner date. \"Care to place a wager on it?\" Almost as swiftly as the challenge had been raised was it accepted. Meals secured the duo went to opposite ends of the feast and dug in with beaks and fangs. Feathers and scales stained red as the duo raced in their display of gluttony. </span></div></div>",
