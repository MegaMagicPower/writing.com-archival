This monster is Opal, your social worker, who was tasked with making sure you were taken care of while in the orphanage. On the days that she sees you, she would wear a red pantsuit and horn-rimmed glasses. She was also what a person would call 'a bit on the pudgy side,' but that didn't really matter to you, since she wasn't wearing but a simple dress and ordinary glasses in the office today. This could only mean one thing: she was the one that was adopting YOU. At first you are surprised, but that soon leaves and is replaced with...hope maybe? <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The silence must have been too much for the owner, because he says \"ahem,\" rather roughly, this brings you both back to the present and then you two look at him. \"Look I have some stuff to do alright, so the sooner we're done here, the quicker I can't get them done.\" The owner's tone and gestures he makes while saying this seems to annoy Opal a bit, since she stares at him intensely but she quickly regains her composure and replies, \"you're right, let's move on.\" \"Thank you,\" answers the owner. <br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0You watch as Opal signs some papers, as well as handing over some money to the owner. After this is done, you are handed over to her, she carefully places you between her cleavage. Then she proceeds to exit the building and as soon as the both of you are outside, Opal spreads her wings wide and says to you with care and concern, \"hold on Timmy, you'll be at your new home soon.\" You clasp the front of her dress and hold on with all your strength as she takes off and starts to fly away. However, you ask in your mind 'where exactly is home?' </span></div></div>",

Despite her species being known to eat humans like Tommy, she is actually harmless and is married to a human man named Vernon, and has adopted a werejaguar monster girl named Felicia as her daughter.

She has blue scales with a yellow underbelly and blonde hair that reaches to her backside. Dinah works as a waitress in Grimmsly Lodge that is owned by Azure Skinwalker. Dinah has an apparent obsessive crush on a <i>certain</i> human boy that works at the same place she does, so she  wears a skimpy waitress outfit and may wear skimpy clothing as well. Whether she eats humans or not is unclear. However, since she is in love with a human boy, Tommy might be okay. She might be adopting him to get the attention of the human boy she adores (and stalks frequently.)</div></span></div></div>",

Apparently, the director is getting annoyed, but eventually calms down when he enters his office and reveals the small human boy in his hand to Mrs. Skinwalker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>In Tommy's POV:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare back at the giantess with pure horror. A werecoyote! Like werewolves, this species is known to hunt humans as well. Getting a better look, you notice that she is covered in thick silver fur; appears to have a heavyset build and is wearing nothing but a white polo shirt with light grey pants. However, what was even more striking was the white crescent moon shaped birthmark in the centre of her head. Apparently the female werecoyote notices you staring at her birthmark and smiles warmly back at you. Later she asks in a motherly tone (to your surprise) \"Hello there my name is Azure...what is yours?\" Trying to answer, you simply stammer \"T-Tommy.\" Azure simply smiles and replies \"what a lovely name...\" A cough from the director brings you both back to the present. \"Oh right,\" Azure gives an apologetic look to the director. Pretty soon, you see Azure sign some documents and handing over a wad of cash to the director. Afterwards, you are placed in between her cleavage, which you soon find to be nice and soft, thanks to her fur. It's not soon you find yourself falling asleep, while Azure looks down on you with paternal love and a nice smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>In Azure's POV:</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get in your...vehicle, which is a cross between a gigantic snowmobile and jeep.
