Flash!\" shouted the feline chief of the city's security team, as he rushed to the city's guardian. Flash looked 17 years old, and wore a black leather jacker and blue jeans over his brown-furred body. A Japanese-style sword was prodded against him in its scabbard. He had been meditating when the chief had called him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlash twitched his whiskers as he said, \"What is it, chief?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chief then explained, \"Flash, we just picked up signs of an intruder in the west area of the city,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, chief; I will inspect this,\" said Flash, picking up his sword. The chief didn't ask if he needed back-up...Flash was probably the most powerful warrior in all of Felonia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, Flash was walking through the west area, when he came across an unconcious figure laying on the ground. He cautiously approached it, and found the figure was a girl...</span></div></div>",

Perhaps the fact that large women were in style in this place had something to do with it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlash smiled, amused by the Bat's antics. \"I see you're still testing the Cheif's curse.

While it certainly sounded like the curse could and would be broken once she gained the trust of Flash and the High Cheif, she wondered if the weight gained from this was pernament or not. She hoped not. Otherwise, she would have no reason to leave this town. Well, at least it's nice to know that she wouldn't have trouble finding someone here. She could probably have any man in THIS town with the way she looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlash lead Rouge to a guest room and left so she could change in private. Rouge scanned the various clothes...and what a selection he had! All kinds of clothes and sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge pulled out the clothes that would fit her best with her added weight.

She had some trouble sleeping, as she wasn't used to being 2-3 times heavier than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Rouge got up to look at herself, she noticed something curious. While the curse mostly affected certain areas first, she noticed that the weight shifted to other areas, making her more proportionate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomache and chest were the larger parts of her, her chest just barely sticking out further than her stomach, but she also noticed that some of the weight made her frame wider...about twice as wide as before. Her legs were almost as thick as a normal or thin human and so were her arms. The were soft to touch, her back was softer and thicker, her thighs rubbed against each other. Even her face look more fuller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*groan* Well, I suppose I look better this way than being unproportionate...but still, this is quite inconvient...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge went back to the closet and pulled out what appeared to be a pair of jeans and a large shirt. She quickly put them one and took a look at herself. Surprisingly, they were actually kind of loose on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" Rouge thought to herself. \"Now I don't have to worry about ripping these clothes if I lie again....which I should avoid for now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlash knocked at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...come in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlash came in and smiled as he looked at Rouge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, Rouge.

It was a bit odd with all the weight. Everytime she walked, her thighs rubbed next to each other and caused her hips to slowly swing side to side. Her body was much more jiggly and shook a little more as she moved. The thing she noticed the most was how much harder it was to move with all the bulk. It was then she realized that she probably would never be able to fly again...that is, if she was to keep all this weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge shuffled in her seat a few times. The chair she was directed towards before Flash dissappeared into the kitchen was rather large...probably suited specifically for the females of this town.

That old man wasn't kidding when he said he did this to make me be loyal. *sigh* I'm too young to deal with this crap.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge sniffed the air. The food smelled great. Rouge took her mind off her anger for a moment and thought about Flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to admit, he is probably the first guy to actually treat me like a lady for once. Knuckles is stubborn to his extinct tribe and won't let me have that emerald and Shadow is rather cold...but Flash is different. Course, he might be attracted to me because of all this weight but even before the curse he acted like he was concerned about me...I never had that before....I wonder what he wanted to talk to me about.

It looked a lot more advanced than she thought it would be. Rouge had to wait in an empty room while Flash talked to a man for checking in. The one things in the room was a table and a few chairs, the largest one for Rouge concerning her weight. Finally, Flash and a man with a notebook came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Rouge. Now I just want you to relax.\" Flash said. \"I'm going to ask you some questions and I want you to answer honestly. I don't think you have anything to be afraid of admitting here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's he's doing here?\" Rouge asked, pointing to the man with the notebook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's going to record your responses. This is normal procedure in cases like this. We have to have someone not involved as an objective observer. Not then, let's begin. Rouge, is it true that you are a spy for your government, which part of a nation from the outside world?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I am! I already told you that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax. I know, but this is a standard question. Now, what kind of things did you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, mostly recon missions.

Sure, Rouge would be considered a knock-out in this town, and he thought Rouge was becoming even beautiful than this morning but he kept reminding himself that she was an outsider and therefore thought like an outsider. Maybe tomorrow he could convince the High Chief to show Rouge some mercy and break the curse. Even if she was a threat before, she's harmless now she's so large.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge slept for about two hours. When she got up, she noticed something odd. The weight shifted around already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh. That's odd. I guess it doesn't take a whole night's rest after all. I wonder what I look like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled (she shuddered at the fact that was how she had to move now) to the closest mirror she could find. Her clothes still fit but just barely. Her chest was large and round, like two basketballs. Her stomache was large like a small beach ball and extended slightly past her chest and hang down from her waist by one inch. Her arms were about three or four inches thick, her legs about 5-6 inches thick. Her legs, not just her thighs, rubbed against each other. Her face had more puffiness around her cheeks and her rear...well, her were roughly the size of her chest. Even her back felt considerably thicker and softer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge sighed as she looked at herself. Why did she choke up like that? Of course, she never was interrogated before. Was she just really nervous?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDidn't matter. She was now forever 150 pounds. And she would have to watch herself carefully until the curse was broken. She guessed the exteme max she could gain and still be mobile would be about 300 pounds, but at 250, she would probably use the ability to get up from her back. No, she would try her hardest to stay 150. She sighed and tried to look for Flash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You okay?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No....\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get used to it.

If there is anything we encourage our women to do, it's to eat as much as they want and to enjoy it.

I mean, I could-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry aout that. Unlike other cultures that focused to keep people healthy by conforming to nature, we sort of....bend the rules of health. We found and developed ways that even obese women could live a very, very long life. The only reason we haven't share this secret with the rest of the world is that it would jeapadize our security from the outside world.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge could only blink from hearing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, I'll...\"</span></div></div>",

They needed more people and they thought that with training, they could turn me into some kind of special agent. And for awhile, they did.

I wonder what I look like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe waddled (she shuddered at the fact that was how she had to move now) to the closest mirror she could find. Her clothes still fit but just barely.

Her arms were about three or four inches thick, her legs about 5-6 inches thick. Her legs, not just her thighs, rubbed against each other. Her face had more puffiness around her cheeks and her rear...well, her were roughly the size of her chest. Even her back felt considerably thicker and softer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge sighed as she looked at herself. Why did she choke up like that? Of course, she never was interrogated before. Was she just really nervous?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDidn't matter. She was now forever 150 pounds. And she would have to watch herself carefully until the curse was broken. She guessed the exteme max she could gain and still be mobile would be about 300 pounds, but at 250, she would probably use the ability to get up from her back. No, she would try her hardest to stay 150. She sighed and sat back down. Then...</span></div></div>",

And of course, her rear was much larger, although not as large as her chest, thankfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, I'll never get used to this. I just hope I don't get sick from all of this. Then again, this place does seem rather technologially advanced for an obscure town. I wouldn't be surprised if they found a way keep larger women from getting weight-related diseases....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge shrugged and continued to look at her self, not out of vanity or even disgust but mostly curiosity. It was still taking time to register that the fat bat in the mirror was HER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlash knocked at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...come in...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlash came in and smiled as he looked at Rouge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, my fair guest.

This is serious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, as I need to talk to you as well. Perhaps we could talk over breakfast.\"</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately for her, the air had blown her underwear straight out the open window. \"Oh bother!\" thougth Rouge. \"What can I wear now.\" Searching the closet, she found that all the clothes at least three sizes too big. Sighing, she took a pair of purple short shorts with a matching purple sports bra. However, all the shirts managed to cover her entire figure. \"Wow, the women here must be huge!\" she said. Putting on the new bra, she noticed that the smallest size just fit her already large chest. After putting on her shorts, she had to pin them in the back to keep them from falling off completely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she approached the landing above the kitchen, Rouge had calmed down a bit. While still angry, she was no longer about to tear Flashe's head off. Rouge paused just outside the door to the kitchen. Inching the door open slightly, Rouge saw Flash humming as he made a fresh batch of waffles.....and pancakes.......and muffins........\"No wonder the girls are so big. THey eat all this food!\" gasped Rouge. Seeing how happy Flash was made her think again. \"He really seems to care about me, and he did deflate me. I guess he is okay, even if he is a perv.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCool and collected, Rouge strolled into the kitchen. Flash looked up from his cook book. \"Oh, hello there.\" He said calmly. \"Just sit over there and I'll be with you in a minute. Rouge sat down at the table and marveled at all the food that Flash brought out. \"He did all this for me! How sweet. But how am I going to eat all of this?\" Rouge thought. Flash simply smiled. \"Dig in, I am sure you're hungry. I'll explain the curse in a minute. Taking a bite of the waffles, Rouge was amazed at the flavor. \"This is delicious!\" she exclaimed. Eating heartily, Flash started to explain about the curse.</span></div></div>",

We can't have dangerous people running around all the time. We have to make sure that the people won't do anything bad before we let them go free.\" Rouge just kept eating. It was far too good for her to stop. \"Anyway, the curse works like this. As you already know, the curse makes you inflate whenever you do something it deems wrong. It takes into acount what you are doing, where you are, and a couple other things to deem what should happen. For example: When you attempted to leave the room last night, which you shouldn't have by the way, first it tried to stop you. Then, because you kept going, it had to inflate you. You were trying to fly away. Since the curse takes into account the area around you, the best substance to use was air. Thus you blimped, and could not fit out the window.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlash went on to explain several other things about the curse, while Rouge just kept eating. \"I can always ask him again later. Besides, this is just two good.\" Finally, Rouge had eaten all the food that was on the table. After letting out a small hiccup, Rouge blushed as she thought \"Oh god, I must seem like a pig!\" Flash saw this and merely smiled. \"Don't worry, it happens to everyone the first time. Now, in recap, The curse uses what's around you, the high chief can manipulate you inflation at anytime (thought he won't), and high ranking officials like me can manipulate the curse if you are willing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge rubbed her engorged belly and moaned. \"I think it's time for a demonstration.\" said Flash. Leading Rouge over to the couch, he laid her down. \"Now, I can make that big belly of yours go away, but only if you trust me.\" Rouge nodded her head in concent. \"Okay, now lay still.\" Rouge was perfectly still as Flash gave her a belly rub. All of the pain of overeating passed, and the food slowly dissolved into fat. Rouge spoke up as her newly fat belly jiggled under his hands. \"But I don't want to be fat!\" she cried. \"Just relax.\" Flash replied. He kept rubbing her, which felt extremely soothing. With a soft THUMP, Rouge's belly button popped once more. \"Now, open you mouth if you don't want your pants coming off again.\" Said Flash. Quickly opening her mouth, Rouge waited. Flash pressed on her belly button once more. Another wave of pressure passed through her, but soon passed. Rouge's stomach rumbled. Suddenly, a huge, unladylike burp passed out of her mouth. Rouge's stomach began to shrink. Then, it was all over. Rouge gripped Flash's hand as she sighed a sigh of relief. Then she realized that their hands were holding and quickly retracted hers, blushing. Rouge now thought that......</span></div></div>",

Then her vision started to focus...she could see...a face, yes, a face, with big blue eyes and a black nose. Soon she knew exactly what she was looking at: A brown furred cat. Without thinking, Rouge reacted. She turned her body into a kick that sent Flash through the air, surprised, and into a tree. She then pulled out her pistol, a slim .45 caliber with the logo of the GUN printed on the grip. Flash quickly pulled out his sword. She fired, but Flash swung and deflected the bullet, sending it careening into a tree. The sound of the ricochet echoed into forest with a deafening bang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge blinked. What had happened? And why wasn't he dead? She fired again, and Flash deflected it again. Flash started moving forward. Now Rouge was scared. She kept pulling the trigger, trying so desperately to kill this brown furred cat, all the while Flash moving closer and closer to Rouge. She eventually ran out of ammunition. She turned to run, but it was too late. Flash dove in and tackled her, wrestling her to the ground and pinning her arms down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! Get off of me!\" Rouge said, struggling to get out of Flash's iron grip.<br>\r\n\"No!\" Flash shouted. \"Who are you and what is your business?\"<br>\r\n\"Let me go and I'll tell you!\"<br>\r\n\"I can't take the risk of you flying away with those batty wings of yours. Tell me your name, at least!\"<br>\r\n\"I'm Rouge, acclaimed treasure hunter and agent of the Guardian Units of Nations, better known as the GUN!\" Flash's eyes widened.<br>\r\n\"The GUN?\" Flash quickly backed up and off of Rouge.<br>\r\n\"I know of the GUN, they founded our local Security Team and funded our headquarters!\" He said.<br>\r\n\"Really? Where am I?\"<br>\r\n\"You mean you don't know?\"<br>\r\n\"I know I wasn't here, THAT'S for sure.\"<br>\r\n\"You're on the outskirts of Felonia, the hidden city.

Why can't you remember where you were previously?\" Flash asked.<br>\r\n\"I think I got bonked on the head pretty hard, 'cause when I look back at where I was it's all...blurry...I can't even remember who knocked me out!\"<br>\r\n\"Hmmm...\" Flash pondered the situation. After thinking about it for a while, he said, \"Okay, this is what we'll do: I'll take you to the Security Team headquarters. I'm sure the Chief will be able to find out where you were, and send you home straight away!\"<br>\r\n\"Who's the Chief?\" Flash opened his mouth to give an answer, when a drop of rain hit his head. A clap of thunder made both Rouge and Flash jump with fright, and soon, it was raining cats and dogs (no pun intended). Flash grabbed Rouge by the hand.<br>\r\n\"Come on! Let's get out of this downpour!\" Rouge ran after Flash, struggling to keep up as he led her through the woods to Felonia.</span></div></div>",

Eventually, they got to the east wall of the city.<br>\r\n\"Rouge, get into my arms!\" <br>\r\n\"Um...okay...\" Flash cradled Rouge's head and lifted her legs up into his arms. Rouge was about to ask Flash what he was doing, when she realized she hadn't even asked what his name was. Before she had time to say anything, however, Flash crouched down and leaped high into the air, sending him and a screaming Rouge sailing over the 30-foot-high east wall and into the hidden city of Felonia. Flash landed, and let Rouge onto her feet. She was about to say thank you when Flash once again grabbed her hand and took off. By the time they reached Security Team headquarters, they were both soaking wet. Flash quickly opened the metal door and let Rouge inside. The two of them fell to they're knees, panting with exhaustion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore either of them could react, Felonia City Police and Security Team personnel surrounded them, pointing various ballistic weapons at Rouge. Rouge instinctively hid behind Flash, hoping he would protect her. Flash looked dead straight, looking for one person in particular. She soon arrived. Rouge watched as the police and Security Team members parted and stood at attention. The slow rhythm of stiletto heels striking the wooden floors echoed in the large hallway as someone walked between the sea of gunmen. Eventually a female cat resembling that of Flash stood before them. She wore somewhat loose black jeans with a holster that hid a powerful handgun, held up by a tight leather belt. She also wore a back shirt that was a bit too small, leaving her brown and tan belly exposed. The shirt had the words \"Security Team\" on the front in white print, with an unbuttoned dark blue jacket over it all. A ruby necklace dangled around her neck, a golden earring stood out proudly on her right ear, and a pair of black stiletto heeled shoes adorned her feet. On her head she wore a dark blue hat that sat on a head of dark brown hair that went down to her knees. With a cigarette between her teeth and a glare in her soft green eyes, Rouge reasoned that this chick was NOT someone she wanted to mess with. The cat in question slowly approached Flash, stopping but three feet away. She lifted her hand, and everyone behind her lowered they're weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, is this our intruder?\" The feminine feline asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"So, is this our intruder?\" The feminine feline asked.<br>\r\n\"Why, yes it is.\" Flash answered. \"She is a GUN agent who goes by the name of Rouge. When I found Rouge, she was unconscious. And when she awoke, she attacked me, but I quickly subdued her. She claims to have received a rather large hit to the head, and that she cannot remember where she was before she \"mysteriously\" arrived here.\"<br>\r\n\"Well in that case,\" she turned and looked at Rouge, \"Welcome to the hidden city of Felonia. I am Trinity, Chief of the Security Team. I see you have already met our freelance operative and warrior champion Flash.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, YOU'RE the Chief?\" Rouge asked.<br>\r\n\"That I am. What's it to you?\"<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I just...\" <br>\r\n\"Nothing indeed,\" Trinity interrupted, \"Now, we need to find you a way home. If you're a GUN agent, then I'm sure the Commander will want to know where you are.\" Rouge shivered on the inside. The Commander would NOT be happy about her mysterious disappearing act. She was thinking ahead to what she would say to the Commander (or rather, her excuse) when Flash tapped her on the shoulder, making her jump three feet in the air. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on,\" Flash said, \"Everyone's going this way.\" Rouge was stunned. She hadn't even noticed everyone's leaving because she was so frightened of the Commander. Rouge shook her head and followed Flash down the hallway of the Security Team headquarters. Rouge looked side to side. They passed at least fifteen doors on either side when the reached a metal vault-style door at the end of the hall. Rouge watched as Trinity entered a thirty-digit pass code to open the door, and as the giant door swung inward. The Security Team members and Felonia City Police quickly dispersed, leaving Rouge, Flash, and Trinity standing in front of the massive door. Flash made a gesture for Rouge to go in before him, and she stepped into a technological wonderland. Every wall it seemed was covered in computer and TV screens, a giant screen taking its place in the center of the room. Stairs went down either wall, and there was a platform leading to an observation deck that gave you a birds-eye view of the entire room. Rouge followed Trinity onto the platform and from there to the observation deck. Rouge almost had a heart attack when Flash closed the giant door behind them, making a rather large metallic clang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This,\" Trinity said, gesturing to the entire room, \"Is the Command Center; a fully operational security system watching every corner of every street of every province of Felonia. Our 24/7 staff operates at maximum efficiency to keep our fair city safe.\" Rouge looked around. Almost fifty men in Security Team uniform were either taking their place monitoring a specific area, repairing equipment and other various tasks. \"Now, let's call the Commander.\" Trinity said. She tapped her foot and a terminal rose out of a hatch concealed in the floor in front of her. The giant screen in the center of the room turned on, and a log in appeared. Trinity cracked her knuckles. She then started typing. Rouge watched Trinity's fingers dart around the keyboard faster than anything she had ever seen. When she finished, Trinity had entered a one hundred-digit pass code. The computer gave her access, and she pulled up a communication program. She rifled through the various files of contacts until she found the Commander's private channel. \"Hit it!\" Trinity yelled.\"<br>\r\n\"Roger!\" said a Security Team staff member.<br>\r\n\"Dish up in five...four...three...two..one...now.\" said another.<br>\r\n\"Satellite is up, Chief!\" said the first.<br>\r\n\"Thanks, guys.\" Trinity said. \"Do we have a connection?\"<br>\r\n\"Unconfirmed, Chief.\"<br>\r\n\"Try it anyway, the storm must be causing this.\" Trinity replied. The channel broadcast systems activated, and there was a brief period of silence. Suddenly, the screen went to white noise.<br>\r\n\"Turn it off, TURN IT OFF!!!\" Rouge yelled.<br>\r\n\"Turn it off!\" Trinity ordered. After a few seconds, the connection was severed. Rouge fell to her knees with pain, tear is her eyes. The frequency of the white noise was high enough to hurt her sensitive ears, and at such a high volume, it was almost deafening. Flash quickly helped her to her feet.<br>\r\n\"Are you alright, Rouge?\" he asked compassionately.<br>\r\n\"Ugh...yeah, I'm fine...damn that hurt!\" Rouge sniffled, covering her ears.<br>\r\n\"Damn storm. We can't get a signal through! That's just terrific!\" Trinity vented.<br>\r\n\"What are you guys so pissed about? The storm will blow away after a day or two.\" Rouge said.<br>\r\n\"Heh, you're wrong about that.\" Flash said. \"When it rains on this island, it rains for at least a week.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait...we're on an island?\" Rouge asked.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Felacci Island.\" Flash answered.<br>\r\n\"And you didn't care to mention this before?\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry, guess I forgot to mention that.\"<br>\r\n\"Now, what's this about at least a week of rain?\" Rouge asked. <br>\r\n\"It doesn't rain very often on Felacci, but when it does, it lingers over Felonia for at least a week.\" Flash replied.<br>\r\n\"Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, honey, but it looks like you're stuck on this island until the storm clears, and that won't be for quite a while.\" Trinity said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Are you sure you filled up with helium, or did you just gorge yourself with food until you got so gassy you could float?\" Cream says, stifling a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails tries to stifle his own laugher. \"Maybe she just inflated herself too quickly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy grumbles as her face turns red, partly from anger and partly from embarrassment. \"Urk.

What could have happened to them? Did Cream and Amy end up bursting themselves trying to outsize each other?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps they just got so light that they floated right out into space, with nothing to do but to grow for the rest of their lives. They could have been experimenting with hyrdogen, with a end result that was signicantly more explosive than the end results Amy just had. <i>Laughs</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr maybe they were placed in some old, forgotten dresser while they were deflated.
