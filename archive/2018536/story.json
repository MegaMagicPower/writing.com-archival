That might be another case in mind, when Leondre opened up and saw this strange looking object that looked like a remote controller, but with different buttons he's never seen before, but not before he looked at the label that it had said what it is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Size Device?  Hmmm.... that's pretty strange, but rather curious to say the least.  Maybe I should try it out and see what it's like?\"  Leondre thought of his suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, he wanted to try it out a little bit, which he knows that it may be just a prop with nothing else to work.  So he shrugged and gives this a go and sets up the device it had asked Leondre to do.  Once he did that, he stood up and takes a deep breath before he aimed at himself and shoots it with a laser struck him.  That jumped when whatever that laser took, this could be the moment he would knew that this remote had done something to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened moments later, when first of all, he felt his belly was starting to push out from him, then so did the rest of his body, and from that on, he was started to get taller too, making Leondre absolute shocked from this and couldn't believe that he was actually getting bigger for real,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body was swelling very well, which his butt and thighs are about to get the biggest part of his body.  His belly was so fat and larger, even when it overlapped his meaty thighs, his arms are thicken and legs are thickened and his face was turning chunky with some chins developing.  As for his height, Leondre grew all the way, when he first bumped his head on the ceiling.  Must to this pain, he decides to take a seat on the floor in hoping that this should never happen again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it didn't, and kept growing when his head had bumped again, and that's when the growth finally came to a stop, which Leondre's head had touched the ceiling whilst sitting on the floor, and he looks so obese, he weighs at 500lbs (if he was normal height), and his ginormous butt and thighs are have taken up mostly on the floor.  Leondre couldn't believe it, even with his expression that he then started to smile and giggle that it all happened to him by surprise, all because of that fan mail and a remote it did to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, I'm so big and fat!  This is the greatest feeling of my life.  Maybe I should...</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">For those who do not know, Bars and Melody (B.A.M) are a British singing/rapping duo consisting of rapper Leondre Devries (\"Bars\") and singer Charlie Lenehan (\"Melody\").  They met in September 2013 via Facebook, after Lenehan had seen many of Devries' covers as a solo rapper. Lenehan said to Devries, \"Do you want to meet up?\" in January 2014, so, accompanied by their parents, they met in late January and decided to form a music duo, naming themselves Bars and Melody (or B.A.M, as stated in their first appearance).  On 8 February 2014, Bars and Melody auditioned in Manchester for the eighth series of Britain's Got Talent. They performed a song based on Twista and Faith Evans' \"Hope\", with Devries replacing the original verses with ones protesting against bullying. After the audition, the audience began chanting \"Push the gold!\". Bars &amp; Melody received the golden buzzer from Simon Cowell and went straight through to the live semi-finals. Their audition has been viewed on YouTube more than 50 million times. (Source, Wikipedia)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI might take too long so you'll find more about the two through web searches you can find.  This is a weight gain and growth (giant) story which can either be separate scenario or combine as one and the choices you'll find from the start.  The rules however are as follows:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*There is no sex or toilet stuff so keep it clean, please.<br>\r\n*No nudity!<br>\r\n*No age changing please so I like it that way.  (I know it may be past but I want their age they first appeared through BGT; Leondre 13, and Charlie 15.)<br>\r\n*No short chapters as I want at least a paragraph.<br>\r\n*Also, be realistic through scenarios as well.<br>\r\n*Both two characters cannot die in this story and I don't want to end this story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease note that anyone breaks the rules that it says from there, will be deleted and informed from me!  So be careful for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's all I got but please add while you can and hope I'll see you soon!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUPDATE 5/10/19: I'm also interested in roleplay, if you want to have a go?  If so, either let me know either here or on Discord pjc-fc#4186 and I\u2019ll see what we can come up for this.</td>",
