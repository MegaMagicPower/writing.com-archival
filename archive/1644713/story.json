The day was slow and the sun was beginning to set. Not one evil soul was seen and the wait has begun to take its' effect on the duo.<br>\r\n          \"I'm tired of all this waiting man\" Alastor finally said. \"I want something to kill.\" The duo turned down a dimly lit alleyway. \"Patience my friend\" Ryan said at almost a whisper. \"There's something nearby, I can feel it\" <br>\r\n          They came to a small clearing. It was almost perfectly circle and there was trash littered around the edges. At the center was a large figure that seemed bent over something out of view. Ryan turned to Alastor giving him a look of accomplishment. Alastor in turn closed his eyes and tilted his head back. Light began to emanate from his body as his form began to change into his weapon form. His head turning into the blade and his body becoming the shaft. Soon he had changed into a halberd and Ryan grabbed him, bearing his teeth in anticipation.</span></div></div>",

I don't understand why you think I'm a kishin!\"  She scoffed and looked at me with a disappointed face, \"Like you wouldn't know.  A kishin is a person who turned from humanity, and eats human souls.\"  I yelled right back, \"What do you mean?  Sure, I might be dead right now but I have not eaten a single human soul!  I didn't even know you could eat souls in this dimension!\"  She jumped and struck me on my tricept. \"Aaagghh! That Hurt!  Why don't you understand that I'm not a kishin!  I'll give you a choice, kill me and become a kishin, or let me go and understand!\"  She stopped and looked at me, \"You may be right, but I won't let you go just yet.\"  She rushed toward me and bonked me in the head knocking me out, \"Who said I was going to kill you?\"  With that, I fainted.</span></div></div>",

My name is paradox, but I don the name Vincent for dealing with my old race, humans. I was kind of a nerd before but that actually comes in handy since most anime and cartoons were actually just recorded information from other universes and dimensions. This time I woke up to a familiar freak show moon that seemed to be grinning and drooling blood, but i couldn't remember the name of the show. I knew that i was in some swamp and I could hear someone being chased in my direction, so i stood up and checked to see if any of my weapons made it with me. What i discovered was weird as hell, my weapons had disappeared completely  but my syringes made it untouched, my inter dimensional communications equipment was fried but it looked like it would still work in my current universe. Deep in thought and camouflaged in the darkness Neither I nor my new acquaintance noticed each other until he toppled both of us over, and began muttering, \"Just one more.\" before grabbing my throat. My left arm shined pure white and I hit him in the chest open palmed causing a dark being to fly out and into a tree. The man on top of me quickly removed himself and said \"thanks, but what the hell did you do?\" my only response was to point at the being and get into a fighting stance, ready to rip it apart with my claw like nails, but the man insisted on helping and did something even i found freakish, he turned into a lengthy combat knife with a filed base, almost like it was made for me. I instinctively caught it but before i could end the shadow it was sliced in half by a black and red scythe held by young blonde girl. \"What happened here? And who are you?\" was all she said to me and the man  who was now standing next to me looking like he was ready to run off. For now i didn't say any thing but stayed facing her while I slammed the man back and open a wide rift while falling back myself, but before I fell through i gave a slight smile and gave the girl and her odd partner the finger before disappearing into the darkness.</span></div></div>",
