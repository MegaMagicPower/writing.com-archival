Taking time for a small sigh, Meia quickly answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meia here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, This is Sgt. Connor Sinclair, your acting XO until you have had time to assign your crew. We're forming up now for inspection, as per Taraakite custom. You requested to be notified before we were due to commence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeia's mind quickly recalled the information from the young man's dossier, which she had head shortly before reminiscing about her time on the Nirvana. <br>\r\n<i>Connor Sinclair, Male, mid-20s. Grey hair, red eyes. Solid commander, actually holds a rank of Lieutenant in the Taraak military. As part of the rank reshuffling for Project Eden, he was made Sgt for this station. His skills as a leader from the Damocles training exercise were primarily responsible for his assignment here. The men look up to him, while the women are sometimes in awe of him. Caution required when handling him: could prove dangerous if treated in a way he's not expected to be...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Understood, Sgt. Sinclair. I will be along presently. Tell everyone that they should be prepared for a training exercise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am!\" With a quick salute that, while proper, held a small tinge of irony and resentment, Sinclair cut off the feed before Meia could respond further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That man will be a problem. But not as much as the dossier I read before him...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a break from what would otherwise prove a bleak review, Meia quickly dressed in her standard flight suit from her time as a Dread pilot. essentially, this was simply a custom-designed vest or jersey which went on over her standard jumpsuit to provide additional warmth and comfort while piloting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she began heading to the main hall, Meia...</span></div></div>",

Oh come on I can't be any late that I am right now!\" Said the young man, probably a teenager and younger than her by about a year or two. He had blonde yellow hair, reminding her of Jura in a sense.

What made you hesitate Chef Risu?\" Risu's face blushed a little more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm...permission to speak Captain Gisborn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Granted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you call me Ritz? It's what I prefer to be called.\" Meia nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well, Chef Ritz. I will inform Sgt. Sinclair about this matter. Maybe he can use headphones to lull himself to sleep. In the meantime-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was cut off from a growling from her tummy, now it was her turn to have some pink on her cheeks. Ritz perked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.

It's lucky she collapsed when she did - otherwise she could well be dead or beyond our help. A combination of Malnutrition and being stubborn as a mule led to her not eating at all for the better part of 5 days - she'll have hell to pay for it now, though. She's grounded under medical over-rides until she stabilizes and her blood tests show she's healthy enough to be discharged. As you're a cook, I'm entrusting her dietary care to you, son. Get her healthy and she'll be allowed to resume combat duties. For now, a minimum grounding of 3 months stands - it's not good for an officer to starve themselves like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the doctor left to see to other patients.

Before we begin, a few ground rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrist, this is a WG interactive fic: don't like, don't take part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond, please keep the rates at which the girls gain realistic (no gaining 400lbs in 40 seconds, and so on)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPregnancy, body expansion and inflation are allowed, as long as you can explain it clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSex and nudity are allowed, but only if it fits with the story arc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScat and blood are out of bounds. Entries of this nature will be removed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, story arcs are free for you to establish, though I would prefer you didn't go too OOC. Enjoy and have fun!</td>",
