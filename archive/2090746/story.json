Rachel asked, \"They said that this mansion was built back in the early 1800's when supposedly supernatural creatures wandered this area\" Natalie replied. \"It gives me chills just looking at it, lets go exploring guys\" Lurena said, the four friends walked up to the big doors of the mansion and knocked using the old fashioned door knocker shaped like a lions head. It was silent for a few seconds then a trap door opened up from below them and they all fell down into these tubes, the tubes led them down to the bottom floor of the mansion. Lurena and Natalie appeared in a room lit with lots of candlesticks up on the walls and a door directly in front of them. Valerie and Rachel landed in a room filled with old fashioned dolls that were probably made in the 1800's as well, the creepy doll faces were all placed so that they were facing Natalie in the center of the room, there was one door in front of them as well. Once all the girls got their composure they heard a voice over a speaker \"Hello and welcome to the Mongolian Mansion, if you are here that means you are either travelers passing through looking to find help or you are trying to find out more about this historical mansion, well I am sorry to say that you have made a grave mistake coming here for you see this mansion is haunted by different supernatural creatures that used to wander around these parts back in the 1800's and they love to hear laughter. Don't worry though for there is a way for you all to escape but in order to do so you must make your way to the top floor of this 5 story mansion and switch off the mansions security because the doors on the 2 floor entrance where you all fell from are locked, you might be thinking well that doesn't sound to hard but unfortunately for you their are a lot of different paths in this mansion, you could say its like one big maze, and top it off all the creatures in this mansion will be hunting you for your laughter. How they will acquire it is something you will find out soon enough. I wish you all the best of luck\" the speaker shut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhose Story would you like to follow?</span></div></div>",

She loved the Twilight books and movies and felt that she could cope with that environment easily. \"Look Nat\", she said, \"maybe we can find traces of the ancestors of Edward or Jacob.\" Her younger friend nodded eagerly and went along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny hope of a quiet entry was spoiled by the loud, high pitched sound the door made when they pushed it open. To the girl's muted disappointment the narrow steps went down, further away from the fifth floor they were looking to get to finally. The steps were humid and illuminated by live torches. Towards the bottom of the stairs there were no more torches. \"Let's take one of them each\" Lurena said and pulled the wooden handle of the torch from its fixing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the stairs there was a small room with three further heavy doors which had large keys sticking in the keyholes. Next to the doors there were symbols carved in old oak. Natalie went closer and identified them as two dancing girls (girl's room), fighting boys (boy's room) and a man and a woman in intimate contact (adult room).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich room did they choose?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirls<br>\r\nBoys<br>\r\nAdults</span></div></div>",

The 2 girls slowly opened the door and inside they saw a harem of about 6 vampires lounging on 2 big king size beds, Lurena and Natalie looked back and forth at the vampires and then themselves with shock unsure of what to say or do next. The vampires got up and started walking towards the 2 girls \"Look at these 2 lovely young ladies that walked in our door, I think we ought to welcome them, don't you all\" the leader vampire said, \"A..Actually we just picked the wrong door and we would just like to be on our way\" Lurena said quickly, Lurena and Natalie turned back toward the door but then 3 of the vampires appeared in front of their way out. The leader vampire spoke again \"Now, now don't be shy girls, I promise you will both have a fun time, you will both be full of laughter soon enough\" then the vampire knocked the 2 girls out. When Lurena and Natalie woke up they saw that they were completely naked and each tied spread eagle to a bed, they looked over at one another and began to try and move but their bondage's were securely tightened. 3 of the vampires surrounded Lurena and the other 3 surrounded Natalie, one was down at their feet and the other too were on both of their sides, \"This might be a bit to much for me Nat\" Lurena said with fear in her voice, \"Yeah where are our clothes\" Natalie asked. \"Oh you wont need those anymore, we are going to make you 2 girls our personal tickle slaves\" the leader vampire said with excitement \", Lurena and Natalie gulped as they heard those last 2 words come from the vampires mouth. \"Nonononono Please don't tickle us\" Lurena begged \"Please just let us go\" Natalie pleaded, \"sorry girls but we have waited to long for 2 lovely young ladies to enjoy ourselves with\". Then the leader vampire nodded her head and the vampires immediately started tickling the areas they were positioned at, Lurena and Natalie screamed with laughter as they felt all the vampires long nails on their young ticklish naked bodies, the vampires tortured the 2 girls feet and sides for what seemed to them like hours but was really only about 30 minutes, the tickling was just so bad it felt longer for the 2 young history nuts. The leader vampire raised her hand and all the other vampires stopped their ticklish onslaught. \"Now that we have warmed you 2 girls up, I think its time we have some fun with some other parts of your bodies that probably haven't been touched that much lately. Then she brought her hand back down and the 2 vampires that were tickling the girls sides began licking their breasts while the remaining one vampire that was tickling the girls feet began sliding a feather along their pussy's. Lurena and Natalie's eyes got big as they took in what was happening to them, they were being tickle raped by 6 female vampires, both girls began laughing uncontrollably as their private parts were tickle tortured, their faces got red with both embarrassment and because they were running out of breath. To Lurena and Natalie's eyes the room began to get blurry, neither girl could think straight as this vulgar harem had their way with them, \"Oooommmyyyggooooddddpplllleeeeaaaasssseeeeesstttoooopppphahahahahahahahaha&amp; #34; Lurena and Natalie both screamed with ecstasy in their voices. After an hour of this vulgar tickle torture Lurena and Natalie passed out, when they woke up they were untied and the vampire harem were gone, however both girls were still naked, Lurena and Natalie looked at each other with embarrassment and curiosity, \"I don't understand where did they go\" Natalie asked, \"Never mind that Nat, we have to get out of here before they come back, I really don't want to feel that violated again right now\" Lurena replied defiantly. Natalie nodded \"But what about our clothes\" Natalie asked, the 2 girls looked around the room and under the beds but they didn't see their clothing anywhere \"Great now not only are we in a mansion with supernatural creatures that enjoy tickling us in a very inappropriate way but we are completely naked and our skin is vulnerable\". Lurena said with anger in her voice, \"We will just have to look for some other clothing Lu, there has to be a dressing room somewhere in this mansion\". Natalie replied. \"We can either go back the way we came and try one of the other doors or we can continue through the door opposite of the one we came in\" Lurena stated. \"I ain't going back we should press forward\" Natalie argued. Lurena nodded and the 2 girls made their way to the new door, it was just a big black door, no pictures or symbols on it. Natalie opened the door...</span></div></div>",

Rachel began laughing again however she was surprised because the snakes tongue did more than just tickle her it also felt good, the snakes warm wet slippery tongue sliding across her vagina put her into a weird state of ecstasy she couldn't explain, she threw her head back, closed her eyes and started emitting soft moans. The elves and all the other animals watched the snake go to work on Rachel's private part seeing that she was not laughing as loud as she was a few minutes ago. Rachel felt like she was in heaven so to speak, which surprised her since she felt like she was in hell a few minutes ago. The snake continued Rachel's pleasure for another 5 minutes while the other animals continued tickling Valerie's belly and feet driving Valerie crazy, Valerie saw Rachel having a better time than her and tried to yell at the Elves through her laughter \"Heeeyyy, why does she get the good end of this situation, tell the animals to switch positions\".
