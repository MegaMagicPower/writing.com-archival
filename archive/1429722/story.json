            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Doctor Small was, to say the least, an amoral man.  He didn't view his fellow man as human.  Rather, they were experiments.  Elements which he could manipulate on a whim.  It just so happened that he had his eye on a family of magnifiscent specimens.  The Titan family:  Tom, Lisa, Chad, and Molly.  They were tall, statuesque, and athletic.  Except for that Molly girl.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But every chain has a weak link...no matter\" said the doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor was an expert in many scientific fields, but one interested him in particular:  human  anthropology.  He was obsessed with human instinct, the will to survive, and the desire to dominate.  Dr. Small spent hours thinking of ways to test his theories, conduct the most definitive experiments, obtain the ultimate knowledge.  But he needed to experiment on a large scale with two groups.  Those that needed to survive, and those that wished to dominate.  He already set his sights on one group, the Titan family.  But he needed those which would flee from them in terror.  Then, it came to him.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lab he was working at was based in a military facility.  The team of scientists located on the floor below him had been conducting experiments on the shrinking of matter.  The objective was to find a way to shrink weapons and supplies.  These would then be transported over to rebels in countries with dictators, and facilitate an uprising without the world knowing of an American involvement.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, they had built several prototypes of the shrinking device, and one of them was in storage.  Dr. Small stole a passkey, and under the cover of darkness, walked into the storage facility.  Seeing the shrink ray gun, the doctor smiled to himself.  Such pleasure would await him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She glanced over at her husband, sunbathing himself in a lawn chair.  He's so vain Lisa thought to herself.  But then giggled to herself, realizing she took just as much pride in her own appearance.  At 5'11'', with long blond hair, and plenty of muscle tone herself, she was a vision of feminine strength and sexuality.  She often looked down on people, literally and figuratively.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would often stare at the other women in the shopping market or department stores, imagining her long, tan, meaty foot on their faces.  A sneer of disgust on her face.  Those women that had let themselves become unfit for their husbands, spending money on useless baubles to improve their inferior appearance.  She wished she could crush them like insects and be worshipped like a goddess by their lowly spouses.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer current husband Tom nudged the the sunglasses down his nose and looked at his wife.  She had that look on her face again.  He had an idea of what she was thinking and it made him so horny.  His muscles inadvertently flexed just from the thought of it.  The large snake-like appendage in his speedo stirred awake.  He got off his lawn chair and before Lisa could grab a towel, he embraced her in his arms, lifted her off the ground, and kissed her hard.  She reached down and felt his bulge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy big man, save that for later and get back to your tan\" she said with a smile.  Tom smiled back, \"you know you can't tell me what to do, not when we're out of bed\".  Lisa laughed and gave his package a quick sharp squeeze.  He let go, enjoying the pain.  Lisa wrapped a towel around herself and walked back into the house, her long wet soles slapping the tile.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile, back at the deranged Dr. Small's house, the owner of a brand new shrinking protoype arrived out of breath.  The doctor was so nervous about his theft he was nearly unable to complete his mission.  But this wasn't about him.  This was for science.  He layed the shrink ray upon his ornate glass table, quivering with joy.  The anticipation was almost too much to handle.  But what to test it on first?  It had to be something organic, but small enough not to cause a mess if the experiment would fail.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lonley whine of a cat broke through the almost deafening sound of the doctor's beating heart.  He brushed his fingers through his hair and grabbed a carton of milk from the freezer.  Opening the door, he caught sight of the unsuspecting cat.  The carton in one hand, the shrink ray in the other, he began to poor milk on the cement in front of his door.  The cat gratefully lapped up the precious liquid.  The doctor looked around to make sure no one was watching and zapped the hapless kitty.  A flash of light and a puff of smoke greeted the doctor, making him fall backwards in surprise.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor quickly got up to see his results.  The cat was nowhere in sight.  \"Damnit!  A complete failure!\" the doctor cried.  He could see his dreams of shrunken specimens slipping away.  That is, until he saw a rippling in the milk.  Looking closer he noticed a nearly microscopic black dot circling in the pool of milk.  The doctor carefully reached into the pool with a pair of pocket tweezers.  Pinched in between the two metal pinchers was a very wet and very upset cat.  The doctor smiled with glee and almost dropped the cat he was so happy.  His first trial run had worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could barely prevent himself from aiming the gun at the neighborhood houses, but a shocking thought stopped him in his tracks.  If he shrunk each neighbor of the Titans one by one, the other neighbors would notice and inform the police.  He had to shrink them all at the same time.  It was a small wealthy community situated in the hills.  If he shrank them all, no one would investigate for at least two weeks, perhaps three if he was lucky.  He immediately began work on a \"shrink bomb\".  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA month later the device was completed, he was a top scientist after all.  The day he had finished he called the community leader and asked him to invite the entire community to a town hall meeting.  Letters were immediately sent out claiming that the eminent scientist Dr. Lewis Small had made a discovery that would make their community famous.  Dr. Small made sure to steal the notice delivered to the Titan's household so they wouldn't show up.  It was summer and hot out, so Dr. Small knew from observing them for a month that there was no reason for the Titans to leave their house and wonder where everyone had gone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe town meeting commenced and Dr. Small revealed the device.  The audience gasped with surprise.  Before them was a large crystalline sphere which shone with an odd light.  \"Gather around everyone, I want to expose you all to an experience you will never forget!\" exclaimed the doctor.  The entire community, about 150 people gathered around the crystal sphere in wonder and anticipation.  Dr. Small pressed a button on the back of the sphere, watching a red light flash in a signal of preparation.  He then excused himself, telling the community he needed a separate component to complete the demonstration.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile outside he removed a remote from his pocket and pushed the trigger.  There was no noise, rather a shockwave that blew out all the windows and caused light smoke to pour out the openings.  He went back inside the building carrying a slender, transparent container.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was madness.  White smoke covered the skies, women screamed, children cried, men pissed themselves.  When the smoke cleared, micro sized community attempted to gather itself.  One of the shrunken spoke up, \"Ok let's everybody calm down.  I'm sure what we're all seeing is merely an optical illusion created by Dr. Small.  I know when he gets back, he'll turn off his device and all will be well.\"  The people laughed, of course it was just an illusion.  Something like this couldn't happen in real life.  They all began to calm down, until they heard what sounded like thunder from far away, but was quickly approaching...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Small opened his glass container, sweat dripping down his forehead.  He bent down, and to his delight, spotted the ultra small community.  It was just as he expected, they didn't look like humans at all.  Insect size at the most, barely noticeable by the human eye.  He brought his hand down and began herding his captives into the container.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giant hand landed witha BOOM behind the 150 frightened people.  They shrieked with fear as the massive hand slid towards them at an amazing speed.  It was a grotesque hand, covered with sweat and hair.  It engulfed them and forced them into a glass structure the size of a stadium.  The people looked up in horror at the doctor's face.  There was a coldness to his eyes, but his massive worm like lips twitched into a perverted smile.  There was evil in his intent.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor walked with his precious cargo to his car and drove to the Titan's family home.  He parked his car across the street and when darkness came, he flooded the Titan's house with a mild sleeping gas he had stolen from the lab.  When he was sure they were asleep, he began the task of installing various cameras all over the house in order to track and record his experiment.  When he was sure all the cameras were hidden and could not be found by the family, he opened the container of shrunken people again and emptied them in the center of the living room.  150 tiny individuals found themselves scattered across a carpet ocean.  Confused and scared it would be the most difficult and deadly time of their lives.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctor gave them some parting words, \"Do not despair my little specimens.  Whether you survive or not, you will all be making history.  You will not merely live among this Titan family, you will test your worthiness to even be noticed by them.  And if you're lucky enough to get their attention, take comfort you will please your superiors with your deaths\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shrinkees could barely understand the giant, but by the look on his face, they knew their lives had become insignificant.  And the rising sun signaled a new day.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Doctor Small quietly let himself outside the Titan's house.  He walked a few houses down to his own residence, sat in his basement, and switched on the recording signal.  The experiment had begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tinies were still in a state of absolute panic.  The carpet fibers came up to their waists and made it almost impossible to move through.  It was like walking in a field of soft cacti.  It took awhile, but eventually families were reunited with each other, huddling together for safety.  Everyone gave suspicious looks at everyone else.  Surely this could not be the work of one demented man.  People's cries of fear turned to anger when no answers were given as to how or why this had happened to them.  They were about to riot out of sheer frustration when a thunderclap of metal silenced them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance a large door that was miles tall opened.  Resting on the door handle was an enormous manicured hand with long blood red finger nails.  Next appeared a giant female foot.  It was long and thick, each toe the size of a bus.  They were covered with clear nail polish, Lisa Titan had no need to paint them.  She knew they were already beautiful enough to attract attention.  Which they did, but for the wrong reasons.  This attention came from a crippling fear of dozens of people.  One step could easily kill two dozen of them if they stayed still long enough to get squashed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the tinies had a different idea in mind.  A retired police chief, he got up and with as loud a voice as he could make at his size said, \"Listen up people we don't have a lot of time!  If we all of us stay together like this that monster is bound to notice us and put us out of our misery.  Let's separate into 3 groups of 50 and meet in a place that can't be seen by the giants!  Now move out!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe community quickly split up into 3 groups each making their way across the living room to avoid the giantess.  One man however, refused to follow his fellow shrinkees.  Dale Evans was a stubborn man, even ignoring the pleas of his wife and two children.  He was in denial and couldn't believe that someone would crush him like a bug.  He decided to get the attention of the towering giantess.  His wife cried and screamed, holding onto his leg to try and slow him down.  His two kids merely sat on the floor crying, the carpet fibers slightly above their heads.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM came the the thunderous footsteps of the goddess.  Dale marched toward her in defiance.  A determined look on his face.  The calf muscles in Lisa Titan's legs flexed with each approaching step.  A shadow of her long, battle ship sized feet proceeded each step.  She walked with the confidence of a military commander, yet her shapely ass shifted from side to side in a feminine swagger.  Dale Evans stood before her, arms crossed, his eyes focused skyward.  His wife still clinging to his leg screamed in terror.  A shadow loomed over the couple.  Dale could see the wrinkles of experience in the foot and the muscle that powered it.  He opened his mouth to speak, \"Now listen up bitch, I demand that\", Dale was cut off as the foot overtook him.  A toe nail decapitated him, his head flying off into the distance.  The pad of the toe landed squarely on Dale's wife.  Her mouth became filled with toe flesh for a fraction of a second before her own head was turned into soup of bone and blood.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two Evans children still sitting below the carpet fibers screamed in terror having just witnessed their parent's death.  The foot approached, each line and groove like a narrow trench.  The children held each other as a BOOM filled their ears causing them to immediately go deaf.  They looked up into a sky of flesh.  Sitting below the carpet fibers and under the long arch of the woman's foot had saved them.  They watched as long tan legs carried harbingers of death and destruction off into the distance.  The children got up and slowly made their way to the 3 groups that had split up.  Dale and Mrs. Evans had not been worthy enough to be noticed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A group of tinies led by a retired police chief cowered in fear under the couch as they saw the giantess casually walk across her living room floor, crushing a young couple in the process.  The giantess was dressed in a long flowing robe, which exaggerated her prominent stature.  She was truly the goddess of her world, dominating all those around her.  One of the tinies, Jake Fletcher, noticed two small children off in the distance, looking for some form of cover.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake looked up and saw the giantess making coffee for herself in the distance.  He yelled over to the young children, hoping they would notice the group and run for cover.  \"Hey kids!  Over here quick!  You'll be safe!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe children couldn't hear them however.  They still hadn't recovered from the booming noise of the giantess nearly crushing them with her wrinkled sole.  Jake knew he had to move fast.  Before anyone else volunteered, Jake quickly made his way through the carpet ocean, near the children.  He was nearly upon them when he began to her an ominous sound.  It was like an emergency siren.  Jake stopped in his tracks and looked towards the kitchen.  The giantess was humming a tune, slowly swirling her spoon in a fresh cup of coffee.  Jake saw the muscles in her thigh twitch as her leg lifted up.  The ball of her foot began tapping the kitchen floor.  BOOM BOOM BOOM!  It was the drum beat of impending doom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake rushed over and grabbed the two children's arms.  The trio began to run when Jake heard the sound of flesh twisting against tile.  The giantess was turning around and heading straight for them!  The slap of female foot flesh cracked through the air and the unlucky group was only halfway back to being under the saftey of the couch with their fellow tinies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goddess Lisa stood before the living room on the edge of the carpet.  She made a contented sigh and looked down at her cup of coffee for a sip.  Before the liquid passed her lips she noticed a small dot moving across the floor towards the couch.  She smirked saying, \"Just great, hope we don't have an infestation.  Well it's summer and everything breeds in summer right?  But you buggies won't get the chance.\"  She seductively walked to the slowly moving spot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake's lungs were near to bursting he couldn't take anymore but the muffled booms approaching quickened his legs.  Two feet the size of battleships were right behind them.  The children began to slow down, their tiny legs covering little ground.  Jake knew what he had to do.  He picked up a child in each arm, slowing him down.  Right at the edge of the couch he threw them until they rolled to safety.  Jake collapsed, too exhausted to move.  Too exhausted to scream as the monolithic foot fell upon him.  For a moment he noticed its beauty.  The grooves and wrinkles, it was feminine yet muscular.  It crushed him utterly in an orgasmic explosion of guts and blood.  Lisa Titan smiled to herself, took a sip of coffee, and gave another contented sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Though one bug had just been crushed, there would surely be others, she thought to herself.  That bug had been crawling towards the couch.  Hopefully there were not more of them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking towards her expensive couch, Lisa got down onto her hands and knees to take a look underneath.  The vibrations of this caused the tiny community residing under there to panic.  Some screamed, others were knocked off their feet by the impact.  Lisa's massive shadow eclipsed the tiny's light source, as they were now staring at part of Lisa's face, trying to look underneath the couch.  The tiny community did not know what to do.  Should they try to get her attention?  Should they stay still or run and hide?  Several members of the group began to argue among themselves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa thought the could hear something underneath the couch but it was too dark to see anything.  She walked back into the kitchen to grab a flashlight.  The tiny people, thinking she had gone, were a bit relieved.  They had already seen what her massive foot could do to poor Jake Fletcher.  But then the floor started to rattle again.  They could see the massive feet with bus-sized toes of Lisa approaching again, and again she went parallel to the ground.  This time though, the community was in for a surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa had turned on a flashlight and shined it underneath the couch.  The sudden outburst of light temporarily blinded the entire community.  They screamed in horror.  They had been caught off guard and had no idea what was going on.  They began to blindly run in all directions.  It was complete chaos underneath the couch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crap!\" Lisa yelled, startling the tiny individuals even more.  \"We have a god damn infestation.  Well I guess we better do something about this.\"  Normally Lisa would love to just use her massive feet to crush the insects, but being underneath the couch they were much harder to reach.  \"Hey Tom,\" she called out to her husband upstairs.  There was no answer.  Lisa was starting to get irritated now.  This was not how she wanted to spend her morning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Lisa decide to do?</span></div></div>",

There in the aisle was Tom Titan, the bodybuilding patriarch of the Titan household.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom was currently looking at vitamin supplements.  While contemplating which brand to buy, he was completely oblivious to the fact that the man shopping near him had been in his house, and definitely did not suspect he was watching a tiny society struggle for their lives inside his household.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTom turned and started walking towards the exit, when he got a good look at Dr. Small.  What the hell was this guy doing in this section of the store?  Just looking at the guy, Tom could tell he probably never bought protein powder in his life.  It was people like this who annoyed Tom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh his way down the aisle, Tom made sure to bump into Dr. Small.  \"Watch it nerd,\" Tom said with a cocky laugh.  \"Looks like you're in the wrong aisle.  Don't hurt yourself.\"  Tom proceeded to laugh as continued to walk down the aisle to check out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Small just stood there with a perplexed look on his face.  \"Where did that guy find the nerve to talk to him like that,\" he thought to himself.  Then a smile crept across Dr. Small's face.  \"Well, I'll show him,\" he said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDr. Small wanted to teach Tom Titan a lesson in size.  Thoughts started racing through his head.

The crazed doctor wasn't taking that lightly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he followed the body builder back home, he pulled up to the Titan's driveway once Tom exited.

Collecting his tiny prize, Dr. Small quietly snuck into the Titan's house and deposited the now tiny Tom on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck!\" he laughed before leaving to watch from the safety of the cameras he had set up.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown on the floor, Tom was panicking.
