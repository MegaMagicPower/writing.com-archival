            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you walk down the street of an unfamiliar town one evening, you notice a colorful flyer stapled to a telephone pole.  A circus is performing just a few blocks from here.  It's been a long time since you've been to one, and you're in an adventurous mood, so you decide to check it out.<br>\r\nAs you approach the tent, you notice how comparatively small this circus is to the others you've known.  The circular tent implies that they only have one performance ring, and a lack of trailers and manure smell suggests they don't even have any animals.  Out from beneath the darkened entrance flap a gloved hand beckons you.  The silhouette of the summoning figure is barely visible in the shadows of the tent.  As you reach the opening, you hear her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fantastic!  We have room for just one more guest!  Come inside.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpecting to pay for a ticket first, you reach for your wallet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no.  We wouldn't dream of charging you!  You're going to be our special guest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one hand replacing your wallet, you ponder what that statement could mean as her glove takes your free hand and she pulls you inside the tent.  The flap closes behind you and now the only light shining down on the circus ring up ahead.  You hear the low murmur of voices around you as your adjusting eyes make out the dark shapes of the audience members.  In the center of the ring you see what appears to be a tall walk-in closet with it's rainbow colored doors shut.  As you are pulled nearer to the light, you can now see your guide.  <br>\r\nShe is wearing the red coat of a ringmaster, but it's not like any ringmaster's coat you've seen before.  It's front is clearly designed to fit her feminine curves, while it's tails trail all the way to the back of her knees, where they curl up and away in springy ringlets.  The coat's shimmering fabric is matched by the red bow tie she wears at her white collar.  Her feathered, shoulder length black hair is playfully streaked with red, as are her eye lashes.  A small black top hat rests on her head which, married with her button up elbow length white gloves, convey a caricature of class and distinction.  Her taut backseamed fishnet tights and the long legs inside them inspire something else altogether.<br>\r\nShe gets you seated, and then walks directly into the center of the ring to start the show.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and gentleman, welcome to the silliest, sexiest, most shameless, mischievous, and deviant show on earth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she began her statement speaking to entire audience, she ended it speaking directly to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Send in the clowns!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chimes of a calliope fill the tent as half a dozen clowns coming running, spinning, and cartwheeling in to the ring.  You turn your head to look at one and do a double take at the seats beside you.  You were so busy admiring the ringmistress as she took you to your seat and walked away, that you didn't even bother to take stock of your surroundings until this moment.<br>\r\nJudging by your peripheral vision, you had thought that the audience was full, but you were mistaken.  In the seat immediately beside you on either side is not a real person, but a fully dressed mannequin.  You can hear the crowd cheering behind you, but when you turn around, you see a bunch of carboard cutouts in the seats shaped like people.  You're starting to feel very uneasy when you feel a tap on your shoulder.  At the center of the ring, the ringmistress makes an announcement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now ladies and gentleman, please help me give a warm welcome to our special guest this evening!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn audible click from a recording device echoes through the tent and the crowd behind you applauses encouragingly.  The hand that just tapped your shoulder is now extended towards you to help you out of your seat.  This graceful extremity belongs to a lovely young woman with curly pink hair, creamy fair skin, and a cherry red nose.  She is the cutest clown you have ever laid eyes on.  Her gloved hand leads to shapely arms capped in puffy sleeves at her shoulders, plunging down to just enough cleavage to perk your interest.  At her narrow waist, her vibrantly colored dress cones out to a hoop that sways ands bounces at her thigh level.  Striped stockings reveal the form of her well-turned legs.<br>\r\nShe waits for you expectantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will you do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The setup may be a bit questionable, but you started this evening in an adventurous mood, and you did agree to be their \"special guest\" this evening when they let you in for free.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou accept the pretty clown's hand, and give a sudden start as it rattles and buzzes loudly on your palm.  The clown makes an exaggerated \"oops\" expression, as if she hadn't realized the joy buzzer was there.  The audience chortles behind you.  When she offers her other hand, you make a big show of inspecting it before you accept her help up.  Your playing into the joke earns you another canned chortle.<br>\r\nThe attractive clown leads you into the ring, where the other clowns are preparing a number of different skits.  To your right, three clowns are setting up a bakery set with lots of thick cream pies.  Ahead, one clown appears to be juggling eggs, and to your left, another clown is approaching you with an extra large bucket, an extra large brush, and a small piece of colorful wallpaper (about the size of your standard notebook paper).  The cute clown points you toward the bucket laden clown, waves goodbye to you, and sneaks a quick pat to your bottom as she goes to join her comic comrades at the bakery set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worker clown puts down the bucket, and extends the brush toward your right side, shaking it up and down.  You don't know what to make of it at first, but then the clown realizes the mistake, hands the brush to you, and then shakes your hand in greeting, or rather shakes the brush which is now in your hand.  The handy clown appears to have lost something and begins to search for it.  You just stand there watching, brush in hand.  Just before giving up the search, the clown spies the brush in your hand and snatches it back smartly, while giving you an accusatory glare.  Having retrieved the brush, the clown hands you the scrap of wallpaper, and demonstrates that you should hold it up at chest level.  Once you do so, the laborer clown dips the extra large brush into the extra large bucket, and pulls it back up dripping with dense, gooey white paste.  <br>\r\nHaving seen this sort of act before, you know what to expect from this clown, and you intend to avoid the sticky mess.  At first, you obediently hold the paper in place as the blue collar clown puts the brush to it, but when the bristles begin an upward stroke, you lift the paper with the brush and defend your face from the brushes goo.  You smile broadly at your own cleverness, until the unexpectedly quick downward stroke smears paste all over the front of your shirt. In an effort to spare the rest of your clothes the same fate, you jump backwards away from the brush, and feel yourself bump into someone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the first egg splatters on your head, all you feel is surprise.  When the second hits you, you realize that you've just disrupted the juggler in mid-juggle.  As the third egg crack upon your cranium, and the yolks start finding their way down the back of your neck, you decide you must find some sort of shelter.  Instinctively, you raise the wallpaper from in front of your face to above your head, where you safely catch the fourth and final egg, intact.  You make no expression of clever triumph this time however; because the moment you exposed your face, a freshly laden brush covered it up again with heavy paste.  <br>\r\nYou blow yourself a mouth hole and breathe deeply while you wipe an eye clean with one hand.  The worker clown takes the wallpaper from you, and you feel a twinge of gratitude, as you now have two hands to clear your vision.  Unfortunately, no sooner have you regained your eyesight, than the clown takes it away again by smacking the wallpaper securely over your pasty face.  At this point you can hear the slowly rising laughter of the audience and you know that the wicked worker clown who you can no longer see will just keep playing dirty tricks on you if you don't get away right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stagger blindly away, feeling the air with one hand, while peeling away the stuck paper with the other.  You've stumbled a few yards when the paper comes loose and your perception is restored.  What you see gives you pause.  Four clowns with two pies each stand poised before you like a confectionery firing squad beside a bakery counter.  The first volley knocks you back a bit as two pies strike your forhead and the other two your right arm and left thigh.  The audience laughs louder.  with the next volley, all four pies take you forcefully in the chest and leave you stumbling backward until your heel strikes something and you trip.  You sit down with a heavy squelch, and realize immediately that you've just fallen into the extra large bucket of paste.  <br>\r\nThe audience is now laughing uproariously, and you are fairly certain you can make out the distinct laughs of the clowns standing around you as well.  You struggle to get to feet, and then unstick the bucket from your backside amid the cacophony of hoots and cackles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do now?</span></div></div>",

The audience's laughter has died down, and the clowns start performing small gags with each other while ignoring you.  The ringmistress makes an announcement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the second act, we\u2019ll be needing a moment or two to prepare, so feel free to get yourself some cotton candy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the sound of creaking chairs and moving feet, and think for a moment that you might even be able to duck out with the exiting members of the audience, before you remember that there is no real audience, and all the sounds that you are hearing are recorded.  You notice that the clowns have receded to the edge of the ring and appear to be leaving themselves.  This may be your chance to escape.  You take a step forward, and nearly fall down before pulling back your weight.  You had intended to take a reasonable stride, but your legs are so stiff from the now dry glue that coats them that you barely managed to move your foot a few inches.  Then, all the clowns that had seemly disappeared start to slowly seep back into the show.  At first, you are more concerned with getting your legs unstuck, but you change your focus when you realize they are all carrying quite a few large objects behind their backs while grinning eagerly and devilishly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies and Gentleman, for being such a wonderful participant in our first act, in appreciation, for our second act, the clowns would like to make our special guest a glorious statue.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surrounding clowns just continue to watch you expectantly, while out of the corner of your eye, you see another clown, dressed in a purple spotted costume, enter the ring riding a unicyle.  Balanced atop of the riding clown's head, a very large, very familiar bucket teeters and sloshes.  Dreading the imminent, but helpless to get out of the way, you watch as the unicyclist pulls up in front of you and stops abruptly, causing the bucket to fall forward and douse you entirely in fresh paste.<br>\r\nImmediately, the circled clowns move in and employ their hidden objects.  Gloved hands grab your arms and force them into an outstretched pose, while what appears to be oversized hair dryers are aimed at your elbows and shoulders, drying the glue.  A pair of oversized scissors, like the kind you would see at ribbon cutting ceremonies, flashes before your eyes.  After a few quick snips, you feel your shirt get stripped of of your body, sticking for a moment where the old paste had dried.  You feel the same happen to your pants, and you try to move once they are pulled off, but the clowns and the paste that had soaked through to your skin hold your legs fast.  You are now nearly naked and completely immobile.  Paste laden brushes coat your body once more to ensure your captivity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

You raise your hands a liitle and shake your head to decline the clown's invitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh.  It looks like our special guest is going to need a little more support, folks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ringmistress looks behind you at the \"audience,\" and after another click, the same encouraging applause is played again at a louder volume.  The pretty clown in front of you still holds out an insistent hand, but you adamantly refuse to take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww, he's too shy, everybody.  Don't worry though, we know just how to give our guests a good motivational boost!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ringmistress says the word \"boost,\" you feel your seat rocket up and forward, launching you screaming into the ring where you land face down with arms and legs splayed.  You lie stunned from the surprise of the booby trap, and now realize you'd been set up since she directed you to your seat.  While you attempt to get up, gloved hands sieze both of your arms and legs.  The clowns lift you up by your appendages, leaving you face down about two feet above the ground.  No matter how you struggle, you cannot break free.  They dance around in a circle, spinning you and laughing as you continue to struggle futilely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think he wants us to put him down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting dizzy now, you nod vigorously in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Kay!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA fifth clown comes running towards you from the side of the ring carrying a large cream cake.  The clown trips and falls with extended arms holding the cake up from the ground, and slides across the dirt like a baseball player making a breakneck steal. The cake comes to a stop directly below your face as you feel the hands gripping your arms and legs pull up for a moment, and then push you down to the ground.  You have no way to dodge your head away from the cake as it rushes up to meet your face.  Your head is engulfed for a few seconds before the clown haul you back up into the same suspended position, cream cake now dripping from your nose and ears.  You sputter in indignation as the clowns and audience howl with laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that you say?  You want MORE cake?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feeling of dread comes over you for a moment, but then the sliding clown takes the cake out from under you and retreats.  As you are about to breathe a sigh of relief, you begin to be spun again, this time slowly.  At a quarter turn, you can see something very large is being rolled into ring from the direction that was just behind you.  At first glance, it appears to be a great circular bed, but as you are brought to face it, you can see clearly that it is a massive cream cake.  You struggle feebly once more, but without hope.  The hands holding you up begins to swing you back.. and forth..  back...  and forth...   back..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe we should just let him go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clowns bring you forward in one great swing, and then let go of you.  You sail into the air on momentum, and come crashing down again right on top of the massive cake.   Every inch of you is covered in sticky cream.  You prop yourself up away from the cake and take a breath, but as you shift to get off of the cake, your arms slip out from under you and your face smacks right back into the giant cream covered sponge.  The audience continues to crack up, and the clowns are pointing at you as they guffaw.  You gingerly edge your way off of the cake and stand, sopping with cream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do now?</span></div></div>",

You taste cotton.  You feel a bit foolish, but then she smiles and laughs happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come with me, loverboy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe backs away from you into the ring, beckoning you with her finger to follow.  You sigh and step forward, the recorded audience clicks and then hoots and hollers as real audiences so often do for sexy entertainment.  You blush, but aren't about to be psyched out by mannequins and cardboard.  As you reach the center of the ring, the coquettish clown begins to dance around you.  She takes your hands and the two of you start to spin like you've got saturday night fever.  The other clowns have formed a ring around the two of you and spin in the opposite direction, laughing.  You spin faster and faster until everything but her is a blur.  Suddenly she lets go of your hands and gracefully spins away in the opposite direction, giggling.  Her revolutions slow and she comes to a neat stop with a curtsey to her dance partner.<br>\r\nUnfortunately, you are nowhere near as graceful.  Caught off guard by her disengagement, you stumble quickly to a stop and are so dizzy you fall flat on your backside.  The audience and the clowns howl with laughter.  You grin sheepishly and awkwardly get to your feet.  Once again, the cute, pink-haired clown is baiting you; luring you in with open arms while making kissy faces.  You should be cautious, but it's been fun, enticing, and you're still a little dizzy.  You take few steps in her direction and notice the other clowns standing on either side of you have their hands behind their backs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to cool off, loverboy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFour buckets of cool water are tossed into your face by the prankish clowns.  Before can even finish sputtering for breath, you hear another clown cry something from beside you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Makeup!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world goes white as a giant powderpuff connects with your face and envelopes you in a cloud of baking powder.  Through coated ears, you can hear the clowns and the audience erupting once again into raucous laughter at your expense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow do you react?</span></div></div>",

Her face paint is red and purple in exaggeratedly clownish femininity, her lips already huge and full before being painted their sparkling red.  Her clown outfit is a motley polka-dotted dress cut to resemble a sultry nightclub singer's, but stretched to impossible tightness over her gigantically fat body, her behemoth boobs barely contained and her gargantuan gut nearly bursting from the seams.  She's looking you over with a comical parody of lust and there is raucous laughter from all around you.  You can already hear the band kicking up \"Yackity Sax\" and are pretty sure you know what's expected.  It's to be the chase as the massive and lusty female chases around the smaller and weaker male to the all too familiar Benny Hill theme.  The question is, how do you play this?  You'd rather not offend this massive female clown who looks easily strong enough to pound you into the ground if you made her mad, but you have a feeling that just giving up might not be the best idea, either.

Looks like you'll be doing the chasing now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you catch me,\" she whispers, \"I'll make sure you like the results.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen with gales of laughter, she teasingly runs from you and you (fully committed to playing along with the whole thing at this point) give chase, with exaggerated expressions of affection.  Of course, the other clowns are throwing obstacles in your way.  As you pass one, you are spun around vigorously so that your chasing becomes unsteady from dizziness.  A couple of clowns trip you up as you try to catch up with Gladys (who is surprisingly nimble given her size) but you are undeterred, even when one clown drops a bucket of whitewash that you step in and find yourself still chasing, but now with the clattering bucket on your foot.  The laughter continues to mount with the more obstacles thrown in your path and with your dogged determination to overcome them nonetheless.  Gladys seems genuinely flattered through her comedic teasing that you are willing to put yourself through so much both for the show and for her.  She always seems just outside of your reach, even though you're pretty sure she could outdistance you at any point, especially with all of the other clowns slowing you down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, one of the clowns throws an oversized banana peel in your path and you slip, but instead of falling, you continue to slide in the direction of Gladys, unable to stop.  She sees you sliding towards her, unable to stop even if you wanted to, and seems to be coming to a decision.  What does she do?</span></div></div>",

You slammed right into her soft body before her arms clamped around your body, pinning your arms to your sides and holding you to her. The crowd cheered at you \"catching\" her as she stood there smiling down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lfted your face up to hers as she whispered in your ear. \"Here's your prize. Teehee.\" With that, her lips pucker and plant a wet smooch on your cheek, leaving a visible red lipstick imprint as they part. \"Mwah.\" She makes audible as she breaks the smooch. Then another on your forehead, and your other cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the seconds roll on, her lips find themselves on every part of your face but your own lips, leaving so many lipstick marks that you start to look like a cartoon character, a fact the audience takes note of as their laughter turns to audible chuckling as they see your face. Using just one arm to hold your body up, she takes her other hand and grabs your cheeks, forcing your lips to pucker. She licks her lips as she closes her eyes and puckers up as her lips get close to yours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

As she's going slowly, you have a moment to mutter through your squeezed cheeks what you have in mind.  Gladys, who is already delighted at your willing cooperation with the act, whispers agreement and just as her lips meet yours, the two of you swing about.  Now you have your arms wrapped around what you can of her vast body and are tipping her backwards in a huge kiss with her seeming shocked at your boldness.  Admittedly, you have nowhere near the necessary strength to hold Gladys up like this, but she knows how to hold herself to make it look like you do.  As for the kiss, you get the feeling that might be the real surprise for her given that you throw yourself into it completely to the point where your tongue is grappling with hers like it was Wrestlemania.  The band, responding to the sudden shift, hits a comically romantic violin sting and a couple of other clowns prance out in cupid-gear, firing suction-cup arrows at both of you to ensure that both you and she have at least one stuck to your respective behinds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well how about this, ladies and gentlemen,\" says Glenda, now having taken a microphone, \"Could it be after all of this time my sister has found the man of her dreams?  What do you think?  Should we just skip the preamble and move on to the wedding?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour breathtaking kiss with Gladys has only just ended and she is now on her feet in front of you as that last word registers.  Wedding?  Really?  Well, you're committed to the act, but something about the tone makes you wonder just how much if it is meant to be an act.  You give a nervous smile to Gladys, wondering if you'd gone too far, but she seems to be enjoying the events of the act more and more by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hope you're ready for what you've gotten yourself into, cutie,\" she says, \"Just remember, you make a commitment, you'd better be ready to honor it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready, the clowns are changing the scene, bringing out bouquets of squirting flowers, wedding-style cakes that you know are going to end up all over someone (probably you) and even a bumbling clownish \"priest\" to officiate.  You're going to have to make a decision here.</span></div></div>",

You watch as the female clowns get to work on Gladys, adding lace to her outfit like it were a wedding dress, and applying copious amounts of extra lipstick, as if her kisses didn't show enough. Meanwhile, some of the male clowns start prepping you. You were forcibly stripped of your clothes, getting a laugh from the audience as they see you in your boxers, ashamed by the exposure, before they dress you up in a suit more akin to the Joker's than a traditional tux.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are then pushed in front of the clown priest with Gladys, who was now holding one of the squirting bouquets. You turn to face each other as the priest begins the standard speech with a few jokes thrown in. You were starting to get nervous about the lusty grin she's been giving you since you got up here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you Gladys Giggles, take this man to be your clown husband, so long as you both shall live?\" The priest asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGladys shoots a stream of water from her bouquet right in your face, getting a laugh from the crown. \"I'll take that as 'I do'.\" The priest declares before turning to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And do you take Gladys to be your. Clown wife, so long as you both shall live?\" He asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, you've come this far. \"I do.\" You answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The by the power vested in me <i>by</i> me, I now pronounce you clown and wife. You may kiss the bride.\" He concludes with a honk of his horn as you and Gladys face each other. She then leans in, her freshly superglossed lips pucker and her eyes close in anticipation. You do the same and closer your eyes and pucker up for her, wondering the whole while if this was real or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next? </span></div></div>",

Ah well, you think, you'll at least have the memory of being wrapped up against Gladys' overwhelming warmth and softness, the unrestrained enthusiasm of her kisses, the enjoyment of unashamed playfulness in expressing affection that can be kind of difficult to find outside this weird (but entertaining) big top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the one thing you didn't expect to happen does happen.  Gladys' lips meet yours and the full reality of what has happened hits you.  The wedding, as ridiculous as it was, is genuine.  You are now married to Gladys and as you find yourself not only kissed but unashamedly grabbed and groped by Gladys, the other clowns wind up with the wedding cakes and let them fly to target the two of you and getting you both absolutely covering the two of you in cake and frosting.  You actually take the opportunity (under the guise of just trying to wrap your arms around all of Gladys' succulent girth) to give her massive boobs a feel which actually causes her to whoop in delight.  You follow this up by meeting her eye and very deliberately licking some of the frosting from her long line of cleavage.  Well why not?  She is your wife now, isn't she?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Delicious,\" you say with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you begin to notice something...your commitment to this marriage doesn't just make you her husband.  One other part of the vows registered.  It wasn't just husband you agreed to be...but clown husband.  And with that you begin to feel changes taking place in yourself.  It's not so dramatic as to make you unrecognizable.  You remain the same height and basic build, although you feel much more comfortable in the baggy Joker-like tux you wear now.  There is a notable increase in the size of your feet which your shoes expand to accommodate.  Your hair turns an odd shade of broccoli green and becomes much more bushy, although more straight than curly, although the front now seems to stand up in an oversized curl naturally.  Finally...there's a notable increase at the front of your trousers, inflating almost like a long balloon, although you're quite certain that it's all you.  Gladys looks on in delight at your transformation and one pudgy hand finds your Y-fronts to confirm what's happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, hubby,\" she says with a wink, \"Was your daddy an elephant, because I think you've inherited his trunk.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Gladys openly strokes you to full erection through your baggy trousers (which now barely contain the junk within) that is when you realize...</span></div></div>",
