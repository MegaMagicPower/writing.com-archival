He walked down the hall to his room that he made himself, mostly by stealing the furniture using Chaos Control. He opened the refrigerator and frowned. \"Damn. Out of food again.\" This meant another trip to Earth to stock up.</span></div></div>",

Luckily, it was night there, so stealing some should be a breeze. He ran down the streets of Beijing, not caring about plowing into a few pedestrians. Out of the corner of his eye he spotted something that caught his attention. He skidded to a halt and turned around. There was a perfect store to rob. He teleported inside and then back to the ARK with bags of food. He sorted it, put it away, and turned on the TV. (He gets really good reception in space!) He switched to the news and started eating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A massive earthquake struck Mexico to-click-ere at the Savanna Desert which is hav-click-eports of robots that have been stealing parts from a factory in New York.\" Shadow paused and listened. \"Employees say the robots stood on two legs and had two arms, but one arm had a gun on the end. One threatened the workers with the gun as four others gathered parts and then they all fled out of the east entrance. No one else saw these robots, and how they escaped unspotted remains a mystery.\"</span></div></div>",

He teleported to New York and Triangle Jumped his way to the top of a builiding. He scanned the horizon for the industrial district and leaped across rooftops to get there. Once he did, he tried to remember where the factory was. Hmmm..... It was near the edge of the district! He saw a street sign on the TV........ Darvy Drive! He remembered Darvy Drive led to the industrial district from... the residential! Shadow then leapt across some more rooftops until he found the factory. The news crew was just leaving. Shadow sat on a nearby rooftop until night fell then snuck into the factory. He used Chaos Control to freeze time so he could find a good hiding spot. The factory was mostly automated and the machines that did the work were scattered in the middle of the factory. Shadow jumped to the top of the machine and used it to get to the rafters of the building. Then there was nothing to do but wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed like hours he saw something out of the corner of his eye. He looked over at the movement and saw...</span></div></div>",

He then walked around the corner and there he was, comletely unaware.
