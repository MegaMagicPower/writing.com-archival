            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was just after 7:00 in the morning, I\u2019d been lying awake in bed for almost the last 90 minutes.  Rolling over in bed, I looked over the dozing body of my girlfriend Amber.  Last night had been our 5-month anniversary, so we celebrated by enjoying a romantic dinner followed by passion-filled evening in bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019d been having these feelings of uncertainty lately where my life didn\u2019t seem to be going in the direction that I wanted it to.  I loved Amber, don\u2019t get me wrong, but I\u2019d recently wondered if she was truly the one for me.  Quietly climbing out of bed, I was on my way to the bathroom when my cell phone beeped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing work was the only reason I\u2019d get a text this early, I sighed and retrieved my phone from the dresser.  Looking at the screen, I saw the text \u2013 <b>Deceased teenager in Lakeview Park</b>.  Putting the phone back down, I walked out of the bedroom; stopping briefly to look at some photos I\u2019d hung on the hallway wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were your typical family photos; me with my parents doing various activities.  Things like sitting in my Dad\u2019s patrol car while pretending to drive, going trick or treating dressed as a cop, or on the football field after scoring the championship-winning touchdown.  By looking at the smile on my face in all those photos, you\u2019d think I was happy; but you\u2019d be wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see my parents, especially my dad, were the type to exert absolute control over every aspect of my life growing up.  It didn\u2019t matter what I wanted to do; I had to do everything they told me.  I wanted to join my school\u2019s theater group, but my Dad insisted I do something more manly \u2013 so I reluctantly tried out for football.  It didn\u2019t matter that I was a decent football player, I still didn\u2019t enjoy it that much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe same thing happened when I graduated from High School; I wanted to go off to study economics, but my Dad pushed me into joining the police force.  You see he\u2019d been shot while serving a warrant as part of an investigation, forcing him to take an early retirement.  My joining the force and becoming the youngest detective in department history was more about him wanting to relive his glory days through me then it was about honoring him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about 5 minutes into my shower when I heard the door open, followed by Amber saying, \u201cLet me guess, you got called into work?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d rinsing some shampoo out of my eyes, I said, \u201cthey found a body in Lakeview Park.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPoking her head through the shower curtain, Amber said, \u201cI\u2019m going out for a run; make sure you text me when you get there.  Alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t until recently that Amber had started making that request; that I text her both when I got to work and when I was leaving.  That was something I could live with; but I didn\u2019t like that unless I had an errand to run, I had to come straight home after work.<br>\r\nHaving succeeded in getting the shampoo from my eyes, I looked at her and said, \u201cSure thing, babe.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>There was a light drizzle as I drove through the main entrance to the park a scant 10 minutes from my apartment.  Finding a spot across from the bathrooms, I noticed an ambulance and 3 patrol cars were already here.  I briefly considered not sending Amber the text saying I\u2019d arrived, only to remember what she\u2019d do if I didn\u2019t; she\u2019d blow my phone up with calls until I answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sending the text, I grabbed my jacket and stepped out of the car.  I started towards the police tape only to be stopped when I saw my partner, Jamie Collins, approaching me.  Handing me a cup of coffee, Jamie said, \u201cHow did your anniversary dinner go with Amber?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt went pretty much as I expected; except somehow she found a way to bring you into the conversation.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling as he ducked under the tape, Jamie said, \u201cI\u2019ve been back in town for 3 months; you\u2019d think she\u2019d be used to us working together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s slowly coming around on that.\u201d Walking alongside Jamie, I said, \u201cI just think it\u2019ll take time for her to realize that our working relationship isn\u2019t a continuation of our physical one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I know what you\u2019re probably thinking; I swing both ways and Jamie used to be my boyfriend, but that couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth.  You see Jamie and I dated for almost 3 years in High School; but back then he was a girl named Emily.  \u201cOh wow, why is she so hung up on that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRounding the corner behind the bathroom, I said, \u201cRelax, she\u2019ll come around eventually; we just have to give her time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou got it, boss.\u201d With a smile, Jamie said, \u201cI\u2019ll go speak with the witnesses, why don\u2019t you go look at the crime scene.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking further into the crime scene, I spotted the Medical Examiner kneeling by a nearby tree; it wasn\u2019t until I got close that I saw the body leaning against the tree.  The victim was a young woman, probably no older than 16 years old.  There was blood on her jogging outfit and what appeared to be stab wounds on her chest and abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking up behind the coroner, I said, \u201cI\u2019m Detective Percy; what can you tell me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me, the coroner got to his feet and said, \u201cDetective Percy; let me introduce to 15-year-old Chloe Hawkins.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJotting down that information on my notepad, I said, \u201cHawkins?  As in Arthur Hawkins, the property mogul?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur Hawkins was a local businessman responsible for many of the commercial and residential developments in the area.  He\u2019d died of cancer about 4 years back.  \u201cThat\u2019s right Detective, Chloe was his granddaughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at Chloe\u2019s body, I said, \u201cAs I recall, there was speculation that she wasn\u2019t actually related to Arthur.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Hawkins never married; so, when a young girl arrives in town claiming to be his granddaughter, everyone was right to be confused.\u201d Wiping some dirt from his pants, the coroner said, \u201cIf memory serves, the day-to-day of the company was supposed to be handled by the Board until Chloe turned 18.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked down at Chloe\u2019s body, saddened to think that such a young life had been extinguished.  Turning back to the coroner, I said, \u201cWhat can I you tell me so far?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell judging by the condition of the body, I\u2019d estimate she was killed at some point within the last three hours.\u201d Stepping closer to me, he said, \u201cThe wounds on her body are consistent with a bladed weapon, and I\u2019ve noticed what appear to be several defensive wounds on her arms.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spoke with the Medical Examiner for a few minutes, getting his opinion about the case; everything I saw pointed towards an early morning mugging.  After making sure to take some photos and ask that coroner keep me updated, I walked over to where Jamie was speaking with the witnesses.  \u201cI\u2019m Detective Percy; did you two notice anything out of the ordinary prior to discovering the body?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cN-No, we didn\u2019t see anything unusual.\u201d Barely keeping composure, the young woman said, \u201cI was going to get a drink from the fountain when I discovered her body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to respond when my phone started ringing; I groaned when I saw that it was Amber calling.  Indicating to Jamie that I needed to take this, I stepped a short distance away before answering, \u201cNow\u2019s not an appropriate time, Amber; I\u2019m in the middle of a case.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou forgot to text me, Andrew.\u201d Her voice stern, Amber said, \u201cProbably too busy cavorting with your ex, I bet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked upwards into the trees to keep my composure, \u201cI\u2019m really getting tired of repeating myself, Amber; there\u2019s nothing going on between me and Jamie.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cNeed I remind you that <i>he</i> has a girlfriend?\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After returning to the station, I sent off yet another text to Amber before going to my desk.  The conversation with Amber was still weighing heavily on my mind; enough to make me log into my OneDrive account and look at some old photos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI spent the next 30 minutes going down memory lane; revisiting all 3 years of my relationship with Jamie before he realized he was trans.  Prior to that realization, he was the epitome of femininity; cheer-squad captain, fashion trend-setter as well as Prom Queen.  The two of us were inseparable and, at least for me, it felt like we were soul mates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was so focused on our Prom photo that I didn\u2019t realize Jamie was standing behind me until he said, \u201cI knew I was living a lie at that point; but that didn\u2019t keep me from having a good time with you.\u201d Taking a seat across from me, Jamie said, \u201cI always thought of Prom as the last hurrah for that part of my life.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSometimes I find myself thinking back to those days; how lucky I was to have a girlfriend who wasn\u2019t the jealous type.\u201d Checking to make sure the coast was clear, I looked at Jamie and said, \u201cDo you ever wonder what things would\u2019ve been like if we hadn\u2019t broken up?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his characteristic doofy grin, Jamie said, \u201cThat would\u2019ve required a major lifestyle change on your part, don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br>\r\nIt took me a moment to realize what Jamie meant; but I smiled once I did, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant, dummy.\u201d Looking at Jamie, I said, \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t realized you were trans, do you think we\u2019d still be together?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure, Andy; that\u2019s not really something I think about.\u201d Sighing, Jamie said, \u201cBut if it makes you feel better, we probably would still be together.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing this was an uncomfortable topic for him, I decided to change the subject, \u201cDid the witnesses say anything else after I left?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot really; based on what we know, I\u2019m afraid the victim was already long dead before they even arrived in the park.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">*****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie had left 10 minutes earlier; going to check up on another case we were working on.  I was in the middle of finishing up my report when my phone began ringing.  Picking it up, I said, \u201cHomicide, Detective Percy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDetective, this is Alistair Thorne from the Coroner\u2019s office.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the clock on my desk, I was surprised to see almost 2 hours had passed since my return to the office.  I chuckled to myself, realizing that I\u2019d been so laser focused on the report I lost all track of time.  \u201cMr. Thorne, I assume you have some information for me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow soon can you be at my office? I\u2019ve discovered something rather interesting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe town\u2019s emergency services were part of the same emergency complex, which was located a block away from town hall.  This meant it was a quick 5-minute walk from my office to the Medical Examiner\u2019s office.  \u201cOkay Mr. Thorne, what\u2019s so interesting that you couldn\u2019t tell me over the phone?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Thorne silently led me into the exam room, where I saw Chloe\u2019s body on the table.  \u201cAs you know, it\u2019s standard procedure to gather fingerprints and DNA from a victim.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course; that way we can make sure the victim is properly identified.\u201d Confused, I said, \u201cDid you find something interesting when you took that from Chloe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cInteresting doesn\u2019t begin to describe it.\u201d Stepping over to a computer, Mr. Thorne said, \u201cOur victim isn\u2019t Arthur Hawkins\u2019 granddaughter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Looking at Mr. Thorne, I said, \u201cAre you saying this is a case of mistaken identity?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back towards the body on the table, Mr. Thorne said, \u201cI ran the test three times to make sure; but somehow this young girl is Arthur Hawkins.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment I thought perhaps Dr. Thorne had gone insane, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible, Dr. Thorne; Arthur Hawkins was a 73-year-old man.\u201d Leaning against the counter for support, I said, \u201cHow can that 15-year-old girl on the table possibly be him?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can re-run the tests just be sure; but I doubt it will change the results.\u201d Pausing, Dr. Thorne said, \u201cSomehow, Arthur Hawkins found a way to turn himself into a teenage girl.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Even with the information staring me in the face, I still struggled to believe what I was seeing.  With the printout in hand, I approached Chloe\u2019s body.  Her body was the textbook definition of a young girls with an attractive figure and slightly smaller than average breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the printout in my hand was telling me this young girl was a 73-year-old man.  Standing across from Dr. Thorne, with Chloe\u2019s body between us, I said, \u201cI\u2019m still having a tough time processing this, so bear with me.\u201d Looking at Dr. Thorne, I said, \u201cAre you telling me that Arthur Hawkins underwent plastic surgery in order to appear as a teenage girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes and no; surgery was definitely involved, but it wasn\u2019t to simply look like a teenage girl.\u201d Retrieving some paperwork from his dead, Dr. Thorne said, \u201cI know it sounds crazy; but that is a teenage girl lying on the slab, inside and out.  I\u2019m not sure she even knew it yet, but she was about 7 weeks pregnant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI took Anatomy in College, so I was easily able to recognize a complete female reproductive system on the images Dr. Thorne handed to me.  \u201cHow does an old man, one who could barely walk I might add, turn himself into a girl so completely that she\u2019s able to get pregnant?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking the images back, Dr. Thorne said, \u201cI\u2019m just the coroner, I\u2019m afraid; solving mysteries is your job.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stared at the body for a moment longer, \u201cForgetting about how this was done; what I want to know is why it was done.\u201d Pausing for a moment, I said, \u201cWhat could have possibly possessed Arthur Hawkins to do this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope this doesn\u2019t come off as me telling you how to do your job; but perhaps you should go to Ridgeview and search through Chloe\u2019s personal effects.\u201d Taking a seat at his desk, Dr. Thorne said, \u201cTeenage girls are always confiding in each other; perhaps some of her classmates can shed a light on this for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was going to be my next stop, Doc.\u201d Heading to the door, I briefly turned around and said, \u201cDo me a favor; try to figure out how someone could do something like this.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I used to babysit for her in my younger years; but I hadn\u2019t seen her for almost 3 years now.  \u201cSir, I\u2019m sure Erica had nothing to do with Ms. Hawkins\u2019 death.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">****************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRidgeview Academy was a prestigious boarding school on the outskirts of town, catering to the children of local businessman and other wealthy individuals.  It wasn\u2019t the kind of school that I, a child of a blue-collar family, could afford to attend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter driving through the gate onto the grounds, I parked outside the Administrative Building.  I stopped myself before stepping out of the car, reminding myself to update Amber on my location.  For a moment I considered not sending the text, but eventually she\u2019d wonder where I was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of the car after sending the text, I started to wonder if perhaps I should just break up with her.  But then I realized if she was acting this way out of jealousy, she\u2019d probably act 10x worse if I dumped her.  I was so caught up in my train of thought that I wasn\u2019t watching where I was going.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could stop myself, I bumped into a young girl and caused her to fall down to the ground.  Feeling terrible, I reached down to help her up, \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that, I wasn\u2019t watching where I was I going.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl didn\u2019t even try to hide the fact that she was checking me out.  Blushing a little bit as , she said, \u201cIt\u2019s totally alright; I wasn\u2019t watching where I was going either.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as the girl ran to catch up with two other girls; smiling when I heard one of them say, \u201cHe\u2019s kind of cute.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood at the bottom of the steps and watched as the girls walked around the corner.  The longer I watched them, the more I envied them; they had their whole lives ahead of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made my way inside the building and down the hall to the office.  After announcing my presence, I sat down and waited for the Headmaster to come out.  I got a text from Jamie while I was waiting \u2013 *<i>I just spoke with Doc Thorne; I still can\u2019t believe what he told me is true.</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*<i>Tell me about it; I\u2019m still trying to figure out why someone would do something like so drastic.</i>*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Headmaster\u2019s door opened right after I sent off the reply to Jamie; a middle-aged woman stepping out.  I was never a troublemaker in school, but the air of authority coming off her was enough to make me sit up straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApproaching me, she said, \u201cDetective Percy; I\u2019m Abigail Devereaux; Headmistress of Ridgeview Academy.  What brings you here this fine morning?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d be more comfortable speaking in private, ma\u2019am.\u201d</span></div></div>",

It was easy to see from the tears in her eyes that cared deeply about her students.  <i>If I had it to do over again,</i> I thought, <i>I wouldn't mind having her to teach me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping tears from her eyes, Headmistress Deveraux said, \u201cWhy would anyone want to kill such an innocent girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to find out, ma\u2019am.\u201d Readjusting my position in the chair, I said, \u201cTo that end, I\u2019d like your permission to search her room for any clues.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting up from her desk and walking towards me, Headmistress Deveraux said, \u201cOf course, if you think it will help identify who killed her.\u201d Heading to the door, she said, \u201cIn the meantime, I\u2019ll gather the students in the dining hall to tell them the unfortunate news.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting both a key to Chloe\u2019s room as well as directions, I left the Administrative Building and walked across campus to one of the 4 dorm buildings on the property.  I noticed several students walking past me on their way to the dining hall; talking amongst themselves about what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving outside Chloe\u2019s room, I took a breath before stepping inside.  The first thought entered my mind as I walked inside was that perhaps every test Dr. Thorne had run was wrong.  Looking around the immaculate room, built for two, I could see that this was most certainly a girl\u2019s room.  Both closets were open and full of things like dresses and skirts; and probably two dozen pairs of shoes between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the clothes and makeup in the bathroom weren\u2019t enough, the pictures of the wall by Chloe\u2019s bed were more than enough for me to doubt Dr. Thorne\u2019s results.  They included photos of her wearing a rather skimpy bikini on the beach, one of those ubiquitous group selfies with four other girls, in a cheer outfit and kissing a boy at some formal dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn</i>, I thought as I looked at the photos closely, <i>Arthur Hawkins definitely wasn\u2019t one for half measures.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was photographing everything when my phone started to ring; digging it from my pocket, thinking that it was Amber calling, I was relieved to see it was only Jamie.  Putting an earbud in my ear, I answered the call, \u201cHey Jamie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you found anything of interest at the school?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot yet; I\u2019ve only been in Chloe\u2019s room for a few minutes.\u201d Looking around the room once more, I said, \u201cI\u2019m still no closer to figuring out how Chloe managed to become a girl; but she was really committed to being a teenage girl.  I mean, she\u2019s got more dresses and shoes then you did.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like she would've given me a run for my money.\" Chuckling, Jamie said, \"I never saw it as a problem but mom would always say half the stores in the mall were in business because of me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I have to side with your Mom, Jamie; I remember one time you dragged me from store to store buying every outfit you could get your hands on.\u201d Leaning against the wall, I said, \u201cI mean why spend close to $1000 on clothes only to announce a few months later that you want to transition.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Andy, you know what it's like being a teenager.\" With a sigh, Jamie continued, \"I was being pulled in every possible direction; part of me wasn't sure if I was just conflicted or if this was real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing my eyes for a moment, I said, \"I know, Jamie; you forget I was there with you every step of the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, and I can never repay you for that; you were an incredibly supportive boyfriend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie and I continued along that line of conversation for a few more minutes, until I noticed something on Chloe\u2019s desk.  Pulling it out, I saw that it was a letter from some company called Ovid.  \u201cJamie, have you ever heard of Ovid?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, can\u2019t say as I have.  Why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI quickly perused the letter; something about there being a data breach and certain information may have been compromised.  <br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a letter from them on Chloe\u2019s desk; something about a breach and information being compromised.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a brief pause before Jamie responded, \u201cWhat if this company was the one responsible for turning Arthur into Chloe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf that\u2019s true; then what if whoever hacked their system discovered Chloe\u2019s true identity.\u201d Taking a photo of the letter, I said, \u201cWe could be dealing with a blackmail situation here, Jamie; someone wanted money from Chloe and killed her when she wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSend me a copy of the letter, I\u2019ll do some research on the company when I get back to the station.\u201d Pausing, Jamie said, \u201cLet me know if you find anything else of interest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe call ended just as I heard someone fumbling with the door.  After a moment, the door opened and a teenage girl of Italian descent entered the room.  Judging from the messed-up makeup on her face, she\u2019d been crying recently.  She stopped in her tracks once she saw me, no doubt thinking I was some weirdo breaking into her room.  \u201cW-Who are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Detective Percy with the Lakeview Police Department; I\u2019m here investigating Chloe Hawkins' murder.\u201d Pausing, trying my best to sound gentle, I said, \u201cAre you her roommate?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cY-Yeah, I\u2019m her roommate.\u201d Wiping tears from her eyes, the girl said, \u201cI\u2019m Josie Russo.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I knew she was grieving over the loss of her friend and roommate, and I wanted to be sympathetic, but I did have an investigation to run.  \u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry for your loss, Miss Russo,\u201d finally speaking up, I said, \u201cbut I\u2019d like to ask you some questions if I may.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" she said, wiping the tears from her eyes. \"I guess I must seem like a bum trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling, I said, \u201cSorry; but isn\u2019t that a little out of date for a modern teenager.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJosie reacted as if I'd caught her with her hand in the cookie jar. \u201cI guess it\u2019s something I picked up from my grandfather.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking towards her nightstand, I saw a photo of her with an older man \u2013 who I assumed was her grandfather.  I quickly recognized him as Marcus Russo, a one-term governor and former friend of my grandfather.  I didn\u2019t know all the details, but something had happened to drove a wedge between them.  I even remembered him coming to my school once for an assembly.  \u201cMarcus Russo was your grandfather?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPoppa took me in after my parents died; he raised me on his own for 5 years until a heart attack took him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI remembered hearing that story on that news; my Grandfather had even considered reaching out.  \u201cI remember the car accident, but I don\u2019t recall anything about him having a granddaughter.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can blame Poppa for that; he thought he\u2019d lose support if it became known his daughter had a child out of wedlock.\u201d <br>\r\nReaching for some tissues, Josie said \u201cI didn\u2019t even know he existed until he introduced himself at the funeral.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking my notepad out, I said, \u201cNow back to the case: Did Chloe Hawkins have any enemies here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLying back on her bed, Josie said, \u201cJust Darcy Hawthorne.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking note of the name, I said, \u201cWould you care to elaborate? \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDarcy had this on-again/off-again relationship with this guy, Colin; during one of their off-again phases, Chloe swooped in and nabbed him for herself.\u201d Looking at me, Josie said, \u201cI\u2019m not saying Darcy killed her; but she\u2019s the closest thing Chloe had to an enemy here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI made sure to write down both Darcy and Colin\u2019s names, reminding myself to speak with them.  It seemed likely that Colin was the father of Chloe\u2019s unborn child; news of which might have pushed Darcy over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question continued for another few minutes until there was a knock at the door.  After getting my permission to answer it, Josie got up and opened the door.  I leaned forward just enough to see _______.</span></div></div>",

Having 9 people inside the already cramped room was enough to give me anxiety.  As the group took seats where they could, I recognized one of the girls as the one who\u2019d said I was cute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched as all seven of them, starting with an athletically built blonde, each gave Josie hugs.  Once that was finished, Josie gestured to me and said, \u201cThis is Detective Percy; he\u2019s investigating Chloe\u2019s murder.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the group, I said, \u201cI take it you all knew Chloe?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tall boy, whose red hair and green eyes hinted at his Irish heritage, nodded, \u201cOur classmates all called us the Legacies; because we\u2019ve all inherited fortunes from relatives.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry for your loss; I\u2019ll be back over the coming days to speak with each of you in private.\u201d Handing them some business cards, I said, \u201cIf any of you thinks of something, please don\u2019t hesitate to call me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leaving the dorm building, I decided to take a short break to collect my thoughts.

The fact that I, someone who was almost 5 years older than her oldest students, was being given the same level of compassion was astounding.  Looking at her, I said, \u201cYou ever find yourself thinking about some important life decision, and regretting the choice you made?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think everyone has had moments like that in their lives; it\u2019s completely normal to have regrets.\u201d Turning towards the lake as she sighed, Headmistress Devereaux continued, \u201cWhat is it that has you so preoccupied, Detective?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking out over the lake, I said, \u201cI\u2019ve had absolutely no say in my life for the last few years; my parents and even my girlfriend run my life.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI joined the football team and became a cop because that\u2019s what my father wanted, I can\u2019t hang out with my co-workers because of my girlfriend\u2019s preoccupation with my partner.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something about the Headmistress that made it hard for me to read her.  Looking at me, she said, \u201cSometimes parents feel the need to live vicariously through their children; was your father a cop as well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah; for 25 years until he was shot by someone holding up a convenience store.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cHere\u2019s the kicker; he wasn\u2019t <br>\r\neven on duty at the time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat explains your father then; but your girlfriend is still a mystery.\u201d Taking a brief pause, she said, \u201cWhy is she so preoccupied with your partner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause my partner and I dated throughout most of High School; Amber seems convinced that we\u2019re somehow continuing our relationship.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I can understand a little of where she\u2019s coming from; especially if her boyfriend spends every day with his ex-girlfriend.\u201d Sighing, she said, \u201cHave the two of you done anything to alleviate her concerns?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew enough not to divulge Jamie\u2019s private life to a stranger, but I felt the need to explain the situation.  \u201cI\u2019ve done everything I can to explain the situation to Amber; I still care about my partner but not in the romantic way that I used to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf I were in your position, I would sit down with Amber and your ex; the three of you need to have a frank conversation about this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFidgeting with my keys, I said, \u201cEasier said than done; neither of them really likes being in the same room with each other.  My ex thinks Amber is being too controlling, while Amber...well, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeadmistress Devereaux and I spoke for a few more minutes until I figured it was time to leave.  As I got up from the bench, she said, \u201cI\u2019m guessing this probably won\u2019t be the last time I see you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo ma\u2019am, I\u2019ll be back to speak with the rest of Chloe\u2019s friends, plus two persons of interest.\u201d Reaching out my hand, I said, <br>\r\n\u201cThank you for taking the time to check on me; your students are lucky to have someone like you looking out for them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Detective.\u201d Shaking my hand, Headmistress Devereaux said, \u201cI hope you\u2019re able to find answers to your questions; both with the case and your personal life.\u201d</span></div></div>",

They couldn\u2019t believe anyone would kill her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over my notes, Jamie said, \u201cWhat about this Darcy girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI did a search while you were in the bathroom; the only offenses on her record were some minor shoplifting charges from a few years ago.\u201d Glancing at Jamie, I said, \u201cBesides, I really don\u2019t think she\u2019d kill Chloe solely because she stole her boyfriend.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking from experience, I can tell you that girls can become irrational when it becomes to relationships.\u201d Blushing, Jamie said, \u201cYou remember how jealous I got when I saw you hanging out with that girl in 10th grade?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a chuckle, I said, \u201cHow could I forget?

As he reached for the dipstick, Jamie took one look at it before turning to me, \u201cGeez Andy, when was the last time you added any oil to the car?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking to myself for a moment, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s been a while; guess I\u2019ve just had a lot on my mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComing around to the driver\u2019s side, Jamie reached inside and opened the trunk, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go get us some sandwiches or something, I\u2019ll put some oil in the car and check the rest of the fluids.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a line of people waiting to make their orders at the Subway inside the building, so by the time I got back outside Jamie was all finished with the car.  The two of us walked over to a bench and sat down.  Looking at him, I said, \u201cThanks for helping with the car, man; I still know next to nothing about general car maintenance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, I know.\u201d Chuckling as he took a bite of his grinder, Jamie said, \u201cThere aren\u2019t many guys who ask their girlfriends for help when their car won\u2019t start; on the way to Homecoming, I might add.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI groaned, \u201cYou\u2019re never going to let me live that down, are you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou had me looking inside the hood of your car, while I was wearing a $400 dress.\u201d Grinning, Jamie said, \u201cYou\u2019re just lucky I didn\u2019t get it dirty.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell like I said back then, I appreciate the help.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of us ate in silence for a while, until Jamie looked at me and said, \u201cSo when are you going to tell me what\u2019s on your mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Jamie, I said, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve known you for close to 15 years, Andy; I know when something\u2019s bothering you.\u201d Placing the sandwich on the bench between us, Jamie said, \u201cSo what\u2019s on your mind?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing there was no way out of this, I said, \u201cWith everything going on with my Dad and Amber lately, it feels like my life is spinning out of control.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cMy mom tries her best to help, but you\u2019re the only one who really seems willing to let me live my life how I want to.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie had a peculiar look on his face as he looked at me, \u201cI can\u2019t say as I blame you; your dad\u2019s been controlling pretty much every aspect of your life since I\u2019ve known you.  And Amber, well she\u2019s just being a controlling bitch.\u201d  Sighing, he said, \u201cIf you ask me; what you need to do is change something significant about your life.  Only once you\u2019ve done that will you be happy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny you say that, because the Headmistress said something similar to me.\u201d Looking up at the sky, I said, \u201cShe explained to me how a lot of her students didn\u2019t discover who they really were until they arrived at that school.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing a hand on my shoulder, Jamie said, \u201cI\u2019m here for you, Andy; if you ever need support or a shoulder to cry on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks Jamie.\u201d Grabbing the rest of my sandwich, I said, \u201cWhat do you say we get going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a plan to me; I\u2019ve got dinner plans with Jessica tonight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy phone beeped as we walked back to the car; as I took it from my pocket, I saw it was a text from the station.  Catching up to Jamie, I said, \u201cHannah just did a preliminary search for information on those possible suspects; the girl, Darcy, has some minor shoplifting charges and the boyfriend\u2019s clean as a whistle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we got back in the car, Jamie said, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t entirely rule them out though; having her boyfriend stolen could have thrown Darcy over the edge, and what if the boyfriend discovered the truth about Chloe?  I\u2019d be pretty upset if my girlfriend turned out to be a man in his 70s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning the car on, I said, \u201cThey\u2019ll be the first ones I speak to when I go back to the school tomorrow.  After that I\u2019ll finish speaking with Chloe\u2019s friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe got to the business park a short time later.  Pulling into a parking spot, Jamie said, \u201cConsidering how hard it was to find information about these people, I doubt they\u2019ll be happy to see two detectives walk.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of the car, I said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be delicate then.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking into the building, we found the suite on the directory and took the elevator to the 5th floor. Entering the suite, I saw that it was rather spartan \u2013 only a few chairs and a table. There was a receptionist window nearby along with another door. The receptionist, a woman a few years older than us, eyed us suspiciously. \u201cCan I help you gentlemen?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re Detectives Percy and Collins with the Lakeview Police Department.\u201d Pausing, I said, \u201cWe\u2019re investigating a murder and your company was brought to our attention. We\u2019d like to speak with whoever\u2019s in charge.\u201d</span></div></div>",

I\u2019d never been one to sit around; so, when you add in the fact that we were investigating a murder, I was rather annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie had gone off to use the bathroom and I was fiddling with something on my phone when the door opened.  Looking up, I saw a man step out wearing a business suit.  Getting a good look at him, I figured he was probably only a few years older than me.  Walking up to me, he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the wait, Detective; I\u2019m Jonathan Crane, Regional Manager.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jamie re-entered the room, I said, \u201cMr. Crane, we\u2019re here on police business and you kept us waiting for almost an hour.\u201d Sighing, I continued, \u201cSome might consider that to be obstruction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry; but our clients pay handsomely for our services and expect there to be some discretion.\u201d  Gesturing towards the door, Mr. Crane said, \u201cSo when two men stop by unannounced and claim to be police officers, we have to be careful.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading towards the door, Jamie said, \u201cI assume you were simply trying to confirm we were telling the truth?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Crane silently nodded as he followed us through the door, \u201cYour Captain was rather tightlipped, so I\u2019m hoping you\u2019ll be more forthcoming about why you\u2019re here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie and I stared at each other as we followed Mr. Crane down the hall.  Once we entered a conference room the two of us sat down while Mr. Crane closed the door.  As he took a seat across from us, I said, \u201cYour company came up during a murder investigation.\u201d Pulling up photos of Chloe on my phone, I slid the phone towards Mr. Crane, \u201cThe victim was Chloe Hawkins, a 15-year-old student at Ridgeview Academy.  There was a letter addressed to her about some personal information being stolen.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie and I quickly took note of the color draining from Mr. Crane\u2019s face; so much so that Jamie said, \u201cDo you recognize her, Mr. Crane?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComposing himself, Mr. Crane slid the phone back to me, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t say that I do; as our services aren\u2019t offered to clients under the age of 18.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter casting a quick glance at me, Jamie turned to Mr. Crane and said, \u201cWhat services does your company offer?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur company designs and sells high-end forms of entertainment for our clientele; things such as virtual reality and the like.\u201d Pausing, beginning to look a little concerned, Mr. Crane continued, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll understand that our clients use our services for reasons they\u2019d prefer to be kept from the public.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie and I stared at each other again, it was becoming clear that Mr. Crane wasn\u2019t going to be forthcoming with us.  Turning my attention back to him, I said, \u201cIt\u2019s not wise to lie during a police investigation, Mr. Crane.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI assure you, Detective, I\u2019ve been nothing but truthful to you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you go again with the lying, Mr. Crane.\u201d Retrieving my phone once more, I pulled up some more information.  Handing in back to him, I said, \u201cWe have incontrovertible proof that Chloe Hawkins isn\u2019t Arthur Hawkins\u2019 granddaughter; she was Arthur Hawkins.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Still shocked, he looked at me and said, \u201cHow could you possibly know that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMr. Hawkins spent the evening in our drunk tank a few years ago; the fingerprints from that incident matched those taken from Ms. Hawkins.\u201d Gesturing to Jamie as I leaned forward, I said, \u201cPerhaps you\u2019d like to explain how a 73-year-old man turns himself in a fully-functional 15-year-old girl?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out an exasperated sigh, Mr. Crane said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid the explanation for how is out of my league, but I can explain to you the why.\u201d Leaning forward, Mr. Crane said, \u201cTo put it in the simplest terms possible; Mr. Crane was dying, and he wanted another turn on the merry-go-round.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing at me, Jamie said, \u201cI guess I can\u2019t fault someone for wanting a second chance; but why change genders to do it?\u201d taking a pause, Jamie said, \u201cIt seems to me like simply becoming young again would have been the easiest thing to do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t speak for Mr. Hawkins; but there are many people, myself included, who sometimes wonder what it would be like as the opposite gender.\u201d Pausing, Mr. Crane said, \u201cPerhaps Mr. Hawkins wanted to spend this second time around as a girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie and I listened intently for the next 20 minutes or so as Mr. Crane further explained the company\u2019s arrangement with Mr. Hawkins.  That arrangement involved creating a cover story to explain the sudden appearance of a hitherto unknown granddaughter, followed by a delicate procedure to transform him into that granddaughter.  Looking at Mr. Crane, Jamie said, \u201cSo I\u2019m guessing the plan was for Ms. Hawkins to receive her inheritance once she turned 18?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Detective Collins; upon reaching her 18th birthday, Chloe Hawkins would have been a rather wealthy young woman.\u201d Frowning, Mr. Crane said, \u201cI can\u2019t fathom why someone would want to kill her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJamie gave me a look that told me it was my turn to speak up, \u201cEven if we disregard her inheritance for the time being, there\u2019s still several other possible motives: jealously and her pending motherhood.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI watched the color drain from Mr. Crane\u2019s face once more, \u201cMs. Hawkins was pregnant?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a nod, I said, \u201cThe Medical Examiner determined that she was somewhere between 6 to 8 weeks along; we\u2019re not even certain she was aware of it.\u201d Taking a breath, I said, \u201cI went to the school earlier and spoke with her roommate, who told me Chloe had recently become involved with an older classmate.  It seems this boy\u2019s ex was the jealous type; she wasn\u2019t very happy to learn that Chloe was seeing her ex, she may have lashed out if she learned of the pregnancy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">***********************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe conversation revolved around discussing possible motives for Chloe\u2019s murder; as I was uncomfortable discussing police matters, I decided to steer the conversation in another direction.  \u201cForgive me, Mr. Crane; perhaps you can tell us the nature of this hack?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath to compose himself, Mr. Crane said, \u201cOur servers were breached just over a month ago; six of our clients had their information stolen, Ms. Hawkins being one of them.\u201d Sighing, Mr. Crane continued, \u201cWhile we didn\u2019t reveal the nature of the stolen information, we did inform the proper authorities of the breach.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning to Jamie, I said, \u201cDoes any of this make sense to you?  Someone goes through all this trouble to hack some secure servers and only steals the information on six people?\u201d taking a pause, I said, \u201cWith the nature of the information, you\u2019d think everyone\u2019s information would have been compromised.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMr. Crane spoke up before Jamie could respond, \u201cI\u2019m afraid it gets even stranger, Detective; all six individuals are students at Ridgeview Academy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say I hadn\u2019t expected that revelation would be an understatement.  Looking at Mr. Crane, I said, \u201cAre you telling me that there are five more people like Chloe attending Ridgeview?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible there could be even more than that; I was only told about the clients whose information had been compromised.\u201d <br>\r\nChecking his watch, Mr. Crane said, \u201cI have another meeting to attend; if you gentlemen want, I can have Ms. Hawkins file sent over.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasting a look towards Jamie, I said, \u201cSure, that would be appreciated; it might give us some insight into who killed her.\u201d Getting up, I said, \u201cWould it be possible for us to get the information regarding the breach as well?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t see why not; but it will have to be heavily redacted.\u201d Walking towards the door, Mr. Crane said, \u201cI understand you\u2019re just doing your jobs, but I still have to protect our client\u2019s privacy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter leading us back to the reception area, Mr. Crane said goodbye before walking away.  As we left the building, Jamie turned to me, \u201cWhat\u2019s on your mind, Andy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m just thinking about what Crane said, how there\u2019s at least five other clients attending that school.\u201d Getting into the car, I continued, \u201cIt boggles the mind that some of the students I saw could actually be older than us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at his phone as he climbed into the car, Jamie said, \u201cWe\u2019ll leave that for tomorrow; our shift will be over by time we get back to the station.\u201d</span></div></div>",

That revelation came as a surprise to me, as I was certain I\u2019d plugged it into the charger before we left Ovid.  <i>Crap</i>, I thought to myself, <i>Amber\u2019s going to kill me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce I\u2019d made sure that the charger was plugged in, I drove out of the parking lot certain that I was going to get an earful when I got home.

Amber must\u2019ve seen me pulling into the parking lot, because I founder her angrily glaring at me the moment I stepped through the door.  I barely had a chance to acknowledge the fact she was wearing a fancy dress before she started yelling at me, \u201cWhere the hell have you been, Andrew?  <br>\r\nYou know you\u2019re supposed to let me know where you are every hour.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Geez, I bet the students at Ridgeview don\u2019t have to deal with rules like this.</i> Closing the door so the neighbors wouldn\u2019t hear the argument, I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Amber; my phone died, and I guess I forgot to charge it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh please, do you really expect me to believe that?\u201d crossing her arms, Amber exclaimed, \u201cYou were probably off screwing around with that partner of yours, weren\u2019t you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was getting fed up with Amber\u2019s constant insinuations that there was something going on between me and Jamie.  \u201cHow many times do I have to say this before you finally believe me?  There is nothing sexual going on between me and Jamie.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cIf there were, that would involve a pretty drastic change in lifestyle for me; and we certainly wouldn\u2019t be dating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease; it\u2019s not a stretch to think that you two aren\u2019t doing anything, I mean you slept with him how many times during High School?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was before either of us realized who Jamie really was; our physical relationship stopped almost immediately after he came out.\u201d Attempting to change the subject, I said, \u201cIf you\u2019re done throwing baseless accusations at me, perhaps you can explain why you\u2019re dressed like that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d know if you bothered to check your phone; your parents invited us to dinner, and I told them we\u2019d be there.\u201d Gesturing towards the bedroom, Amber said, \u201cI left some clothes on the bed for you; shower and get dressed, we\u2019re meeting them in 45 minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great</i>, I thought to myself as I walked into the bedroom, <i>not only do I have to contend with an angry girlfriend; now I\u2019m forced to deal with my controlling father.</i></span></div></div>",

It got to the point where, in the heat of the moment, I said something I shouldn\u2019t have.  \u201cI can\u2019t believe how hypocritical you\u2019re being, Amber.\u201d Looking at her, I continued, \u201cIt\u2019s not okay for me to work with my ex, but it\u2019s okay for you to have lunch with yours?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at me with a glare in her eyes, Amber said, \u201cThat\u2019s completely different; we were just meeting to catch up.

By the way, she doesn\u2019t get upset about him working with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat silenced Amber for the rest of the drive; something I was immensely thankful for.  As we arrived at the restaurant, I caught sight of my parents waiting outside the entrance.  As I parked the car, Amber turned to me and said, \u201cI\u2019d rather we didn\u2019t argue in front of your parents.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting out of the car, my voice dripping with sarcasm, I said, \u201cHeaven forbid they hear us arguing; it\u2019s not like they don\u2019t already know Jamie is a hot topic for you.\u201d Sighing, I said, \u201cI hate to break it to you; but neither of them understands why you\u2019re so hung up on this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to catch up to me, Amber said, \u201cI doubt that very much; your fathers told me several times that he thinks Jamie is more of a man then you are.\u201d  Glaring at me, she continued, \u201cThat must be a blow to your manhood; knowing your father thinks your ex is more masculine then you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI chose to ignore that comment; not because I didn\u2019t believe it, but because I didn\u2019t want to have a public fight with my girlfriend.  After greeting my parents, the four of us went inside and got seated in the main dining room.  Once our drinks orders had been taken, my Dad looked at me and said, \u201cSo Andrew, I understand you\u2019re working a particularly interesting case?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn\u2019t surprised to learn Dad had heard of the case; he still had friends in the Department who were likely keeping tabs on me.  I could only hope that he didn\u2019t know the shocking truth about Chloe.  \u201cYeah; this teenage girl was found stabbed multiple times in Lakeview Park.  The autopsy showed she was probably less than 2 months pregnant at time of death.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you have any suspects?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hated talking shop with Dad; because he\u2019d always try to but in and give me some advice.  Sometimes his advice was helpful, like when I was investigating what I thought was a murder-suicide a few months back; but he didn\u2019t know all the facts this time around.  \u201cI went up to the victim\u2019s school; her roommate told me about two possible suspects \u2013 the boyfriend, and potential father, as well as the boyfriend\u2019s ex.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat conversation went up for a little while, until Dad said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard good things about your work, Andrew; there\u2019s even rumors of you getting a promotion soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Great,</i> I thought, <i>a promotion in a career that I didn\u2019t want in the first place.</i>  Our drinks had arrived at that point, so I took a sip of my Coke and turned to face my Dad, \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking, Dad; perhaps I\u2019ll take some time off after this case is finished, to rethink my career choices.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that, Andrew; you\u2019ve got a bright future where you are.\u201d Sighing, Dad said, \u201cYou\u2019re a detective, and you\u2019ll stay that way until you\u2019re promoted even further.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought back to the kids at Ridgeview; how they were able to make decisions on their own without parental guidance.  In that moment, I wanted nothing more than to have that ability.  \u201cBut Dad...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo buts, son; you\u2019ve got yourself a fine career helping the people of this town.\u201d Sighing, Dad said, \u201cI refuse to let any son of my waste his life in something like finance.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could hear the derision in Dad\u2019s tone as he mentioned finance.  Finances was something I had an innate knack for; in High School, thanks to some good investments, I was the only one in my class who had enough money to buy the Xbox One the day it came out.  Looking at Dad, I said, \u201cI get that you\u2019re trying to help me, Dad; but this is my life.  Only I should decide what I want to do with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than wait for the argument that I knew was coming, I got up and walked out of the restaurant \u2013 leaving my parents and Amber staring after me as I left.  I barely made it to my car before I heard footsteps behind me; turning around I was relieved to see that it was my Mom.  Catching up to me, she said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t do this, Andrew; your father is simply trying to help you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo he\u2019s not, Mom; he\u2019s just being a controlling ass.\u201d Unlocking my car door, I said, \u201cHe pushed me into being a detective simply so he could relive his glory days before he got shot.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI knew from the look on her face that Mom knew I was right; as Dad was controlling of her as well.  \u201cWhere are you going, Andrew?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs my phone started ringing, I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, Mom; I just need to clear my head.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter hugging Mom, I got in the car and drove out of the parking lot; ignoring the dozens of angry texts I was receiving from Amber.  Sitting at the intersection, I figured I could grab some things from the apartment before Amber got home; after that I could get a hotel room or spend the night at Jamie\u2019s.</span></div></div>",
