Eric and Jake, your two friends in high school, have been coming over but you've grown pretty tired of them always hanging around your house.  Sometimes you aren't even sure why you associate with them.   Unlike the two of them, you are known by all your teachers and throughout the adults in the neighborhood as a polite, good looking, and clean cut guy.  You are reserved at the best of times and know exactly how to get on the good side of the authority figures you meet.  You are also calm and slow to anger, the only person ever truly getting on your nerves being your neighbor's kid Mike.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis afternoon, you are hanging out with your two friends Jake and Eric.  As you exit the backdoor of your house to meet them, a strange red glint catches your eye from the yard.  \"Hey,\" you state.  \"What is that..?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not sure,\" Jake replies.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go look,\" Eric adds.  You all drop your garbage bags and do exactly that.  </span></div></div>",

Curiously you kneel down and reach your hand toward it.  In the instant you touch its cool surface, a light evenlopes your entire field of vision and an unfamiliar but rather exciting stretching sensation overtakes you.  When the light fades, the world around you ceases to be the world around you.  Instead, it appears to be a world beneath you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill crouched onto the ground, you peer down at the surface of the flat landscape below.  Buildings and cars are scattered about you.  Around your legs are familiar structures that you recognize from your town!  Your two sneakered feet are smothering entire houses!  Amazing... that crystal has increased your size dramatically and you now are huddled over your own comparably miniature sized town.  You scan the earth below you and try to find your own house.  You spot it immediately.  It's centered in between your own two feet, which are placed on top of the neighboring two blocks.  The house is no bigger than two or three inches in height to you.  In your yard are your two friends, Eric and Jake, cowering in awe and terror at the sight of your crouched figure extending into the vastness of the sky from their point of view.  Realizing that you have just made eye contact, Jake immediately makes a break for it.  He darts out of your yard and hops the fence.  Not quite ready to let him go, you carefully follow him with two of your fingers and pick his little body up as he runs, amused at how he kicks the air.  \"Where do you think you're going?\" you tease.  Jake continues wriggling in your grasp.  You bring your arm over to your house again and set him down in your yard next to a stunned Eric.  \"This is a pretty cool view, though\" you continue.  \"I can see the whole town from up here.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou unfold your legs and stand up to your full height, keeping your feet in place.  At your height, the world truly looks tiny to you.  Nothing comes even close to reaching your enormity.  The talling buildings in the center of the town probably could only go as high as your knees.  Normal houses don't even reach as high as your ankles.  Curiously, you look down squarely at the ground beneath you again and tilt your right foot on its side, to see what this size increase has meant for the people around you.  Under your foot is the crumbled, flattened foundation of two houses.  You raise your calf into the air and prop your foot against your knee, and look down at the treads of your sneaker.  Stuck to the bottom like ants are two smashed figures of people, your next door neighbors.  One of them was an old woman you knew as a child.  The other is so crushed that they are unrecognizable.  You lower your foot back down on the lifeless wreckage of the houses.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou debate in your mind where to go from here.  You very well can't stay rooted in one place forever.  But you also know what moving about means.  But would that be wrong?  At this size, should you even care?</span></div></div>",

No one can stop you from doing anything you want to the little bug-sized people below you!  It's time to stop with this polite boy charade and show your real nature.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a pompous smile spread across your face, you lift one of your massive feet into the air.  Enjoying every instant of this, you slowly take care to place it far above the cowering figures of Jake and Eric in your backyard.   The two of them freeze there, underneath the shadow of your vast sneaker.You keep your knee bent, relishing the fear that your huge body alone is causing for your two tiny friends and the ease at which you can snuff out their lives as though they were bugs to you.  Finally, and swiftly, you bring the thing down and flatten them both beneath your crushing weight.  You lean forward, and pivot your foot from left to right, smothering a couple of other nearby households.  After a second or two, you lift your foot up and slide it to the right, smirking silently at the rather liquidy mess that you left behind.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you feel invigorated, knowing you can step on anything and anybody whenever you feel like.  You never imagined killing and destruction would be so much fun!  You become increasingly  convinced of your own magnificence, as you ponder the almost absolute power you have obtained.</span></div></div>",

You felt a strange sensation come over you and watched confused as your body absorbed the crystal, in that moment you new just how to punish your slaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou began laughing, it boomed for hundreds of km's as the crowd who defied you were lifted into the air glowing like fireflies.

You slowly bring her to your mouth and opened it wide, giving her a perfect view of your cavernous throat saliva dripped from your teeth \"Kyle stop, please don't eat me, Kyle stop, no stop, stop\" her cries fall on deaf ears. She screamed and thrashed as you slowly lowered her helpless body into your mouth.

You feel your body converting the mortals you absorbed into power and you began to grow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n You grew larger and larger, swelled higher and higher with every passing moment and you laughed. The world below shook as your shadow covered more and more ground below it \"Yes, yes bigger, bigger\" you roared \"Fuck I'm so gorgeous, so sexy\" you ran your hands over your colossal form and groaned as you played with your nipples. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Your growth finally comes to a halt at a mile tall.

Want to come?\" you ask Jake and Eric.  The two of them nod.

Straddling the entire block, you carefully walk down the road, crushing several parked cars.  A few cars turn into the roads from the side but at the sight of your giant body, they quickly turn around.  You continue on this path until you reach a pretty remote area in the woods, where the road stops.  No longer having to worry about houses, you walk casually over the landscape, crunching trees as you go. You realize that from here, a mountain range isn't too far away.  It might be cool visiting it.  </span></div></div>",

The mountains themselves are about as tall as yourself, with a steep enough slope that you can grab a hold of the peak with a fist without having to step onto the mountain itself to reach over.  You bring your hand to your ear and scoop Eric and Jake from it and are about to sit your two little friends on a ledge of the mountain in front of your face when, as you bring your arm over, you hear a buzzing behind your head.  You turn around and see a helicopter floating in front of your two eyes, no bigger than a bee.  Suddenly some guy starts talking through a megaphone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you are: put down the two kids, or we will open fire,\" some man's voice states.  The helicopter is obviously a police chopper, come to stop you.  You find yourself amused by the notion that the police sent only this one little helicopter at you.  You're huge enough that whatever shots it fires would be almost almost microscopic.   You take your free hand and swat at the helicopter playfully as though you would a fly, purposefully missing it but scaring the pilots enough so that they back away.  After a couple swipes of your hand, the helicopter darts away... and regroups with about a dozen more that you find have been waiting right at your waistline.  You look down and find yourself even more shocked by the fleet of police cars that have parked themselves at various points in the woods at your feet.  Little men are barricaded behind them, rifles pointed directly up at you.  It would be easy enough to stomp one foot on the whole barricade: car, man, and all.  You pocket Jake and Eric and begin to raise one foot into the air in order to scare the little guys into retreating  back into their cars and leaving.  The second you do so, the helicopters all at once let forth a hail of gunfire.  At first the shots they fire are blocked by the fabric of your shirt, but you are surprised when they start tearing a small hole through it.  You bring down the back of your hand to block the hole so they can't fire into your belly.  The instant you do so, the fleet of helicopters rise in altitude and fire at your face.  Immediately you feel the pain of a thousand little needles piercing the liquidy film of your right eye.  You react wildly, flailing your arms in all directions in order to smash the helicopters who, in your opinion, launched the first attack.  You keep your eyes shut,  feeling several helicopters being flung by your movements.  You open your eyes for a brief second and survey the ground below and find a grouped up barricade of three cars parked adjacent to each other, the little men shooting from behind the doors.  You use this opportunity to raise you foot into the air once more and mercilessly bring it down on top of the three cars, crushing them and their occupants utterly.  You find the best way to deal with this is by covering your face with your arms and just stamping your feet randomly in circles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n It doesn't take long before things get quiet.  You open your eyes and survey the ground below... looking with amazement at the dozen sheet-flat pieces of metal cars that you've stepped on.  The rest of the cars have retreated, as have those irritating choppers.  You touch bring your hand to your eye and realize that you are bleeding from it, though you can still see.  Already you're beginning to think being a giant isn't as fun as it seems.  You need to make plans to leave this area before reinforcements strike, so you grab a hold of the mountain with a hand and swing your body sideways over it, coming down with a crashing force on the untouched landscape on the other side.  You begin to sprint.</span></div></div>",

My yard; my jewel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab the crystal back from Jake and make to run off with it. In a flash the other two are on top of you, wrestling playfully, trying to snatch it from you. Caught in the middle of the struggle, the crystal gets squeezed between three sets of hands and a red glow suddenly expands to surround all of you. You feel a burst of heat, and some kind of energy seems to course through your entire body: it's intense enough to make you black out for a couple of seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you open your eyes a moment later, you are lying on the ground with a pounding headache. You're vaguely aware of your friends lying close by: obviously the same phenomenon affected all of you. You rub your eyes and look around - and then the reality of the situation sets in...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You get to your feet, looking all about you.  You feel like you're in some prehistoric jungle.  It's hot, humid, and the ground beneath you is muddy.  Long green stems arise from the mud on all sides, looming over the three of you like ants.  You know what they are by looking at them: grassblades.  Not far from you is the crystal, now a towering red obelisk in the midst of this oversized jungle.  \"This is bad,\" you state.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake and Eric don't have any inclination to disagree.  The three of you huddle back to back, looking at these threatening surroundings with both awe and fear.  Suddenly Jake turns: \"We have to get big again.  The red crystal there did this to us... maybe it can turn us back.\"  Eric nods, and the three of you sprint toward the red crystal.  You grab hold of the side and look up.  It must be two or three times as tall as you.  You try banging on it with your fists.  \"Nothing's happening,\" you say.  Suddenly you hear a loud, wet, squishing noise in the distance, as though something large just landed in the muddy ground a hundred meters away.  Then, as you hear another, everything becomes dark.  You look up to the sky in dread.  Looming over you like some kind of colossus is a giant kid: Mike.  Mike is your next door neighbor, an annoying jerk around your age, maybe a year younger.  You've wanted to pound him for years... but suddenly that idea seems unwise.  Mike is staring down at your location, looking at the ground quizzically.  Without any hesitation, Eric shouts \"RUN!\" and he dashes off into the blades.  You watch him bound off, noticing that he is disrupting the grass blades as he dashes through them.  You look up again at Mike... who has apparently noticed the disturbance in the grass.  He leans over and plunges his hand down into the grass in the direction that Eric has run off in.  He fumbles around for a second and triumphantly raises his hand into the air.  In the distance, you see Eric flying in his grip, kicking and screaming and looking like some little speck in the air that Mike has nabbed.  Mike rises to his full height and grins at Eric: \"Man... youre puny,\" he jeers.  You watch him quickly pocket Eric and examine the ground again, realizing that you and Jake must be here as well.  The two of you split up and run in opposite directions.  You keep running... and running... and running.  Then you hear a \"GOTCHA!\" in the distance, realizing that Jake has just been caught.  You heave and heave, running as fast as you can go.  You see that your porch is not too far away, over the distant grassblades.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick up your pace... and suddenly feel a great pressure land across your back.  You are pushed with an unstoppable force face flat to the muddy ground by something huge.  You feel like your body is in a vice.  Everything is dark and silent and you struggle to breathe.   You realize what has just happened:  you've just been stepped on by Mike.  Then, suddenly, you are pulled into the air with tremendous force, high, high up into the air.  You look to either side of you and see huge pieces of mud falling to the floor from the rubber tread around you.  Suddenly you are lunged forward and Mike takes his next step.  You stay as still as possible, praying that you don't fall off to your doom.   Finally his foot comes crashing down into the mud again and you are plunged into darkness once more.  When his foot lifts, you are quite nicely wedged inside the treads of his mud-caked sneaker.  Feeling a little more safe, you simply lie still and wait.  Eventually you are enveloped by so much mud that you can no longer see outside.  The ordeal is less traumatic now.  After a minute or two of listening to the muffled sounds of Mike's footfalls, no longer having any idea where he is headed, you suddenly are loosened from this entrenchment of mud as a thud takes place.  You bring your arms to your face and quickly start digging away at the mud around your head, then down at your legs.  You see in front of you a hardwood floor. Clearly you are inside of a room of some sort... probably Mike's room.  You don't see Mike, though.  Apparently he dropped his two muddy sneakers onto the floor and went elsewhere.  Having no interest in remaining for another ride on the bottom of the Mike's feet, you jump down from the treads and distance yourself from them.  Lying on its side, the sneaker is several times your height and it extends dozens of meters in either direction.  Caked along its treads is a huge muddy mess, filled with giant grass blades and vicious looking insects that Mike mindlessly flattened on his way through the grassy jungle.  You aren't sure where to go.  In all directions, everything just appears like some giant colored blur to you.  You walk around the giant sneaker and hoping that maybe Jake, perhaps having been stepped on as well, is nearby.  You reach the opening of Mike's sneaker, retch at the mild odor emanating from inside, and give up.    You're going to have to simply venture in one direction or wait here.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Wandering around this vast hard wooden floor would be unwise, you think.  You know that Mike has a dog and you don't want to be licked up or worse.  You gaze around at your surroundings.  Not more than a hundred meters away is the foot of Mike's bed, the messy blankets draping all the way to the floor.  You ponder a few moments: climbing up that blanket to the top of Mike's bed seems like a good idea.  It isn't too far away.  There are a lot of dangers to being exposed here on the floor, and bringing yourself to higher ground would eliminate any chance of being stepped on.  You jog toward the foot of the bed.  \"Wooh,\" you say in exhaustion as you pace yourself.  This is *much* farther than you had thought.  You have been running at least one hundred meters and it feels like you are only halfway there.  You overestimated just how much ground you can cover at this tiny size.  Finally after what feels like a half a mile, you reach the foot of the bed.  You lean your neck back, observing how the height of this bed extends hundreds of feet into the air.  Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you hear a pounding sound and the wooden floor shakes with each impact. You turn around and standing in the doorway is a giant-sized Mike, dressed in khaki shorts, a collar shirt.  You see that he is holding what looks like a razor blade.  He doesn't see you, thankfully...but then he starts lumbering toward you.  You cringe at the sight of his gigantic body when one of his socked feet steps clean right over you and he kneels down at the side of the bed, on the other side of you just a few hundred meters away.  \"Heheh,\" you hear him snigger as he examines something that it appears he placed on his bed earlier.  Obviously, it is either Jake or Eric.  Your curiosity is now unsatiable, so you quickly grab a hold of the threads of the blanket and begin climbing up Mike's bed to see what state Jake and Eric are in from afar. You make sure to climb up the corner on the side out of Mike's field of vision, finding it remarkably easy to grab a hold of the thick threads of the blanket's fabric.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just how are you going to get out of this?\" you hear Mike tease to whatever victim he has trapped on the surface of his bed.  You climb sideways a little toward the corner again, and see Mike toying with the razor blade in his hand.  Just what does he plan on doing with that?  Your continue your ascent more rapidly, concerned about the fate of your friends.  You are three quarters of the way up when you can make out the distant and muffled sound of someone struggling.  \"Uh oh, my hand slipped!\" you hear Mike's now-thunderous voice state jokingly.  \"Looks like you might never please a girl now... not with that maimed little stump!  Not that it wasn't already small to begin with...hahahah.\"  You are aghast at what you are hearing.  From what it sounds like, the innuendo is that Mike is driving the razor through someones penis, slicing it smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach the top of the bed at last, but there are several folds of mountainous fabric that is obstructing your vision, the folds of Mike's scrunched up blankets near the foot of his bed.  You hear a muffled scream again.  The desperate yet suppressed sound is almost inhuman.  You scurry over the folds and at the top of the last one, you look down across the vast expanse of the length of Mike's bed.  You can see Mike, of course, his head leaning over the side of the bed, his short yet thick brown hair framing his expressive face as he looks down below with boyish glee.  Beneath his looming visage is a large text book and on the surface of the book, a couple strips of transparent tape pressing down a tiny Jake, one stretching right over his head and muffling his face, the other holding down his legs to the book.  Only a bloodied beyond repair crotch is exposed and untaped.  Clearly Mike has been physically torturing Jake.  You knew he was a punk, but you never realized that Mike himself would act as such a heartless bully, given the opportunity.  You had pictured Mike would trap you guys for a little while, tease you, show off whatever imagined sense of magnificence he had of his size over you, but you wouldn't have thought Mike would have gone to THIS extreme. You know you never would engage in torture or killing, if you had discovered some tiny people.  Who would want to be so monstrous?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know now that you can't risk being captured by Mike, or you might suffer a worse fate than Jake's sliced off penis.  You begin to turn back the way you came.. and then hear a stern \"Wait.\" A shiver goes down your spine as you turn around, desperately afraid that Mike has seen you.  \"I'll be back soon.  Don't go anywhere!\" you hear Mike tease to Jake.  Mike stands up, rising to his full height of about 6' tall, the same as you.  He lumbers out of the room, perhaps going to retrieve some other instrument of torture.  You realize now you can get off this bed safely... but part of you is compelled to try and rescue Jake.  He may be maimed, but he is surely still alive.  Your mind is made up as soon as you even begin thinking about it. You hop down the hill of blankets and sprint towards the text book.  It isn't long before you have climbed up its edge and see blood pooling around Jake's taped up body.  You stand right over him: there is nothing left of his bloodied crotch, and the entire site looks rather gruesome.  Still, you can see Jake's face -- and his eyes -- searching at you from under the tape adhered over his head.  He can't say anything... but you can tell what he wants.  You're never going to be able to peel this tape off of him: it's wider than your entire body and it is held fast to the surface of the book.  So you think that maybe it is best that you perform the only act you can do for your suffering friend.    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You get to your  knees and slip your hands under the edge of the tape onto Jake's neck and grudgingly squeeze, looking away.  You can feel Jake's body start to quiver as you nearly finish this task... until you are suddenly lifted into the air from behind..!  You can feel the back of your shirt being pulled as you are raised and spun around... directly in front of Mike's face.  This isn't good: he must have seen your tiny form on his bed from the doorway and tip-toed into the room.   Mike grins as you, \"I saw you shrink in the grass with the others, but I couldn't find you.  How did you get it into my room with the pathetic size you are at?\" Mike's booming, curious voice is practically deafening.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was walked in,\" you shout sarcastically at Mike's enormous visage, wondering if he is smart enough to get the hint.  You then dart your head toward Mike's mud-caked pair of sneakers sitting on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike looks down to see where you are looking.  \"I see.  Say, did you meet those ants I stepped on this morning?  I think some of their little bodies are still gunked up on the bottom, heheh.\" You say nothing, realizing from his gloating laugh that Mike  relishes the idea of you being comparable to one of the tiny bugs that he's stepped on.  \"Oh come on, you aren't being fun.  Jake wasn't being fun either.  Now he is missing an important part of his anatomy.  You don't want to end up the same, do you?\"  You look down at Jake, roused and still alive because you weren't able to finish putting him out of his misery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want, you punk?\" you boldly ask, not quite having shaken your superiority complex over Mike, despite being so small in size and being hung by the back of your shirt somewhat like a fly by its wings.  To tell the truth, Mike has never been a weakling even though he is a year younger.  He's above average height, yet lean and strong. You continue, \"And where is Eric?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric?  Eric was loads of fun!  Let me show you!\"  Mike lowers his arm and crudely plops you down on the surface of the text book again, right next to Jake's taped body.  Suddenly Mike reaches into one of his pockets... and pulls something out in his fist. Mike moves his arm toward you and hovers his fist right on top of you, and for a moment you think he's about to slam you beneath it.  Instead, he unfurls his fingers and reveals a white figurine in the shape of a human.  Mike lowers the life-sized statue with its head pinched gently between his large thumb and forefinger.  He brings it right down at your side and it amazingly, the clay-like figure stands upright.  You circle toward the front of this white statue and realize that this figurine isn't actually a mere figurine.  This is an effigy of Eric, made of some freshly dried plaster.  The mold fits his stocky physique perfectly.  Just the right proportions, just the right bulges where his clothes would be, fitting the contour of his shoes and shorts.   The fresh smell of the plaster is strong.  When you put your hand on the statue's surface to tilt it, its resistance and weight suddenly indicates to you that this statue is not hollow.  Clearly, Mike has dipped Eric in some cheap plaster and allowed him to dry, literally burying him alive!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric?!\" you shout at the figurine.  You hear nothing.  Suddenly you look up at Mike in outrage.  \"He's in there, isn't he?  What's the matter with you?  Live and let live, you animal!\" you shout in hopelessness at the callous giant looming over you with a cruel grimace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pipe down, pipsqueak.  You know I can crush you like a bug if I want.  Besides, I don't think he is dead.\"  Your head darts toward the statue again.  You shout at it one more time and then put your head against the surface of the figurine's rough, flaky face.  Inside you can hear a faint muffled moan... he's alive!  Suddenly you are of a mind to knock the statue over on its side to perhaps free Eric.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let us go, Mike.  You've already gone way too far with what you've done to Jake.  Now will you let Eric out?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Mike draws his arm back over to you and grasps the figurine in his palm.  He looks down at it for a few seconds, Eric's stiff, encapsulated body sitting helpelessly in his palm.  \"Nah.\" He smiles and pockets the Eric-statue once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what <i> will</i>  you do\" you ask, dreading both the answer or no answer at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll show you what I'm <i>first</i> going to do,\" he states cryptically.  Suddenly Mike extends his enormous arm back over you once more, his fingers extended outward.  Then, all but his forefinger are flexed inward.  He lowers his long fingertip slowly and for a second you think he is going to press you beneath it -- as it is surely large enough to do so.  Instead, he brings it down over Jake's mutilated body, only two meters or so away from where you are standing.  The bottom of Mike's fingertip presses down over Jake's immobile torso.  You watch in terror and Jake is compressed alive beneath the fleshy appendage.  Beneath the tape you can hear the most inhuman yet still muffled wail conceivable, as Mike continues to apply slow pressure.  Suddenly, the wailing ends with an abrupt squeal as Mike rapidly and completely puts the weight of his hand behind his fingertip, squishing what is left of Jake's body utterly and taking his life.  Mike lifts his finger from the bloody mess, taking it with it Jake's severed and almost completely formless upper half from the under the tape.  You watch with anger as Mike inspects his finger with an amused, gloating expression on his face, before he flicks his finger against his thumb to expel the remains off into the air.  Mike looks toward you again and smirks.</span></div></div>",

The roller coaster like movements make you ready to vomit.  Then without any further ado, you are lowered down toward one of Mike's feet.  He lifts back the edge of his right ankle-high sock to reveal the fleshy side of his long, lean foot.  You are lowered even further down, right in the crevice between the wall of the sock and the heel of his enormous foot.  \"I hope you don't mind it down there.  Don't worry: this is the one with less foot fungus, hahahah.  But just so you know, I haven't changed these socks for a few days!\"  Mike's playful teasing angers you, but before you can even respond he releases his grip on you, withdraws his hand, and lets the elastic rim of the sock snap back toward his ankle bone.  Your body is pressed tightly face-first against the side of Mike's moist heel; his foot odor is thick and fresh -- moreso because of his active lifestyle as a member of the track team.  The compression of his tight sock is suffocating you, so you slide to your left beneath the fabric.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can imagine Mike watching with sadistic approval as he observes a tiny little bump under his sock scaling the length of his foot toward his toes.  As you progress, you realize that Mike wasn't kidding about his foot fungus. You reach his sweaty big toe and nearly puke at the sight of the cheese-like white substance underneath in the crevice between the toe and the ball of his foot.  You can feel Mike shifting his body around as he leans back on his bed; you are nearly thrown off the side and underneath his vertical foot entirely when he lays on his back with his toes now pointed upward toward the ceiling.  You adjust by climbing on the dorsal side of his toe, around the nailbed, and in between that one and his second big toe.  The humidity inside his sock is almost unbearable.  Every breath you take in is hot and hoarse, almost like a sauna.  You thought your senses had adapated to the smell of his feet until you ventured in between his giant-sized toes, twice as tall as yourself. You have no choice though, except to find reprieve on the surface between them as Mike naps in his bed and decides it's time to remove you. You hope he just doesn't forget you exist when he arises from his slumber and then stands up with you squashed like a bug under his sole. Not that you think it will go that much better for you if he does  get around to taking you out.  </span></div></div>",

Slowly, you peel open your eyelids, not realising that you are no longer lying on the soft grassy backyard but instead of standing up. As soon as it had overwhelmed you, the nausea leaves you, and your senses come alive. A number of factors bombard you as you gaze out, free from your pensive slumber:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. You are standing in what appears to be a city, but at a much smaller scale. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. You're standing. In a city. Full of tiny cars, tiny buildings, tiny roads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3 Holy shit, you're a giant <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll these stimuli send your mind racing. You crane your head downwards, to look upon the erratic movements of what look like...people! They scurry around your runners, no doubt bewildered at the obtrusive rubber-soled monoliths. Your feet are planted in some sort of park, in the apparent centre of this little city.You don't appear to have killed any of the little critters yet, but they undoubtedly have been affected greatly by your sudden appearance. You can see people abandon their crashed vehicles, entire swathes of frantic townsfolk, making their way through the narrow roads like little ants. The image makes you laugh a little, and you feel at ease with your new surroundings. Beside your feet lies the crystal, probably the instrument that delivered you to this strange new world. Interestingly, neither Jake nor Eric appear to have been transported with you, which you consider as a bonus. No doubt you'd have to deal with their idiotic antics, instead of focusing on this possibly-alien race you've discovered. You debate your next move. Any move would invariably lead to a few casualties, you surmise, but the minute scale of these beings forbids you to interpret them as fellow humans. They may well be intelligent, but to you, they hold no more significance than ants, creatures unfortunate enough to find themselves at the feet of...a god. <br>\r\nThe thought of you as a god-like being to these things is one you savour. Secretly, you've always harboured a great enjoyment for flaunting your power over smaller, weaker things. Now you have a real chance to fulfill the role you've always dreamed about. <br>\r\n\"You guys are sooo fucked\", you announce with glee. You're not even sure if they can understand you but the heightened intensity of their desperate attempts to flee suggest they do. You grin from ear to ear.

You press down upon the tiny structure with the toe of your sneaker, feeling the brittle structure collapse effortlessly beneath the weight of your shoe.  *crunch*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Oops!\" you state sardonically.  Within seconds, a little tiny figure comes dashing toward the edge of your sneaker.  You immediately recognize it as an ant-sized Jake.  \"Well, look who it is!\"  Your foot still planted on his house, you grin as the your miniature-sized friend approaches the patterned, treaded sole of your massively huge sneaker and then starts banging with his fists on the white, grass-stained rubber wall, apparently in an attempt to get you to move your foot off his house.  You gaze down with immense amusement as he even tries to actually push your immoveable sneaker by slamming all his pathetic weight onto the side. As much as you enjoy the sight below, you think of something even more fun.  Before he can do anything, you crouch down and pinch the little teen in between your thumb and forefinger, very gently.  Then, you lift him up into the air and stand up to your full height.  You bring him directly in front of your two eyes so that you can make him out in greater detail.  You watch with a cruel smile as he struggles to free himself from your grip, trying to push your two fingers apart with his arms and legs.  You can't even feel any resistance, so huge are you.  He's so tiny that his cries sound like little squeaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any warning, you lower him down to your waist, pull open the elastic waistband of your shorts, retract the foreskin, and drop him onto the shaft of your penis.  He tumbles a little on the sweaty appendage and then stands up, realizing exactly where he is: standing like a flea on some other guy's dick!  You savor the implication of dominance and superiority.  He looks up from inside your shorts opening in utter disbelief.  Looking down, and knowing this must sound utterly disgusting to all the bug-sized people below, you speak to Jake; \"don't worry, I have a new home for you!\"  Using one finger to gently pin him down upon your penis, you use your other hand to pull the foreskin back up until it covers your other finger, leaving Jake trapped underneath, pressed down against the sticky surface by an equally stick layer of flesh.  You can already feel him struggle to move, and the tickling causes some very arousing sensations.  You let your waistband slip back and then look back down at the ground.  All around you are terrified potential victims, horrified by what you have just done.  Not that you care!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you get to your feet - rather shakily after your recent experience - you hear laughter. Standing at the yard entrance is Mike, the annoying kid from next door. He must have heard the commotion and come to investigate, and is now cracking up, pointing and jeering at you and the still-woozy Jake and Eric, who remain sprawled on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout a year younger than you are, Mike and you have hated each other for years. The only reason you've not bullied him into submission long ago is that your parents and his are such good friends. If you took any overt action against Mike you'd never hear the end of it - and he knows it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he continues to make fun of you a surge of anger and frustration builds up inside and you *glare* at him. You feel another pulse of energy running through your body - similar to the one you felt before -  and then, to your intense shock, the brat suddenly seems to vanish! You walk over to the spot where he was standing and see a tiny figure, no bigger than an ant, hopping around. You reach down and pinch the little thing between your thumb and forefinger and lift it up. It seems impossible to believe, but it's actually Mike, kicking and screaming in fear!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWow! Did you actually do this? There doesn't seem to be any other explanation for what just happened. You decide to investigate further so you carelessly shove Mike into the pocket of your shorts for the time being and see if you can recreate the effect. There's  a plastic chair nearby so you concentrate on it and try to make it shrink. After a few false starts you somehow hit on the right state of mind and the chair is reduced to a tiny model on the ground. Neat!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext you turn your attention to a nearby tree: a slightly tougher proposition as its roots are deeply embedded in the soil. This time it only takes two attempts: you're learning fast.  A moment later the entire tree has been reduced to the size of a piece of broccoli, lying in the middle of a churned up piece of ground where the roots were. Excellent! If you can isolate and shrink a tree like that you might even be able to reduce houses or other buildings to mere toys! Perhaps even larger objects might be possible... You snap the once-mighty trunk like a matchstick and toss it carelessly away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the bags of trash you dropped earlier, you test your power once more. You pick one and shrink it, and then manage to grow it back to its original size. Evidently you can change the size of any object you want to any size you please! You shrink the rest of the trash to 1cm in size and hold it all in your palm - it's pretty easy to deal with now. Then you focus on them again and reduce the formerly heavy bags to barely-visible specks, which you casually blow on, sending them drifting away to vanish on the breeze...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou return to your friends and explain what you can do, taking Mike out of your pocket to show them as proof. They are delighted with your tiny captive and soon discover they have exactly the same abilities as you! Basically everything and everyone in the world is now potentially at your mercy, and it's a pretty nice feeling. The three of you decide to make the most of your powers and explore what limits (if any) they have.</span></div></div>",

Your mailbox disappears into grass below it, as well as your neighbors hedges, and their dog too.  With each object shrunken, the three of you laugh hysterically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the sidewalk a kid on a tricycle comes pedalling toward you.  The three of you move to the sides, grinning at each other, watching the kid as he thinks he will casually ride by.  The instant he pedals between you, the three of you all hit him with your power at once.  The kid and his tricycle vanish, and you look down at the sidewalk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, found him!\" Eric exclaims.  He steps forward, lurching over something and looking down at it with a cruel jeer.  In between his two feet is the little boy still on his tricycle, the size of a gnat, crying.  Trapped in between Eric's two sneakers, the kid is terrified of the huge teenager smiling down at him like a giant out of the sky.  Eric begins to lift one of his feet into the air and hovers it over the kid, its shadow enveloping his little figure entirely.  Immediately, and before Eric can do anything, Jake yells \"hey!\" and the kid grows back to his normal size... right under Eric's foot.  His growing form pushes Eric's foot back and causes him to tumble backward.  You can't help but be amused at the sight of the two matching their powers, as the kid pedals away from his tormenters like crazy.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrushing himself off, Eric says \"I wasn't gonna stomp the kid really, I was just scaring him.\"  You don't quite believe that, knowing how quick Eric is to crush any insect or fly that becomes bothersome to his immediate presence.  Bored with their conversation, you look toward the road and get an idea.  The road that your house is on is notorious for its speeders.  The police don't patrol here on account of quiet this neighborhood is, so you decide it would be prudent to take matters into your own hands -- literally.  Since the police don't ticket speeders here, you think it would be prudent to punish speeders yourself -- all while having some extra fun with this new power.  You walk into road and wait by the side, casually watching the normal-speed cars glide by.  For a few minutes you do this, altering little things here and there.  You grow some old woman by an entire foot, and shrink some macho looking guy by another foot.  Finally you here a \"vroom\" in the distance, someone accelerating as they turn a corner. You look down the road and see an open roof convertable sports car coming down the lane as fast as can be.  He closes in, getting louder and louder, as you stand at the side of the road.  Patiently you wait... and wait... and wait... until you dart out into the middle of the road as he is a mere 20 yards away.  The driver puts on his brakes and his tires screech, the momentum of his car bringing him right toward you still, and then you turn on your power as he comes a scant few yards from hitting you!  The sports car almost vanishes, leaving a visible trail of dust in the air... but you never lose sight of it.  You look down at the ground and see the little open roof convertable car, perhaps an inch in length sliding on the smooth black pavement as it crashes its front end right under the toe of your right sneaker, where it lifts off the ground slightly.  You feel it make a little tap on your foot.  You stand there looking down at your foot, unwavering and unmoving.  After a few seconds, the man who is driving the vehicle -- clearly the trendy type, wearing shades and a collar t-shirt -- opens the door of his little sports car and backs away from your looming sneaker, looking up at the sight of you and shaking uncontrollably.  You give him the most pompous look of triumph as you can, before leaning down and opening your palm over him and clasping him inside.  You lift him into the air with that hand, and move your foot side and pick his expensive little car up with your other hand.  You rise to your full height and put your two hands out in front of you together, opening your palms so that the man can cross between your cupped hands to see his car in the other.  As he begins to move toward his car, you close your fingers around the car in your other hand and make a loose fist.  Immediately the man begins waving a \"No\" signal as he shifts his two open handed arms in front of him.  Snickering, you tighten your first and hear an audible *crunch* as the little car in your other first is flattened.  The guy puts his two hands over his head in grief, as you slowly open your palm and look down admirably at the utterly crushed car in your hand.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pocket the little guy into the same pocket that holds Mike, wondering how he's enjoying his trip inside your shorts right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With Jake and Eric playing around with their powers, you decide to crush this little annoyance into submission.  You squeeze your two fingers together slightly, your mouth hanging open in excitement as Mike's inhuman cries begin to ring out.  After you feel his ribs on the verge of cracking, you decide to let go.  Then you  take hold of him by the legs and dangle him upside down.  You use your finger to pry the top of your shorts away from your waist and drop him in the tangled brown web of your pubic hair, watching him fall through the thick hairs and onto the top of your penis.  \"Hope you can stay on!\" you shout, as you let the top of your shorts snap back, leaving your little captive in the darkness.  You begin to walk toward Eric and Jake, occasionally sensing Mike pulling on some of your crotch hairs, no doubt struggling to stay attached.  Falling out the leg of your shorts down toward your trampling feet would be a much worse fate, he must suppose.  </span></div></div>",

Jake's first oncoming car is shrunken to the around half the size of his own shoe.  It comes reeling forward in between his legs until he proudly stops it with his heel, as he would a soccer ball.  He calls you over and you stand alongside of him, the both of you looking down into the windshield of the remote-control sized car that Jake is resting his foot on.  The two passengers, a man and his wife who you recognize from down the street, are leaning forward and looking up at you through the glass like you were a couple of giant mutant aliens.  \"Boo!\" you shout and the two of them flinch back in their seats, terrified.  Jake then puts more pressure on the roof the car, causing it to cave in slightly as he gets ready to send it backward.  Finally he kicks his foot off and sends the little car back with as much momentum as he can give it.  It goes pretty smoothly and steadily down the street... until Eric intercepts its trajectory.  He comes stomping from the side and the second the car passes him, he raises his knee into the air and brings his foot crashing down onto the vehicle from behind.  The whole of the car is crunched under his sneaker, the people no doubt squashed flat.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do that for?\" Jake yells.  \"You've killed them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's fun?\" Eric replies, choosing words he knows are like to cause an argument.  </span></div></div>",

You blink several times to try and rid yourself of the aura that has annoyingly persisted following the initial flash.  Then, suddenly, you hear a thundering boom-like sound and the ground shakes violently.  \"Run for cover!\" Jake shouts, \"it's an earthquake!\"  The three of you quickly dart through the grass and to your backyard porch.  The shaking stops abruptly, as you hide on the deck, then begins again just as intensely as before.  You quickly grab onto the porch railing to steady yourself before you are knocked over again.  Your two friends also grab onto whatever supports they can find.  After three or four more of these occurrences, you hear one of the most terrifyingly loud voices speak from overheard.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Whoa... look at this, guys.  This is incredible</b>.\"  The thunderous bass in this voice is so potent that you can feel your chest practically vibrate, each word pounding on you as if this voice was amplified by those loud boom-boom speakers you would hear in a busy nightclub.  You look at Eric and Jake in shock and see from their vacant expressions that they are just as puzzled and, you admit, likely as frightened as you.  The voice resonates so intensely that you can almost hear it all around you, as if God was speaking down to you through a huge megaphone.  Then, another seemingly celestial voice accompanies the prior one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Look -- there are cars down there!  And buildings, and tiny little people!</b>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listen, motionless, to the conversation, when a third voice joins in.\"<b>They look like ants from up here... man, we're giant!</b>\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA series of rhythmic thunderous crushing sounds takes place and sends the ground shaking again, one of the quakes sounding as though it just occurred very close to you.  \"<b>Whoops!</b>\" you hear overhead. In the distance you can hear ambulance sirens.  Finally your curiosity overtakes your hesitation and you slowly creep out from under the porch and into your backyard, leaving Eric and Jake where they remain.  You see nothing in front of you, then, scanning the area, you turn around to face the porch you were hiding under and witness the impossible.  Standing over your porch, indeed, over your house, and all the other houses in the the neighborhood and more than likely the city too, an massively huge human figure is presiding.  He must be hundreds, probably a thousand meters tall or more.  At this size you can't even tell.  What you <i>can </i>tell is that you need to stretch your neck as far back as you possibly can to get a glimpse of the titan's face, which is still partially obscured by the brightness of the sun overhead.  Strikingly, he has the features and the voice and even style of clothing belonging to a mid to late teenager -- and he appears to be looking down at his feet in wonder.  He must be standing one or two streets over from your house, but at his size you can't tell for certain.  Without taking your eyes off of him, you silently motion to Eric and Jake to come over and join you so that they can witness this giant and, you hope, reinforce the hope that you have not gone completely insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA nearby voice in the sky can then be heard. \"<b>Whoops?  What do you mean whoops?  You just stepped on a bunch of them!</b>\"  The voice sounds as if it belongs to another teenager.  Another enormous giant then strides into sight and stands next to the first teenager, each footstep causing the earth to shake and you to almost lose your balance and fall onto the grass.  A third voice then chimes in, and says, in a playful tone \"<b>Yeah, careful!</b>\"  There appear to be three of these beings, you quickly discern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant you have been staring at this entire time, who has been looking at the ground, then speaks, \"<b>I didn't meant to step on them.. I was just shuffling my feet.</b>\"  His expression changes from an expression of innocent wonder to, then, a wry, ever-so-slight smile.  \"<b>But they <i>are</i> really tiny.. heheh.  Can't really help where I step</b>.\" He continues to scan the ground curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, you can hardly comprehend the reality of the situation.  Your town has been visited by giants!  You are overwhelmed by both amazement and fear.  You have no idea what these visitors' plans are nor their origin.  Part of you wants to dart back under the porch out of pure instinct.  But at this time your curiosity is just as intense as your fear.   Who -- or what -- are these guys?!   You look up and down at the first giant who is still just idly scanning the ground with interest.  He's wearing a navy blue polo shirt and then regular shorts.  He props his foot up up in the air and against his knee to inspect the sole of a white sneaker he is wearing.  Indeed, nothing about his clothing seems out of the ordinary for someone his age -- except for the blatantly obvious fact that no factory or clothing company on this planet makes clothing big enough to fit someone of his size or shoes, in, if there were such a scale, probably size 10,000 or greater.  As well, the logo on the side of the sneaker and on the shirt is nothing you've ever seen before.  The patterns on the logos looks just like any other one you might find on a popular clothing brand you would find anywhere, but they aren't ones you recognize at all.  Indeed, apart from their size, despite how ordinary these teenagers, their dress, mannerisms, and speech are, they still seem alien to you in some way, as if they are from some other world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant's thunderous voice resonates.  \"<b>Look -- their little vehicles are stuck in my shoe!</b>\"  He playfully points to the rubber sole belonging to the vast running shoe he has tilted up into the air.  From this distance you barely make out a smattering of colored vehicles that have indeed been pressed deep into the maze-like walls of his patterned rubber tread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your amazement, his massive buddy leans over and lets out an indifferent chuckle.  \"<b>Hah, I feel bad for whoever is still inside of those cars!</b>\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Yeah..</b>\" his friend replies, then shrugs.  \"<b>Well, too late to do anything about them now.  Ah well..</b>\"  Diverting his somewhat disappointed gaze away, he casually lowers his sneaker back down, the ground shaking once more as he plants his foot back down on the ground firmly.  You can't help but wonder who or what else was just crushed by this casual act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>So what do we do now?</b>\"  The giant's statement hung in the air several moments.  He curiously scans the ground again, waiting for a reply, and before you can even react, narrows his gaze in your direction, squinting down at your backyard.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

After all, you could become one of these giant's pets if necessary. So after choosing to stay, you need to take refugee. You couldn't risk it in the park, as there were people thousands of meters tall and probably countless amounts of wildlife that could harm you. You saw a building across the street and walked towards it. As there was probably gigantic bugs and animals in the grass, you stayed on the sidewalk. You figured that if a human came by you would be able to easily hear them by the vibrations from their footsteps. The building across the street that you were walking towards had a banner hanging from it. The writing was impossible for you to read, as it was in a language not known to Earth. Thankfully the street was blocked as a few men were doing repairs on a pipeline a long stretch away, and thus there were no cars. However, as you were about to cross the street, you felt an earthquake amount of force. You look behind you, and a boy in his late teens was running towards you. Inspired with fear, you ran to hide behind the curb. The teenager leaps off the sidewalk onto the street in a sprint and goes into the building. He was wearing shorts, a t-shirt, a backpack, and running sneakers. Then you realized what the building you approached was: a college lecture hall. \"That explains the banner,\" you thought. You ran up the ramp to the building and then saw how lucky you were; that college student left the door open and you could just walk right in. And you did exactly that<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving gotten into the building, your decided to walk around for a bit. It was truly humbling to see such a massive structure. Seeing a room with an open door, you decide to walk in. \"Nobody was going to notice a microscopic person walk into a room,\" you thought. The room you entered was filled with scientific equipment, from telescopes to beakers to magnifying glasses to googles to computers. The room was also filled with projects. You peered onto a few of the projects. You saw chemicals, a few contraptions, and an interesting remote. To your surprise, the remote was inscribed with the illegible native language and also English. Oh how euphoric it felt to see writing in your native tongue. You read the remote. At the top, it said \"Inter-dimension size transformer\". One button read \"shrink to scale\" while the other read \"grow to scale\". Pointing the remote at yourself, you press the \"grow to scale\" button. Suddenly you shot up thousands of meters, now being the height at which is natural is this giant world. Smirking, you held the remote. It was now at a size that you could hold. \"Perfect,\" you thought. \"I can now go back home.\" But first you realized that there were still the Giants roaming around your world. They need to be disposed of, and you were the only one that could do it. However, you couldn't just walk around your world in the clothes that you currently were in. People would notice you're one of the them, and hold you accountable for anything that went wrong. So you next plan was to get some clothes from this new world. You head out of the door in your new size, sticking the remote in your pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was refreshing to be a natural size. It made your ego larger. You were 6'2\" on Earth, despite being only in high school. You had massive size 14 shoes. Thus, instead of being microscopic, you were larger than the rest of the world. You see a building that looks like a department store. It would have been a trek at your former size, but now it was only a brisk three minute walk. As you walk in, you head over to the men's department. But as you look around and see the cash register, you realize that you could pay for the clothes. You didn't want to steal, but knew your world depended on you. So you picked out some clothes. You found a t-shirt with a logo that was native to this world, but I recognizable to your foreign eye. You also got some shorts and picked out some white crew cut athletic socks. You also found some white briefs. Then came the shoes. You found some shoes that were practically converses, with the exception that the writing was different. It took you a while to find your size, as the numerical system in this world made no sense. However, you finally did find one that would fit your feet. It was the standard black and white type of converse. You then headed to the changing room. After locking the door, you shrunk each article of clothing you had gathered. Then, you shrunk yourself. Taking off each of the tags from the native clothing, you then regrow yourself. You picked up the microscopic clothing, then placed it carefully in your pocket. Then, you headed outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you got outside, you walked over the the tree where the crystal was. While you were small, the walk to the building was a massive venture. Now, peering from your lofty perch of growth, you see it should have taken only a few seconds. As you reached the tree with the crystal, you made sure no people, animals, or insects were around. There was one ant close by, but that was all. You crushed the ant just for protection. Then took the clothing out of your pocket and placed it on the ground. You used to remote to shrink yourself. Once you got down to the microscopic size, you changed into your new clothing. Nobody was going to see you naked anyway, so you didn't care. After changing, you placed your old clothes on the ground and used the remote to grow. You place the remote and your old clothes in your pocket and then grab the red crystal to teleport back to your world. After a blinding white light, you open your eyes to see a devastated world. Footprints are scattered all over the ground. Buildings are in ruins. You decide to then:</span></div></div>",

However, you look by your feet and see Eric and Jake by your house, which was still standing. Feeling bad from their small size, you carefully pick them up. You wanted to guarantee that they were safe, so you placed them into your pocket. Then, you scanned the horizon. You found the giant teens. They were stomping on the city that your house was a suburb of. Thankfully, the giant teens hadn't seen you yet, so you went over to their direction. Wishing to not cause anymore destruction, you walked in their footsteps. However, these teens had much smaller feet than you, so causing damage was unavoidable. You attempted to save as many lives as possible, but this ended up with a few of your fellow citizens at the bottom of your converses. Once you got within striking distance of two the giant teens, you hit the \"shrink to scale\" button on the remote twice and aimed one shot at each of them. Both of the giant teens immediately shrunk down to the height natural on Earth. You ran over and picked them. Having both of them in your hand, you drop them into your pocket with Eric and Jake. Now the third teen sees you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Whoa!\"</b> He said.<b> \"What happened to my friends and who are you?!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing, that now was your chance, you ran up to him. The area where you ran was untouched, but that didn't matter to you. You aim the remote, and hit \"Shrink to scale\". But a red light goes off on the remote, and the flashing words \"Recharging appear\". So you realized that you needed to knock the kid down before he got the remote and shrunk you. He had brown hair and was wearing athletic clothing. He was also short. His friends were probably about 5'8\", but he was 5'6\". You had an 8\" advantage on him. You were also more fit, as you were on the track and lacrosse team at school. And, as an added bonus, you were probably more intimidating; your dark brown hair was spiked up in the front. Both you and the giant foreign teen ran to each other. You throw a punch to his jaw. He recoils, but then runs and tackles you. Both of the land on the ground. However, you quickly get up. Both you and him were rolling around in areas that hadn't been crushed yet, but now this brawl happened. He also gets up, but you get him into a headlock. The teen was stuck under your armpit, and you hadn't showered in a few days, even though it was summer. \"The kid deserves it,\" you thought. Then you pulled out the remote. The light had gone off. You stepped back, aimed the remote at him, and pressed \"shrink to scale\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third teen finally shrank down. You pick him up, and drop him into your pocket. Then you looked around. The entire area was destroyed. You figured it was best to leave your converses where they were, as you could probably cause less destruction. You unlaced them, took them off, and inspected the soles. Inside of the waffle pattern bottom were countless cars, buildings, and people stuck to your shoe. It depressed you to see that, but then you looked about and saw how much of the world you saved. So you left the converses in the rubble of the city. \"I guess they can use these gigantic shoes for something,\" you thought. Then you walked back to the crystal. You stepped very gently to avoid hurting anyone. As you return back, you fished your pocket for Eric and Jake. Then, you placed them down on the ground. You grabbed the crystal, saw the white flash, and returned back. There, you shrunk your self down and changed into your old clothes. As you looked at what to do with the remote, you saw that there was a switch on the bottom that read \"Remote Size\". You flipped the switch, and the remote suddenly shrank down to your size. Having everything, you returned back to your home world. You decided to keep the former giant teens in your pocket for a punishment later on.</span></div></div>",

At the end, you saw them the minute red teenagers you had in your pocket. Eric and Jake questioned what you would do with them, but you hadn't decided. You knew they were frightened, but you also knew that they deserved to be punished. After all, they just killed a countless amount of lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you returned to your room, you took the microscopic teens out of your pocket. \"Not so much fun now when you're the victim, is it?\" You said aggressively. One of the teens then bowed to you. The rest followed suit. \"All of you know how to get into this world,\" you said. \"So I feel compelled to not set you free. You all also just murdered an immense amount of people, and would have destroyed my world had I not stopped you. So you deserve to be punished.\" And idea came to your head. They would spend their lives, however long you let them live for, in you shoes. You pulled out your normal converses that you wear everyday. Just holding them two feet away from your face you could smell the potency of your foot odor. \"Your punishment is to be confined in this make-shift prison.\" You said. Having the microscopic teens on your desk, you then bring down your converses next to them. They were filled with anxiety, which was amusing to you as you had just been inspired with fear as their shoes touched ground. You dropped them into the shoe, and then placed them on.</span></div></div>",

Later on, they reported you to the investigation as the savior. Quickly, your story was found out, and you became a national hero. The government freed you from all liabilities for damages causes, gave you $12,000,000 for your work, and confiscated the red crystal and remote for national security. You did not, however, tell the truth of the fate of the formerly gigantic teens. You told the investigation that you released them back into their home world, fearing that the government would confiscate the microscopic teens to stand trial if they knew of your own punishment. Soon, the death toll was found: 6 million people died in this attack. However, within a year most of the city had been rebuilt. A visitor center and memorial for the attack was also constructed in the middle of the city. Attached to the visitor center was a massive wear house containing the gigantic converses you wore during the attack. The converses were the main permanent exhibit at the visitors center. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the day the center opened, you traveled to the museum of the attack. Inside, there was a map of all the dame done to the city. It research was done to see whose shoes caused the most damage. Thankfully, yours were the least by a long shot, but the amount of ground you covered was impressive. Inside the visitors center was also rubble for crushed buildings, photographs, and videos of the attack. One of the videos was taken by a man almost crushed by your shoe while you were brawling with the third giant. You looked impressive, so magnificent with sweat dripping down your face. But you also looked like death, with just one step ending priceless lives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you visited the converses. Because the toe lifts up from the floor, the visitor center is able to show people the front underside of the shoe during tours. People could walk right under where your toe was. The right shoe was up in the correct position, but the left shoe was on it's side to show how much debris the shoe picked up. All bodies in the soles of the shoe were taken out and buried, but at close inspection one could see blood all of the bottom. The tour also took visitors inside the right converse. An elevator takes people up, over the lip, and down into the caverns of the shoe. Then, visitors are given a tour of all the impacts your feet made in the shoe. Although you were wearing it for only a short people of time, the amount of sweat you released into the shoe was enormous. Visitors dealt with an intense scent of your sweat as they toured the caverns of your shoe. Despite the smell, the tour of the converses is one of the highest rated parts of the visitor center. When you visited, it was incredible to see the inside of your shoe. You were even wearing converse shoes as your toured the visitors center, with the three Microsoft teens still in your shoe. \"If the smell of the gigantic converses that I haven't worn in a year is this bad, I can only imagine how horrible it is for those tiny teens.\" You thought, putting a smirk on your face as a deserving punishment after all the destruction documented in the museum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, an aide informed you of an event for the one year anniversary of the tragedy, which was:</span></div></div>",

Debris that was sent into the air by your\u2019s and the giant teen\u2019s steps was still floating in the air. Fires were ravaging the landscape, and columns of water were shooting into the air thanks to the destroyed fire hydrants. And the ground was completely flat, only marked by the signature of giant tress. The only structure that remained standing for a radius of a few hundred feet was your house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, Eric and Jake we\u2019re still around. Wanting safety from the air quality, you three head into your home, chatting about what happened in your living room. The two of them admired your work in saving the world as you told them about your endeavors both in the giant world and in as a giant. Eventually both of them decided to try to go see if they could find any remaining structures of your home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce alone, you turn on the TV to try to relax. However, the channel that first flashes on is the news, displaying your huge visage causing destruction. The cameraman\u2019s perspective from the ground was radically different from that of your\u2019s perched like a skyscraper. During combat, you had failed to see that you stepped on your country\u2019s government buildings while your were fighting that one giant. But the news footage shows clearly the normally massive office building collapsing under the weight of your much larger converses. The perspective then shifts to your face, where it looks like you\u2019re smirking. Then it is announced that there will be a $1,000,000 reward for your capture. The news coverage then shifts to a news briefing of military officials. Apparently the entirety of the executive cabinet was meeting in that one office building you crushed, having a special retreat from the capital. Without leadership of the government, the military announced that they would establish a junta to take over the country. Their first order of business was to capture the perpetrators, in particular, you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShutting off the TV, you run up into your room, stuffing a backpack with your things. But then you hear your door being knocked down and shouting from what seemed to be either police or the military. Putting on your backpack, checking for your phone and captives in your pocket, and slipping on your Adidas NMD running sneakers, you then use the remote to shrink yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly the room enlarged around you. You shrink the remote with you, grab it, and run into the closet and look for a place to hide. There wasn\u2019t much on the floor, save for your shoes. You decide to make a dash for your boots, climbing up the lace to hide between the laces and the tongue. Even starting outside the miasma of your boots was overwhelming. Then you hear multiple footsteps running  up your stairs. The booms are louder until a young soldier appears in your vision. He must be only a few years older than you, and seems to be fairly tall (which is only amplified by his giant nature). Looking in your closet with a flashlight, Je determines you aren\u2019t in there, and then leaves. It takes only about five minutes to hear one of the soldiers report on a walkie-talkie. \u201cThe suspect is not on the premises. However, we have found the portal. It is a red crystal in the backyard. Touching it will transport a person to a giant world.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out your phone, you open your texts. Then, realizing that the military junta must be monitoring all communications, you open WhatsApp and text Jake. \u201cDude, they\u2019re looking for me and trying to blame it on me. Can I hide with you?\u201d You shoot off another message. \u201cAlready shrunk\u201d Within two minutes Jakes responds \u201cYeah. Get out of the house and text me where to meet you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were able to slip out of the house and make it through your yard. The military had already set aside your entire property with caution tape, but there was only a few guards in the front yard. Seems like most of the action was with the crystal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou made it off your premises, but was would normally be a simple task took over an hour. Eventually, far enough from the soldiers, you stopped at the stop sign at the end of your street. You texted Jake to pick you up there. Within five minutes, your buddy came jogging around. He was wearing his running gear. It seemed completely normal, excerpt you noticed on his quickly approaching sneakers that one of his shoes was untied. \u201cStrange,\u201d you muttered, \u201cJake never has untied shoes.\u201d As he approached the stop sign, you could hear from what seemed like a voice from the heavens \u201cOh no, my shoes are tied.\u201d Jake them stopped and grabbed the stop sign. He looked around for you as he deliberately seemed to be catching his breath. You waived your arms trying to catch his attention. Then his eye caught you, giving you a wink. His face was dripping with sweat, glistening in the sun. He then lifted up his untied shoe and dropped it right next to where you stood. His sneaker, which was clearly used more than it should, had many small holes from wear that Jakes was probably oblivious to. The smell of it was also rank and filled your nostrils, causing you much discomfort. Jake then kneeled down and reached for his shoe laces as you grabbed onto them. As his hand covered you, you let go and his palm brought you into his pocket. While he was trying his shoes, a solider yelled at him to leave the area. Getting up, Jake ran back home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Jake got home, he took you out and place him on his desk. You looked up ready to thank him, but then you heard...</span></div></div>",

This was successful in severing the connection to the giant universe, but in the moments that the crystal was destroyed it created a vacuum between the universes. The result of destroying the crystal meant that the surroundings between the crystal in the two worlds were swapped. For your world, this meant your house, a few tanks, and many soldiers were sucked up into the crystal and sent a world were they would be the size of ants. But for the giant\u2019s world, the crystal was surrounded by the nearby university\u2019s men\u2019s track team, who were doing their post-practice stretch. Most of the team was suddenly drawn into the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soldiers who were thrown into the giants world found themselves on the giant sidewalk. Looking around, they saw blades of grass that towered over them. Then, behind them, were giant booms from footsteps. The soldiers then looked in shock as they saw the few remaining track team members trying to figure out where their teammates went. \u201cWHERE DID THEY GO?\u201d One of them boomed. Another began walking towards them \u201cDID THEY RUN OFF,\u201d he asked his friends. The voices of the giants were so loud that the soldiers had to cover their ears. Some of them crouched down in their anxiety. But as their sense overwhelmed them, they weren\u2019t able to pay attention to the giant approaching them. The sight of the soldiers and tanks caught his eye, but the giant didn\u2019t recognize them as people. \u201cMAN THERE\u2019S ALWAYS THESE NASTY BUGS IN THIS PARK\u201d The soldiers then gazed in awe as a muscular, hairy leg lifted up a running shoe covered foot. Their vision was then filled with the sole as the shoe came cratering down. That one college giant had ended the lives of 126 soldiers with just one step, remaining completely oblivious as he searched for his missing teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour world was again thrown in shock as new giants appeared on the horizon. Except for this time, there were 20 giants. Each of them were college students, either in their late teens or early twenties. They all wore smilier running outfits, sporting the same blue colored t-shirt and shorts. The only difference was their socks and their running sneakers. Once again, the clothing logos were all foreign. However, what caught your eye was that at least five of the guys were wearing a sneaker that looked a great deal like your own Adidas NMDs, even though it had a different logo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWHOA\u201d one of the giants said. \u201cGUYS, I THINL WE\u2019RE IN SOME TINY WORLD.\u201d The giants again began moving about, causing even more destruction to a world who thought it had been spared. This time though, people couldn\u2019t keep up. The twenty giants spread out further from the area that had already been destroyed, crushing seemingly everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing the danger, Jake withdrew from the window. \u201cHEEEYYY,\u201d he said with fear in his voice. \u201cCAN YOU MAKE US A GIANT???\u201d You pull out your remote. \u201cYes, but first let me return to normal size, otherwise you might be too big relative to me\u201d As you use the remote on yourself, it happens that</span></div></div>",

He doesn't appear to notice you -- in contrast to him you are surely no bigger than a termite.  However, that provides you no guarantee of safety.  This fact is made evident when the giant, curiously looking down at your house, slowly lifts his foot into the air, (even this motion causing the ground to shift slightly) and deliberately hovers it high above the roof of your house.  A cool shadow envelops your entire backyard and several nearby houses as the blue sky is partially blotted out by the edge of the teenager's monstrous foot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!!!\" you shout.  Panicking, you frantically wave both of your arms back and forth in the air over your head to try and get this giant's attention, praying he will see you and realize that he is about to crush not only your house, but you and your friends like bugs. For a moment the colossal teen, expressionless, looks down, his foot still in the air.  Then, he squints his eyes slightly.  He sees you..!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Hey.. look at this little guy waving up at me.</b>\"  Miraculously, he inches his foot back and brings it down just short of your own house, instead flattening a wooded area next to your house.  Jake and Eric are now standing next to you in the yard, having fled from under the porch when they saw the giant was about to \"test\" how tough your house was with his foot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Hehe, I was a second away from squashing you like a bug, little guy.  You're lucky I noticed you guys.</b>  The giant teen's playful remark is followed by him crouching down to the ground, like a researcher examining an insect colony.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shout out to the teen's looming visage above you: \"We're not bugs!\"  The giant, appearing not to hear you or even notice that you're speaking, lifts his arm and extends it forward and down into your direction, no doubt intending to pick you up and examine you.  Not willing to be handled by the teen, you quickly duck in the grass.  \"RUN!\" you hear Eric shout as he quickly darts backward and sprints in the opposite direction.   Having tightly shut your eyes out of fear, you are surprised when you hear him exclaim \"NOOOO!!\"  Then, his voice trails off as if he was becoming farther away.  You open your eyes and find Jake in the grass next to you.  \"He's got Eric!\"  Jake's exclamation is confirmed when you look back toward the crouching teenager who indeed has Eric pinched between two fingers and is dangling his flailing little form in front of his face, his eyes wide and mouth ajar from awe and wonder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Man.. I can't believe how puny these people are compared to us.  We really are giants here.  This is so cool.\"</b>  Still crouching, he unceremoniously dangles Eric slightly from side to side.   You wish you could do something for Eric, but what could you possibly do?  You're impossibly outsized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the other giant teens strides over and looks down over his friend's shoulder.  \"<b>Yeah, we're giants all right.  And do you know what giants do for fun</b>?\"  His question hangs in the air for a moment before his friend responds.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Having lost his attention on you in order to focus on Eric, you resolve to get the titan's attention while, overhead, the teens converse about how seemingly amazed they are by their current circumstances.  You begin by shouting up to him.  \"Hey, that's my friend.  Let him go!  You can't just do whatever you want with us!  We're human beings!\"  It's no use; the teen's head is hundreds, if not thousands of meters overhead.  He's having a conversation in the sky while you're shouting up from the dirt.  You'd have better luck trying to converse with someone in an airplane.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling daring, and alarmed at the possibility that the giants are going to leave with Eric, you leave your backyard and dash into the street, directly in front of the giant's two feet and continue shouting upward.  On either side of you are planted the giant's aircraft-carrier sized sneakers.  Surrounding them are fissures in the road, the hard surface being no match for his immense weight.  You run toward the inner side of his left foot, up by the toe section, reach the white, rubber foam wall that forms the side of the tread.  The side of the synthetic monstrosity is rife with huge grass stains, as if he was just running in a field.  The chemical-like smell of the rubber is quite potent at this scale.  Desperately, you begin to bang your hands on the foam wall, hoping that you can be forceful enough to catch the massive giant's attention; you just pray he doesn't accidentally shuffle his foot while you do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Looks like you have a little fan down by your feet, buddy.  Or, maybe a little worshipper?  Haha.</b>\"   You look up to see that the thunderous voice belongs to one of the giant's friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Huh?</b>\" The giant whose sneaker you were hitting now stares directly down at you and to your terror, frowns sternly.  Clearly you weren't strong enough to get his attention on your own.  You can't imagine that he would feel your miniscule pounding on the (to you) thick, synthetic, foam wall of his shoe as anything but a slight tingle to be ignored. \"<b>Man, they're just like ants.</b>  His contemptuous statement hangs in the air and then, to your surprise, the giant's frown loosens and he simply looks forward into the distance.  \"<b>Hey! Let's go to that city area.  Look at all those buildings there!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Haha, yea!</b>\" His nearby friend replies.  \"<b>Man, over there we'd be like three Godzillas walking through!</b>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any further ado, the titanic teen above who was mere moments from stepping on you, begins to advance forward.  However, not before you discreetly grab a hold of the end of a stray white shoelace that swung by.  The girth of the lace alone is so thick that you can't even wrap both your arms around it.  You now go for the ride of your life, clinging to the shoelace belonging to the sneaker worn by a massively giant-sized teenager, hoping you can maybe rescue Eric.</span></div></div>",

You become dizzy from this motion, and then, for an instant, come to a near stop in mid-air, as the teenager suddenly begins to bring his foot down to complete a single step forward.  Immediately your stomach turns as you begin free-falling downward now, the momentum from the shoelace reversing in the opposite direction as the teenager's sneaker descends.  You never imagined that the simple act of walking could be so dramatic.  You're in such a state of alarm that the entire sequence seems to be happening in slow motion.  The teenager's foot alone is scores taller than the highest roller coaster you ever heard of.  Bear-hugging the fabric of the shoelace as tight as you can, lest you risk falling to your death, you look downward as the ground below zooms into sight as the shoelace follows the sneaker plummeting downward upon what looks like a quiet residential neighborhood.  The giant, teenaged visitor doesn't appear to exhibit any notable regard to where (or on what) he treads. He may not be purposefully causing massive destruction, but, at his size, you begin to doubt that he views a few city blocks crushed under his feet as a cause worthy of significant concern.  In fact, you doubt if he is even looking at the ground as he plows forward.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact his sneaker makes on the neighborhood below is cataclysmic, to say the least.  The thunderous impact sends the ground shaking and the sound of metal and stone being demolished sounds for miles.  At least a dozen houses are crunched flat in an instant.  Momentarily the shaking stops, and you tighten your cling on the shoelace which is now dangling alongside the bright, colored athletic logo on the outside wall of the battleship sized sneaker.  You stare in awe at this massive edifice of  consumer materialism belonging to this giant, otherwise ordinary teenager until he lifts his foot again, from heel to toe, to take another destructive step forward.  The rhythmic motions continue for several steps in this way until, you hear overhead, one of the teenager's walking alongside state \"<b>Look!  There are skyscrapers over here!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid who's foot you have hitched a ride on then stops abruptly once it has been planted firmly on the ground.  Meanwhile, his shoelace still swings upward carrying you with it! \"Oh no!\" you shout in a futile objection.  You pray the lace doesn't crash either the ground or the teenager's shoe and send you flying.  But instead, because of the abrupt cessation of his walking, the worn, faded lace swings upward and then backward.. bringing you down into a path toward the narrow opening between the giant teen's sneaker and his sock!  The lace hits the tongue violently and you fall helplessly into the darkness, stuck between the teen's foot and his massive athletic footwear.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Fearing that you will be suffocated by the dense fabric of the sock or simply squashed by the movement of the teen as he walks, you realize now that this daring rescue may prove to be a fatal error.  Not noticing that he is carrying with him a much tinier passenger, the teenager continues lumbering forward.  Staring up at the sky, you watch as the clouds shift as the teenager takes a single, large step foward.  He plants his foot, the impact causing you to be squeezed tightly.  A second later, you can feel through his sock the muscles of his ankle shift as he prepares to lift the foot once more, and insodoing, a gap arises under you and the pressure you were feeling, on one side from his foot, and on the other the wall of his sneaker, is suddenly released. \"Ahhhh, much better\" you resound. Unfortunately, this reprieve is followed only by worse circumstances.  \"Uh oh.. NOOOOOO!!\"  The widened space causes gravity to bring you further into the chasm below until you are then encapsulated in utter darkness.  Great.  You are now entirely trapped inside the massive running shoe, and suspended just underneath the inside of the teen's right ankle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to let out an exasperated sigh, until the situation worsens further.  A highly offensive odor overtakes your sense of smell and even taste.. and it doesn't take you long to figure out why.  Unfortunately, this overgrown jerk's feet stink.  The potency is made worse by the fact that at his scale, the smell is likely magnified in relation to his massive size: the larger the foot, the stronger the smell.  If he doesn't just wear these jumbo jet sized sneakers for everyday wear, which is a possibility judging by the fact that they were mildly scuffed as you observed from the outside, then you can imagine that the teen likely wears them for running competitively, which is also a possibility as they were of a type suited for this activity.  And, judging by his muscular, lean frame, he likely is of the active type -- perhaps a fitness enthusiast or just, unfortunately (in your case), a pretty active guy.  Either way, nothing changes the fact that you are now inhaling this toxic, humid, miasma.  Indeed, the smell is so potent and the air so stuffy, warm, and wet, that you can imagine all sorts of organisms are growing and thriving in this environment.. to which the titanic teen overhead is blissfully oblivious to from high in the sky.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that you need to make the best of the situation, which involves not getting squashed like a bug at this point.  Your choices are very limited, however.  You can either try to climb out yourself, although you doubt this would be safe, or somehow irritate the colossal teen in order for him to pay enough attention that he will take off his shoe, which may give you the opportunity to escape.  But, you will have to pray that you can escape without him knowing, as you are not certain that he would hesitate to crush you for annoying him.. or just as bad, leave you stuck in his shoe for fun. Climbing out yourself seems impossible now; the teenager is continuing his strides and you would almost certainly be squashed by these movements as he continues forward.  However, you have now been slowly inching further and further down, deeper into the shoe, with each of his strides.  If you can just crawl further down, you could maybe reach the teen's sensitive sole and earn his notice.  Just running this plan through your head is a debasing prospect: the fact that you're stuck inside another kid's sneaker while he's wearing it was already bad enough.  Oh well..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Whoa, look at this guys,\"  Kyle commented as he surveyed the unfamiliar surroundings.  Minutes ago he was outside in the backyard throwing a ball with his two friends.  Then, out of nowhere, his eyes were blinded by a flash of light and he was standing in a completely new environment.  The tall trees that had been surrounding him were nowhere to be seen.  The pleasant breeze that had been present all afternoon had ceased.  There wasn't a building in sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle pivoted around and saw that his friends, Ryan and Keith, appeared just as confused as he felt.  To make things even more strange, the ground upon which he stood had a brittle, crunchy-like quality as he adjusted his stance to look around.  The earth was quite flat, grassy in some areas, gravelly in others, and was patterned with linear striations that were parallel and perpendicular to one another. \"This is incredible.\"  Kyle's feelings vacillated between concern and curiosity as he focused his eyes in order to acquire more detail below him.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Look -- there are cars down there! And buildings, and tiny little people!\"  Kyle turned around and gave Ryan, who was down on one knee now, an incredulous half-smirk in response to his exclamation.  He rolled his eyes: sure, tiny people and cars.  What will Ryan think of next?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was even more surprised to hear Keith, generally a more serious type, join in. \"They look like ants from up here... man, we're giant!\"  Kyle took a couple steps toward his two friends and felt the ground crunch and flatten as he did so.  Glancing down once more, he then saw them.  He had stepped squarely on one of those little striations that separated the ground into square and rectangular sections, and noticed on both sides of his left sneaker, the accumulation of insect-like activity.  \"Whoops,\" Kyle said to himself as the tiny little insects scrambled in all directions at his feet.  He hoped he didn't cause too much damage to the nest as he watched the bustle increase and almost seemed to become somewhat organized, with a number of the little things converging closer to where he stepped.  Kyle leaned down even more and opened his jaw in surprise, stunned by what these things really were.  They <i>were</i> cars.  Ryan wasn't kidding.  Flashing little red and blue lights were teeny tiny emergency vehicles: fire trucks, police cars, ambulances slowly zipping to where his foot was positioned.  The striation he stepped on, he realized, was in fact a road for these vehicles.   All along either side of the roads were tiny boxes of all colors: buildings!  They looked like any buildings you would find in a small city, but just tiny-sized.  Suddenly Kyle felt as though he was standing on top of a model train set that might have belonged to a young child.  He never would have fathomed that such tiny people existed or that he would be such a giant compared to an alien form of life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith responded to Kyle's remark: \"Whoops? What do you mean whoops? You just stepped on a bunch of them!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was right, Kyle realized.  The road was cracked and ruined where he stood and as he tilted his foot on its side, he could see a number of the vehicles had been flattened paper-thin and pressed into the roads under the weight of his (to them) giant sneaker. \"I didn't meant to step on them.. I was just shuffling my feet.\"  He continued to look upon the panicked activity below.  \"But they are really tiny,\" he stated, followed by a quiet chuckle.   \"Can't really help where I step.\"  Kyle certainly didn't mean to crush these little guys, but avoiding any sort of damage was a little too much to ask.  Following that, he lifted his foot into the air and propped it against his other knee to further evaluate the degree of wreckage.  Wishing there was a wall or something to maintain his balance as he stood on one foot, he saw that across the patterned, creviced sole of his running shoe were trapped tiny little cars that he stepped on.  He saw also the remains of demolished buildings that were pressed into the maze-like treads, sort of like miniscule pieces of gravel.   \"Look -- their little vehicles are stuck in my shoe!\"   Kyle signaled Keith and Ryan by pointing his hand down at his shoe.  The two of them leaned in and looked down upon with playful interest.  Kyle himself couldn't help but be amused by the sight of these tiny structures and colored vehicles stuck in the grooved white treads walls.  He could even see some of the wheels of the vehicles spinning as drivers desperately tried anything to escape their rubber prison.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah, I feel bad for whoever is still inside of those cars,\" said Keith. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah..\"  Kyle did feel somewhat bad for the little guys, but there was nothing to be done about it now. What was done was done.  \"Well, too late to do anything about them now. Ah well..\"  He lowered his foot onto roughly the same location as where he stood before, trying to get past the knowledge that a number of tiny people and vehicles were still stuck to his vast sneaker like smashed bugs.  \"So what do we do now?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kyle, being a rather inquisitive sort, was fascinated by the world below.  He was astounded at how huge he was compared to the civilization here; they were no bigger than ants.  He almost began to wonder if he were dreaming.  He had to learn more.  He looked at the ground for anything of interest.  Then, he noticed that situated next to the toe of his right sneaker was one of the little box-shaped structures.  Focusing his eyes, he realized it was a tiny white house.  Nothing was particularly close to it and none of the little people appeared to be in sight so he didn't see the harm in indulging his curiosity further.  \"Wonder how tough these buildings are at this size...\" he stated to himself, not knowing if Ryan or Keith heard him.  They seemed just as preoccupied with the the newness of this scenario as he was.  Kyle lifted his right sneaker off of the ground, and hovered his foot over the patch of land where the house stood.  He sort of wanted to test how much pressure it could withstand using his foot but being smaller than his fingernail he figured it wasn't a lot.  Only one way to find out though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpressionless, Kyle about to lower his foot on the tiny structure when he saw something else.  Something down was producing movement, he spotted.  One of the little people maybe?  Still holding his foot above the tiny house, he squinted to more clearly see what he was about to step on and then realized it was a little person.  It was amazing, Kyle thought.  These people were so incredibly small, he mused.  From his great height, it was difficult but he realized that the tiny lifeform was waving its little arms back and forth, likely to get some attention.  \"Hey.. look at this little guy waving up at me,\" Kyle remarked.  Not wishing to cause the little guy any harm, he withdrew his foot and lowered back into a more grassy area.  Kyle then crouched down with his knees bent in order to further examine and communicate.  He looked down upon the tiny figure and realized it was a teenager, likely his age, who was waving up at him.  Good thing he did too, Kyle thought.  Two other tiny figures who looked like teens stood next to the first teen. \"Hehe, I was a second away from squashing you like a bug, little guy. You're lucky I noticed you guys.\"  The little guy seemed to be screaming something at him but at that size there was no way he could ever hear it.  Instead it just sounded like a series of little squeaks.  As his curiosity swelled, he instinctively reached down his arm in order to pick up one of the tiny figures for further study.  At first he tried to grab the one who was waving and screaming.  He lowered his hand hoping to gently pick him up and was surprised when the little guy ducked and could no longer be seen amongst the grass -- or trees actually.  Then the other two began to move.  Kyle quickly brought his hand down and before one could disappear into the flora, gently closed his thumb and forefinger around one of the little figures.  He successfully had both of his tiny little legs in his two-fingered grasp.  Trying to be careful as possible, he slowly raised his hand into the air and brought the little guy up to his face. The teen was hanging upside down, dangling to and fro between Kyle's fingers.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Keith and Ryan in earshot, Kyle commented aloud.  \"Man.. I can't believe how puny these people are compared to us. We really are giants here. This is so cool.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle wished he were able to get the two other little guys, he thought to himself, until he heard Ryan begin to speak. He turned his head around to hear what his friend had to say, and Ryan indeed spoke his mind.  \"Yeah, we're giants all right. And do you know what giants do for fun?\"  Kyle was unsure what Ryan was getting at.  Obviously they were huge, but what did that mean?  </span></div></div>",

Think I'll save this little guy for later.\"  Gently, Kyle used one hand to widen the pocket of his shorts and the other hand to lower his new acquaintance inside.  He gave him a friendly smile as he did so: \" \"Hope you don't mind going for a ride, little guy.\"  Perhaps he could try talking to the miniature teen and find out what these tiny people were all about at some point. His great curiosity overshadowed his concern for whether or not the little guy was as keen on the idea of being taken for the trip inside his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeith then spoke,  \"Looks like you have a little fan down by your feet, buddy. Or, maybe a little worshipper? Haha.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Kyle looked at him quizzically, then looked down at the ground.  Indeed, in between his feet, on the inside of his left foot, one of the little teens had remerged.  He focused his eyes and realized that the kid was banging his arms frantically on the white rubber side-tread of his sneaker.  At first he looked at him sternly, as he experienced the instinctual impulse to squash him like a pesky bug.  However, Kyle didn't wish any harm on the little guy and probably would be just as annoyed in his situation.  It was actually a funny sight, he thought to himself, as he watched the termite-sized figure banging on the foam wall his sneaker which must have seemed like a massive aircraft carrier to him.  \"Man, they're just like ants,\" he remarked to Keith.  Ignoring the insignificant and unfelt outcries of the teen attacking his giant sneaker, he gazed into the distance and saw what looked like a metropolis-like city, complete with miniature skyscrapers and everything.  \"Hey! Let's go to that city area. Look at all those buildings there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haha, yea!  Man, over there we'd be like three Godzillas walking through!\"  Ryan looked pretty excited.  The three of them lumbered forward.  </span></div></div>",

At least, he thought, he wasn't destroying anything they couldn't rebuild given enough time.  Still, he thought, sucks for them that they were so damn puny.  Ryan on the other hand appeared to be raising each foot high up and slamming it down with intense force, marching atop the civilization below with destructive glee.  Keith was a little more low-key.  Kyle noticed he'd stop occasionally when he saw something interesting, slowly edge his foot forward to it, and without lifting his heel off the ground, grin cruelly as he slowly lowered the sole of his massive sneaker toward whatever unfortunate thing happened to be in his path, clearly relishing the sight of the ant-sized figures futilely scrambling like all hell to be avoid being crushed by the slowly descending sole.  Then, he's press his foot down and twist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skyscrapers were coming closer into view when Kyle felt a slight itch on his right ankle.  It felt as though something got lodged in his shoe, like an annoying, tiny pebble or sharp grain of sand.  He tried to ignore it at first as the inched-high towers were awaiting and he was excited to look at them.  However, the itching became increasingly annoying.  He stopped in his tracks and standing on one foot, quickly pulled off his right shoe.  He regained his balance and looked inside for whatever was causing so much irritation.  That's when he saw a little figure attached to the inside fabric wall of the shoe, where his ankle was.  \"What the hell?\"  He focused his eyes and realized a tiny person had managed to get into his sneaker!  He appeared to be sort of sticking to the white fabric interior wall due to the moisture that had accumulated throughout the day.  \"Heh, how'd you get in there?\"  Kyle asked this question mainly to himself as he knew he couldn't hear anything the figure was saying.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he was definitely screaming something judging by the fast paced squeaks.  He actually seemed angry and Kyle guessed it may be due to getting stuck inside a giant teen's sneaker.  He could see how that might be degrading and unpleasant.  Though, Kyle was a pretty clean guy and all he did today was a lot of walking around, so it couldn't have been that awful inside his sneaker, could it?  Still, he ran competitively all the time in these running shoes and at the end of the day, feet were feet.   On further examination, to his amazement, Kyle realized that this was the same little guy who was banging on the same sneaker before he took off for the city a few minutes ago.  He could hardly believe how persistent the little guy was.  What could he want?  He didn't care so much as for what the little guy wanted as he was interested in the lengths to which this tiny teen would go. He taunted the little guy playfully: \"Not every day you can say you got that up close and personal to the stinking feet of a huge giant, eh?\"  Kyle couldn't help but laugh at how massive he was compared to the little ant-people below.  He was practically a god to them, he thought.   A giant god, actually.</span></div></div>",

Every step you take is leaving behind footprints of broken little sticks.  Suddenly Eric exclaims for you to stop.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The three of you resolved to stick together and try to find some more of these tiny people. Already a little shook up about the one that had died, you said, \"watch where you step,\" to your two friends as you decided to move through the trees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you stumbled upon what looked like a tiny, rudimentary town. Smoke rose out of a couple of the houses, and your mouth fell open as you saw tiny, 1-inch people scurrying around in fear and awe. What of, you wondered for a split second before realising - it was the three of you. You were dominating their skyline and they sensed your undoubted power. The town was very small - it would probably take just a couple of minutes for the three of you to stomp through it and squash all of their houses flat. If there were much more than a thousand people living there, you would be surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut a thousand inch-tall people were still more than enough for you to enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is great,\" you said to Eric and Jake. \"Look at em. They're terrified! That should make it easy to-\"<br>\r\n\"Squish them all?\" Eric said, perhaps only half-joking.<br>\r\n\"No, idiot. Rule them. We can be their kings.\"<br>\r\n\"Now that, I like,\" said Jake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou saw people begin to leave the village at the opposite end of it to you, getting as far out of dodge as possible. You didn't want anyone leaving just yet. \"Listen, I'll go over there and cut these guys off. You make sure nobody else leaves the village. We'll make a perimeter around it to keep everyone inside it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other two nodded and moved sideways. Eric crouched down and said in a deep, baritone voice, \"no, no no no...\" holding out his hands to prevent any escapees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, meanwhile, effortlessly caught up with the runners. There were only 5 or 6 of them and, bending down, you picked each one up. Marvelling at your newfound power, you realised you now had 6 lives on your palm. You held the hand up to your face and grinned at them in what you hoped was a non-threatening way, and checked out your catch. There were a couple of young men about your age, an older lady, a 20-something woman and three older men, it looked like. You took the couple of short steps back to the village. You could have put them back down, but you enjoyed holding them, watching them. You effortlessly transferred three of them into one of your other palms and stood, towering over the village. The houses just about came past your ankle and you laughed at their primitive buildings, though you couldn't help but admire their enterprise. This was clearly a civilization a few hundred years behind your own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are your new gods,\" you said aloud. \"We have chosen this village because we know you are the ones who will serve us best. We will provide you with health, and food, and we will even allow some of you to join our higher plane of existence. But you must worship us. Your must devote yourselves to us. And if you do not...you will be punished.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou glance down at the six in your hands to find them already on your knees, and you grin. </span></div></div>",

You feel almost kind of bare, here.  Exposed.  There's literally no objects around you except the almost carpet-flat terrain that extends in every direction.  \"This is weird,\" you state.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a step forward, and the next thing you know, you hear and feel a crunch beneath you.  Instinctively, you stop in your tracks and look down to see the damages.  Your eyebrows lift in awe as you witness what appears to be an extremely complex maze of highway, the roads only an inch across.  Twisting and turning, roundabout here and there, and causeways connecting different roads over tiny streams.  All along these busy little roads are a bustle of cars, stopping and going and turning.  Your own foot -- the one you just stepped with -- is planted across several of these interconnecting roads.  The crunch you heard was the sound of a smashed causeway.  Amazing... an entire race of people, no bigger than ants to you!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou examine the ground almost scientifically, as a researcher analyzing some kind of insect colony.  You lean forward, marveling in awe at the wreckage of the car pile-up that has accumulated at several points around your massive, obtrusive sneaker.  You try to imagine yourself in the place of these little people on one of these blocked roads, staring at the giant sneaker smothering the landscape and the roads, and then up at the colossal bare leg to which that sneaker connects.  You realize that your enormity must truly be terrifying to these little beings.  You wonder who they are, if they are of the same species as yourself, and why they are so tiny.  The people who have gotten out of the cars look entirely human, you notice as you squint down.  Very slowly, you lift the foot that you had planted onto the little people's roads into the air and hold it up.  It left a visible indentation in the earth.  A sneaker-shaped footprint has cratered the area, including the roads, complete with treadmarks.  All along the roads are utterly flattened metal cars of all colors, like smashed bugs.  You mindlessly stepped on at least three or four dozen people, you see as you prop your sneaker up against your knee and examine the smashed figures in the treads.... and probably more are squashed under your other foot, you surmise.  As you think about these things in terms of intellectual inquiry, it doesn't slip your notice that along with your two friends, you are almost certainly the most superior being in this world, practically unstoppable due to the pure physical advantage of your size.  You have a choice here.   You can assume that superior role and torture these tiny runts in any way you would like, just for fun... or you could assume a different role.  A role of benevolence -- of a god.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cThis is just... so... cool\u201d, Eric whispers\u2014somewhat lamely in your opinion. In fact, there are few words that come close to describing how you are feeling at the moment. It\u2019s like some kind of incredible dream\u2014the kind where you have superpowers and can do anything you please\u2014but you don\u2019t need to pinch yourself to realise this is actually happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric continues: \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re gods here.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, he\u2019s stating the obvious, but on the other hand, just hearing it spoken out loud makes you feel even more proud and superior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe could do literally anything to these people. We could just CRUSH them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, except that they ARE people, or at least look just like them. They\u2019re exactly like the folks we know back home, only much, much tinier. Maybe we should just leave them in peace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Jake\u2019s interjection hangs in the air for a moment, giving you pause for thought. Maybe he has a point. It would be one thing to stamp out a nest of mindless bugs, but these really do look exactly like humans, even though they are no bigger than ants\u2014plus they are clearly intelligent, with a fully-developed civilization that looks remarkably like your own. It occurs to you that there could well be tiny versions of you, Jake and Eric down there on the ground: small-time bullies who are now looking up terror, realising precisely what thoughts must be running through your gigantic heads and wetting themselves at the prospect. Maybe you should prove that you\u2019re better than that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...But then you look back at Jake and see that he and Eric are now smiling broadly. This was Jake\u2019s idea of a joke: all three of you know full well that you\u2019ll never get an opportunity like this again and you have no intention of passing up on it. Picking on smaller kids, dorks, and other hapless victims at school\u2014as you were wont to do only this morning\u2014doesn\u2019t seem as satisfying now compared to having a whole world of ant-sized beings to grind underfoot. What makes it even better is that there are no conceivable consequences for picking on this race of little humans. Nobody\u2014at least nobody who matters\u2014will ever find out or punish you for it. This place is all yours! You give each other high-fives and get to work!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing you do is take a closer look at the scene below. While you and your friends have been standing there like pensive titans, the commotion on the ground has become more frantic. The once-orderly flow of traffic along the highways has become a tangled snarl as cars and trucks have attempted to reverse direction and flee your immediate vicinity. Many accidents have already occurred in the confusion; plenty of drivers and passengers have elected to leave their vehicles and take their chances on foot. You can\u2019t help but chuckle at the terror you\u2019ve caused just by standing here, but now it\u2019s time to have some real fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn a whim, you decide to take off your sneakers. It\u2019s fascinating to compare how gigantic even these objects are compared with the world below; you inspect the bottoms and note with amusement just how many of the little bugs and their vehicles have been ground into the treads already. You also chuckle at the thought of how potent these things\u2014not to mention your feet themselves\u2014must smell to everybody on the ground. At your present scale everything is magnified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick a spot at random along the winding length of the tiny highway and then carelessly drop one of the sneakers onto it. It lands with the force of a meteor, obliterating a number of unfortunate cars beneath it. A slight puff of dust rises slowly around it, which you realise is actually a huge cloud of smoke and debris to the tiny people; the shattered highway is now completely blocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost immediately the oncoming traffic tries to brake or swerve to avoid the massive obstacle in its path. There\u2019s little chance. The first car slams against the side of your sneaker and crumples; others quickly follow. The deafening noise gradually reaches your ears as a slight tinkle; your sneaker is barely scuffed. Meanwhile, since your footwear easily covers the entire width of the highway the same is happening on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a couple of steps along the road and drop the second sneaker in a similar fashion. Now the highway is blocked in two places, with a stretch of maybe a mile lying between them. Apart from the crashed cars, there are some larger vehicles and a sprinkling of tiny specks that are fleeing people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continue to watch you see a large haulage truck slam on the brakes in a futile attempt to avoid crashing into the growing pile-up: the driver only succeeds in jack-knifing the vehicle. An instant before it impacts the tangle of cars you lower your hand and allow the truck to slide sideways into it. You fold your fingers around it and lift it into the air, delighted at how light and fragile it feels in your grasp. You bring it up to your face and look inside the cab. You can see a minuscule driver, screaming and moving around, almost hysterical and evidently trying to hide from your gaze. You bare your teeth at him playfully, then pull your arm back and throw the little truck as far as you can. It arcs over the landscape, breaking apart as it goes, and finally disappears on the ground somewhere way over in the distance, too far away for even the faintest sound of the impact to reach you. Your ego swells even further at the thought that you\u2019ve just sent a fully-laden haulage truck soaring for miles! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning with pride, you return your attention to what is happening back on the ground by your feet. Nearby you can see what appear to be a couple of motorcycle cops, weaving in and out of the stranded traffic, doing their best to keep control and maintain calm. They are so focussed on their task that they don\u2019t even notice you reaching down to grab them, one with each hand, until they are effortlessly pinched between your colossal fingers and lifted into the air. At that point they start to struggle frantically, trying to wriggle free, careless of their height above the ground, but in vain. Deceptively gently\u2014almost tenderly\u2014you hold them pinned to their vehicles. You don\u2019t want them to get hurt before you\u2019ve had your fun! You have two cops; you have two sneakers, so in they go: one in each shoe. You watch with fascination as both cops turn on their headlights to see in the gloom inside your footwear; the pretty little lights start to move around as they explore and search for a means of escape. As you pick up the sneakers the bikes struggle to keep upright and you amuse yourself by slowly tipping each sneaker, first one way, then the other, just to see if you can make them tumble. They do their best to stay remain stable and even have some success at first, but there isn\u2019t much they can do when you start shaking the sneakers more and more violently. You hold them up to your ears and listen to the faint rattling sound from inside as the little cops and their bikes are tossed around. At last you tire of your game, so you put the sneakers back on the ground and slide your feet inside them. You pause to enjoy the slight tickling sensation as your prisoners brush against your sensitive toes\u2014but then you slam your feet all the way inside, feeling two faint crunches as the bikes and their owners are crushed. You flex your toes playfully, just to make sure they are both good and smeared across the inside of your sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point you look around to see what your friends are up to. Eric is on his hands and knees nearby, flicking at stuff with his fingers. Jake, on the other hand, catches your eye and comes over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, I was thinking: tormenting these worthless little shits is great\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sense a \u201cbut\u201d coming, and sure enough, you\u2019re not disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2026but imagine what else we could do. Think about it for a moment: how many people do you suppose there are in this world?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider the question. You have no idea just how expansive this \u201cpocket\u201d world might be, but it stretches to an apparent horizon in every direction, and possibly much further. Given that the people and infrastructure seem to be pretty much identical to what you know back home you guess the population must run to several millions in nearby cities alone; possibly even billions if it turns out you\u2019ve somehow been transported to a full-scale planet with discrete countries and continents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right: a whole lot of them\u201d, Jake continues. \u201cWe could come here every day and crush their little ant cities one after the other, but we\u2019d probably get bored long before we could wipe them all out. On the other hand, we could easily fit a hundred of the little creeps in each of our pockets and take them home; maybe even some of those itty-bitty cars, trains, and stuff\u2014perhaps even a building or two. We\u2019d effectively have a limitless supply.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo? And then what?\u201d By now, Eric has wandered over to join you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, we could keep them as slaves or something, to clean our feet, get us off, or anything we want.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Eric nod: the idea certainly appeals, but he hasn\u2019t finished yet. Instead you are treated to that familiar self-satisfied smirk that invariably means that Jake, always the schemer, has had one of his famous ideas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut how about this?: we could sell some of them at school. Just to our friends at first, and if that goes well, maybe on the street too; eventually we could move on to eBay, provided we\u2019re really discreet about it. Just think what we could charge for real, living tiny human slaves\u2014or snacks. We could be rich!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod slowly: even though Jake can be an ass at times there\u2019s no doubt that he comes up with some great schemes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric contributes his opinion: \u201cWow, that\u2019s a really neat plan. But we can still do other stuff first, right? Like crushing and things?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou exchange a quick glance with Jake: Eric never changes!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI mean, before we found this place we were just going to hang out, play some soccer, throw some frisbee and stuff, right? We could still do that, but HERE, and then collect all the stuff we want after we\u2019ve finished. So let\u2019s go fetch ourselves some food and stuff, bring it here, and we\u2019ll make a day of it. Whaddya think?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDamn! Seems like you underestimated Eric. You imagine a gigantic frisbee, football, or something similar, soaring over a miniature city like a UFO, ready to crash down on a defenceless skyline. Not to mention the potential of bringing food and drink here\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake turns to you: \u201cOkay, that\u2019d work. So is there anything else we could try?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a second; Eric has given you an idea\u2026 \u201cWell, there\u2019s one other thing we might do. Just think what a great place this would be to have a party! Imagine it: a few friends; some drinks; some music; limitless tiny people to use for games or snacks\u2026 this place would rock\u2014literally!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake rolls his eyes at your cheesy pun, but Eric frowns. \u201cThat sounds real neat, but we found this world. It should be ours. We don\u2019t want anybody else taking it over or spreading the word.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod again. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ll restrict it to just a few buddies we know we can trust. Maybe we\u2019ll even blindfold them or something so they don\u2019t know exactly how they got here. But once they\u2019re here\u2026 well, let\u2019s just say we won\u2019t have to worry about the usual complaints about the noise and the mess we make with our parties. We can go wild and nobody else will even know or care about it. Our little pets here can worry about cleaning up afterwards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and Jake smile appreciatively. Maximum fun with minimum effort sure is fine by them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then, so which do we do?\u201d asks Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how do we get back home?\u201d adds Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou point to a very faint glowing outline about twenty feet away. You noticed it earlier while you were throwing the truck and guessed that it marks the point where you originally entered this world. With luck, it should take you back home as well. Now all you need to do is decide on a course of action\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That way we can continue wrecking this town as much as we want without worrying about if we annihilated all of the little runts.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crouch down to the ground, your knees bent.  You try to think how best to collect these people.  Picking up their little buildings off the ground would be effortless, so you begin by pinching a what appears to be a small, windowed apartment building a couple inches off the ground.  You pinch your two fingers around it but the structure begins crumbling from the bottom as you rip it off the ground.  As people fall out from underneath the structure you realize that simply picking up their buildings won't be a good way of keeping these little people alive.  You pinch your two fingers together, crushing the building entirely, and flick the debris away.  Then, you try picking up cars.  The cars are easily manageable, as you gently trap the moving little vehicles between your fingertips and pocket them in your shorts.  You pocket many cars in this fashion, until all the ones in your vicinity have driven off or been scooped up.  Then you rise to your full height and stride over to another busy highway, stomp on top of the busiest line of traffic you see, and collect all the cars that pile-up in the wreckage that results on either side of your obtruding feet.  After filling both your pockets, you kick off your sneakers once more and slide off your socks in order to fill them as well.  The ground under your bare feet tickles when you stand back up.  You curl your toes up and then stretch them out, snickering at the people who get smeared underneath from these movements.  You stomp around some more for fun.  Buildings are still no match for agitating the tough skin of your vast soles, and cars are easily flattened into sheets as well.  After stepping on what looks like a school, you crouch back down and start filling your two socks with cars again.  Before long you finish.  \"Hope you can stand the smell!\" you say jeeringly, as you tie the ends of the filled up socks.  You look around for Jake and Eric.  Jake has appeared to have gathered people in the same way you have, though it looks like he is placing cars directly inside of his sneakers.  Meanwhile, Eric is still stamping his feet on things.  Oh well, time to go home!</span></div></div>",

You stretch out your enormous bare feet, flexing and spreading your sweaty toes. \"Man, I don't know about you guys but I could suurre use a niice loong foot rub! That would feel amazing on my tired stinky feet!\" You chuckle as your friends seem to share your sentiment and grin with you. \"What a great idea! Come 'ere shrimps!\" Eric leans down and scoops up several tinies. Jake laughs, \"Yeah, I can smell our feet right now, they're sooo overworked! It'll be nice to have some tiny worthless people to give some attention to them!\" Jake sits down in the middle of a busy crowded street flooded with panicking people, several of whom get crushed under his enormous rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frown when the tinies don't seem to take your hint, \"Hey, punies! Get your asses over here and rub my big feet!\" You wiggle your toes threateningly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA man stands up, separate from the crowd. \"Who the hell do you people think you are!? You can't just come into our city and start terrorizing us!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of you laugh at this, loudly, enough to make the brave man flinch. \"Oh yeah?\" Jake sneers, his face coming up behind the man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha ha ha, we can do whatever we want! We're giants, and your people are nothing but puny little ants! And you know what ants are only good for? SQUISHING!\" You bring your big toe onto the man, his body compresses into the ground underneath your toe like a folding chair. Blood leaks out underneath your toe as you scrape his remains off on the concrete. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone else have any objections? Or are we gonna get our feet serviced?\" Eric says chuckling.</span></div></div>",

You can clearly see the fear in these runts, their faces showing utter terror. You stretch your feet briefly, and laugh at how even this little motion spurs the people into action quicker. Eventually the first few make it to your soles but they can do little more than attempt to make their way through the layer of debris that lightly coats your feet. You can't feel anything at all bit the idea that these people are willingly attempting to service you in fear of their lives is pleasing enough. You look over to Jake and Eric, who are now receiving similar attention from the people. Eric casually moves his feet every so often, grinding entire groups of people beneath his heels. This doesn't deter the others from carrying out their duty, you notice. Jake is a little more reserved, sitting still to allow the tinies to fulfill his desires. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn back to your own group of slaves. Their progress is little and by now the initial allure of servitude has worn off. On a whim you sit up, planting your feet on the crowds of people at your soles. Turning over you shuffle over to a previously untouched section of the city, the skyscrapers cast in shadow by your body. You look over the fleeing specks, dashing through burning streets littered with wrecks of vehicles. Without any direct influence, your presence has caused calamity you notice with glee. Time to show these runts who's in charge. You begin by opening your palm and hold it over a densely populated section of the city. You can see the people desperate to escape from beneath but it is all for naught and you swiftly slam your hand down, feeling a satisfying crunch as the entire area is crushed to dust. The shock wave from your hand disrupts all the other evacuees, as you notice cars struggle to drive and see people fall to the ground. You see a bunch of them run down a street and an idea pops into your head. As they make their great escape, you flick at one of the buildings next to them, and laugh as it collapses atop the tiny people. \"What are you doing over there?\", you hear Jake say. \"Just showing these little shits who's boss\", you reply, still grinning at the destruction you caused a moment ago. You stand to your feet and begin to stomp around the city. Everything is utterly destroyed beneath your soles and the city is soon littered with numerous footprints. Jake and Eric have also grown bored with their little servants, and they too get to their feet and begin to walk around, crushing even more of the battered city and no doubt killing hundreds more tiny people. You must say, the power feels amazing. You scan the ground for the most populated areas before grinding them underfoot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while you reach into your pocket and grab a hold of whatever little trinkets you can. You open more palm to a collection of cars, buses and dazed people. Noticeably some have been killed by the movements but this doesn't bother you. After all there are plenty more of the little bugs to replace. Gazing down on your open palm, you wonder what you should do with your little captives.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Scattered around your palm are a collection of disorientated people of all ages, trying to somehow make sense of what has taken place in the last few hours. You discern all this from the frenzied movements of the bug-like beings. It's difficult, seeing as at their present size, they resemble small ants more than anything remotely human. You take some time to scrutinise them, no doubt instilling absolute fear in the little shits. You know that these things are living people, like yourself, only at a much smaller scale, but you can't reconcile this image in your mind. To you, they are nothing more than bugs for you to kill as you please. The fact that they are fully aware of your thinking makes it even better to you. It fuels your ego even more, knowing that you are holding a hundred or so sentient people in your palm to do with as you please. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that final thought, you slowly begin to close your fingers around your palm. You can see the people all react in even greater fear as they see the monoliths of your digits close in around them, like fleshing skyscrapers taking over their fields of vision. Some are completely frozen, unable to react to the situation. Others simply run around, looking for any sort of refuge to escape their inevitable fate. Seeing the effect you have on these people with the simplest of actions is unbelievably arousing, as you feel yourself getting a little hard at the thought of crushing them in your fist. You even see a few people fall to their knees, in what looks like subjugation, probably praying for mercy or a reprieve from your might. You sneer at the pitiful demonstration. To you, there is nothing wrong in crushing these worthless fucks. Survival of the fittest, and all that, and you are certainly the fittest of beings in this puny world, on account of your sheer size. To the denizens, you are a moving mountain, a living god. Besides you have plenty more of these little beings to crush like bugs, or do with as you please. Since your arrival, you've taken note that it appears that an entire new world has opened up to you, not merely a single solitary city. The crystal seems to have transported you to a new dimension of some sort, one similar to your own home, though on a minute scale. You can't wait to torment even more cities, maybe even whole countries if you can figure out how that crystal worked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you clench your fist tightly. Your feel some small pops and crunches, a mixture of the vehicles and people imploding. In one movement, you've killed maybe a hundred or so people, without the slightest effort. Fear grips everyone who witnesses your latest action. Now there is no possibility of you being indifferent to them, they've seen you go out of your way to purposely kill dozens of people for the fun of it. Utter panic is rife throughout the ruined city, men, women and children all in a mad scramble to survive the apocalypse you've brought to their little world. Jake and Eric have wandered off into the distance, no doubt to pursue their own fun in annihilating whatever they want. Suits you all the better, you think to yourself. Now you have an entire city to do with as you please. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping the splotches of crimson off your shorts, you stand to your full height and start to walk around, purposely stepping on to the little buildings below. It's feels great to simply stomp down on a section of city, crushing everything beneath the scuffed rubber of your runner. You notice a densely packed street, filled with people desperately trying to escape, your destruction. All around them is the rubble of once standing buildings, reduced to nothing beneath your feet, leaving only smoldering footprints as the only recollection. Wanting to play with them a little more, you crouch down and rather lazily, cast your finger onto the surface to dig a trench to stop their escape. In an instant, dozens more are crushed beneath your finger, driven into the ground as you push your finger through the micro roadways and streets. The crowd stops, no doubt seeing no alternative but to face you. A deep cavern encircles them, courtesy of your finger digging a semicircle around the petrified people, knocking over a few building as you do so. You move forward, and stretch yourself onto the city, so that you are lying on your chest, with your head hanging above the terrified escapees. You smile with malice down at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>I hope you little fucks weren't trying to run away from your new god now</b>\", you state with a commanding tone. Without warning, you lower your index finger and thumb, and pinch a small man between, who had become somewhat isolated. Lifting him closer to your face, you gaze upon him with intense interest. He is hysterical, trying to avoid your gaze despite being completely trapped in your grip. You laugh at the sight and ponder what to do with your captive.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It's decided.  Eric and Jake will go to their houses and get everything you need: frisbees, balls, food.  You, having nothing to bring, will simply wait in this tiny world.  The two of them trample across the cityscape to exit in the same location you entered: on the ground they find the crystal.  Eric picks it up and with both touching it, they teleport away.  After they leave, you survey the ground triumphantly.  Even as you stand here right now, you are aware that several hundred humans are being flattened beneath the crushing weight of your two feet.  The idea that your body is probably more massive than all of these little people put together only reinforces that sense of superiority.  You feel like relaxing until Jake and Eric get back, so you kick your shoes off, smirking as they go reeling over a couple city blocks and landing on their sides, the mouths wide open for all the people to enjoy the smell of your foot odor.  Then, you sit down -- right there on top of the active cityscape.  You can feel the crunch of buildings underneath your buttocks as these people are literally flattened to death under one of the more unflattering portions of your huge body.  You finish by stretching your legs out in front of you, your toes pointed up into the air and taller than any skyscraper here.  You hold yourself up by pushing your hands down on the surface of the ground behind you, supporting your torso so you can lean back a little on your arms.  Your sprawling fingers and palms press down across roads, intersections, and whole city blocks. You can't help but enjoy thinking about how many people are suffocating under your body right now.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take long before most of the cars vacate your vicinity.  Just for fun, you collect a few of the stragglers.  You get a hold of about a dozen tiny cars and drop them onto your lap, where they are immobilized in the dense and hilly fabric of your shorts over your crotch.  The movements of the cars and the people who get out but find themselves unable to climb the fabric begins to tingle your penis a little, and you feel yourself getting hard.  You watch with boyish glee as the fabric beneath the people raises ever so slowly... until a couple cars start to roll off the side of your shorts onto the ground below.  Entire groups of people struggle to maintain balance over the mountainous bulge your penis is causing.  Feeling cruel for no reason, you flick one of the cars off the top of the bulge and laugh as it goes sailing back down.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick another car up and empty the people out into your palm.  It looks like a family, you notice when you raise them to your eye level and watch the mother, father, two little kids and a teenager your age squirm about the vast fleshy surface of your hand.  Curiously, you hold them up to your right ear in order to let them climb into your lobe.  You tilt your palm slightly to encourage them to venture over the gap between your hand and a ridge in your ear, so they can speak.  You can feel them crossing over and you are also tempted to scratch.  You prematurely draw your hand away as a reflex and feel a little tingle along the side of your ear... as you realize that one of them fell off due to the movement of your hand.  Inside your ear lobe, you can hear a man, the father, screaming out for the child you apparently dropped.  \"Uh...oops,\" you say nonchalantly, followed by a \"heh, sorry.\"  Suddenly you feel a more intense itching inside of your ear as you hear the mother screaming something about you being a bully.  You realize that she is pounding and scratching on the thick skin inside your ear.  \"Hey, cut that out or I'll give you more to cry about than your bratty kid\" you command sternly.  \"Keep it up and I'll stick my pinky finger so far in that you'll have to be scraped out of my ear wax a month from now.\"  Immediately, the annoying itch stops.  \"Good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, the man speaks up: \"Why are you doing this?\" you hear him shout, more as a statement than as a question.   You assume he knows you are being cruel for the pure enjoyment.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it's fun and I can, why else?\" you reply smugly.  \"I can't help that your species evolved to be such puny little runts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just because you are bigger doesn't mean you are better than others\" he replies, somewhat childishly in your opinion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahah, tell that to the people stuck to the soles of my giant, stinking feet, little guy.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dialogue continues...</span></div></div>",

We are intelligent beings, not ants for you to play with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny,\u201d you snigger, using one finger to toy idly with the small crowd of people still trapped on the shifting contours of your shorts. \u201cBecause you sure look like ants to me\u2014or maybe that should be <i>mites</i>... OOPS!\u201d Your inattention has caused you to squash one of the unfortunates inadvertently beneath your fingertip. A faint screaming sound reaches your ear from below and the movements of the crowd become more frenzied, their slight tickling creating all kinds of delightful sensations in your groin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that noise?\u201d demands the puny creature in your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHehehe, never you mind,\u201d you chuckle, resisting the urge to rub your crotch and smear the remainder of the hapless commuters across the fabric of your shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m warning you, you can't invade our world and treat us like this. We have weapons. Powerful weapons that can deal with even monsters like you. You\u2019ll pay for this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re amazed and highly amused at the temerity of this tiny being, actually daring to threaten you while standing in the immense sticky passage of your ear canal. You lift your hand back up to your ear and tilt your head, so that he and the remainder of his little family tumble back into your palm. You look down sternly at the sorry bunch\u2014the mother with her youngest surviving child hiding behind her; the teenager biting his lip as he tries to appear brave\u2014and reply:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo just what are you going to do to stop us? Send an army of little ant-people against us? Go ahead! It\u2019ll be fun to see just how many we can squash with a single footstep. In fact, I bet it\u2019ll be just as easy to flatten them and all their little tanks as it will be to crush you right now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re just starting to close your hand slowly and deliberately around them when you hear a slight noise from behind: it\u2019s probably Eric and Jake on their way back. The interruption saves your captives\u2019 lives. Instead of obliterating them as planned you smile sweetly down at the miniature family and begin to speak:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, I'll tell you what\u2019s going to happen. My friends and I now own this world. Everything and everyone on it belongs to us. I\u2019m going to let you live so that you can go back, find whatever gnats you call leaders, and tell them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look round and sure enough, you see your friends, still some distance behind you, laughing and shoving each other as they trample the tiny landscape carelessly underfoot. You still have a couple of moments left to yourself, so you lean in close and whisper something else to the family:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd just so you know: <u>I\u2019m</u> the one who's in charge here. Not them over there. <u>Me</u>. Now you can go and scurry away back to your little nest.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019ve just lowered them safely down onto the ground when another amusing thought strikes you. \u201cHold on,\u201d you command. The pitiful group freezes. \u201cOne more thing: just to make sure you don't try anything sneaky or stupid I think I\u2019ll keep one of you with me, as a hostage... or maybe just as plaything.\u201d You wink cruelly, and before they can react you pinch the teenager quickly between your thumb and forefinger and snatch him up into the air. The mother begins screaming again and her husband rushes back towards you. You can just make out his words as he yells, \u201cPlease! Take me instead!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laugh cruelly and examine the tiny boy. He\u2019s obviously terrified, struggling and yelling, almost in tears. The fact that he is pretty much the same age as you makes it even better. You\u2019ve always derived immense pleasure from tormenting smaller kids, and the utterly minuscule size of this teenager makes it infinitely more satisfying than anything you\u2019ve done previously. Knowing that the kid\u2019s family is watching, you deliberately pull back the waistband of your shorts and lower him down inside onto your pubic hair. Then you roll him gently around until he is hopelessly entangled deep in the rope-like pubes. He\u2019ll be relatively safe in that rather unpleasant prison until you are ready to deal with him. The elastic snaps back into place and you blow down on the horrified family, sending them flying off into the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the tiny vehicles and their owners are still being tossed about in your lap so you gather them all up in one hand and get to your feet. With one hand you shove them all inside your pocket for later, while with the other hand you do your best to conceal from your friends the embarrassing bulge of your partially aroused penis. With both hands occupied you hear somebody suddenly yell, \u201cHeads up!\u201d...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You dart your head straight up and see the bright orange disc flying over your head and to the left.  A natural athlete, your keen reflexes immediately alert you to action.  You spring up off the ground and hop high into the air as the orange frisbee sails above and to the side.  You stretch your arm out and catch it perfectly... and drop back to the ground, your two bare feet slamming down upon an untouched square of apartment complexes.  You can see a couple water towers and and telephone poles collapse in the vicinity.  Your enormous weight at this size has caused your landing to be forceful enough to shake the ground violently, it seems.  Awesome!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the vast soles of your feet are tough enough to crush all beneath them without any agitation, you know that your performance would be enhanced with your shoes back on.  Before flinging the frisbee back, you go to slip them on.  Interestingly, a crowd has gathered around them, staring in awe at the enormous running sneakers that are responsible for flattening much of their town.  You smirk at the scene, then kneel down to pluck one of your shoes up with your free hand.  You grab it by the back of the heel and raise it up, then rather like swatting a fly, you whack the crowd, obliterating dozens of tiny people beneath the rubber sole.  Predictably, the people run, scattering in all directions.  Not content with letting them all escape so easily, you stand up to your full height and start swiftly stepping on the skittering survivors individually with your bare feet.  First, a well-dressed businessman is flattened, then a couple of teenaged joggers, a homeless guy in rags, a bunch of little kids... and each step more exulting than the last, until each member of the crowd has either vanished or been rendered into a dried little stain under your colossal soles.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, let's finish this game up, shall we?\" you exclaim to Jake and Eric, who you are sure have grown impatient with your attention toward the ground.  You slip your socks and sneakers back on and then fling the frisbee toward Eric.  He catches it perfectly and flings it back to you.  You catch it effortlessly and then yell for Jake to go long.  He nods, and you send the frisbee well over his head.  \"That's too far and you know it!\" he shouts.  He tries to run back, charging over the city and leaving audible *crunches* with each stride.  Sure that he won't catch up with it before it lands on the ground, you start laughing at him... until he catches it.  Jake's face is red from exertion and, you suspect, annoyance at your purposefully overdrawn throw.  He flings it back in your direction -- right at your face!  Jake's quick, angry throw takes you by surprise and causes you to shield your face with your arms crossed in front.  However, the frisbee goes right in between them and smacks you squarely in the nose. \"Argh!\" You jerk your head to the side, losing your balance, and begin your disoriented fall to the bustling town below.  Seconds later, you open your eyes and find yourself laying on your back with your head turned to the side.  You can see tiny people, cars, and little buildings just inches from your face.  Your body is sprawled across several blocks of the city, your titanic head, shoulders, legs, and heels no doubt pressing down upon hundreds of tiny people at this very moment.  You plant your hands down on the fragile cityscape below, caring little for whoever and whatever is crushed beneath your palms, as you prop yourself up before a gloating Jake who is striding closer and closer to you in curiosity or concern. \"Heh, hey, you okay?\"  His disingenuous voice does little to assuage the anger you're experiencing from not only being knocked to the ground, but being made to look bad in front of the thousands of tiny onlookers who are supposed to look up to you in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jake closes in, you don't get quite get up all the way.  Instead, you bend forward slightly as though you were about to rise... and then tackle Jake right in the gut.  \"UGH!\" he shouts, as you ram your head straight into his abdomen.  Jake seems to have been prepared somewhat for your reaction, because your lunge doesn't quite knock him back in the way that you had intended.  Instead, he throws his hands down on your back and tries to push you to the ground again.  However, you've always been slightly stronger than Jake... enough so that you can resist this move.  Instead, you retreat back a step and slip out of his arms.  The two of you charge into each other as Eric watches intensely.  You grapple hands with Jake, trying to force him backward.  You give it all you can, slowly feeling Jake's arms tiring.  Then, you take your first step forward, causing Jake's feet to slowly slide backward across the surface of the city below.  In the midst of this, you imagine how this sight must appear to the thousands of bug-sized onlookers on the ground.  Two gigantic teenaged males, as tall as mountains, trying to physically outmatch the other like a couple of angry Greek Gods, your two pairs of vast, sneakered feet tramping down upon building and person alike.   They must be truly terrified: two titans having a selfish battle of egos in the sky above, both of you appearing focused utterly and only on each other as the ground loudly shakes with each of your heavy, labored, and forceful steps.  That fear will make this all the more rewarding when you defeat Jake, you think.  You can already feel him weakening as you bear down upon him.  Before long, you have sent him back 10 feet, and finally, you force him so low to the ground that he can no longer step back and instead falls the rest of the distance to the ground below, panting.  You circle Jake meticulously, tired but not exhausted, until you are standing with your feet behind his head, forcing him to look up at your tall form from the ground, just like one of the bug-people that you are standing upon.  Then with a triumphant smirk on your face, you walk to his side and quickly and forfecully shove your foot into the lateral side of his abdomen, right under his rib cage, causing him to gulp and lose his breath.  \"I win,\" you say, as you pin your foot upon his chest to keep him from getting up.</span></div></div>",

From the perspective of these tiny lifeforms, they literally witnessed the clash of the Titans, and you emerged as the victor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake rolls over to his side clenching his belly, causing you to lift your foot off him as he curls into a ball trying catch his breath from your kick to his gut.  You plant your foot back down upon the city, caring little for those crushed beneath, and look down at Jake with contempt.  \"Well, that's embarrassing,\" you gloat.  \"These little guys just saw you get your ass kicked.  Now even <i>they</i> are going to think you're a loser!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few seconds, Jake sits up with his knees bent in front of him, causing no small amount of destruction doing so, although not intentionally.  After a couple more breaths, he looks up at you and sneers: \"Damn, man.. what the hell is your problem?  Tackling me over the frisbee?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, you know you overreacted, but on the other hand, Jake didn't exactly try to diffuse the fight.  You haven't a doubt that in your position, he would also be gloating over such an impressive victory.  The truth was, you actually respected Jake, and certainly much more than Eric. Whereas Eric was often a crass boor, Jake was very similar to you: intelligent and physically athletic, sometimes quiet, he was well-respected for both his clean-cut good looks and his apparent good nature.  And although he was reserved, even shy at times, he was well-liked by all.  You've viewed him as a quieter mirror image to yourself.  It's precisely his similarity to you that makes your victory over him even more enjoyable.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring his question, you decide to showboat even more. Once an ordinary guy back home, the fact that literally thousands of intelligent beings see you as a massive, destructive giant has got your ego running wild, and you want to enjoy every second of it.  You scan the ground for the busiest and most dense section of tiny \"skyscrapers\" around.  Purposely saying nothing, and without making any demands, you lift one gargantuan foot, inching it forward delicately, so that several of the structures are enveloped by the cool, dark shadow of your gigantic sneaker.  In response to the looming danger represented by the synthetic alien-like object, barely perceptible swarms of tiny people pour out of the buildings and congest the streets in total panic, causing you to smirk fiendishly. You grin even more when you see what appear to be tiny vehicles zip through crowds and plow straight through their fellow citizens, desperate to escape the threat of your huge, deadly sneaker that eclipses the sky above and discerns no one it crushes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou speak: \"You guys see there can only be one god here.\"  You bring your foot down just low enough for the rubber tread of your sneaker to press down on the roofs of several of the tallest of the skyscrapers below, causing large sections of the buildings to crumble and break apart, making an example of several hundreds of victims.  With purposeful smugness, you command them: \"Worship me, or be crushed under my feet.\"  You know you could remove your foot and place it back down on the smoldering rubble from whence it came, to show that you have some semblance of honor... but what fun is that?  Instead, you decide to make an example of these buildings and the thousands within them, to demonstrate your sincerity and your might.  You press your foot down, causing the buildings to topple over until they are finally crushed into gravel beneath your titanic sneaker, smiling as you think of how monstrously terrifying you must seem: a temperamental god who squashes innocent men, women, even children without a second thought.  You very much enjoy the idea.  \"Going forward, I want every family who produces children to name their first born son after me,\" you state.  Just the first step in forcing these insects to engineer their society in YOUR image, you think to yourself.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless of whether they comply or not, you already know that you fully intend on being as cruel as possible and will continue terrorizing them for fun.  For you, being able to dominate an entire civilization through sheer force is every dream come true. Your existence alone is enough to petrify these lifeforms, who will do anything you say to avoid you visiting your quite whimsical wrath upon them with your merciless and destructive feet. The fact that they will be living in constant fear and acute distress is more than side benefit; it's your goal!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Jake\u2019s shout takes you by surprise, and you look up to see a glass bottle hurtling towards you. Your immediate instinct is of course to reach out to catch it; unfortunately, your right hand is currently engaged in protecting your modesty. Obviously you\u2019ve all seen each other nude before in the showers, but knowing Eric and Jake as well as you do you know they are bound to draw the worst possible conclusion about what you\u2019ve been up to on your own if they notice your arousal, and they certainly won\u2019t pass up the opportunity to make fun of you for it.  There is absolutely no way you are going to risk letting yourself\u2014a proud and mighty giant god\u2014be humiliated by your friends in front of the thousands of people inside the city (not to mention those elsewhere who may be following events via live news broadcasts), just because you\u2019ve got an erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so, with self-consciousness dictating your actions, you instead try to use your other hand to grab the bottle. Unfortunately, since you\u2019ve just finished stuffing a small crowd of tiny people inside the pocket of your shorts it\u2019s not exactly in an ideal position for catching a fast-moving object. The result is that you are a fraction of a second too late and only succeed in knocking the bottle with your fingertips, sending it spinning away instead of catching it firmly in your palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tumbling bottle, which is of course large enough to dwarf most of the buildings in this tiny world, hurtles down into a region of high-quality housing and parklands near the outskirts of the city. The result is spectacular to say the least. The giant bottle doesn\u2019t just shatter on impact; it <i>explodes</i>. Razor-sharp fragments of glass, many of which are larger than houses, fly outwards like shrapnel, while a foaming mass of sticky-sweet, ultra-carbonated liquid sprays across the landscape for miles around. From the force of the blast\u2014and the smirk on Jake\u2019s face\u2014you guess that he must have given the bottle a good shake before he tossed it, hoping that it would drench you when you opened it. That plan didn\u2019t quite work out, but he and Eric are clearly delighted at the disastrous effect it has instead had on the miniature city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, did you see that?\u201d Jake asks. \u201cPretty cool, huh? I found a couple of those old bottles in the garage. Don\u2019t know how long they\u2019ve been there.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that explains that. The things could have been sitting there for ages, slowly building up pressure inside. And of course Jake was only too happy to give yours that little extra boost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I\u2019ve always wanted coke-coloured sneakers,\u201d you remark pointedly. The landscape wasn\u2019t the only thing that got drenched: your footwear has also been splattered and stained. You suppose you should count yourself lucky that your bare legs didn\u2019t receive any cuts from the flying glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, it was just a joke,\u201d he shrugs indifferently. \u201cMaybe you should try catching it next time? That\u2019s what hands are for.\u201d He looks pointedly at the one that is still in its unlikely position in front of your crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, the sudden distraction has allowed your erection to subside so you nonchalantly shift your posture to something more natural. \u201cMaybe I would have done if you didn\u2019t throw like a girl,\u201d you retort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe ignores this and walks past you to inspect the carnage more closely. He is carrying a similar, though already opened, bottle, and lazily takes a swig from it before admiring the sodden mess on the ground with a look of satisfaction. \u201cGuess they were right, this stuff really is better when it comes in a glass bottle,\u201d he comments sardonically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a look for yourself at the havoc you\u2019ve inadvertently wreaked. It\u2019s actually pretty shocking. Pretty much everything in the immediate vicinity of the impact zone has simply been obliterated. Further out, the massive shards of glass have ripped through houses, schools and shops with stunning force. Trees and traffic have been crushed; at least one train that you can see has been derailed and sliced up like salami. You can\u2019t even begin to imagine how terrifying and horrific things must have been for those caught on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou even notice a thin sliver of glass, about half the length of your finger, that has travelled some distance further. It has punched all the way through a tower block, leaving it transfixed, as if by a spear. You guess the building won\u2019t survive long: the immense weight of the sliver is already causing the structure to deform and become unstable\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jake is pacing slowly backwards and forwards, taking great delight in the way the ground squelches and oozes under his soles. It only takes a slight twist of his sneaker to churn the once-pleasant neighbourhood into mud. The tiny landscape is so thoroughly waterlogged by the immense volume of liquid that much of the spilled cola is now trickling freely across the surface, following the natural contours of the landscape until it gradually begins to pool in great sparkling lakes, with a mist of fizzy droplets constantly leaping dozens of feet into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf-submerged in the middle of one of these pools you notice a crumpled object that looks exactly like a school bus, so you pluck it out, dripping, to examine it. It seems to be empty, but you can\u2019t help but notice how most of the paintwork has already been etched away by the acids in the drink\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee what you\u2019ve caused?\u201d Jake pontificates as he casually wanders closer to the city centre, obliviously reducing yet more buildings to powder underfoot and leaving damp sticky footprints wherever he steps. \u201cLittering is bad, mmkay? Next time you don\u2019t want your drink, think of the environment and just pour it safely down the drain.\u201d He finally stops next to the river that winds its way through the centre of the metropolis. Holding his bottle at chest height, he slowly and deliberately tilts it until the contents start to trickle out through the top\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the space of a few seconds thousands of gallons plunge the hundreds of meters down to the ground and crash into the river with a force greater than any waterfall. The resulting splashes rise higher than nearby buildings, and instantly carry off pedestrians and traffic caught exposed on the embankments. A mighty torrent quickly builds and starts to surge down the watercourse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh man, now they\u2019re really in trouble,\u201d whispers Eric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough probably fairly wide to the inhabitants of the city, the river is in no way able to handle the sudden influx of a vast quantity of extra fluid. The combination of the water pressure and the chemicals of Jake\u2019s soft drink make short work of the concrete embankments. They quickly begin to crumble and even dissolve like a sandcastle in the face of the encroaching tide, allowing the swollen river to burst its banks and flood the surrounding city blocks. Meanwhile, the main surge continues downstream, sweeping aside everything in its path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you can only follow slowly and watch as the bridges positioned at intervals along the length of the river are overwhelmed one by one, collapsing and sending the gridlocked traffic trapped on them plunging down into the raging black depths of the contaminated river, along with the rest of the debris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, look at that,\u201d Jake points. You follow the direction of his finger and see a small boat, a passenger ferry by the look of it, struggling against the current further down, trying to escape, and right in the path of the approaching flood. You guess it must have been in the middle of a trip down the river when the three of you arrived and either it didn\u2019t have time to reach its berth, or the captain decided he and his passengers might be safer staying in the middle of the river than amongst the potentially-collapsible skyscrapers of downtown. Sadly, he reckoned without an Act of Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fizzy tsunami rears above the helpless ship. It is about to sweep up the puny vessel and dash it to pieces when Jake\u2019s hand reaches down from on high and scoops up the little boat, lifting it effortlessly above the foaming waters. He turns to you and Eric, with the tiny ferry cupped in the palm of his hand. For a moment you think he is simply going to close his hand around it and crush it into splinters, and that is clearly what Eric is expecting too. But instead Jake smirks at the two of you and holds up the bottle, which is by now just under a third full. As you watch he carefully inserts the ferry into the neck of the bottle. As luck would have it, it just fits inside. With one final push from his fingertip the little boat slides down the inside of the glass onto the surface of the effervescent liquid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow about that! A \u2018ship in a bottle\u2019. I\u2019ve always wanted one of these!\u201d he snickers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Eric roll your eyes at him, but you have to admit, it\u2019s a pretty funny sight. The ferry is filled with passengers and you can clearly see them screaming and waving through the glass. Holding his thumb over the opening, Jake slowly tilts the bottle first one way, then the other, sloshing the liquid about and making the tiny vessel bob up and down. You think you see some of the passengers being sick over the side, and wonder whether he is still planning to drink that stuff. Knowing Jake, he\u2019ll probably play with the ferry for a while and then completely lose interest, leaving it stuck inside\u2014or he\u2019ll forget about the trapped ship altogether and simply throw the bottle away. But for now he slowly turns the bottle into an upright position, taking care not to swamp the ferry in the process, and lets it dangle by his side as he walks along with you and Eric. The mighty flood is left to continue its passage of destruction through the city and presumably then carry on downstream until it reaches the sea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look back at the battered city you can\u2019t help but wonder what might have happened to that little family you released. Whether they have been caught up in the floods along with thousands of others; whether you will ever see them again. Having had a conversation with them, heard their voices and seen their faces, you can\u2019t quite think of them as anonymous little bugs any more. You try to remember exactly where you set them down, but of course you weren\u2019t really paying attention at the time and don\u2019t know the layout of the city well enough to recognise any landmarks. Maybe they were lucky and will get to deliver your message to the guys in charge; you\u2019d certainly like to think so. You suppose you\u2019ll find out eventually if they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little disturbed at the turn your thoughts have taken, you try to distract yourself by turning to Eric and asking: \u201cSo, did you get all the food and stuff?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, and then some.\u201d Eric indicates a spot a short distance away where several boxes of pizza and some more drinks have been laid out on a blanket on the ground. Not only that, you can also see a couple of backpacks, what look suspiciously like rolled-up sleeping bags, and even some small tents ready to be set up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric notices your look of surprise and explains: \u201cWhile Jake was digging around in his garage he also found some old camping gear. And then I remembered we still had most of the stuff my brother used when he went on that survival course last year, so we decided it might be fun to make this a proper camping trip.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt makes sense, really,\u201d adds Jake. \u201cIt\u2019s the best of both worlds. We can pop back home whenever we want for a shower and a change of clothes, but then we\u2019re out here by ourselves, exploring our own private world and all its secrets. We can be slobs who send for take-out whenever we need\u2014or we can be real explorers who live off the land!\u201d He winks at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d continues Eric, \u201cMy brother told me all about how to forage for stuff in the wilderness.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow you don\u2019t think his brother\u2019s loony survivalist cronies taught him about lands where everything and everyone is a tiny fraction of normal size, but you can certainly follow the way your friends\u2019 minds are working right now\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo it\u2019s agreed then? We spend a few days here exploring and hunting, and see what happens?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, why not,\u201d you shrug. It\u2019s not as though you have anything better to do anyway, and this is bound to turn out to be the trip of a lifetime!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so what shall we do first?\u201d asks Jake.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before you have a chance to say anything Eric opens his mouth:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's eat. It's hard work remodelling landscapes and demolishing all these puny little sub-standard buildings. And when you're big, growing guys like we all are...\" He trails off with a knowing smirk. Far from considering it \"hard work\" he's getting as much of a kick out of being a huge, unstoppable titan as you and Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you were completely honest you'd have to admit that you'd be quite happy to continue exploring for a while longer, or at least spend a bit of time examining the various little toys you've collected in your pocket. But maybe your friends are right: now that they've mentioned it you notice the tempting aroma of the pizzas and realise that you're actually quite hungry after today's dramatic events.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay guys, find a spot and I'll bring the food,\" you call as you go to fetch the pizza boxes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear them joking with each other as they pretend to clear the ground for the three of you to sit. At your scale the land seems relatively flat and featureless anyway. It's just a matter of scuffing aside a few stray trees with their giant sneakers and flicking away a single tiny tractor that has been caught exposed as it attempts to crawl away across the open fields.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile you find your own source of amusement. A herd of cows has wandered up in curiosity to inspect the towering cardboard boxes that have mysteriously appeared in their territory. You imagine that they and the other tiny creatures on the ground must be confused by the overpowering scent of cooked bread, cheese and meat that is now drifting across the countryside. You peek over the boxes at them and whisper \"BOO!\" Immediately the herd stampedes, running in terror in the opposite direction. You rock back on your haunches and laugh while making a mental note to search later for the tiny farmhouse of their owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou carry the boxes over to where your friends are now sitting. Jake has set the soda bottle containing the tiny passenger ferry down on the ground next to him. It stands upright, rising high into the air like a glass skyscraper, the waning sunlight glittering off its surface and illuminating the little toy boat that is bobbing helplessly up and down on the liquid inside. Once again you wonder to yourself whether Jake really plans to drink out of it, bearing in mind you've already seen the passengers vomiting and doing who-knows-what else into the soda from the vertigo and terror of being carried around by a colossal teenager. You decide not to mention any of that to Jake, however - at least not until <u>after</u> he has taken a few swallows...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three of you settle down and begin eating. After a few moments Eric grimaces and turns to complain to Jake: \"I told you we should have gone to that other place. These things taste like cardboard. We should have brought some extras to spice them up a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when you get the idea. Jake and Eric watch with incredulity as you reach into your shorts pocket, pull out the little \"trinkets\" you've collected, and begin sprinkling them onto the pizza.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the heck did you get those from!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou give them a smug grin. \"While <u>you</u> two were busy crushing everything in sight <u>I</u> decided to do something useful and collect a few souvenirs to play with later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou all snicker at the antics of the tiny helpless people and their vehicles as they struggle to move through the vast expanse of warm melted cheese and avoid building-sized chunks of pineapple. It's an almost impossible task, and before long they are all hopelessly entangled in the topping. You can see the wheels of the vehicles spinning furiously, but this only results in them sinking down even more quickly into the morass, forcing those inside to abandon them. Naturally it is only right that you should help them out, and for the next few minutes the three of you have great fun toying with your little captives, poking and prodding them, pushing them around with your fingers, watching them strain to free themselves - or be sucked under the surface of the cheese.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Eric scoops up a mound of the soft cheese on the end of his index finger. As he lifts it into the air it stretches out in a string, a few centimeters long. Dangling upside-down at the end of this string, his legs glued to the sticky topping, is a tiny man. As he struggles and yells you all laugh; Eric merely wiggles his finger some more, making the little guy swing about in larger and larger circles. Finally he raises his finger above his head and opens his mouth in anticipation. While you and Jake look on Eric slowly and deliberately lowers the tiny man into his mouth, making sure the helpless victim can see exactly where he is heading. The screaming guy disappears into the depths of Eric's maw and the mouth closes... Your friend makes an exaggerated gulping motion and then pats his stomach with satisfaction. He opens his mouth again for you to see: it's empty!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way!\" Even Jake seems shocked by Eric's callousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I told you these pizzas needed more flavouring. Tiny people make the perfect topping!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver the pragmatist Jake quickly snatches up and gulps down a person of his own. Things then degenerate into a messy scramble as your two buddies chase down and devour the remaining survivors. You let them get on with it and finish your own helping - minus extras. You have to admit there's a certain thrill in watching your friends as monstrous giants, grabbing and eating tiny people as though they are nothing but little candies or treats, but on the other hand you don't yet feel inclined to go quite that far yourself. For now you're content being an all-powerful, capricious and destructive god to these people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Jake picks up the half-filled bottle containing the ferry and takes a deep swig. He burps and then makes a face. \"Ugh, this stuff must have gone bad.\" He tosses the bottle away in disgust and it shatters on the ground a few feet away, obliterating the ferry and its passengers in the process. You guess that means the meal is officially over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough Eric stands up and tugs on his crotch. \"I don't know about you guys, but I think it's time to...\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Time to take a leak!\"  A mischievous grin spreads across Eric's face as he unties his belt.  \"Damn, I really gotta go!  Too bad these little microbes can't scrape together a respectable-sized toilet!  Guess I'll have to find an 'anthill' to piss on!\"  You remember as kids when you were camping and had to relieve yourselves, you would locate the nearest, busiest anthill to soak with your streams.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea!\" shouts Jake.  \"Although, can you imagine how tiny the real anthills are in this world, compared to us?  We'd probably need an electron microscope or something.   Guess we''ll have to make due.\"  Eric and Jake grin at each other and scan the ground.  Only about five meters away is a pristine, untouched little suburb.  You imagine it is a commuter town, with row upon row of houses -- hundreds of them -- lined up with little circular cul-de-sacs here and there.  You not having to take a leak at this time, watch in amusement and your two buddies lumber toward the suburb until the first rows of houses lay at their feet.  The best part is that the town appears to be situated upon a slight mound, making it appear as an actual bustling anthill.  Eric and Jake both undo their belts and unzip their shorts.  Then, they pull out their penises.  The two of them start laughing aloud like a couple of schoolboys and they both unload their streams upon the defenseless populace.  The sound is reminiscent of someone pouring a water bottle out onto hot pavement.  A sizzling, bubbling sound emerges from the ground and you see steam rise as the houses are drowned under the virtual tidal wave of sour, acidic urine pouring down on them as if from hoses.  Although you stand far away still, you can only imagine the horror unfolding in that town.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you go to have some fun of your own.  You feel it necessary to further establish your dominance over these beings so you return to the terrorized city which is in a state of total chaos and panic, having had much of it crushed into dust.  Crowds have formed around the city center, where emergency vehicles including fire trucks, police forces are flashing tiny little lights.  It is a literal sea of people about two feet across.  Your approach is no doubt thunderously loud and ground-shaking, as evidenced by the tiny beings beginning to rush away to avoid getting stepped on.  \"Wait!\"  You speak in a deliberately stern, deep voice.  You halt your approach at the edge of the mass of people, who are dwarfed by your massively bigger feet.  The majority of the crowd stops, frozen in terror.  \"I've decided to let you live.\"  Immediately a foolish police car breaks from the crowd blaring its miniscule sounding siren.  The driver tries escaping by driving in between your two feet, perhaps thinking that as a giant you must have slow reflexes or be too clumsy to react.  \"Not so fast,\" you say as you simply step back, let the driver gain a little distance, and effortlessly, almost lazily, lift your foot and bring it down upon the doomed vehicle before it makes it more than a few inches.  A satisfying crunch is heard as you lift your foot to reveal the flattened toy car.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I was saying, I decided to let you live... as long as we understand that two things.  One, you bugs all have to do what I say, and two, no one escapes.  A cruel smirk spreads across your face and you look down upon your little sea of slaves, who are staring up at you in terror.  \"Heheh, the first thing your new god requires is to be washed... starting with my feet.  It's been a long day and I've been exercising quite a lot.. so let's get going!\"  You sit down, pull off your sneakers and socks, and lay them next to you.  You stretch your legs out in front of you and lean back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nInitially, no one from the massive crowd of this few hundred people moves an inch.  The unpleasant task before them must not appeal.  \"Do I need to make another example out of someone?\"  Only then does the crowd move forward.  Emergency vehicles and helicopters close in as well.  Within minutes you have dozens of tiny little people climbing fire truck ladders and dangling from cranes to ascend your colossal soles.  You watch with glee as little men crawl in and out of your toe spaces with hoses.  The feelings of the little ant-people scaling the fleshy surface is simply delightful.  You chuckle when you even see some of the little bugs up by your toes wearing gas masks as you command them to rake up the substantial amount of foot crud that has accumulated in the crevices.  Your movements cause you to shift your foot slightly and a few unfortunates fall to their deaths at the base of your foot, where most of the people are situated with hoses and soap.  \"Oops..\" you say.  Like good little slaves, the populace continues working, too terrified of you to dare react.   Next, teeny helicopters whizzing by your feet start spraying entire loads of water against your tough soles -- loads which were meant for putting out fires.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to admit to yourself that you enjoy being revered as a giant god.  Creating this pointless work and debasing this population is loads of fun, especially when you know you're eventually going to squash these bugs like the rest of the specks you've squashed.  In the mean time, watching them toil away like egyptian slaves on the pyramids, except instead of wearing rags like ancient egyptians, they're wading through your toejam in modern hazmat suits, is plenty amusing for now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>For a while you just rest there, enjoying the incredible sensation of having your feet cleansed by a tiny captive population. Indeed, it is so relaxing that you lean back further until you are lying on your back, with your hands behind your head, your knees bent, and your feet flat on the ground. You\u2019d think it might be uncomfortable, reclining on the shattered rubble of a city, but you are so massive that everything simply crumbles away into dust beneath you. It\u2019s almost like resting on a sandy beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost involuntarily you wiggle your toes in pleasure, but when you feel a series of tiny pops you realise immediately what has just happened. You\u2019ve accidentally squashed some of your tiny slaves between your toes! \u201cOops!\u201d you snicker insincerely. Like the ancient pharaohs you expect your slaves to give up their lives for your glorification. And there are plenty more to take their place...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you continue to enjoy the ministrations of the hundreds of tiny slaves you idly glance across to where your footwear is resting on the ground nearby. Seen from closer to ground level the sheer incongruity of the situation is more striking than ever before. A pair of what are nothing more than ordinary sneakers towers over a battered and smoking cityscape, the white rubber looming above buildings and people alike and casting the crowded city park into deep shadow. It occurs to you that this scene of destruction is more like something you might see in one of the more mindless summer blockbusters. The notion appeals to you and you make a mental note to explore the idea further later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut despite how overwhelmingly gigantic these edifices are to the denizens of this tiny world, to you they are still nothing more than your favourite pair of sneakers. At first glance it might seem that you\u2019ve taken a stroll through thick woodland, or perhaps a rugged wasteland. Each sneaker appears splattered with dirt and mud, heavily scuffed, and with small stones and pieces of vegetation peeking out from under the treads. Except, of course, the vegetation consists of not twigs or moss, but rather entire trees that have been snapped like matchsticks. And the \u201cstones\u201d are in fact the rubble from buildings: homes, schools, offices\u2014not to mention the fragments of once-proud skyscrapers that you\u2019ve effortlessly kicked over. Your own \u201cskyscraper\u201d threatens to rise within your shorts as you consider the effortless destructive power you wield over the puny little beings that are now literally at your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll in all, the surface of your sneakers has become a vivid record of your passage through this world. For one brief moment you sigh as you consider the time and effort it will take to clean them. But then you realise: YOU don\u2019t have to! You have an entire workforce ready (if not willing) to do the job for you. What makes the idea even more appealing is the knowledge that the \u201cdebris\u201d they will be removing is actually the crushed wreckage of their own homes, cars, and neighbourhoods. Perhaps they\u2019ll even find their missing friends and family squashed into the treads. You snicker cruelly at the thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout bothering to give any warning you get to your feet. Naturally, this cataclysmic activity is disastrous for those involved in cleaning your toes and soles. People flee in panic to escape being trodden on, but for many there is no escape and your feet are quickly splattered with numerous addition stains...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou retrieve your sneakers and return to the city park, which is still crowded with refugees with nowhere else to go. You strike a suitably impressive pose and once again adopt the stern, deep voice of authority as you address them with the arrogant tone that is appropriate for one of your stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLittle beings, I have been satisfied with your work so far, and so I have another task for you. My sneakers require cleansing and it is beneath my dignity to perform such a mundane task, especially since it is YOUR fault that they have become defiled. I therefore require you to clean them thoroughly, both inside and out.\u201d You pause for a moment to scan the crowds for a reaction, but they seem too overawed to offer any resistance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVery well, then,\u201d you continue and hold the two sneakers out at arm\u2019s length in front of you. \u201cCatch!\u201d And then you simply drop them, smirking as the two gigantic objects fall out of the sky. You\u2019ve taken care to position them directly above the densest crowds and are rewarded when the sneakers land directly on top of them, squashing them instantly. Part of you knows you should feel bad about this, but at the same time there is something unfailingly exciting about being so huge and powerful that you can so effortlessly squish an entire crowd of people for your own amusement as though they are merely tiny ants underfoot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sneakers fortuitously tumble over onto their sides, allowing easy access to their interiors\u2014as well as the heavily-crusted treads. Satisfied, you once again settle back down on the ground and gesture for a new group of slaves to resume work on your feet, while others organise themselves to tackle the considerably more difficult task of cleaning your sneakers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a while you simply lie there and watch them, fascinated by the tiny scurry of activity as they attempt to grapple with the titanic objects. You even wonder if you should collect a few to keep in an \u201cant farm\u201d on your desk back home. They would certainly make a soothing, if distracting, desktop toy while doing your homework. In fact, the miniature bustle is a little too soothing, and the hypnotic movements of the little creatures, along with the pleasant tickling on your feet, only serves to make you drowsy. Before you even know it you\u2019ve dozed off...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are brought back to full awareness by a noise echoing across the landscape. Eric is calling you. You sigh at the unwelcome interruption and reluctantly get to your feet, heedlessly obliterating a few more hapless crews in the process. You\u2019d much prefer to ignore the oaf and enjoy the exclusive attention of the little people for a while longer, but you know that if you fail to respond your friends will just come looking for you anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check on the condition of your sneakers and are rewarded by the sight of a number of ramps that have been set up around the openings to allow the hazmat-suited workers and their heavy-duty cleaning vehicles access to the interior of the footwear. No doubt the partially-enclosed environment within your sneakers is even worse than your bare feet, being almost unbearably hot, humid and dark. You can already see minute flickers of light that are undoubtedly tiny mining lights on the former construction workers\u2019 hard hats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther clean-up crews have erected scaffolding and set up ladders next to the towering expanse of the treads so they can excavate deep within the debris-filled canyons. As you crouch down next the discarded sneakers to inspect the activity more closely you notice, to your satisfaction, a number of tiny men already crawling inside the treads and sifting through the debris.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it. Make sure you clean all the way inside,\u201d you encourage them. You can only imagine what horrifying discoveries those workers must be making,  but of course that is not your problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have more important work to do,\u201d you inform them pompously. \u201cBut I expect these tasks to be completed by the time I return. Otherwise...\u201d You leave the sentence hanging threateningly as you inwardly exult once more at your all-powerful status as a giant teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make as though to leave, but then turn back as though you\u2019ve just remembered something. \u201cOh, by the way, you might as well clean out the insides of my socks too. They\u2019re probably even more sweaty than my sneakers by now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than letting them plan how to tackle that project you decide for them by reaching down and plucking up a number of tiny things at random between your thumb and forefinger. A couple of fire engines and police cars (complete with occupants), as well as a bunch of random people, are dropped, one by one, into your waiting socks, which you then shake gently to make sure the tiny captives fall all the way to the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnickering to yourself at the thought of what your little slaves will have to endure, you stroll off barefoot to see what your friends want.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cCome and see what we did!\u201d Eric gestures excitedly as he notices you approaching. He leads you back to the little commuter town that he and Jake were terrorizing earlier. Jake is already squatting next to it, poking at something on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook! Dont\u2019cha think that\u2019s neat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour friends have diverted a small nearby river and converted it into a moat that now entirely surrounds the bottom of the small mound on which the little neighbourhood is situated, effectively cutting it off and trapping the inhabitants. Not only that, they\u2019ve filled it with piss: some that has no doubt trickled down the hillside from when they urinated on the town earlier; they must have topped-off the supply by continuing with their crude games while you were otherwise engaged. And sure enough...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re just in time. This should be pretty neat.\u201d  Without bothering to stand up Jake unzips once more and aims his penis at the bank of the river, just below where a row of high-wealth houses are arranged like tiny models. As he sends a stream of hot urine thundering into the river, splashing the houses a little in the process, you notice the level of the liquid rise a few more feet until it has almost reached the top of the banks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, he finishes and carelessly shakes away the remaining drops, which land with the force of mortars in nearby streets. \u201cJust watch,\u201d he instructs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first you think nothing is going to happen. With the exception of the few drops of spray he didn\u2019t even manage to hit the houses. But then you realize what Jake was doing. The ground is by now completely saturated with the revolting liquid, and that final high-pressure burst, coupled with the rise in level, was enough to tip the balance... As the three of you look on the edge of the bank begins to crumble away and fall into the liquid... carrying the houses with it. One by one the little residences begin to tilt and sway, and then slowly tumble into the stagnant pool of urine. At the last moment you see a tiny family rush out of the door of the final house, carrying a few precious belongings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey! Not so fast\u201d Jake exclaims and quickly reaches down to pinch them between his fingers.\u201dTime for your bath, I think\u201d. He dangles the screaming, pleading family over the middle of the moat\u2014and then deliberately drops them into the gently steaming urine. Almost immediately there is a burst of activity on the far side of the river, where a group of would-be rescuers have been building some rafts. As you and your friends watch with fascination, two men push a boat into the urine, leap inside, and begin rowing towards the choking, spluttering family. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRowing is hard work. Maybe we should help them out,\u201d Eric remarks. He too squats down and blows gently on the little boat. \u201cGentle\u201d is, of course, a relative term, and the boat begins to rock violently under the high winds. The two occupants try desperately to stabilise the stricken vessel, but only succeed in making matters worse until with despairing cries they too fall into the urine as the boat overturns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood job!\u201d laughs Jake, as he picks up a fallen tree that is smaller than a matchstick, strips it of its branches and uses it to push the people under the surface of the urine, making sure they all swallow plenty of it. \u201cNooo! You\u2019re supposed to HOLD ON!\u201d he mocks as he submerges them again and again. Eventually he drops the tree into the urine next to them and leaves them to cling to it and survive as best they can, while he and Eric get to their feet and high-five. You have to admit it WAS pretty funny, if rather childish, and you are reminded of your earlier thoughts about them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what have you been up to?\u201d asks Eric. \u201cAnd what happened to your sneakers?\u201d he adds, looking down at your bare feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I guess I trod in something, so they needed cleaning. I left them to dry off for a while.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, whatever.\u201d Jake dismisses the subject. \u201cWhat shall we do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis would seem to be the perfect time to put some plans into motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cActually, I had an idea before...,\u201d you begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSeriously? You had an idea? That\u2019s a first!\u201d chortles Jake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least it\u2019s better than playing with my own piss,\u201d you retort. \u201cBut if you\u2019re not interested in hearing it...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, man. Jake\u2019s just fooling around. What did you have in mind?\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then, you remember that you entrapped another little slave down there as well -- the microteen.  There's no reason he should be exempt from his duty!  After all, if you're going to claim ownership of a tiny civilization of humans, it means that you own their lives too.   And since you own them, their lives are yours to do with as you please and naturally their lives exist solely for you, as their god, to utilize or crush as you desire.  You pull back the elastic waistband of your shorts and look down at the brown, coiled nest of pubic hair and see the little bug crouching inside the pubic hair sitting directly atop the shaft of your penis.  He sees you reaching your colossal fingertips down to pinch him and, perhaps afraid that you're going to simply squeeze him like a gnat, starts to scramble away.  \"Don't worry, little guy.. I won't hurt you.. hehe,\" you remark playfully.  He continues scrambling away, without success.  You easily grip him in between two fingers and decide what to do.  You could place him in between your toes, to join the rest of the slaves who are washing your giant-sized feet.  Or, you could set aside a special task for him.  Maybe you could give him the choice.  You lift the little guy up to your ear, tilt your head to the side, and let him tumble inside so that you could hear the little gnat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope you'll understand me almost forgetting you were in my crotch, it's hard to keep track of a guy so tiny,\" you announce triumphantly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little teen replies \"Drop dead, you giant jerk.  What did you do with my family?  Where is my mom!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not how you should talk to your god,\" you reply with a snicker.  \"But I'll let your disrespect slide for now.  I don't know where your mommy and daddy are.  Maybe I stepped on them.  I can't be expected to notice each bug I've ever crushed, not when they're all so tiny and look the same, heheh.  Or maybe I've put them to work licking my toes.  Who can say?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou expect your coy answers to enrage the teen further, which they do.  \"You're not a god!  You think no one can tell that you're just some evil kid from somewhere?  We can open portals to other worlds -- we've been doing it for years, bringing guests from other worlds.  They've always been peaceful, normal sized beings, though.  This is the first time we've stumbled across giants -- we never expected beings so huge could exist.  And worse, that they would take advantage of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to reply that you are the normal sized ones and that his race (along with all the others he's encountered) are all just teeny runts, but you have to admit, it's much more satisfying to think of yourself as being a massive, unstoppable giant -- which to these people you are.  Or, perhaps he's right and yours is truly a race of giants and you never realized it.  Instead, you ask the runt his name, to which he replies that it is Mark.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, kiddo.. I was going to put you to work raking up the foot crud between my toes, hehe.. but I think you deserve a special job.  You can get started rubbing down my giant cock!

You've had your fun long enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but enjoy his little pleading from inside your ear.  Hearing a kid the same age as you beg for you not to torture or crush him like a bug reinforces your own sense of egotism.  You really may as well be a God to these little people.  You remember as a kid reading books and watching movies in which giant aliens attack and take over Earth.  Never would you have imagined that you could be playing the role of the giant alien establishing dominance over a tiny race of terrestrials.  But back to the matter at hand... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I let you go back?  What can you possibly do if I decide to just keep you as my little pet for the rest of your miniscule existence?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe replies: \"I'll do whatever you want; I'll clean those big stinking feet of yours if you want!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing the runt actually asking to wash your toes amuses you immensely, but the fact that he asked for that task immediately turns you off to the idea.  It means he finds it to be the least detestable of the possibilities that he is imagining.  The last thing you want to do is give him a task he wants!  \"Hehe, I already have an army of a good number of slaves working on my feet.  I think you deserve a special task.  I'm going to set you down on my big cock -- then you can lick it clean.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please no!\" he shouts.  You let out a cruel snicker as you stick your finger inside your ear to dig out the shouting little teen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please no!\" Mark yelled within the pink cavernous passage.  He heard his voice echo along the sticky wax-encrusted walls of the giant's fleshy ear canal.  He couldn't feel more like a insignificant parasite inside of this giant teenager's head.  Then, the cavern shaked and Mark fell to the floor.  He looked out through the opening to the blue sky, and the opening quickly was invaded by the large pink fleshy surface that was the giant's colossal fingertip. It rapidly intruded into the ear canal, filling up the entire tunnel.  Mark tried to stay as close to the floor as possible; but the greasy flesh wasn't offering much of a surface to hold onto.  He looked up and saw the grooved fingertip lowering.   It pressed down on Mark with crushing force as it tried to slide Mark along the floor.  He was displaced several yards, the the fingertip lifted up into the air again, moved forward, and pressed down again, this time with its giant fingernail pressing down into his back.  The cavern rumbled: \"Come out, come out!\"  The deep, thunderous voice of the giant caused the whole passage to vibrate and Mark to shake.  Mark looked up to see the giant fingertip press down again and Mark was pushed out even further until he was pressed against another fleshy surface which was the giant's thumb.  Now pinched tightly between the giant's thumb and index finger like a helpless fly, Mark was hurled violently through the air until he saw in front of his face two massive eyes examining him.  The giant's grinning expression was terrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Mark was thrust downward and plonked down onto another fleshy surface which he recognized as the giant-sized penis which he had become familiarized with earlier during his entrapment in the pubes.  He lay for a few seconds before getting to his feet; standing atop the shaft.  He caught his breath as he looked upward to see the giant smirking at him from the sky.  It seemed he had no choice.  Battered and beaten, Mark walked along the shaft of the veiny appendange until he reached the glans.  The aroma of semen and sweat was repulsive to Mark, and the sticky, glistening surface was even worse to look at.  Holding his breath, Mark got down on his hands and knees.  He couldn't be more disgusted with himself for what he was about to do.  He bent his head over and began to lick the giant penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch with immense pleasure as the micro-teen debases himself on your cock.  You relish imagining how degraded he must feel, being forced to lick another guy's dick.  The best part is that you have no intention of keeping your word to this little speck.  In your estimation, he's your pet to do with as you please.  </span></div></div>",

You stride over to the edge of the city, not very comfortable with the idea of having these tiny people crawling around your enormous body like bugs while you lay down to get some sleep.  The ground is grassy and green in this area, so you lean down, stretch out your legs, and try to take a snooze on this relatively soft surface.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long you feel an annoying itch in your groin.

It would be so easy to just squish him but you suppose you could use someone to chat with as you drift off.  You bring the little guy up to your ear and let him tumble in the side, as you did with his family earlier, and lay back down with your hands crossed behind your head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... how was the ride?\" you ask, teasingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a disgusting slob!  Don't you have any shame at all?\" the tiny teenager shouts angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah.\" you reply playfully.  \"What was it like, being next to the most gigantic cock in the world, more massive than your whole downtown?  Were you afraid of falling off?\" you say, smirking and self-satisfied at the truthful comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a pig.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I didn't ask to be this big.  But if suddenly I'm big, well... why not enjoy being big?  Say, I should find another part of my body to trap you when I wake up.  How does an afternoon cleaning between my toes sound?   You can be one of the lucky people to experience the all-day smell of my feet!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You wake up entirely refreshed and feeling great.  Normally, you go for a long run every morning just upon rising and before breakfast.  You have no interest in changing your routine today.  At least this time, you have some different scenery.  You unzip the flap of your tent and enjoy the fresh morning air.  You put on your two running sneakers and your shorts only, enjoying the feel of the wind against your bare chest. You typically run shirtless.  You stretch inside of the tent, then step out of the tent onto the fields, feeling a slight crunch under your shoe as you step upon someone's barn.  You look toward the city that you were terrorizing yesterday, still wrecked in many places.  Revisiting it could be fun, but you decide to strike out for new territory this morning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin with a jog and within seconds break into a well paced sprint.  The feel of the air against your chest is exhilarating.  You are running through forested territory right now, each stride you make causing deep prints as dozens of little trees snap under every footfall.  You look around you as you run; the terrain is rather flat in all directions.  The geography might be as dynamic as your own world's from the perspective of these little people, but to you their hills are barely noticeable and their mountains don't reach anywhere near your height.  Every now and then you see little white houses in the fields.  Once in a while, you veer a little to the side to trample the closest ones as you run.   You relish imagining some quaint little family sitting together for breakfast, feeling what seems like an earthquake from your thunderous approach, until your vast sole stamps down upon their house from the sky.  You demolish several little homes in this fashion, adjusting your stride so that one of your two feet lands squarely upon each residence, flattening them.  You never look back at the wreckage; you're intent on not letting the tiny homes distract you from your run.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run for at least three miles.  You even plow through another large city, but then you reach a body of water.  Soon you will go back, but a break wouldn't hurt.  Your breathing is only a little labored due to how well trained you are but the heat is causing you to sweat profusely, you realize.  You could really use a bath after all the activity from yesterday.  This body of water seems to be a sea or an ocean, as you cannot see a coast in the distance.  You sit down and untie your sneakers and place them in the middle of the field you are sitting in.  You then pull off your shorts as well.  Suddenly you see that tiny teenager wrapped in your pubes, right beside your comparatively enormous penis... which makes him look more insignificant than ever.  You forgot about him.  Amazed that he stayed on, you unwrap him from the wiry hair and drop him into your sneaker, whose odor is surely especially potent after such a hot and sweaty run.  Too bad for him!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk to the beach bare naked and stand upon it, disappointed at how its width barely matches the length of your feet.  Its rather expansive lengthwise, however. This is a pretty quiet beach your surmise, because the number of visitors is quite sparse.  The few next to you scatter the second you strided onto the beach.  You're not really that interested in terrorizing people right now, though.  Instead, you walk into the ocean, enjoying the cool wet feel the second you step in.  However, the water here is only puddle deep.  You kick the water, sending a little splash into the air and allowing you to see the floor momentarily.  You're a giant, you recall, so you'll need to go farther out.  You continue in, and before long the water goes up to your ankles, then your knees, and finally after about five minutes of wading through this pitiful body of water, your waist.   You dunk your head beneath the surface, basking in the new cleanliness that the water offers, then resurface.  The water is deep enough to suspend you here, you realize, so you go under again and enjoy swimming underwater for a brief time.  It may be like swimming in a kiddy pool, but it's better than nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue this for several minutes.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a final submersion, you arise out of the water again and are greeted by an exciting sight.  Your face pops up in front of about a dozen ships, each of them only two or three inches across!  You stand on the ocean floor and rise up to your full height in order to examine them further from above. They appear to be a formation of battleships, perhaps a sort of patrol.  They are coming toward your navel quite rapidly.  You can see them trying to turn.  You lean over and watch as the tiny crewmembers scurry around the deck of the nearest ship, panicking as their little vessel comes mere inches from colliding against the wall of flesh that comprises your muscular abdomen.  You take a step back and give them space.  But before you even begin moving, the ship already has begun opening fire from its little cannons.  \"Ack!\" you shout, bringing your hand down to defend your tender abdomen from the surprisingly irritating stings the cannonfire causes.  With your other hand, you place it over the ship, creating a dome around it with your palm.  You grasp your fingers around the bottom of the ship and squeeze the metal hull like it were putty.  By the time you finish tightening your fist, you can feel your fingers pressing against your palm.  You release your hand and observe the crushed, nearly flattened battleship.  You watch gleefully as little sailor men jump off the sinking remains of the ship into the water.  More are probably trapped in the hull, you surmise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly you have an idea for the other ships.  You clear your throat.  \"You see what I like to do to bugs that bite.  But if you do what I say, I will let you go... at least half of you.  We're going to play a game of battleships.  Whoever wins gets to go home.\"  You can hardly contain yourself at the excitement.  \"But there are eleven of your little ships here.  I'll have to even the playing field first.\"  You step toward another ship and pick this one up into the air.  You bring it front of your face to study its little crewmembers, who are falling off the surface from the uneven ascent you give them.  You grin at the survivors on top and turn the ship upside down, amused by how a hundred little white navy men fall off in unison and plummet to the water far below.  You give the ship a long and hard shake to smash the interior crew against the walls of their own ship.  Then, you simply toss it in the distance.  \"There we go, now it's five against five.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can hardly expect these ships to pit themselves against each other so you intervene, gently gripping the ships, picking them up, and separating them into two little fleets.  You make sure each of them has a carrier with little planes on it.  When the two fleets are assembled, you clap your hands together.  \"Begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take long for fire to ring out as the little fleets begin shooting their cannons at each other.  These were allies only seconds ago, but neither of them will dare incur your wrath by either losing or not fighting.  You watch from the sideline as planes begin to fly off the deck of the carriers and attack the opposing fleet. The little explosions from their bombs as they fly only a few inches higher than the vessels excites you further.  Before long, one of the ships is so badly damaged that it begins sinking.  The naval batttle continues until one side begins to start clearly winning.  There four ships left in it, against only one from the other side.  You watch as the last ship sinks and then congratulate the winners.  \"Excellent work.  You guys will make some good entertainment in my fish tank back home!\"  You scoop the four ships up in one palm and grin down at them, noting the crews are looking up at your snickering face and shouting angrily.  No doubt they are enraged by the apparent emptiness of your promise.  \"Now now, I said you would get to go home.  I just didn't mention that it was my home you were going back to.  Be thankful I don't smash you all here and now, hahah.\"  You carry them back to shore and find your shorts.  You pick them up and realize that you have a supply of vehicles and people in one of your pockets.  You empty them out, having lost interest and realizing you can get more whenever you want.  A little shower of cars and specks rains down to the ground.  You drop the four little ships in their place, satisfied that most of the sailors have taken cover in the interior of the hulls.  They should be safe for the run back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit on the ground and begin to put on your socks and sneakers.  Suddenly you remember the little teen you dropped inside.  You lean down to leer over into your sneaker to see which one you trapped him in.  You are amused when you see his little form scaling the wall of your sneaker, gripping the fabric and attempting to climbing out of the enormous object.  He doesn't seem to see you observing him, which makes it even more fun to give the object a shake.  You laugh at how easily he is startled; he loses his grip and tumbles against the fabric wall to the soft, sticky sole once again.  Then you lean down and pick him up, dropping him into your ear canal in the usual fashion.  \"Where did you think you were going?  We haven't had enough fun together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a monster.  I was getting out of that big, stinking sneaker of yours.  Don't ever put me in there again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or what?  You'll tickle my toes?  You can't hurt me when you're the size of a gnat, kid.  What's your name, anyway?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mark, like you even care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we're off.  But since your attitude has resurfaced you get to ride in my crotch again.\"  You plop him out of your ear canal with suction and hold him in your hand.</span></div></div>",

You open your eyes and find Mark standing in it, but now he's the size of a baseball!  He is getting bigger and bigger you realize.  You watch with trepidation as he grows and grows and soon becomes too heavy for you to hold.  You slip your palm out from under him and he lands safely on the field... which has also expanded in size.  Now you get it: he's not growing.  You are shrinking...!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You run back to the camp with Mark dangling in the pubes of your sweaty nether region.   By the time you get back, Jake and Eric are still asleep, as evidenced by the closure of their tent.  You really want to get cleaned off before starting the day so you gather your things and nab the crystal from Eric's backpack, and trudge your way back through the city you terrorized earlier to the shiny circle that Eric and Jake used to exit earlier wearing only your shorts and sneakers.   Your sneakers are muddy from the run so before leaving you try wiping your feet off using intact portions of the city as a sort of friction mat to slide your feet across. Afterward, you inspect the bottoms and note that there is still a lot of debris, so you pick up a tent pole and grind away at the bottom with it to scrape out the layer of trees and little homes that have become entrenched deep in the muddy treads. The results are imperfect, but you have a brand new pair of sneakers at home anyway that you promise you won't use for stepping on ant-sized civilizations.  You don't want to ruin them too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step through the shiny circle and before you know it, you're in your own backyard.  You finish, and then rush upstairs toward your room and take your shorts off, standing completely naked in your bedroom.You look down and see Mark's tiny little form holding on desperately to a single strand of your rope-like pubic hair.  It looks like he became dislodged from the tangle and is about to fall off.  Smirking, your lower your hand below your crotch and then bring it up from under Mark's dangling form, scooping him into your palm.  \"Looks like someone almost fell down.  That wouldn't have been pretty.  By the way, I'm going to take a bath now.\"  You look at Mark's form in your palm, unclear of what he appears to be shouting.  You bring your palm closer to your ear slowly, stopping once you hear him cry out that \"you need one.\"  You frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can understand why he'd say that, having been trapped in a gigantic track star's well-worn running shoe that was filled by his equally gigantic foot all day, as well being forcibly stuffed next to his sweaty balls for a long time. Still.  \"I don't think your attitude befits someone of your stature.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn idea to punish the little runt springs to mind almost instantly.  Before you bathe, you often jack off.  What better way to get revenge on this little punk for effectively accusing you of stinking than to jizz all over him?  You lower him onto your desk and sit on the chair, pulling one of your own socks off.   \"Guess where you're going,\" you snigger sadistically.  You bring the sock to the edge of the desk and with your free hand, usher the micro-teen inside.  He resists as he is naturally afraid of the fall, so you flick him with your finger -- not too hard though.  He tumbles along the inner edge of the fabric.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark's descent was nasty to say the least.  The all too familiar smell of this giant teen's feet saturated the air and made Mark feel like he was going to choke.  He tumbled along the moist fabric walls of the sock to the even damper, almost soggy area where the giant's toes had rested all day and throughout his run.  Mark got to his feet and looked up at the smirking visage looking down at him from above the sock.  A great deal of hatred for the arrogant and selfish titan above him swelled inside Mark.  Then, before he knew it, Mark's stomach turned as he felt the sock being jerked around.  The center of gravity seemed to change and Mark struggled to keep steady as the sock appeared to be turning horizontally.  Then, something Mark hadn't expected occurred.  He looked toward the opening and saw his captor's penis being inserted into the fabric.  \"He wouldn't... he can't be that disgusting,\" Mark said to himself.  Obviously he was wrong.  Besides being inundated with this giant athlete's foot odor, he was about to be the victim of the ejection of a surely large volume of his joy juice from his advancing cock.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walls of the fabric around the thick, glistening penis came together as the captor wrapped his fingers around the covered shaft.  Soon the entire prison began shaking.  Mark steadied himself at the very end of the sock, praying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rub harder and harder, with your eyes closed.  It only takes you about thirty seconds to do it.  A satisfying release comes over you as you feel your ejaculate shoot out.  You pull the sock off your rock-hard penis, a little tired.  You pull apart the opening and see, at the bottom, Mark's tiny form face flat in the milky liquid.  </span></div></div>",

He is plastered against the fabric, utterly consumed by the sticky substance, struggling to lift his head up and breathe.  You smirk at the sight of this little guy desperately trying to break free from your semen but unable to due to the sheer volume and viscosity of the substance.  \"Now I'll take my bath,\" you say to him.  \"Let's hope you can get out of that before it dries!\"  You tie up the end of the sock and stuff it into your sneaker once again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand naked and and walk across the room to your bathroom and turn the water on.  You pour some shampoo into the hot, steaming water and wait for it to fill.  You remember that you had those ships that you won from your game in the little world.  You eagerly walk over to your shorts on the floor, lift them into the air, and reach into the pocket gently,  hoping that you didn't crunch these prizes as well from the movements of your body.   You feel the little edges of the ships and grip them one at a time.  Just the slightest scraping could cause significant damage to the hulls of these ships.  Unfortunately, one of them which was sitting at the very bottom of your pocket has become too far deformed that it surely will not  function in the tub  Its siding is ripped clean open.  You place it on your desk and place a shot glass over it face down.  You may have lost the ship but you at least can toy with its survivors later.  The rest of the ships are intact and ready to rock.  So you walk to the tub again and then, at the farthest edge of the tub from the water, you lean down and gently lay them on the surface.  To your satisfaction, they float!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shut the water off and then stride into the tub yourself.  The water reaches the height of your shins, and you notice that the ships drift closer to the hairy pillars that are your legs the longer you stand there.  So, very gently, you kneel down and sit back, resting your head against the far wall.  The water has become filled with suds.  Some of the mountains of suds tower over the puny fleet of ships.  You uncurl your legs which you were holding against your chest and being careful not to ram your feet against the ships, you split your legs apart and straddle the two walls of the tub.  The ships are now floating squarely in the middle of the tub with your torso against one wall your toes emerging from the water on the opposite wall.  The ships huddle in between your straightened out legs, giving the sailors and captains a first-class view of your hairy crotch, you surmise.  What to do now...  You could see simulate heavy hurricane-style tidal waves and give these tiny people a deadly ride.  Or, you could devise something more suited to to your more bodily, carnal urges. </span></div></div>",

You can't imagine how enormous your naked body must appear from the perspective of these tiny men.  You remember that when you first found them, you forced them to war against their own forces in exchange for your protection.  Then, they bore a half-day's journey inside the turbulent pocket of your shorts while you sprinted across their lands.  That they survived this long is rather amazing, when you think about it, and you can't wait to see how vigorous these military men are and what other conditions they can withstand.  The fact that these men are in the military makes it all the more enjoyable.  In their own world, you suspect that your captives are revered as tough guys among their ant-sized race.  But instead of feeling tough, you surmise that these bugs are shaking in fear of you at the moment, no doubt maddened by the fact that their alien captor is a teenaged guy with no military training.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down to examine more closely the little sailors on the decks, eager to familiarize yourself with some of their faces.  The first thing you notice upon leaning down is that the men are pouring out onto the decks and are inexplicably taking their little shirts off their chests.  On one of the ships, you suspect there are anywhere between fifty to seventy-five men frantically undressing.  That's odd, you think.  Are they trying to impress you with their miniature physiques?  You smile and open your mouth to gloat over their plight, until you notice that the men on the other two ships are  doing the same -- pulling their shirts off and tossing them onto the deck or the water.  You squint down and suddenly realize why, just by looking at the men's sweaty backs and matted hair .  The hot water is much too powerful for them.  To you, lying in eight inches of hot water is tolerable -- comfortable in fact.  But the hot, humid, tropical temperature down on the surface of that water is more like an overly hot sauna to these little men, who are completely enveloped by it.  You can see the steam rising up from the surface of the water alongside these boats, no doubt cooking whatever captives were foolish enough to remain within the hull.  \"Looks like you guys aren't enjoying the bath as much as me.  That's such a shame.  Maybe you would prefer I run the cold water?\"  You scan their individual faces, just waiting for an angry retort from one of these spineless punks, so that you could have a reason to squash somebody into jelly as an example. You know that you don't need to make an example, considering the great number of people that have been crushed beneath your feet already, but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable.  \"No one has anything to say?  Now don't tell me you're all going to give me the silent treatment.  That would spoil my fun.  And if you spoil my fun, then I have to find other forms of amusement.\"  You wink down at the quiet crews, who are staring up at you with defiant expressions on their faces as they fight against the unbearable heat.  You suspect that they realized that you enjoy their displays of fear as much as you enjoy the actual act of toying with them physically.  \"Heheh, alright, if that's how you guys want to play..\"  You lean forward and run the faucet again and notice that the ships are now being pushed away by the water, drifting closer to your crotch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sailors looked back in horror at the enormous pillar of water that pushed down from behind them.  They wondered if he planned to make the water ice cold.  Several men had already fainted from the heat of the steamy miasma of this tub.  Several died inside the hull because of the giant's thoughtless usage of the high temperature. To some, cold water would be welcome, regardless of the consequences that would come after.  However, that all changed once one of the men screamed out \"We're moving closer to him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the men all turned their heads in the opposite direction.  It was true.  On either side of the ships lay his two long, muscled legs and in front and above, a towering flat abdomen that was getting wider and wider.  And of course, directly in front of them lay an open, hairy crotch, thick with the teenager's wirey brown pubic hair. His glistening penis, which they noticed had remained erect throughout his entire stay in the tub, seemed to grow longer and longer.  \"Reverse!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hopeless.  The colossal teen simply stared down at them with a playful grin as he watched what was about to unfold.  As the nearest ship came within mere meters of the thick brown nest, the men all ran toward the opposite side of the ship in order to escape.  Several jumped off, even as the ship penetrated the first tangle of hairs on the giant's right groin.  The ropey strands extended above them, beneath, and along all sides of them as the ship continued to plow through the jungle.  The thick strands swept across the deck of the ship, in a clothesline motion, picking men up from the deck, knocking some off, and suffocating others.  Even the ones who attempted to jump off were caught in the tangle of hair that lay waiting in the water, ultimately drowning.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't help but snicker gleefully as you watch the dozens of little men squirm, swim, and suffer in the messy thick tangle of your pubes.  \"I guess that wasn't the most dignified way to go,\" you say gloatingly.  You watch as the other two ships make landfall against the tip of your penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe odor of the giant's reproductive organ was potent.  The ship was wrecked from its impact against the tough skin wall of the oversized organ, but the men had all survived.  Then, a few large drops of urine dribbled out.  \"Uh oh...\" a single man said.  Suddenly a full forced jet of urine blasted out of the teenager's penis, as they heard the giant above them burst out laughing loudly.  Half the men were blown off the ship, which was pushed away instantly by the brisk stream of piss.  The deck of the ship was soaked in urine, which kept flowing out from the laughing titan's manhood.  By the time he had finished, the ship had been pushed under the water totally from his purposeful aiming.  The survivors swam for as long as they could in the acidic, toxic water that they were stranded in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final ship had been blasted off to the side, sparing its sailors.  However, the men lamented as it wasn't long before the giant raised a hand into the air, curled all but his index finger into a ball, and advanced his massive fingertip toward the ship.  It floated above the crowd of men for a few seconds, who spent equal amounts of time gazing upon both the fingertip and the giant's smirking visage.  Then, they panicked and rushed to jump overboard as he descended his giant fingertip down on top of the ship, instantly crushing their comrades beneath it and pushing the ship under.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you effortlessly push the 10,000-ton warship beneath the surface of the bathwater you feel a surge of pride and satisfaction. The little toy ship offers surprisingly little resistance and soon you feel the warm liquid forcing its way through the cracks in the superstructure, filling the spaces within. In a matter of seconds the once-mighty vessel has been completely flooded and sinks slowly down into the \u201cdepths\u201d of the tub, finally settling on its side at the bottom\u2014mere inches below the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than retrieve the now-useless vessel from the bottom and toss it into the trash where it belongs, you decide to give your miniature audience a further demonstration of your god-like strength and power. Scooping up the last remaining sea-worthy (or at least bath-worthy) destroyer, which is still tickling your inner thigh, you slowly clamber to your feet and gaze down upon the scene from your full height. As you rise up the water sluices down off your lower body, dislodging a few tiny men and sending little waves coursing up and down the length of the tub. These are minor disturbances to you, of course, but more like enormous combers to the numerous sailors who are doing their best to keep afloat in the hot, polluted water. You watch them struggling vainly until the ripples finally subside and then turn your attention to the ship you\u2019ve just sunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTowering high above the stricken military taskforce, with your muscular body glistening with moisture and a modern navy destroyer effortlessly clasped in your hand, you might be Neptune himself risen from the waves. You pause for a moment, giving the tiny men the opportunity to gaze up at your gigantic naked form in fear or admiration, and then lower your foot down directly onto the submerged wreck. Taking care not to injure yourself on the twisted metal you systematically flex and pivot your foot, grinding up the fragile little ship in a series of satisfyingly easy crunches until it is nothing more than a mess of oily particles. You take a short step forward and obliterate the ruin of the other sunken vessel\u2014the one you vanquished with nothing more than a stream of piss\u2014in a similar fashion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the ship you are still holding, you take it in both hands and are about to casually snap it in two when an even better idea occurs to you. You step out of the bath, leaving the survivors to swelter in the overwhelming heat and humidity as they continue to drift helplessly in the pungent mixture of piss and bath water. Setting the boat down momentarily on the edge of the tub, next to the faucet, you lift the cover off the toilet cistern and look inside. It appears to be eminently suitable for what you have in mind so you pick up the tiny ship once more and set it down gently in the chilly water of the cistern, noting to your satisfaction that there are still a few sailors scurrying furtively around the deck or trying to hide behind equipment. You silently wish them luck: no doubt their new location will seem blissfully cool after the torrid climate of your bath, but you hope for their sakes that they are not afraid of the dark. You place the lid back on the cistern, leaving the tiny warship and its remaining crew trapped inside. It\u2019ll remain hidden there until you come back later to retrieve it\u2014that is, if you remember...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yourself enter the shower cubicle, intending to cleanse yourself properly. As you do so you realise that there are a number of the little sailors still trapped in your pubes: either clinging desperately to the cable-sized hairs in fear of falling, or simply too hopelessly entangled within the wiry mass to free themselves. It seems these little creatures manage to get everywhere! All the more fun, you snicker to yourself as you turn on the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shiver with delight as the relaxing warm stream enfolds you, dampening your hair and rinsing away all traces of urine from your lower body. This initial onslaught is enough to dislodge the most precariously positioned of the sailors and send them sliding down your legs, tickling you slightly as they brush against the sensitive hairs on the way down. The first two slide right over your foot and are carried straight down the drain; however, the last somehow manages to acquire a foothold\u2014literally\u2014clinging desperately to one of the tiny hairs on your big toe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrug dismissively and continue your ablutions, adding shampoo to your scalp and lathering up your torso, singing as you do. While you rinse yourself off you glance down to check on the fellow\u2019s progress and are just in time to see a splat of shampoo land on your foot next to him, knocking him free. You shift position very slightly and manage to smear him beneath the same toe that previously saved his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoops!\u201d you comment, insincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou check your crotch for the other pests and find a couple still entangled in your pubic hair, now covered in suds. You reach down and pluck them free, then rub your fingertips together, squashing them as you might a gnat or some other unwelcome insect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the last few sailors have somehow attained a position of relative safety on your testicles, huddling beneath the colossal shelter of your penis. Laughing at their presumption you lift your penis, exposing the little parasites. You detach the shower head and direct the spray onto them, waving it back and forth until one by one the men lose their grip and fall or slide down your legs to the floor of the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou point the shower head downwards, attempting to make a game of swishing them around the floor of the shower. This turns out to be surprisingly tricky. You soon discover that pointing what is effectively a water-cannon powerful enough to blast away tanks or entire buildings directly at the tiny sailors is likely to kill them: either from the force of the water itself or by smashing them against the hard porcelain. This inevitably limits your control and all too quickly the men are washed away, one after the other, by the powerful currents flowing into the drain. The last sailor does his best to cling momentarily to the edge of the abyss\u2014but then a stray speck of lint drifts too close and carries him away down the pipe with a final despairing scream...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou step out of the cubicle and towel yourself quickly. The fun you\u2019ve just had with the men in the shower has convinced you to collect a few more from the bath and maybe even get to know some of them personally before tormenting them further\u2014just as you have with that captured teenager, Mark. With this in mind you glance inside the tub to check on the status of the survivors, noting as you do so the small patch of oil that has risen to the surface from the shattered wreckage. Satisfied, you leave the bathroom and head downstairs to the kitchen. With nobody else at home you see no reason to put on any clothes, so you stride around the house completely naked, exulting in your status as an omnipotent colossus to your puny captives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou search the kitchen cupboards until you find a suitable empty jar. On a whim you collect a box of matches as well and then return upstairs. Back in the bathroom you notice that the patch of oil has expanded slightly and it occurs to you that in your world an oil-slick like this would be regarded as a potential environmental hazard. No doubt it would be a monumental task to clean it up, but here on this tiny scale all you have to do is pull the plug...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you do that you indulge your curiosity and take a match from the box. Striking it alight you toss it down onto the patch of oil, instantly setting it ablaze\u2014much to the terror of the tiny people swimming nearby. The little flames are quite pretty; unfortunately they also start to give off an unpleasant black smoke as the fuel burns. Unperturbed you unscrew the jar and use it as an impromptu bucket to scoop up water and pour it over the miniature inferno. Inevitably you can\u2019t avoid accidentally collecting some of the tiny people in the process and tipping them into the flames as well\u2014but it is their own fault for not swimming out of the way in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only takes four or five jars-full of water to extinguish and disperse the oil. You dip the jar back into the water one last time next to a small group of maybe half a dozen tiny figures. Seeing the huge object descend they pathetically try to swim out of reach, but the current catches hold of them and drags them inside the container. You lift it up and playfully swirl the liquid around, snickering as the men inside struggle and splutter in the turbulence, no doubt swallowing mouthfuls of the vile mixture of your piss and bath water in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to show them a little mercy so you drop a fresh matchstick inside the jar to give the bedraggled sailors something to cling onto and then screw the top back on. You place the jar on the edge of the bath while you pull the plug and watch in fascination as the few remaining survivors and debris are slowly caught in the resulting whirlpool and swept away. Then, with your ego swelled by the ease with which you have obliterated an entire navy fleet, you pick up the jar with its tiny contents and carry it into your bedroom...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While the water is somewhat relaxing after your intense morning jog, you soon grow bored. You decide to let your little slave accompany you and stride toward the coast once more. Stepping onto the sandy shore, you take a good look at the surrounding area. Not too far away, you can see another metropolitan area, the buildings no bigger than the ones you pulverized earlier. You make a mental note to take a more detailed look later on, after you've had some fun with your miniature \"friend\". Walking over to your discarded shoe, you reach in after spotting the micro teen desperately trying to avoid your gaze. Your fingers curl around his diminutive form and you lift him up to your grinning face. \"I think some company would make my swim a lot more enjoyable\", you say with a smile. For his part, Mark again begins to squeak out protests at your actions. It's highly amusing to watch this bug speak out as if on equal terms with yourself, despite the fact you could easily end his life with a slight squeeze of your fingers. You simply shrug your shoulders in response to his protestations and enter the water once again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stride out to your previous position, holding your prisoner above the water as you do. Next, you simply drop the teen into the minuscule ocean, watching with sadistic glee as he plummets towards the water's surface. He lands with a splash, but immediately resurfaces, desperately trying to avoid drowning. While the water may not be deep for you, it is more than enough to send the terrified teen to deep grave. You laugh at his struggles, and even move the water with your palms, watching as he is dragged under, and resurfaces in a fit of anxiety, trying to regain his breath. It must be truly terrifying and demeaning, you think, to have your entire life in the hands of a teenager, thousands of feet tall. The experience of torturing this ant gives you great satisfaction and you continue attempting to submerge him beneath the waves. \"I hope you're having as much fun as I am, bug\", you gloat, though you doubt he is focusing on your words at the present moment. For a moment, you allow him a few moments to rest, so as to not kill your pet too soon. You can see how exhausted he is from all the activity and you begin to ponder other devious tortures you can exact. For a while, you repeatedly lift him out of the water onto your palm and drop him back on, almost drowning him on a couple of occasions. Finally you decide your little games have come to an end and you make your way back to the tiny beach. Mark is nearly unconscious between your fingers and you shake him a few times for a laugh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stand on the shore, water dripping from your naked, muscular form, you may as well be Poseidon himself, risen from the waves. You glance down at your prisoner once again and move him closer to your face for inspection. However the slickness of the water has loosened your grip on him, and the sudden movement releases him from your grip. You watch in shock as he plummets towards the ground, hitting off your penis before striking the sand. You hadn't intended for that to happen, and you crouch down to get a look at his crippled body. He is still alive, barely, but the fall has caused severe injuries. You feel pity for a second, but then realise there are plenty more bugs to torture. \"Sorry 'bout that, little guy\", you say without remorse, \"but you really should have held on tighter. I suppose I better finish you off, put you out of your misery, that sort of thing\". You move your foot so that your big toe hangs above his broken body. You pause for a moment but change your mind and lower it beside your former slave. \"Actually you're really not worth the effort, bug. Nice knowing ya\". With that, you walk off, leaving him to die alone. You have decided to torment the city you saw earlier. Grabbing your shorts, you hear a rattle from within the pockets. Remembering the little playthings you gathered, you empty them out onto the shore. A collection of micro vehicles and tiny specks fly out, hitting the ground and no doubt killing whatever survivors there were. You stomp on the remnants anyways, feelings numerous pops and crunches as everything is crushed beneath. Leaving the beach you stride through a thick forest. Leaving huge footprints throughout, you stand pensively at the edge of this new city. It's a little smaller than the one from yesterday but there is still a bustle of activity upon your arrival as the inhabitants attempt to flee from your coming wrath. You begin once again by stomping through the city, crushing busy roads and buildings beneath your vast soles. This also proves very stimulating and an erection soon hangs over the minuscule buildings. </span></div></div>",

You curiously ponder what the tiny people inside are thinking as the two mountain-sized objects land in front of their buildings, accompanied by the ground-shaking *THOOMs* each of your steps cause below.  No doubt your ominous approach had been heard and felt from leagues away, already.  After further examination, you notice a stadium, a few tiny little monuments, and a couple rows of uniform looking brick buildings that resemble dormitories.  You realize that a large university campus is down at your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are about to lift one foot and step on a few dormitories when Jake calls out: \"Hey, what's up!\" as he strides across the open fields.  \"Oh, you know..\" you say.  \"Just messing around.\"  You lower your foot upon two of the structures, flattening them with a quiet but gratifying crunch and twist your foot slightly to thoroughly pulverize them.  You lift up your foot from the front end and pivot it to the side, smiling mischievously at the rubble.  All throughout the crumbled ruin are tiny little people, many squashed utterly into paste and others maimed, torn in half, and missing limbs but still squirming about slightly, no doubt crying in agony at their unfortunate twist of fate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smile callously at the destruction you've wrought, and you bring your foot back around and once more flatten the same section, and simply stand there as you wait for Jake and Eric to catch up, eager to continue your reign of terror.</span></div></div>",

On the other end of that embarrassment, you feel sort of proud to be able to demonstrate such a display in front of people you can easily control.  It's actually almost freeing to be able to act out these impulses and not have to worry about any social consequences.   You collect some of the tiny microbes by your feet; before long you have a couple dozen of them in your palm.  You grin wickedly and lower the front of your shorts and hold your hand right next to your penis.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get on,\" you command.  The tiny little people look up at your face, horrified, and backing away in your palm, trying to distance yourself from your stiff penis.

As you do so it briefly crosses your mind as being quite a coincidence that the people of this world not only speak the same language as you but also use the same slang and incorporate similar cultural elements in the way they live and build their cities... but you dismiss that thought for now as other, more interesting ideas for what you can do to the miniature world and its inhabitants continue to fill your head. And more importantly, you still have to put this little gnat in his place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s good to hear your little ant civilization knows how to speak properly and to respect its betters.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again the response is surprisingly inventive for somebody of his age, and this time it is accompanied by a slight tickling sensation inside your ear. You suspect the little brat is probably kicking and punching the wall of your ear canal in frustration. It\u2019s actually kinda pleasant, but the time has come to teach him a little discipline and put him to work, you think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, since you\u2019re not going to act like a civilized being then I\u2019ll have to dig you out of there like the tiny bug you are.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou heave yourself up onto one elbow and insert the pinkie finger of your other hand into your ear canal, probing for the tiny mite inside. After a second you feel something very small brush softly against the tip of your finger. Encouraged, you continue pushing deeper\u2014though very carefully, so that you don\u2019t accidentally smear the little guy against your eardrum\u2014and then slowly pull back out, hoping that the micro-teen is now stuck to your fingertip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the first time you frown, frustrated that this little pest has temporarily managed to hide out of your reach. You think for a second, reasoning out the best way to catch him without accidentally squashing him. Ah\u2014of course! You raise your hand to your ear once more, but this time press the flat of your hand firmly against the opening, pushing your ear against your palm. You tilt your head to one side until the palm is almost level and then slowly remove your hand. This acts somewhat like a sink plunger, sucking the tiny guy out of your ear and sending him tumbling into the palm of your hand with a plop!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look down at the brat\u2014and can\u2019t help laughing at the sight that greets you! The miniature teenager has a small lump of earwax stuck to him. Small to you, that is. From his perspective it is almost as big as he is, and is covering his face\u2014no doubt filling his mouth\u2014with the sticky product of your ear canal. You delicately use the edge of a fingernail to detach the worst of the earwax\u2014enough to allow him to breathe, at least\u2014and then smear it liberally across the rest of his body until he is shiny with grease and thoroughly caked in the stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHope you enjoyed snacking on the contents of my ear,\u201d you sneer at him, \u201cbut that stuff\u2019s probably fattening, so you\u2019d better take some exercise to work off the pounds. I was going to let you have a break for a while, but instead you can get to work right away cleaning my toes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his traumatic experience the poor little thing is too shaken to offer more than the feeblest protest. You probably ought to give him time to recover before tormenting him further, but you figure that adversity is character-building. Like the rest of the pitiful micro-population he clearly needs toughening up. Since he has already sampled the tropical fragrance and humidity of your crotch and now the feel and taste of your earwax, it is only right that he should experience some of the other delights your body has to offer and be introduced to your sticky smelly feet as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPinching him between your thumb and forefinger, you pull off one of your sneakers (now somewhat scuffed and dirty, with the remains of tiny vehicles, buildings and countless human bodies ground into the treads) and place him in the hollow between your big toe and the next. There\u2019s a nice piece of lint already lodged there and you roll him over it encouragingly: \u201cThat\u2019s a good boy, get to work\u2014and make sure you clean properly under the nails!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put the sneaker back on your foot. You can already feel the tickling sensation of his body moving against your sensitive skin and have to resist the temptation to clench your toes together and grind him into a pulp. You can check back on him in an hour or so. But now, you think, it\u2019s time for your well-deserved nap. You lie back down on the tiny fields and relax. As you start to doze off you think about what a great feeling it is to be so huge, powerful and unstoppable, with a whole world full of tiny people at your command...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When you finally awaken you discover that it is late; very late. Certainly much later than you had intended, and the sun is already sinking behind the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re pretty surprised that Jake and Eric didn\u2019t call you for dinner. Puzzled, you return to the camp to find the two of them unconcernedly unrolling a couple of sleeping bags and getting ready for bed. When they finally deign to notice you Eric just stands there with his arms folded, while Jake has a typical shit-eating grin plastered across his face. He shrugs in mock apology: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you looked so peaceful sleeping there that we decided not to disturb you. I guess you must have been exhausted after helping us set up camp.\u201d Clearly this is their childish way of getting back at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake continues with a note of smug satisfaction in his voice: \u201cSpeaking of which, that\u2019s your tent over there.\u201d Naturally he points out the smaller, dirtier, and more threadbare of the two that were brought here; he and Eric will be sharing the newer, luxury model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we left some food for you too,\u201d pipes up Eric. He indicates a scuffed delivery box with a couple of sorry-looking slices of cold, greasy pizza half-welded to the inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEnjoy. We\u2019re heading off to bed. See you in the morning!\u201d Your two \u201cbuddies\u201d then climb inside their clean, comfortable tent and zip it closed behind them. You can hear what sounds suspiciously like snickering coming from inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, screw them then. You glance at the leftovers and decide you\u2019re not feeling hungry right now. Instead you\u2019ll check up on how your little captive is doing. You collect your own sleeping bag and lay it out inside the tent. The equipment that your douchebag friends have left you is ratty and musty-smelling with numerous unidentified stains, and you pray that none of it turns out to be infested with fleas or other bugs. Once you are inside and have some privacy you pull off your sneakers and inspect the foot where you left the little ant-sized teenager.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe\u2019s pretty much in the same place he was before: trapped in the tiny space between your big toe and the next. In fact, he appears to have got himself physically stuck to your skin by a combination of your sweat, foot crud, and the remnants of the earwax you smeared on him before. He obviously had a fun time while you were asleep. You use a fingernail to carefully peel him off your skin and bring him up to your face for inspection, pinched between your thumb and forefinger. He seems half dead, almost unconscious after several hours of exposure to the overwhelming heat and miasma inside your sneaker, and moves his arms and legs only feebly in response to the pressure of your fingertips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou speak to him cheerily: \u201cHey wake up! You\u2019ve been working hard so I guess the least I can do is help you clean yourself up a bit and give you something to drink.\u201d He weakly raises his head at that\u2014just in time to catch a droplet of saliva full in the face. The foamy droplet, rather larger than his entire body, oozes over him. You place him down in the middle of your palm and use the index finger of your other hand to rub it into him, \u201cwashing\u201d him thoroughly. Of course, most of his clothing is either torn off completely or reduced to mere scraps and threads in the process, but that\u2019s just too bad. He should be glad you\u2019ve bothered to notice him at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again the total power you have over another person the same age as you, to torment and humiliate as you please, arouses very definite sensations within you and you feel something beginning to stir down in your crotch. You\u2019d love to toy with this little guy some more, but somehow you don\u2019t think that he\u2019d survive any further games tonight. Still, there\u2019s always tomorrow...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I can\u2019t say you did a very good job on my foot. You barely even cleaned a single toe. I guess I\u2019ll have to put you back there again in the morning...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listen carefully for any smart replies, but the micro-teen is still barely conscious and in no position to answer back. Slightly disappointed, you taunt him one last time before putting him away so that he\u2019ll have something to worry about during the night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn the other hand, maybe you\u2019d do better if I put you somewhere else? Perhaps you can collect the fluff from my navel or make sure my nostrils aren\u2019t blocked with snot. Damn... looks like I forgot to pack my floss: I guess I\u2019ll be needing you to pick some of the crud from between my teeth as well. And I suppose you don\u2019t have a shower my size anywhere in this toy world of yours\u2014you might as well clean my penis too. Hope you get a good night\u2019s sleep, \u2019cos you\u2019ll be needing it with all the work you\u2019ve got to do tomorrow!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChuckling at the thought of all the nasty tasks you have in store for him, you lower the helpless teenager and dump him into one of your sneakers for the night, making sure the entrance is blocked so there\u2019s no way he can escape. You can\u2019t wait until tomorrow: crushing and destroying whole populations is certainly fun, but having a special slave or pet around as a focus for your whims and frustrations is just as amusing!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As you slip off your shorts you feel a slight crunch and something rattling inside the pocket. It is then that you remember that you still have those tiny people and their vehicles that you stuffed in there earlier. You might as well take them out and have some fun with them before you go to sleep!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lie down naked inside the sleeping bag but don\u2019t fold the cover back over yourself for now. You rummage around in the pocket of your shorts to see what is still inside. All the stuff you\u2019ve collected is still there, although now in a rather more battered state from being tossed about inside your pocket. That crunch you felt was actually a tiny SUV being crushed against your leg. You flick the useless piece of scrap metal away with disdain; it\u2019s too badly damaged to tell whether anybody was trapped inside at the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the people themselves, you quickly notice that there seem to be fewer of them than you remember. You\u2019d supposed at first that there might have been some of them still loose inside your pocket, but you quickly realise that would have been distinctly hazardous for them with the various heavy (to them) vehicles being bounced around like stray tic-tacs. You inspect the little toys one by one and discover that the survivors have apparently banded together for safely inside what appears to be a school bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suspect that a few of the braver or more adventurous souls may have risked climbing down out of your pocket while you were lying down on the grass asleep. Possibly a few others simply fell out unnoticed while you were walking around. Either way there\u2019s not much you can do about them now\u2014and anyway you figure that if those people had the guts to escape while they could then they deserve to survive. The ones now remaining are just the cowards and weaklings and it suits your designs to have them all conveniently trapped inside one vehicle. Feeling horny, as you currently do, a cruel but amusing idea has come into your head for what you can do with them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou place the tiny bus in the palm of your hand and allow the rest of the vehicles to tumble carelessly in a pile on the ground next to the sleeping bag. Then you pinch the bus between your fingertips, no doubt making the tiny people inside imagine that you\u2019re about to crush their puny sanctuary like a piece of tinfoil. However, all you do for now is very carefully press against the exits until they are sufficiently damaged and deformed to stop anybody escaping through them. Then you raise the bus up to your face and explain what is going to happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a nice guy so I\u2019m going to give you all a chance to escape. The catch is that you need to pass my challenge first. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s actually pretty simple: all you have to do is just drive away. Easy, huh? Well, there <u>is</u> one little snag, but I\u2019m sure you can overcome it...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick at one of the many loose threads scattered across the surface of the sleeping bag until it starts to unravel. Once it is of a sufficient length you snap it and tie the end around the little bus. The other end you loop around your exposed penis, just below the head. Then you set the bus down between your legs, next to your balls. Naturally your penis, even in its current near-flaccid state, completely dwarfs the little vehicle\u2014and the sense of overwhelming power and ego inspired by that incredible size-difference quickly starts to make your cock twitch and enlarge still further...</span></div></div>",

It should be pretty easy when you're that tiny. Now scram!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey don't need to be told twice. Immediately the bus driver floors the accelerator and starts to drive down the wide canyon formed by your legs. At first they proceed without too much trouble: the uneven fabric of the sleeping bag makes for a bumpy ride, but there are no other obstacles and the length of thread allows the bus some slack. However, it soon springs taut and holds the bus firmly in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe frantic movements of the bus are carried back along the thread in the form of a slight tugging sensation against your penis. The tiny vehicle simply isn't powerful enough to shift the immense weight of your organ or snap a piece of cotton that is stronger than a steel cable; what it <i>does</i> do is rub the loop of thread gently against the sensitive region below your glans. Jolts of pleasure run through your dick and it is all you can do not to grab it and start jerking off properly. Instead you restrain yourself and continue to watch as the bus tries desperately to escape. The driver has obviously pushed the accelerator down as far as it will go and you imagine that you can see the tiniest wisps of smoke rising from the wheels as they struggle to free the stricken vehicle from its bonds. However, not only does the bus fail to move any further forward, it actually starts to be jerked backwards!</span></div></div>",

Little by little you are starting to become erect. With a series of twitches your penis becomes engorged, lengthens and begins to point upwards. And with each of those jerks the little bus is yanked backwards a few feet, despite the efforts of its straining engine. It's hilarious seeing how a heavy, fully laden bus is completely at the mercy of your body\u2014and you're not even consciously doing anything!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally your penis expands beyond the capacity of the thread, and with one last jerk the tiny bus is effortlessly lifted into the air. Twisting and turning helplessly, it dangles from the head of your cock like a little trinket, banging repeatedly against your shaft, just above your balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point you can restrain yourself no longer, so you reach down and slowly begin to stroke your shaft, casually knocking the bus backwards and forwards in the process, denting the chassis and terrifying the passengers still further. You can't hear them screaming, but you imagine that is what they must be doing. All you do is chuckle breathlessly and pant a response:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quit complaining. You should consider this the trip of a lifetime. I bet people would pay good money for a theme park ride like this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are just working yourself up to an explosive climax when there is a sudden scrabbling noise outside the tent. You barely have time to fling the cover of the sleeping bag over your rock-hard penis before the tent flaps are unzipped and Jake pokes his head through the opening without bothering to wait for permission. You push down firmly on your erection to prevent any giveaway bulges from betraying what you've been up to, but in the process you feel a sudden crunch somewhere down by your crotch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the heck are you talking to? I could hear you mumbling away from outside\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake glances at you suspiciously, then down at where your hands are awkwardly pressed down on the surface of the bag, clearly hiding something, and then looks back up at your face once more. You're all too aware that your skin is flushed, partly with arousal, partly with embarrassment, and partly with annoyance. You're hoping that your friend won't notice, but as you force yourself to meet his gaze it becomes all too clear that <i>he</i> knows that <i>you</i> know that <i>he</i> knows <u>exactly</u> what you were doing. As if things couldn't get any more awkward you feel a sudden warm stickiness down in your crotch...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a desperate attempt to break the awkward silence that follows you decide that the best way to deflect Jake from trying to embarrass you further is to out-snark him. You put on a false air of nonchalance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jake, what are you doing in my tent? Won't Eric get jealous if he catches you in here, chatting me up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis doesn\u2019t go down too well\u2014Jake clearly wasn't expecting you to answer back like that\u2014but after a moment's hesitation he relaxes and apparently decides to accept it as a joke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric...,\" he rolls his eyes. \"I wouldn't have come in here in the first place if the douchebag hadn't kept me awake by snoring like a warthog. I was going to ask you if I could sleep in here, but on second thoughts, if you're going to play with yourself all night I think I'd rather put up with his piggy noises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe starts to leave and then stops and points at the sleeping bag. \"Just remember: you're going to pay to have that cleaned.\" He pulls his head back out of the tent and you hear him wandering away muttering. \"Just wait \u2019til I tell Eric about this\u2014that's sooo gross...\" <i>sigh</i> \u201cMaybe I can find something to stuff in my ears..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou flop back down on your pillow with a groan. Why does Jake always manage to appear exactly when you don't want him to!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDreading what you might find you carefully pull back the cover of the sleeping bag... Sure enough, you discover that you've ejaculated inside the sleeping bag, making a mess of both it and yourself. Ugh...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLacking anything more convenient you're forced to clean up the mess as best you can using your dirty t-shirt. Now you really do feel like a pig\u2014just like the brat described you. Fortunately, you have clean clothes for tomorrow at least, but the prospect of spending the rest of the night in the crusty-stained sleeping bag still makes you shudder with disgust. Worst of all, while wiping up the sticky patches you find a small piece of twisted, flattened metal: it's the bus\u2014or rather, what's left of it. It obviously got accidentally crushed between your shaft and balls when you flung the covers back over yourself and pushed down your erection. You guess you hadn't really intended to let your prisoners escape, but even so you can\u2019t help feeling sorry at the unexpected and unsatisfying way things turned out. Damn Jake for his bad timing and nosiness!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore dropping off to sleep you brood over what losers your so-called friends actually are. In truth, they've always held you back and repeatedly got you into trouble. You wish that you had this tiny world to yourself without them getting in the way or trying to humiliate you in front of the miniature population. There's no doubt that Jake and Eric are pests that badly need cutting down to size. You wish they were no bigger than the inhabitants of this world..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat thought appeals to you and makes you feel better. You decide that tomorrow, when you torment that minuscule teenager some more, you'll pretend that it is Jake who is tiny and helpless in the palm of your hand, pleading for mercy and having to perform all kinds of unpleasant talks. With a bit of luck you might even find another captive somewhere so that you can pretend it is Eric. With that highly satisfying thought in mind you finally drift off to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Whereas Jake and Eric rarely surface before the crack of noon, you\u2019ve always savoured the peace and quiet of dawn and enjoy taking an early morning run to focus mind and body before the day starts properly. On this particular morning you also plan to have some quality time with your new tiny pet without your oafish friends interrupting. You\u2019re looking forward to tormenting the little brat some more and can\u2019t wait to set him all kinds of unpleasant and humiliating tasks, such as exploring your pubes, or cleaning your armpits, navel or penis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fling back the cover of the sleeping bag, grimacing at the crusty patches that are an unwelcome reminder of last night\u2019s fiasco. Pushing it aside, you pull on a fresh pair of shorts and collect your sneakers so that you can wish your little prisoner a friendly good morning. You imagine that he\u2019s also had quite the night to remember with the aroma of your sweaty feet and last night\u2019s sexual adventures wafting around him. At his teeny scale the resulting olfactory barrage will surely have been impressive. You pick up the sneaker in which you left him and peer inside. You don\u2019t immediately spot him so you guess he must be trying to hide inside the toe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWakey, wakey! Time to get up!\u201d You don\u2019t want to risk arousing your buddies in the neighbouring tent so you put your mouth up against the opening of the sneaker and keep your voice low. It will no doubt frighten the micro-teen, while giving him the additional pleasure of inhaling your morning breath. Much to your surprise there is still no sign of movement so you give the sneaker another shake and then reach inside to grab the brat. However, the shoe is empty. Puzzled, you check the other sneaker but it too is unoccupied. Surely he couldn\u2019t have escaped? You look around the tent for clues and eventually notice a slight gap at the bottom of the entrance where Jake evidently failed to close it properly last night. It would certainly be more than adequate to serve as a doorway for one of the inhabitants of this miniature world. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can\u2019t believe that somebody as small and puny as that little teenager might have outwitted you and escaped, but it seems as though he has. Outraged, you burst from the tent, clad in only your shorts, and begin scouring the ground all around for your tiny ex-captive, certain that he can\u2019t have gone too far.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>When Mark finally began to regain consciousness it was with an aching body and a pounding headache. He felt bruised and dehydrated from his earlier ordeal and his clothes were in tatters. It wasn\u2019t just the headache that was thumping. A strange rhythmic sound pulsed through the air, neatly in sync with the throbbing in his head, and sent sympathetic vibrations rippling through the ground.  As his senses recovered Mark also became aware of the heavy breathing and panting that formed a background to the metrical slapping and rubbing. Being an ordinary horny teenager himself, it quickly became all too obvious what those sounds must be, even though he couldn\u2019t actually see anything from his position deep inside the sneaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh no! He couldn\u2019t be! He really is a pig!</i> Mark recoiled in disgust at the realisation that his giant captor was industriously fapping, apparently indifferent to the fact that his activities could probably be heard for miles around. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the giant didn\u2019t get the chance to finish what he\u2019d started. A thunderous ripping sound abruptly shattered the air and a violent force slammed into the sneaker, making it rock and sending Mark flying. Stunned by the impact of his body against the wall of the sneaker, it took a moment for him to recognize the sound of deep voices rumbling somewhere above him and realise that another giant must have entered the tent. Mark was still too dazed to follow the conversation, but it didn\u2019t last long or sound particularly friendly. When the second giant left, Mark heard his captor muttering and cursing and guessed that one of the monster\u2019s friends had burst in and caught him masturbating. Mark snickered at how humiliating that must have been, but it was a petty victory and his delight was short-lived. He was still trapped inside the overgrown creep\u2019s stinking, humid footwear, a long, long way from his home and family\u2014assuming they had even survived. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom outside the sneaker came the sound of fabric being moved around, a thud, and then a longer period of relative quiet. After a while the giant\u2019s breathing deepened and slowed and Mark realised that he must have fallen asleep. The miniature teenager slumped back despondently, and it was then that he noticed the lace. The end must have fallen down into the mouth of the sneaker when the footwear was knocked and was just low enough for him to reach. It wouldn\u2019t be easy, but Mark knew it was his only chance to escape. He grabbed hold of the end and began to climb...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took him quite a while and left him sweaty and wheezing\u2014his already aching muscles burning from the strain\u2014but finally he reached the lip of the sneaker and pulled himself up onto its surface. It was like standing on the roof of a small building with a whole landscape spread out below.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was clearly night-time, but a flickering light source somewhere outside cast a reddish glow over everything, making it seem more like twilight. The inside of the tent was a vast cathedral of translucent canvas. The sides rose up, and up, and up to reach an apex hundreds of feet above. The whole edifice was so huge that the tallest apartments and office blocks of Mark\u2019s town would have struggled to climb halfway up to that lofty roof.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I bet most of my neighbourhood could fit in here too, laid out on the floor like some kind of play-set. We really must seem like nothing more than ants to him.</i> Mark was uncomfortably reminded of the way he and his friends treated the insects and spiders they found: just annoying little bugs to be casually stomped and smeared underfoot. <i>Except we\u2019re actual living people with thoughts and emotions and he knows that. In fact, I think he gets off on it. That\u2019s why he\u2019s a monster.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air was heavy with testosterone and perspiration\u2014among other smells\u2014and their source lay stretched out nearby, too close for comfort. It was the giant himself, unconscious in his sleeping bag. Mark already knew that he was huge, of course, but his earlier experiences had been so frantic and rushed that there had been no chance to appreciate his body in its entirety\u2014if \u201cappreciate\u201d was truly the appropriate word...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe folds of the sleeping bag didn\u2019t quite conceal the body underneath, revealing just enough to prove that the giant was completely naked. Perhaps it was the magnified effect of the giant\u2019s pheromones exerting their influence upon him, but Mark couldn\u2019t help but be impressed by the sight and stood there transfixed. In repose the giant\u2019s body was somehow magnificent rather than threatening and Mark was caught in a spell, drinking in every detail of the titanic form. He even found himself hoping to catch a glimpse of the colossal penis that lurked beneath the covers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Holy crap!</i> The giant unexpectedly moved, breaking the spell, and Mark almost fell back into the sneaker in terror. However, the colossal teenager was only changing position in his sleep, lifting his arm slightly and exposing a bare armpit. A forest of dark hair came into view within the depths of the sweaty pit, and a fresh wave of body-odour enveloped Mark. The giant clearly hadn\u2019t washed after his exertions\u2014but then again, where would he find a bath or shower that would fit him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that he was back to his senses he realised that he had to get out of here somehow, locate his family and escape far away from all the giants and their cruel games. Mark looked around the tent. In the distance he could make out an opening where the entrance had not been completely zipped closed. If he could only make it there... The shapeless mass of what appeared to be a discarded t-shirt blocked the route, but he was confident he could climb over it. More troublesome would be simply getting down off the sneaker without breaking his neck. Mark followed the lace and realised that it actually belonged to a neighbouring shoe, resting on its side with the lace draped over its companion. He could climb across to this other piece of footwear and then make his way down through the treads. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After his earlier experiences at the hands of the giant Mark wouldn\u2019t have believed it possible that he might be made to feel yet tinier and more humiliated. The journey down to the ground via the sneaker treads quickly disabused him of that notion. It seemed hard to believe that this dark, patterned landscape filled with twisted scrap metal and forest debris was actually nothing more than the treads of a single sneaker, belonging to some ordinary teenager. Mark involuntarily glanced down at his own remarkably similar footwear, likewise caked in mud and dust. The comparison only served as a terrifying reminder of just how small and puny he and the rest of his world truly were: mere bugs under the feet of this colossal, arrogant bully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe \u201cmud and dust\u201d embedded within <u>these</u> treads consisted of splintered tree trunks, sections of houses and the compacted ruins of vehicles. Mark counted himself fortunate that he came across no half-squashed bodies, although they were undoubtedly here somewhere, most likely inside one of the several cars that had been flattened like mere tinfoil. The teenager had to feel his way cautiously through this grisly mess, finding footholds and paths downwards while doing his best not to dislodge anything heavy (to him, at least) that might crush him or send him tumbling to the ground. The most heart-stopping moment came when he put his weight on the front of a car and a wheel came loose, bouncing all the way down with accompanying bangs and clatters. Mark froze in place, certain that the commotion would wake the giant\u2014but of course it would have registered as just the very faintest tinkle to the monster and there was not so much as a pause or change in his breathing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a good part of an hour for Mark to pick his way down the cliff-face of the sneaker sole. Unfortunately, his journey wasn\u2019t over: the exit was still some distance away and blocked by the looming bulk of the giant\u2019s t-shirt, carelessly tossed onto the floor. <i>Surely it can\u2019t be any worse than the sneaker?</i> Mark wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he even reached the t-shirt he encountered one more grim landmark. It was the wreck of a school bus, so highly compacted that it looked as though it had been through an industrial crusher. Wrapped around the flattened shape was some kind of cable: though immensely thick and strong, Mark had a suspicion that it was actually little more than a thread. He hardly dared wonder what exactly had ruined the vehicle, but it had clearly been treated as no more than a small toy, dangling on the end of a string for the giant\u2019s amusement. He tried not to think about any people who might have been trapped on board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark had lost his watch and phone when his clothing was torn by the giant. He had no idea of the exact time, or even how long had passed since the giant had fallen asleep. All he knew was that he couldn\u2019t risk being found here when morning came so he would have to climb over this last obstacle and escape from the tent as quickly as possible. In theory it shouldn\u2019t take as long to traverse as the sneaker, but Mark eyed the shadowy folds and creases with suspicion, wondering how easy it would be to fall into one and become hopelessly entangled. Unfortunately, there was no other option if he wanted to reach the exit beyond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first things were not as bad as he\u2019d feared and his progress across the huge crumpled garment was relatively swift. On the other hand, Mark found himself increasingly distracted by the smell that clung to the mountainous shirt. Part of it was\u2014as might be expected\u2014the stale body odour that impregnated the fabric and made him want to sneeze. However, there was another underlying scent that was somehow just as familiar\u2014yet he couldn\u2019t quite identify it, much to his irritation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the accident happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo preoccupied to pay attention to where he was going, Mark vaulted over a small wrinkle that ran across the \u201csummit\u201d of the garment. When he landed on the other side his right hand came down on a small patch of something cold, damp and sticky. The little teenager snatched back his hand in disgust, lost his balance and careered head over heels all the way down the other side of the t-shirt. His tumble came to an end when he landed face down in another, larger puddle. This time his whole body was drenched in the substance. His face was covered by the slick fluid, with some even getting inside his mouth. It was thick and salty and Mark realised with horror what it must be. <i>That\u2019s what the smell was! He used this thing to wipe himself off. I\u2019m lying in a freaking cum stain!</i> He spat the foul material out of his mouth and retched. There was little he could do about the rest of the stuff that was now smeared liberally across his body and in his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark spent the next couple of minutes raging at the giant\u2019s revolting habits. He rolled and rubbed against the fabric of the massive t-shirt, trying to scrape away the semen, but only succeeded in ripping his own clothes further. Finally he tore away the last remaining shreds of his own shirt and used them to clean himself as best he could. He tossed the ruined garment aside, leaving it to become just another stray speck of lint on the giant\u2019s incomparably larger version. Mark was now left wearing nothing more than sneakers, socks, and a pair of ragged boxer shorts that barely qualified as a loincloth. The only positive side to the incident was that the fall had carried him most of the way down the side of the shirt and he could now see the tent opening just up ahead. The tiny, nearly naked teenager gathered his breath and began running towards the exit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cool, fresh air outside came as a blessed relief after the stuffiness and miasma inside the tent. However, it was pretty much a wasteland with fields and forests trampled flat for miles around. A rumbling sound like distant thunder could be heard at regular intervals, even though the sky was completely clear. Mark realised with horrified fascination that it must be the other two giants snoring in their own tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time the titans\u2019 camp-fire was starting to burn low, though it still seemed like an uncontrollable inferno to the micro-teen and certainly cast sufficient light for him to see. More alarming was a faint lightening of the sky beyond the eastern horizon. Dawn wasn\u2019t far off and Mark was terrified what might happen if one of the giants suddenly woke and found him here. The escaping teenager had no idea how to reach the nearest town or city so he picked the direction that seemed to lead most quickly out of the giants\u2019 camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time that dawn\u2019s rosy glow was painted across most of the sky Mark guessed he had travelled several miles. Despite that, the monstrous shapes of the two giant tents still dominated the landscape like Olympian temples and he knew he needed to press on. He had stumbled upon a small dirt track running through the battered forests and trampled fields and decided to follow it. It had no doubt been used by the farmers that once lived here, and although it was potentially more exposed it also allowed him to move more quickly\u2014for the most part. In the darker region beyond the campfire he had fallen into a large puddle and only realised afterwards that it was merely a small part of the imprint from a gigantic sneaker. But at least it had washed away part of the cum from his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApart from that, the journey had been mercifully uneventful. He had neither seen nor heard another soul. Even the birds and other wildlife were silent and had probably either fled or been crushed underfoot. At any other time he might have enjoyed the peace and quiet of an early morning run, but now he was fleeing for his life. Sure enough, before he had taken another dozen strides the silence was shattered by the sound of a tent being angrily unzipped. Mark looked back in horror to see the giant teenager emerging from the tent, bare-chested and clearly annoyed. The titan began searching the ground all around him and Mark knew that his escape had not gone unremarked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he looked ahead and tried to summon up the energy to run faster he saw a strange light in front of him. It was too bright to be a star and it was coming closer and closer! Maybe help had come at last? Mark could only hope it would reach him in time and that they could escape before the giant noticed them...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The muddy, trodded landscape stretched out for miles and miles ahead of Mark, but the sound of a roving jeep approaching filled his spirits.  The army jeep with its camouflage paint and the two hardened-looking drivers closed in and the troopers signaled for Mark to come forward.  Mark picked up his pace, not daring to look back at the godzilla-sized teenager who was scouring the ground for him.   He clearly enjoyed cruelly tormenting any living creature that was weaker than himself and Mark was determined not to be subject to his games anymore.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jump in!\" one of the soldiers yelled as Mark was pondering mid-sprint.  The soldier in the rear of the vehicle was mounted behind an unfamiliar cannon.  The jeep halted in the mud after a quick skid.  Mark nodded and picked up the pace.  Before he knew it, the sound of a loud *squelch* was heard behind him.  Still sprinting, Mark began to peer back in dread.  He felt the ground shake as one of the giant's massive bare feet lifted up and landed on the muddy landscape behind him.  Mark saw the giant's smirking visage high above as he lifted another foot and brought it down even closer with another squelch.  The colossus needed only walk at a (comparably) casual pace to close in the distance with his vast strides.  The troops ahead of Mark looked up in horror at the silent giant who had his eyes fixed on the \"insects\" crawling around in the mud as he walked toward them.  Mark was only fifty yards from the jeep before he felt a cool shadow envelop him after a couple more additional steps of the giant.  Suddenly, a thunderous voice rang out.  \"Going somewhere, pipsqueak?\"  The shadow passed over Mark and advanced to the jeep.  Then, Mark saw it.  Positioned directly underneath the giant's crotch and between his pillar-like fleshy legs, a vast bare foot descended out of the sky and hovered over the halted jeep.  The driver of the jeep quickly put his hands back onto the wheel in order to escape.  The passenger behind the cannon was playing around with the machinery of the large cannon in the rear of the vehicle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long for it to happen.  Mark watched from below as the giant grinned, now staring at the jeep, as he slowly descended his foot down.  The jeep had begun to move after the driver gunned his motor but the vast fleshy sole was too big.  The colossus flattened the jeep not ten yards in front of Mark beneath the ball of his foot.  Mark stopped in his track lest he ram himself directly against the tough, fleshy wall that was the side of the gigantic foot.  Before this took place, Mark thought he saw a flash come from the cannon right before the drivers panicked, screamed, and fruitlessly attempted to evacuate from the jeep.  Unfortunately, none of these measures prevented the giant from stepping on both the passengers and the vehicle as casually and effortlessly as he would a few ants.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was time to give up hope. There was no escape from the giant above.  The cruel laughter above reminded Mark of how unfair it was that such a selfish being could exhibit such cruelty and power simply through sheer force... due to no other advantage than his size.  It wasn't fair that a entire city could be brought to its knees through one being's actions.  As he pondered this in despair, and watched plaintively as the giant's stadium-sized hand scooped down to pick him up like he were nothing, he heard the giant remark \"Huh?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the hand withdrew.  The giant stood back up to his full height but was no longer quite has huge as he had been seconds earlier.  Indeed, he was shrinking before Mark's very eyes.  The feet on either side of him shrunk in length and mass.  The pillar-like legs lost their height... and the muscular torso diminished in all dimensions.  \"No!!!\" he heard the giant shout out and afterward gritted his teeth as he descended into the ground far below him.  In less than a minute, the giant teenager stood about 100 yards from Mark, inside his own formerly gigantic footprint, and looked exactly the size of a normal human -- at least from Mark's distant perspective.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe jeep must have used its weapon before he stepped on them, Mark thought.  Now was his chance..!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You were holding your thumb above them each in turn, laughing as you made them scurry about, trying to escape from underneath it, yelling in fear, terrified that they would be squashed at any moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you blink the sleep from their eyes you realise that you can still hear that same sound of frantic yelling. Meanwhile, a peculiar orange glow is flickering outside your tent casting crazy moving shadows across the inside. What the heck is going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly pull on your shorts and rush outside to investigate. You find Jake and Eric\u2014still at their normal size\u2014rushing around waving their arms and screaming like little girls. They also were clearly roused directly from sleep as they are wearing just their underwear and are now slapping at their bare arms and legs and pulling at their hair as though trying to dislodge annoying insects!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Insects!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any other time you\u2019d probably stand back and laugh at the near-hysterical antics of your friends, but on this occasion they have good reason to panic. The orange glow you saw is now revealed to be their tent\u2014on fire! As you quickly start to look around for something that might put it out you hear\u2014almost feel\u2014a sharp buzzing sound, like an enraged wasp, followed by the sight of a streak of light shooting past your ear to strike an untouched region of the burning tent. There\u2019s a small flash as it impacts the canvas and another flame ignites. <i>What the\u2026!?</i> It is then that you notice a cluster of small white flickering lights down by the bottom of the flaming tent, near the opening\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rummage around in the pile of stuff that your friends left carelessly lying around near the tents and find a torch. You immediately switch it on and shine it down around the base of the tent. The spotlight reveals a mass of moving objects: you think at first that it is a swarm of army ants or something, but then you remember where you are and realise that you are only half-right. Not ants; an army! You hear more angry noises buzzing rapidly past your ear so you swing the torch around, hoping to reveal more, and catch brief glimpses of what look like teeny-tiny jet fighters! That streak of light that struck the tent must have been a missile from one of them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiny military of this world has launched a surprise attack!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The army has planned well. By attacking at night they have not only the element of surprise, but also the cover of darkness, while their enemy is still befuddled with sleep. No doubt they targeted Jake and Eric\u2019s tent first because it was larger and more impressive, offering the chance to eliminate two giants at once. It was just as well you woke up when you did...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush to recover the stuff inside, but, fuelled by a barrage of incendiary bombs, the blaze has already taken too strong a hold, incinerating your friends\u2019 clothing and possessions. However, you don\u2019t have time to worry about that now. As you move you feel something cold and brittle crunch beneath one naked foot. You lift your foot in surprise and point the torch downwards to reveal the remains of a miniature tank underneath, crushed like a piece of tinfoil. The beam illuminates several more nearby, still intact, and their guns are already swinging round to shoot at you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn theory your gigantic size should mean you are an easy target, but instead it is a matter of the utmost simplicity to dodge, merely by stepping over them. Rather than stomp these ones too with your bare feet and risk getting some annoying splinters you quickly reach back into your own tent and retrieve your sneakers. You hold the footwear directly above the collection of little tanks, just long enough for their crews to realise in horror what is about to happen\u2014and then simply let go, allowing the colossal sneakers to fall from on high with the force of a meteor. Then you casually slide your feet into them, lazily swivelling your feet and grinding everything underneath into the dirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are still more troops scattered around you next to the tents but you are no longer worried. You simply pick up one of the discarded pizza boxes and sweep the collection of tiny soldiers, vehicles, and tanks inside, then close the lid, trapping them. A powerful and highly-trained military force, consisting of thousands of men has just been effortlessly gethered up like toys and imprisoned! The rest of the army is probably still out there in the darkness, but you can let your friends take care of them. In the meantime, there are still some annoying \u201cinsects\u201d buzzing around your head...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, either Jake or Eric had the idea of bringing some insect repellent with the rest of the supplies. You snatch up the can and spray it liberally into the air around you, not caring about accuracy. Almost immediately you are rewarded by the sound of the faint whining changing pitch and you see little flickers of light as one-by-one the stricken jet fighters tumble down to the ground and explode. A moment later you feel something catch in your hair and instinctively reach up to brush it away, only to find what appears to be a tiny parachute tangled up in your fingers. Dangling helplessly on the end of a slender thread is a teeny ant-sized man\u2014presumably one of many pilots who ejected after being sprayed with repellent. You pinch the unlucky pilot between the thumb and forefinger of your other hand and rip him free, holding him up to the end of the torch for inspection. He is struggling wildly in your grip, obviously terrified and desperate to escape, but in vain. You have no mercy for him: he and his buddies were trying to murder you and your friends in your sleep. You casually rub your fingertips together, instantly crushing him to a pulp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, you turn your attention back to your friends, expecting them to have conquered the rest of the military by now. However, to your surprise they are still scratching and flailing about aimlessly as though covered in itching powder. Suddenly concerned, you ask what is wrong, and Eric gives a faint answer:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI just feel really weird... everything\u2019s tingling.... I...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before he can finish what he was saying....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In the space of a few seconds they become so tiny that they simply disappear somewhere on the ground. You instinctively take a couple of steps towards the place they vanished\u2014and then catch yourself. The problem is all too clear, and once again you have to commend the army commanders on their tactics. Your friends\u2019 minute scale, combined with the cover of darkness, means that it is all too likely that you might accidentally step on them while searching. You shine the torch down on the spot where they were standing and see a group of armoured vehicles racing away. Now reduced to the size of the rest of the inhabitants of this world your friends have clearly been captured by the retreating forces. A sizeable mossy patch on the ground is presumably some kind of forest, and you are just in time to see the vehicles race under its cover. You curse in frustration, realising that this too has been planned to prevent you from reaching down to scoop them up to inspect at your leisure. Like it or not, your friends are gone\u2014at least for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs that fact sinks in you abruptly laugh out loud, partly at the absurdity of being out-manoeuvred by a nation of people no bigger than ants, and partly at the irony of Jake and Eric being miniaturized just as you\u2019d wished earlier. It\u2019s actually pretty amusing to imagine your friends\u2019 horror at finding themselves at the mercy the very people they\u2019ve been tormenting so cruelly as mere bugs. You\u2019re almost tempted to leave them to their fate, but they are still your buddies, even if they do hold you back in life. More to the point, you want to avoid any awkward conversations with their parents, in which you have to explain their disappearance...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClearly there is nothing you can do for them right away, but a soft glow in the sky promises dawn in another hour or so and in the meantime you have at least one possible lead to follow. By now the remnants of your friends\u2019 tent and possessions have slumped down into a smouldering mass. To the inhabitants of this world it probably still seems like a raging inferno, but to you it is the size of a large campfire and its comforting warmth reminds you that the night air is surprisingly cool and are you are still clad in just your shorts. Your sneakers are still lying where you dropped them, so you go to put them on at least, idly scuffing them on the ground to wipe the shattered remains of little tanks and human bodies off the treads and smear them onto the landscape. Then you settle down cross-legged next to the fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closed pizza box is also still where you left it: you pick it up and give it a playful shake, snickering at the slight rattling sound that comes from within. You lay it down across your lap and open it up. The tiny army is still inside, though scattered about in disorganised clumps from the shaking. No doubt some of the soldiers have been accidently squashed by heavy tanks and trucks landing on them, but you shrug dismissively at the thought: there are always casualties in war. For a moment your fingers hover over the collection as though selecting a candy from a box of chocolates... and then they greedily snatch up a single tank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHelpfully, you leave the box open so that everybody inside has a clear view of what is happening as you inspect your new toy. You set it down in the palm of one hand and then reach down with the other and tap on the hull with a fingernail. Even though you are being gentle, the flimsy metal casing is quickly dented by the incredible force of the blows. A hatch on the top pops open and a tiny man looks out, glancing around as if seeking a way to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put on your sternest expression and address him: \u201cAbout time. I\u2019ve got some questions for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately he starts yelling and gesturing at you. His voice is too faint for you to catch the words, but you can guess their meaning. He disappears back inside and the hatch slams shut. A moment later the turret begins to swivel round so that the cannon can be aimed directly at your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not very nice,\u201d you mutter reprovingly as you effortlessly snap off the cannon and flick it away. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to misbehave then I guess I\u2019ll have to punish you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlucking up the tank once more you lean across and drop it down in the middle of the fire, taking care not to burn yourself in the process. The tiny flames and embers flicker around the little war machine, heating it up. Once again the hatch opens and the little guy leaps out and tries to make a run for it. Unfortunately, he doesn\u2019t get very far before his uniform catches alight and he is burned to a crisp in a matter of seconds. By now two other soldiers have also emerged and are watching in horror. Shocked by what has happened to their friend they dive back inside and start up the tank. The metal hull is starting to glow with the heat as the toy shudders into life and attempts to traverse the flames. You watch in curiosity, wondering if they really have any chance to make it, but after only a few seconds the gas tank ignites and the little tank explodes in a shower of tiny sparks. You shrug and turn your attention back to the pizza box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so who\u2019s next for the hot seat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time you close your eyes and pick at random. You feel something squirm under your fingers and grasp it. You open your eyes to find you are holding a tiny little soldier. You bring him closer to your face and offer him an ultimatum: \u201cAre you going to tell me what happened to my friends or am I going to have to discipline you too?\u201d To encourage him further you grab a fallen tree from the ground and strip it of its leaves and branches. To you it is almost the size of a matchstick so you set the tip alight and hold it up next to the captive. Keeping his legs pinched between your fingertips you then dangle him above the little flame, swinging him back and forth above it, though taking care not to actually set him alight. After about 30 seconds of this you blow out the tree-matchstick and set the soldier down in your palm. He is drenched in sweat, with huge patches of moisture darkening his uniform, and sinks to his knees in supplication. Satisfied, you repeat your question and hold him up to your ear for the reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt turns out that tonight\u2019s engagement had two goals: to neutralise you and your friends by whatever means possible, and to rescue the teenager you had abducted. The teen! You\u2019d forgotten all about him; he is still somewhere inside your tent! Obviously his family had indeed safely made the journey back to the government of this world, but the leaders had chosen to assault you rather than negotiate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the shrinking? Apparently an elite group had been sent in first to inject your friends with an experimental shrinking chemical. You recall the band of tiny people you saw emerging from your friends\u2019 tent at the start of the battle; it doesn\u2019t really surprise you to learn that a tiny world that exists within a crystal has the knowledge to alter the size of people and objects. However, the chemical obviously took longer to work than they expected, hence the full-scale assault and your friends\u2019 strange behaviour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time we started negotiating, don\u2019t you?\u201d you remark as you bring the man back in front of your face. \u201cYou\u2019ve got my friends and I\u2019ve got you, your army, and that kid you were trying to rescue. Can you get in touch with your leaders from here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man nods and points at something in the middle of the box. You peer down and see a small truck with a satellite dish on top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, then this is what you\u2019re gonna do...\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You command the little soldier to use the satellite truck to communicate with his leaders.  With the soldier still in your palm, you lower your other arm into the pizza box and reach across the rest of the troops to pick up the tiny truck.  This movement causes the other soldiers to dive out of the way of your approaching fingertips, perhaps in thinking your intention was to make them into your next victims.  You pick up the satellite truck with just your thumb and index finger, making sure to be extra gentle, knowing that you are easily capable of accidentally crushing the vehicle.  You could just set the little soldier and his truck down by your feet to complete this task, but instead you lower the truck into the palm containing the little soldier.  You figure that being under your watchful eye will help prevent the little soldier-ant from getting any sneaky ideas.  The deal is a simple prisoner exchange.  You will release this little soldier, his surviving allies in the pizza box, and the teenaged kid you stuck in your shoe, in exchange for the delivery of Eric and Jake.  You forgot where you had placed Mark when you went to step on all those little tanks, until it was too late.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile the soldier climbs into the truck in your palm to open communications, you use your free hand to take off your shoe.  You tilt it a few times from heel to toe until his little form comes rolling out.  Sure enough the micro-teen comes rolling down from the toe, across the fabric sole, into the wall where your heel normally rests.  You're glad he wasn't annihilated when you were wearing the thing and stomping around on the military.  Instead he's quite alive though and gets to his feet.  He immediately starts hopping up and down on the fabric floor of the giant shoe, signaling to you, no doubt demanding you remove him from the stinking cavernous prison, or let him be heard after so many hours of being ignored.  For a few seconds you just watch with a smirk, to remind him of his powerlessness.  He almost looks like a flea jumping up and down from within your giant sneaker, pleading for your attention.  Finally you pluck him out; you decide that he's not worthy of an audience at the moment so rather than drop him into your ear so he could be heard, you carelessly toss his wriggling form into your other palm to join the soldier.  Ignoring his continued gesticulations, you pick up the sneaker to put it back on your foot.  After putting it back on, you curiously look at the bottom and take note of the fact that there are quite a few intact little tanks wedged deep between the rubber tread walls and amid patches of mud.  Caring little for whoever may be inside, you shrug, plant your foot back down, and carry on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now the little soldier comes out of his truck.  He starts to shout up at you but not being able to hear his tiny voice, you bring him and the truck up to your ear.  A voice comes from the truck, which you recognize as belonging to Jake.  Apparently the leaders of this little race have let him come on the radio to demonstrate to you that he and Eric are safe.  Then, you have an idea.  You grab the truck and simply place it deep inside your ear, so it can act as a sort of wireless radio. You gently manipulate the truck with one finger until you are confident that it is secure, perhaps resting in some sticky, waxy crevice.  You lower Mark and the little soldier onto your kneecap so that your hands are freed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then speak: \"well, looks like you guys went to join the bug people.. that works out pretty well for me.  I decided that there can be only one giant god here anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not funny,\" interjects Jake.  \"You're going to give that teenager and the military back so you can get us back, right?  You can't hurt anyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think I care about getting you back?\" you tease.  \"I'm not really interested in being friends with ants.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Eric chimes in from the background, yelling at Jake: \"tell him to just keep crushing them until they make us big again!\"  You then hear Jake telling Eric to shut up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, alright, settle down.. I'll try not to crush anything.  So I got the kid and all these soldiers.. how is this exchange going to work?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Two hours have passed since you made your deal with the tiny people. You stand pensively at the edge of the city, awaiting the delivery of your micro-friends. You still hold the pizza box between your hands, but decide not to toy with the captives any more, lest you wind up killing some accidentally. Mark and the other soldier have joined them in the box, and everyone waits for the exchange. Eventually you spot a tiny convoy making their way towards your feet. No doubt these are the guys who shrunk and kidnapped your friends. Deciding it will make communication easier, you crouch down, hanging over the soldiers like a mountain. Finally, you see a general of some sort exit a vehicle, and following are your two friends, chained up. You cannot believe they have been reduced to the same pitiful size as the other inhabitants, and you grin at the irony of the situation. You begin to hear a faint squeaking, and try to focus in on the words being said. Your two friends will be returned to you, at their new size and once the crystal has been activated, they will grow them back again, so long as you all leave immediately. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, well, well guys, how is the view from down there?\", you gloat. Unbeknownst to anyone else, you have no intention of relinquishing your authority. You are not prepared to give up your new status as god of this world just to return your pathetic friends to their normal lives. No, you have quite a different plan in mind. Slowly, you lower the pizza box to the ground, beside the convoy. Helicopters hover over the assortment of tanks, and troops gaze up at you in brazen awe. You are simply monolithic to them, nothing even comes close. You lower your palm to the ground, and motion for your two new captives to clamber on. You watch intently as their chains are released, and they scurry to your vast hand, slowly climbing up the side and onto your fleshy palm. Finally you can drop this \"civil\" pretense and show these bugs who is really in charge. Quickly, you pocket your friends, and swat your hands at the assortment of helicopters. They immediately explode on contact with you, and debris rain down on the men. They obviously did not expect this sort of response from you, perhaps thinking that you were interested in returning your friends to normal, and are unprepared for your vicious onslaught. You stand to your full height, glaring down at the forces at your feet. You raise a foot and move it over the panicking group. With all the force you can muster, you stomp down on them, cracking the ground beneath your foot. You have just obliterated 1/3 of them with a single powerful stomp. The survivors are thrown to their feet from the shock wave, some even sent flying from the sudden turbulence. You were annoyed at the immodest way the military had dictated terms to you, and any mercy you had evaporated. Now they are simply bugs to grind to death, holding no importance to you whatsoever. You lean over to pick up the pizza box full of captives. You think of the terror they must be feeling, trapped in the dark with only the sounds of destruction to be heard. You open the box and are greeted with a number of crushed bodies. Obviously some unfortunates must have been caught beneath the rolling tanks and jeeps and were squashed unceremoniously. It's hilarious to think of these fully trained military men fleeing like ants from you and your wrath. You empty some of the men into your palm before turning the box over and letting the remnants rain down on their comrades. Fully laden vehicles descend upon the scrambling forces and many more are crushed to death. The ground is littered with the broken and bloodied corpses of the soldiers and any survivors are quickly smeared beneath your foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow the only captives that remain are the ones in your palm and you stare down at them with a callous smile. You have just shown them how futile their attempts were, that nothing in this world could possibly compare to your stature and power. You ponder what next to do with your band of prisoners. Sure you could crush them them in your palm or dismember them like ants, but you want to torture them psychologically first. After all there are plenty more of the critters to crush, so a change of pace would be nice. As you look down at your terrified captives, you decide to simply drop them into your shorts. After all, what could be more demeaning for them than to be trapped on some other guy's dick, holding on desperately to survive. With that thought, you pull the waistband of your shorts and drop the screaming captives into their new prison. Immediately, the movements of the terrified captives stimulate your penis, and slowly, you feel yourself getting hard. However now there is no one who could demean you in front of these people. You have total and absolute control over every single one of these pitiful creatures, to end their lives as you please. With new found authority, you stroll back once again to the burning city. Countless more lives are ended beneath every step as you carelessly trudge through the cityscape. You decide to take a break and sit down, crushing everything beneath you. As you lie back onto the roadways and buildings, you notice something amusing. Your hardened shaft rises higher than any skyscraper that surrounds it, and you contemplate jacking off right there onto the fleeing denizens. For now though, you are content to listen to the screams of terror and fear as you lie back, content in your role as the sole god to these people.</span></div></div>",

You slowly sit up from your resting place atop the city, rising into the clouds like a behemoth. It appears this world has a day and night cycle, just like your own, meaning that you've probably been transported to an entirely new planet in all likelihood. You take a moment to relish the thought of having an entire world to rule, with millions of little people to grind underfoot. These thoughts are very appealing to you in fact, and once again, your penis rises from beneath your shorts. It is then that you remember your little \"captives\" from the night before. You move your arm over and pull the waistband of your shorts up. Immediately you laugh at the sight. Hundreds of little soldiers are dispersed throughout your pubic region, either hopelessly entangled in the wiry hairs or plastered to your shaft. You notice a good number have already been crushed from your movements as you smile with malice at the surviving captives.</span></div></div>",

To them this must be the most degrading position imaginable -- tiny little fleas trapped in a giant teen male's pubic nest, pressed against his gigantic dick, and barely noticeable and easily forgotten as you lumber through their cities as a giant, uncaring, and destructive god, eager to exhibit your dominance over their world.  In the back of your mind, you acknowledge that you possess no innately divine qualities that would earn you this god-like status, except having the delightfully good fortune of being a massively bigger lifeform than this alien race, but somehow that exact unfairness of it all makes it even more exciting.  You delight in the thought that from their perspective, they're being terrorized and crushed into submission by what likely isn't a god, but what is in actuality an uncaring and cruel teenager who does what he wants. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach into your pocket and feel around for Jake and Eric.  You collect them both into your palm and leer down at their disoriented forms.  The two little specks stagger when they look up to your face, high above them.  Immediately they begin hopping up and down, squeaking like crickets.  \"What's wrong, you two?\" you thunder down at them.  Unable to hear them, you bring them up into your ear and gently tilt your hand so they roll into your ear lobe itself.  You feel the faint tickling sensation are tempted to scratch, but doing so would likely render your little buddies into paste.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight away your hear Jake yelling in your ear canal.  \"What the hell are you doing man?!  You were supposed to get them to grow us again!  Why the hell did you stick us in your fucking pocket?!\"  Eric is yelling something similar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reply, amused: \"Don't worry dude, I've got this whole race petrified of me.  They'll do anything I say.  They know if they don't, I'll just stamp my feet on their cities,\" you say snickering at the idea.  \"I can get them to grow you back any time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell happened to the guys you made a deal with already?!\" Jake replies in a panic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stamped my feet on them of course!\" you say derisively, smiling to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why would they do anything you ask if they know you'll step on them anyway, you idiot!\" Jake shouts angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou continue: \"Idiot, huh?  Hmm, that's another day bug-sized for you!  Right now you can stay in my ear while I mess with these little guys some more.  When I'm done, we can talk about growing you back... unless I decide to keep you in a jar on the nightstand by my bed, heheh.   So you better behave, Jake.  Or you might end up being my pets and no one will never even know you're spending the rest of your natural lives in my bedroom!\"  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Honestly the tone of Eric and Jake's whiny voices begin to get on your nerves as you begin to reconsider your options. They may have been mighty giants once, all powerful alongside you. But now, they're no better than the countless bugs you've already ground underfoot, or imprisoned next to your dick. Weighing all this up in your mind, a sudden urge to punish your former friends emerges to the forefront of your mind. These guys had the audacity to speak to you as if you were on equal terms, when you could so easily obliterate them with a simple press of your pinky finger. Resolute in your longing to exact some authority over these would-be gods, you move your hand up to your ear, ignoring their protests as they are sealed in the darkness of your ear canal. You tilt your head and feel them fall onto your palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBringing your hand back around, you look down in disgust at the terrified parasites that stand shaking on the vastness of your palm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know what, guys, I think I've had enough of your shit. From now on, you're nothing special. Just more shits to do with as I please\", you command menacingly. You watch with intrigue as Jake immediately shouts something back up at you, no doubt demanding you grow him back, while Eric stands slightly further back, stunned into silence by your brazen proclamation. You focus on the ranting Jake, and feel the familiar urge to simply kill him like your other unfortunate victims. You decide to stand up, raising your body off the devastated ruins and thousands of crushed bodies you used as a resting place. Obviously, this sudden movement proves disastrous for the occupants your boxers. People are smeared between the tensing muscles of your thighs and your semi-erect penis, sending even more delightful sensations throughout your body, and many more fall off your member, screaming to their deaths on the ground far, far below. But none of these events catch your attention whatsoever. You are simply too focused on punishing Jake for his insubordination. A sadistic smile crosses your face as you move your other hand to grab him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing your index finger and thumb, you pinch Jake between them. The sudden ascension left both him and Eric dazed, allowing you to easily trap him in your grip. You raise the pathetic teen up to your face, and stare at him cruelly. Now, his patronising behaviour has left him, leaving him a terrified little boy, with emphasis on the \"little\". You can't even begin to describe your disgust at how degraded he has become, just another powerless being below you. All this fuels your own ego as the sole god of this alien world and what better a way to solidify that then to eliminate the competition? Slowly but enjoyably, you increase the pressure between your fingers. Jake screams out in agony, and you can almost feel minuscule \"pops\" as his skeletons no doubt buckles and breaks from the sudden increase in pressure. This time though, there will be no salvation. After a few seconds, Jake's body implodes into a bloody mess, leaving tiny blotches of red on your fingers. You let out a sudden laugh at the absurdity of it. With little to no effort, you have just ended the life of a human being just as you would any bug or insect. The euphoria of your action courses through your body, as you ponder your next destructive action.</span></div></div>",

As he desperately avoids your attention, you bring the palm up closer to your face.  *Boo!*  The thunderous sonic waves startle Eric and he staggers back, and hilariously starts rolling toward the edge of your palm.  \"Bwahaha!  You're like one of those little pill bugs!  Can you curl up into a ball too?\"   Eric is now on his knees, in supplication.  Feeling a tiny little person in your hand is like nothing else!  Your palm alone is the size of entire stadiums to him.  You delight at imagining him struggling to find steady footing on the fleshy palm of his now giant friend.  Bored with Eric for the time being, but still interested in keeping him around for later games, you close your fingers gently and lower him into your shorts down and down atop your penis shaft, leaving him to hang on for survival with whoever else may be caught within your wiry pubic hair.  With a self-satisfied smirk you let your shorts waistband snap back, plunging Eric into a musty darkness.  As you immodestly look down toward your crotch in plain view of the entire world below, you wonder if Eric might resent being trapped on a giant penis.  You delight in thinking that he'll never look at you the same again.  Even if you do ever restore him, he'll always carry the humiliating memory of you making him a  flea-sized resident of your pubic hair.  You snicker, knowing you'll enjoy the memory at least!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou once again stare down at the helpless world below, standing with your arms crossed and your feet spread apart.  In spite of all the destruction you have caused, there is no shortage of panicked activity below.   You love the feeling of utter dominance you have over this tiny race, thanks to your impressively huge stature.  You can only begin to imagine the terror these minuscule beings are experiencing at the sight of your towering form and your smug, masculine stance.  You grin at the thought that you must truly seem a monster to this tiny race, or an uncaring angel of destruction.  You uncross you arms and casually, you lift a foot into the air, slowly edge it forward, and slowly bring it down in front of its previous location, stepping on an entirely new section of prototypical residential suburb.  Your eyes gleam evilly as you think of all the untold suffering taking place under and around your obtrusive foot at this very moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust standing here, you appreciate that entire neighborhoods are currently smothered beneath your vast feet, with scores of men, women, and children flattened under the inescapable groaning white rubber of your sneakers, every slight shift of weight crunching additional houses. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou have to admit you enjoy using your size to fuel your tyrannical ego and sense of machismo.  Being feared as a god is every fantasy come true!  Being as cruel and as uncaring as possible enhances the experience even further.  Being able to act out every fiendish and cruel impulse upon these live intelligent beings is exhilarating, and especially while being so massive that you don't have to feel weighted by their thoughts or your disregard for morality or the untold number of atrocities you've performed.  You're very at ease with your status as an evil god.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving gained a better understanding of the workings of the crystal from this world's military, you decide to experiment with it once more.  You go to return to where it was last activated.  Returning to the battlefield from last night's military strike, you survey the tiny little fires scattered throughout and the smoking wrecks of gnat-sized fighter planes.  Contained inches deep within huge, muddy sneaker prints that you recognize are your own are termite-sized tanks and vehicles pressed into the wet, squelchy earth, most of them crushed totally flat by your immense mass when you stepped on them.  Once again you are fascinated and bemused by the size comparison; entire squadrons of armored tanks, missile launchers, and passenger trucks, all conquered and crushed by just a one guy's running shoe. You notice a scant few vehicles appear intact but half-buried -- likely as a result of fitting in between the rubber grooves and grass-stained ridges that pattern your sneaker treads, then left in place while your destructive feet found other targets.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand back up to your full height then curiously prop one foot against a knee to see underneath.  A self-satisfied smirk spreads across your face when you see that, amidst the abundance of debris, a few tiny military vehicles still remain stuck within the maze-like treads after all this time. Much to your amusement, a couple apparently contain trapped survivors, as signified by the barely perceptible spinning of wheels.  \"Sorry little guys, looks like those tanks are going to be your tombs,\" you state flatly.  Then, you laugh when you realize something else:  \"Hey, I guess that means the bottom of my sneaker will be your graveyard.. hey, at least it smells  better than being stuck inside of it!.\"  You laugh tauntingly.  \"Don't worry, I'll make sure you get plenty of visitors!\" You return your foot to the ground, extremely curious what the tiny people are experiencing with each step you take.  The massive shifts in gravity, the shaking impacts, and constant *THOOMs* of each of your footsteps must be overwhelming totheir senses. That of course is not your problem; now they know the consequences of taking you on, even if it is too late.  You move on and reach the crystal, which you quickly locate on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hold the crystal in your hands and focus. You realize you have just been scratching the surface of what fun could be had here.  You focus on increasing in size and seconds later, after a flash and disorienting period of a few seconds, you open your eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a brief second you stand in silent awe of your new perspective.  The sky is no longer the soft daylight sky blue it once was.  It is now much darker, a deep ocean blue on the horizon and slowly transitioning to near blackness above.  The sky looks more like space at your current altitude, with innumerable stars in every direction.  Looking down, beneath a layer of white film, which you recognize as clouds maybe a centimeter in height, is brown and green earth below, nearly flat.  You have grown so great in scale that  you can no longer make out people, structures, or even cities.  Even mountain ranges are barely perceptible.  Instead you mostly see only clusters and lines of yellow-lit dots amidst the land, in some areas densely clustered, in other areas absent totally, and in other areas stretched out in razor-thin outlines.  You realize these clusters and outlines represent areas of developed civilization, some more dense than others, and borders of states or perhaps countries.  Some of these sections are lit in distinct contrast to other areas, probably delineating either economic or technological disparity in infrastructure.  You also recognize bodies of water of different sizes and shapes, spread here and there, representing huge lakes that could likely be seen from a satellite, and perhaps parts of an ocean.  In the distance you realize you can even make out a slight but distinct curvature of the surface.  Amazingly, you have become so titanic in size that you can make out the planet's curvature. You aren't even sure how you can breathe at this height, but you don't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a moment to ponder that you truly are the closest thing this world could ever have to a god.  Before you were terrorizing cities.  Who knows how many of these little people are perishing under your titanic sneakers at this very moment: hundreds of thousands, if not millions.  Now, you're so cosmically gigantic that you could wipe out and bury entire countries in seconds.  You look down; your feet are big enough to cover nearly half of a small state or country.  With that thought, you smile devilishly, then raise a gargantuan foot...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Kick one guy's tiny little butt,  A well-placed flick would probably do the trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, I was told I would be facing you in battle,\" came a voice from not too far off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to see...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A rush of panic hits you.  About 10 feet from where you stand is another person, the same size as you, dressed in military attire.  He is wearing a camouflage shirt, pants, and brown combat boots.  He also has a pistol holstered on his belt.  You quickly rise to your feet.  This isn't good...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you're here to fight.\"  You try to sound as brave as you can, but you sense your own voice cracking with the last word.  The nervousness in your voice is no doubt audible to this fellow.  The people of this world have found a way to enlarge as well as shrink things, it seems. You look closer at the soldier.  He appears to be older than you, in his mid-twenties probably.  He has a light stubble. strong, chiseled features, and is taller and more solidly built than you, despite you being of above average height and equivalent in scale to him.  Suddenly, you don't feel so big anymore.  This soldier is no doubt well trained in many types of combat, including weaponry and hand-to-hand skills.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" the soldier replies in a deep, mature voice.  \"I see you glancing at my firearm.  Don't worry; I won't be needing that to fight you.  Wrestling down a skinny punk like you will be one of my easiest assignments yet.\"  You can feel your face flushing, turning red, and you know that all the people of this little world probably feel a bit less afraid of you than they were a few hours ago when you were terrorizing the populace.   They are surely rooting for their own giant champion right now.  \"However, if you would rather just hand over your hostage, that won't be necessary.  You know his name: Mark.  You can hand him over to me and walk away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark!  In the chaos of the military battle, you forgot about Mark!  Where did you leave him?  You put your hand on your chin and think back.  You remember him screaming within your ear, then pulling him out along with a clump of earwax, then forcing him to clean your toes, then storing him within one of your smelly running shoes as a practical joke and... uh oh.  You look down at your sneakers, which you see contain your feet... and if you had x-ray vision, no doubt a tiny Mark squashed under one of your massive soles.  If he wasn't outright flattened when you slid your shoes on, then simply the act of walking and running may well have annihilated his microbial body.  Not to mention the lack of air combined with the overwhelming heat and humidity present within your footwear.  Looking at the soldier, you decide to avoid the subject of Mark for the time being.  Without him, you have few cards to play.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about my friends,\u201d you boldly retort.  \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll give you back your little friend if you give me back mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your friends are off the table.  They are ours.  The only one we're letting go is you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, faced with this giant soldier\u2019s impressive physique in addition to his handgun, that\u2019s a deal that you would probably take \u2013 if you had Mark to return.  You stay very still, waiting to see if you feel any tickling sensations within your sneaker.  Maybe if he lived, his tiny movements could be sensed against your foot if you concentrated.  Although even if he lived, there is no guarantee that you would be let go even if you did return him in good condition.  For a second you think you can feel some speck beneath the arch of your foot.  Excited, you state, \"let me take off one of my shoes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I left your little ant friend in there.\"  The soldier eyes you cautiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lift your foot up into the air and lean over to grab the sneaker from off your foot.  The once muddy treads are now decorated with urban debris.  In an old piece of chewing gum there is an entire skyscraper impressed, completely intact.  You wonder if anyone in the building is alive.  Your train of thought stops when you give your sneaker a tug and instead of gracefully pulling it off your foot, it sort of snags and you trip, hopping forward.   \u201cNo!\u201d you hear the soldier yell.  The sneaker comes off and you fumble it with your hands for a second while hopping, until it finally drops and crushes a significant office block.  The neighborhood at your feet has also been laid to waste by your careless movements.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops\u2026\u201d   You look up to see the soldier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn his face is a look of horror at what you did.  Then, you realize why he is standing on the outskirts of the city, in the grassy, forested wilderness.  He wants to avoid any further damage.  Finally, you realize that *you* hold all the cards.  At your feet -- indeed, under them -- is an entire city of hostages.  You need only bring your foot down, literally, in order have your demands met. The soldier was banking on a verbal surrender.  He was hoping you would hand over Mark and leave.  Or even leave without giving over Mark.  The whole thing was a ruse.   Fighting you hand to hand would doubtless result in an innumerable number of casualties.  Even shooting you would cause your enormous body to annihilate the city below. They must not be able to shrink you, you realize, or else they would do that as they did to Jake and Eric.  But why would that be?  And what should you do now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You reach down and pick up your sneaker, careful not to do anymore damage to the surrounding area, however fun that might be, the giant soldier across from you could still drop you pretty easily if he felt he had to. You reach in and, much to your relief, manage to find tiny Mark still inside. You pull the frightened fidgeting little teen out. He\u2019s trying to yell something up to you, but you don\u2019t particularly care what the little bargaining chip has to say at the moment. You shove him in your pocket to make sure he doesn\u2019t disrupt the new deal you\u2019re about to set up. You put your sneaker back on and place your foot back where it was before taking it off. The soldier looks concerned but he seemed to try to hide the fact, he does a pretty good job, but you can still see the concern in his eyes.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSo what\u2019s your name?\u201d you ask the soldier as casually as you can.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cJack.\u201d He answered stoically.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSo, I think it\u2019s time we renegotiated our agreement.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cOh we\u2019ll get to that, don\u2019t worry, but first, how\u2019d they grow you? Out of curiosity.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t say.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d you say, slowly edging your right foot forward, smashing through several buildings before them.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cAlright! Alright! We\u2019ve made an experimental formula that can alter size, I don\u2019t understand it much myself. Just stand still.\u201d He said with a bit more authority.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSure, just keep talking and we won\u2019t have a problem. So, any reason you guys didn\u2019t shrink me or..?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s a shame\u201d you say as you start to inch your foot further.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m serious!\u201d he yells at you.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou keep pushing on \u201cYou can\u2019t ask?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cFine! Just, just stop.\u201d He stands there for a moment, silent. You can\u2019t see it but you assume he has some sort of communication device in his ear. \u201cThere\u2019s, only so much of it. It takes a lot to shrink a giant. And it was only experimental.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI guess that sounds reasonable\u201d you honestly don\u2019t know if you can trust him or not on this, but either way you decide to move on for now. \u201cWell I think I got an idea for a new deal.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cGive me some of the stuff that made you grow.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWhat!\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cHear me out. I wanna be a giant, you guys don\u2019t. So how about we compromise, you give me the growth stuff, I go home, and I\u2019ll just be a giant there.

A look of great concern crossed his face. Then it turned to fear and a sort of disillusionment. \u201c\u2026We\u2026 we will consider your terms\u2026\u201d he muttered. You think some of the higher ups of this world weren\u2019t as moral as the soldier had assumed.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cConsider? What am I supposed to do just stand here while you make up you minds?\u201d You ask impatiently.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe soldier was silent for a moment. \u201cWe agree to your terms\u2026\u201d the soldier was white as a ghost, and looked to be having some sort of existential crisis. \u201cI will retrieve the necessary materials. Please wait here.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThen the soldier marched off. You waited. Feeling it would be somehow against the rules to wreak any more stuff you stood in place. After a couple of minutes you crouched down and decided to take a closer look at the tiny world. You looked down at the world devastated by your presence. You first notice the stark contrast of the absolute destruction from your sneakers pounded around when you dropped you shoe. There was simply nothing left but a wafer thin layer of debris. You assumed the debris was buildings or cars but you honestly couldn\u2019t make out any specific structures, only the black and grey of what was left of what ever happened to be there.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThen, out from the most obvious point of destruction, you saw the rest of the world. There were many wrecks all over the road, you guess because you distracted all the drivers or just caused so much chaos around them. Then you noticed that even in areas you hadn\u2019t been near buildings had collapsed, destroyed from you simply walking around. The people on the ground, for the most part, didn\u2019t really pay attention to you. They all seemed quite preoccupied with evacuating, or perhaps looking for loved ones, or, well there could be a hundred different reasons for any one of them really.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou found this all rather fascinating, however after about 10 minutes or so, you started to get bored with, what was essentially watching ants scurry around. So you stood back up, stretched out a bit, took a deep breath. Then you looked back at the camp site and saw the pizza box of soldiers still lying on the ground. You chucked a bit as you remembered them. You looked around for any sign of the soldier coming back, there was none.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou walk back over to the pizza box, careful to only step on spots you\u2019ve already destroyed, which was surprisingly easy. You picked up the box and opened it up to see all the little soldiers still sitting inside. The first shield their eyes from the sun, before each looking up at you disdainfully. They clearly hate you, and the position that they\u2019re in, but they seemed to have learned better than to try anything. You think you should add them to the new deal; they really do somehow feel like yours now. You went out and captured them yourself, and you think the tiny\u2019s pathetic little army would make the perfect souvenir, as well as be a hoot of a toy. Your mind wondered to throwing them into an ant farm type container, and forcing them to worship you and jerk you off whenever you felt like.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou took another look around to see if there was any sign of the soldier yet before stuffing as many of the tiny guys into your pocket as you could. After your pockets were all as full as they were gonna get you closed the lid and placed the box back where it was. You took another look around for the other giant when you saw him off in the distance. You think he was far enough away that he didn\u2019t see anything. You walk back to where you were when he left.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nSoon you 2 were back where you were, only he something in his hand. You could see he wanted to ask what you were up to while he was gone, but you guess he thought it best to try to get this over with as quickly as possible. \u201cAlright I\u2019ll escort you back to your home world now.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWait\u201d You said \u201cI want to amend the deal; I want the soldiers in the pizza box over there.\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You smile to yourself before turning around to fetch the box. You pick it up, giving it a little shake this time. Satisfied with the soldiers and tanks rustling around inside you start off toward the portal. You stop. Looking back you see the soldier hasn\u2019t moved.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cThought you said you were gonna accompany me?\u201d You asked. There wasn\u2019t any area already destroyed he could step on to get over here, meaning to do it, he would have to clear a path of destruction himself.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cI. Yes.\u201d He took a deep breath. He slowly lifted his right boot. He moved it forward and slowly brought it down on several blocks of suburbs. He looked ashamed of himself as he shifted his weight. Then he took another drawn out step forward with his other boot. He took several more until he got to the point where he could walk in you footprints. \u201cFucking hell\u2026\u201d you heard him mutter to himself.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHis feet were bigger than yours. No matter how he proceeded he would be forced to destroy more under each step. He walked on, following in your footsteps best he could, looking somewhat annoyed mixed in with the shame. Soon you were both standing at the entrance to the portal, where he walked through right behind you.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nYou emerged into the familiarity of your back yard. The soldier looks around amazed at your world. \u201cIt looks just like home\u2026\u201d he said to himself. The he glanced down at his boots. He lifted one up to inspect the sole. On it he saw the same sort of layer of destruction you did when you looked at the ground waiting for him. He sighed before placing it back down on the ground.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSo me being a giant again?\u201d you asked.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nA look of apprehension appeared on his face as he seemed to realize he was simply dooming this world to some soon to be giant sociopath.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cRight\u2026\u201d He sighed \u201cIt\u2019s simple.\u201d In his hand you saw a crystal and what looked like a sort of container for it. \u201cThis crystal has energy. This little thing here\u201d he says holding up the container \u201cFocuses the energy to alter scale at the user\u2019s discretion.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cCool\u2026\u201d you say picking up the things<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cJust put the crystal in the container, focus your thoughts on changing size and it\u2019ll happen. But keep in mind it will only have so much power. It\u2019ll get you to giant relative to this world but after that it\u2019ll probly be all outta juice.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cGood\u2026 So, uh, I gotta ask, why didn\u2019t you uh shrink me down earlier?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cWell, the user of the crystal will be equally affected in all size changing matters, and they must be very close to the target, actually that was the original plan. That was what I was originally told to do.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cSo why didn\u2019t you then?\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cPlan changed.

Having captured or annihilated the military forces that were attacking you, you turn your attention to the rest of the ground forces that were assaulting Jake and Eric.  You lumber toward Jake and Eric's unconscious bodies and wave the torch down to the ground to reveal a swarm of teeny men jogging toward the hulking teenage forms. In tow are hundreds of trucks with what look like retractable cable wires attached.  This force is clearly designed to transport objects of titanic proportions: you and your friends.  It would take at least one or two hundred of these teeny men and their puny vehicles to successfully latch onto and inch just one of you or your equally massive friends across the ground, you surmise.  You imagine for a moment the story of Gulliver\u2019s Travels, where the little people tie the main character down to the ground with a thousand thread-like cables.  Unlike that character, however, you wouldn\u2019t have any problem with using your size to your advantage and swatting your minuscule captors like the gnats they are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you have revealed the tiny specialized force with the light of your torch, you stride forward and stop right next to the long convoy, until the traversing people and their trucks are only an inch away from your massively bigger feet.   Watching the disciplined force staying in formation and bravely crossing right in front of your toes like a line of trained ants, you speak: \u201cWhat do you runts think you\u2019re doing?\u201d  You smirk down at the ants at first, then frown as they simply ignore your presence.  You kneel down and go to pick up one of the vehicles.  Your fingertips are stopped by some invisible force however.  They bounce back and your hand is repelled.  You attempt to grab several vehicles in this fashion but all of them seem to be protected by a kind of forcefield.  You stand back up and lift a foot into the air, ready to bring it down on a portion of the convoy.  As you lower your foot to stamp a group of trucks flat, the same thing happens.  \u201cWhat the..\u201d  you mouth hangs open as you watch the convoy simply ignore you.  You find it maddening that your would-be victims can freely go about their business without your interference.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun is now coming up.  As you watch the trucks attach cables to Eric\u2019s and Jake\u2019s clothing in order to transport them back to the city, you watch some birds fly down below.  Amazingly, they were able to into the zone where your hand was repelled from.  It seems whatever technology is being used repels things of a large size, while allowing much smaller objects to pass through it.  The only way to stop this operation is to find a way to shrink to the pathetic size of this little race and sabotage them from within.  You recall the crystal has such power.  You also recall that Mark is still in your possession.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In a lot of ways, it's freeing being able to act out all of your desires without being concerned about what these tiny people think -- not when your sheer mass is enough to petrify them with fear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brush the little commuters and their vehicles off your shorts using one hand to gently sweep them into the palm of your other.  When you gather them all up, a cruel idea flies through your mind.  You pull the elastic waistband of your shorts back and drop the rabble into your pubic hair surrounding your hardened shaft.  \"Good luck staying on!\"  You let the waistband snap back against your abdomen and immediately you can feel slight tingling sensations as the people pull slightly on the individual pubes, desperate not to fall through your shorts and to the ground, either to die from the impact or to be crushed beneath your feet.  It certainly is ego-building to imagine these little people as being similar to tiny little parasites residing in your nether region.  You can't imagine how dehumanized they must feel to be trapped next to a pair of oversized sweaty balls as if they were nothing but pubic lice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?!\" the little man inside your ear says.

Meanwhile, your bare feet press down over cars as you walk over multi-lane highway, which the width of your foot easily covers.  The little crunches you can hear and feel are simply exhilarating.  Even small buildings are no match for your tough soles.  You grab your socks and sneakers and as you slip them on, another idea comes to mind.  \"Say, why don't you tell me who your leader is?  Where can I find him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, the teenager's voice replies.  \"What good would it do us to tell you?  You think we don't know that you just going to want to stamp your feet on his mansion!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh.  I promise I won't do that.  That wouldn't be useful to me either.  I want to talk with him.  It would be smart for you to tell me, because at the rate I'm going, I just might step on him accidently once my friends come back and we decide to wipe your entire little city out.  But that would be after I dig yout out of there and introduce you and your parents to my toejam!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's disgusting.  How about washing your feet, you big slob!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What fun would that be?  Then you little ant-people wouldn't get to experience the smell, hahah!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe husband interrupts abruptly, no doubt sickened by the bodily nature of the conversation.  \"We'll tell you where he lives.  But you have to let us go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal.\"  You haven't decided whether you will follow through on that deal or not, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He lives in a large mansion outside of town.  You can't miss it, if you walk in the direction opposite of the ocean.  It's on the largest hill in the outskirts.  Now will you let us go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah.\"  Immediately the family in your ear begin shouting in unison, no doubt outraged by brazen lack of honor.  \"Pipe down, pipsqueaks.  I want to find the mansion first.  Then you can go free.\"  The shouting stops.  \"Now then, off to find your leader.\"   You can hardly contain yourself.  You haven't decided whether or not you want to torture him or make an example out of him.  Or even better, you could command him to rule the city as your puppet, and build monuments and statues in your image.  You don't know if you should tell Jake and Eric about this plan, though.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You decide to go on this mission by yourself.  You scan the horizon for the mountain that the little man in your ear described.  You see several little hills here and there, about ankle-high, but none of them are on the outskirts.  Then, a little more distant than the rest, you see what might look like a mountain to these tiny people.  You trudge through the now mostly crushed city toward that mountain.  You can faintly hear sirens eminating from all directions at your feet.  Little plumes of smoke and what looks like fires litter the smoldering surface.  You can only imagine what sort of hellish scenario is playing out down there.  You lumber toward the mountain and realize that it is tall and narrow -- sort of like an artificially created spire of rock covered with trees that rises about as high as your knees.  You walk up to it and lean down slightly to inspect further.  You can see at the very top of the mountain is a flattened plateau and on it is a white little mansion, a lake, and some delicate trees.  Better yet, scattered throughout the estate are tiny people -- probably servants, attendants, even government officials.  You lift one of your feet up into the air, hold it in place for a moment, as though you were about to descend it upon the mountaintop, but then step clean over the mountain, causing the tiny creatures below to cringe in fear as you swing your leg over so that your two feet are planted on either side of the structure.  You stare down, pleased with the dominant posture you have adopted as you straddle the mountain between your legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * * <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assembly of gardeners, caterers, and politicians stared up in awe at the massive giant that had just approached the mayor's idyllic mansion estate.  Over the roof of the mansion, the lowest you could view of him were the uppermost portion of his muscular calves.  Above that were his kneecaps, which were wide enough to cover the guests' entire field of view in one direction.  Directly above was the giant male's crotch, and for those at the most distant-from-the-center of the estate, they could make out the giant's long chest and his visage, which was expressing a self-satisified smirk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe assembly had heard of the three enormous invaders that had mysteriously appeared to terrorize the city, but they had not expected that the invaders would somehow know about the mayor's mountain estate where they had taken refuge.  Along with simply stamping his massive feet on structures, vehicles, and countless people along with the other two invaders, this tall, slim giant was seen on the news broadcasts earlier sitting his bottom atop the landscape and seemingly abducting citizenry.  There had been a great deal of speculation as to who these invaders were.  Some had suggested they were aliens.  However, that didn't explain why these aliens looked similar to humans, only much bigger in size, not to mention the fact that they appeared to be wearing athletic shoes, shorts, and polo shirts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mayor was alerted to this giant's presence and was hiding inside.  All the guests knew what the plan was: someone would have to step in as a decoy for the mayor.  Letting the giant abduct him would surely be the worst fate for their already-damaged city.  They now had to hope that the handsome bully who smirked at them from the clouds would be easily deceived, else they would surely be subject to whatever tortures and cruelties his whims would lead him to perform.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to make this easy for you.  I know your leader is down there.  If he gives himself up, you all get to live.  Otherwise...\"  You lift your foot up into the air once more, raising it high, almost against your abdomen.  You slowly lower it so that your heel presses down against the edge of the mountaintop.  You suspect you could probably tip this narrow structure over completely with a strong thrust of your leg.  You press forward slightly, until you see a crack form at the side of the mountain, close to the base.    \"Heheh, looks like your little 'mountain' won't be standing up for much longer!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a second, someone on the plateau desperately begins waving his arms, no doubt trying to get your attention.  You lift your foot off the mountain and bring it back down on the smoldering footprint it left.  You bend over to examine the figure.  He is a young man, you suspect, wearing what looks like a fancy black suit.  You reach down to snatch him.  </span></div></div>",

Certainly, your stadium sized hand alone surely disempowers any sense of authority he thinks he may have.  \"Tell me why I shouldn't crush you like a bug,\" you command in a deep, authoritative voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bring the little man up closer to your face, smirking as the mere act of your blinking startles the bold authority figure.  Briefly, he explains that he is the president of the country you are currently visiting.  He is quite charismatic and articulate you realize, after only a moment of listening to his miniscule voice.  It's clear how this young, handsome male rose to power, just from his admittedly impressive force of personality.  Too bad his size doesn't match that personality, you think amusingly.  More intriguing is the fact that he states that your coming to this world, and in specific this city, was no accident.  The crystal was constructed to lure you here.  Furthermore, the size changing technology only works on your species; not theirs.  For that reason, he could have never used it on his own people.  In fact, he states, he was hoping that he could employ you to attack several of his rival countries in order to for him to complete what sounds like a world conquest.

He doesn't strike you as very authoritative or powerful, but you're not sure if that's just due to his minuscule. Either way this bug doesn't seem to the leader you asked for an audience for. Taking one look at the covering figure, you squeeze your fingers together, crushing him instantly. You look back down at the plateau between your legs with a look of dismay. \"Looks like you guys didn't get the message. Guess I'll have to just take charge then\", you coldly state. You crouch down, bringing yourself closer to the toy mansion. In doing so, some of the \"passengers\" from your shorts fall to the ground below. The driveway is soon littered with smashed bodies and vehicles, with a few of the attendants even getting crushed beneath a car. However you still have to teach these bugs a lesson. You reach down and pinch a couple of people between your fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cruel thought flies into your mind. In all the films you've seen with giant monsters, people always wind up getting eaten. What better way to show these runts they mean nothing then to devour them as if they were nothing but little treats. Grinning, you slowly open your mouth and stick your tongue out. You bring your hand over, watching with glee as the people struggle to release themselves. Once they are positioned over your tongue, you release them and let them fall onto your sticky appendage. You feel them like pieces of grain sticking to your tongue. You close your mouth and swash them about before swallowing. The tiny people below have descended into absolute chaos, as they watched you devour their colleagues. An erection looms over the minuscule mansion, no doubt brought on by the absolute power you held over these bugs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lower yourself further, and sit onto the plateau. You feel some of the fleeing people and vehicles be crushed beneath you, sending even more jolts of pleasure through your body. Now the mansion sits right in front of your shorts. You then noticed for the first time that you could hear nothing in your ear. The little occupants must have fallen out at some point but this doesn't bother you at all. You have plenty others to take their place. Casually you move your hand around, crushing the fleeing bugs beneath your finger or poking holes in the mansion. Soon the driveway is littered with bloody remains and streaks of red. Next you curl your hand into a fist and punch the structure. It breaks apart completely with the force of your strike, sending brick, glass and people flying down the mountain. You move to stand once again, but not before grabbing some of the survivors. Once again you drab the disorientated people onto your penis, their movements sending all kinds of wonderful feelings through you.</span></div></div>",

You offer to venture back home yourself while Jake and Eric remain in this little world to enjoy tormenting the little people.  You follow your own smouldering footprints back to where you first entered into this world, walking alongside your old pair of tracks instead of in them, in order to maximize the amount of killing, panic, and destruction you cause with each step.  After crunching back to the beginning, you see the quarter-sized crystal on the ground.  Since your departure from this area, a military force has surrounded it and walled it off with what looks like a half-inch tall fence of barbed wire.  Tanks and little men are on all sides and the crystal itself is covered by netting.  You can't help but admire these little guy's systematicness, as well as their courage when a platoon of insect-sized marines rush out of some barracks and begin firing up at you.  With a smirk, you lift your foot and effortlessly press the entire platoon under the toe of your sneaker.  You also kneel down and pick up some of the tanks and pocket them for later.  Afterward, you simply step over the barbed wire fence (which doesn't even go higher than the tread of your sneakers) and pull the crystal from the netting.  You squeeze the crystal and seconds later, after a flash of light envelops your field of vision, you find yourself in the grassy backyard of your house, crystal still in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou haven't had an opportunity to look at the crystal closely yet.  You do so now... and are amazed at what you see when you hold it to your eye.  Inside the crimson backdrop of the crystal you can see a landscape at its base.

In your hand is a race of tiny, intelligent people whose entire world is no greater in size than your pinky toe.  You bring the world closer to your face once more and peer inside.  Barely, just barely, you can make out the figures of two tiny teenagers kicking, stamping, and shuffling around over the surface of the little landscape.  You thought you were huge when you were inside the crystal... but you actually shrunk in size, you realize, as you see a miniature Eric and Jake bullying the now-microscopic race of intelligent life inside the crystal.  You wonder if you could hear them through the crystal wall...  you bring the crystal to your right ear, pressing it firmly against the lobe to maximize your acuity.  You can hear the two of them chattering as though they were tens of yards away from you; they're too small and the crystal wall is too thick for you to understand them.  Surely that doesn't mean they couldn't understand you, though, with your much bigger voice!  You lower the crystal and bring it back in front of your face and shout \"Boo!\" and watch with amusement as the tiny figures of Jake and Eric start twirling around inside the crystal, their heads moving this way and that as they no doubt search for the thundering voice coming from their sky.  \"Don't you recognize my voice?\" you ask playfully.  You give the crystal a violent shake with your palm to see if you can tip your two unwitting victims over.  They seem to be unaffected: the gravity inside the crystal must be isolated only to that area. The two of them are simply staring directly up at the sky above them, or to your perspective, up at the roof of the crystal not being able to see you.  \"Well guys, I have you, and the whole little crystal world in my hand right now... and I think I want to see the view from above.  Only this time, from WAY above. You better enjoy being little giants while you can... because soon there's only going to be one giant!\"  You leave them with that cryptic message and lower the object.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout any further ado, you walk over to the sidewalk in the back of your house and let the crystal fall from your hand onto the cement surface below, looking at it predatorially as it tumbles and rings against the stone until it stops at the tip of your toe.  The crystal is made out of a glass-like material and is hollow, so it should be easy enough to crush with a few stomps, you surmise.  You raise your foot over it and plant it on top of the crystal, gently resting it on the crystal's surface to test its strength.  You push some weight down to see if it cracks at all.  Confident of its sturdiness, you lift your foot into the air and slam it down over the crystal firmly.  The ball of your foot is stopped by the crystal's hardness.  It's going to take more force than that, you realize.  You raise your foot one more time and with all of your force, bring your heel down to smash it open.  Not only do you not penetrate the crystal's tough shell, but your foot slides off it and you fall backwards.  You would have been embarrassed had anyone been able to see you.  You angrily snatch the crystal up and glare inside at the seemingly unaffected Jake and Eric, who still can't see you.  You pocket it and decide to resort to more drastic measures.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You bring it back up to your room, not daring to let anyone outside see or hear your activities.  You lock your bedroom door, kick off your shoes, and set the crystal down on the thick desk across from your bed.  \"This shouldn't be too hard..\" you say to yourself.  Standing up still, you raise the hammer about six inches over the crystal and eagerly bring it down.  Smashed!  You lift the hammer up and set it aside and look triumphantly at the fissure your stroke has left in the top of the crystal.  You find it quite easy to stick your fingernails in the crack and peel off a piece nearly half the size of the crystal's jagged roof.   You set the fragment down and slide your head over the opened crystal to peer through.  You see Jake and Eric's ant-sized forms looking up at your visage in panic.  \"How's the view from down there, little guys?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how did you get so big?!\" a tiny little Jake says, looking up at you in awe from the interior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forget about me, I'd be more worried about what's going to happen to you!\" you retort.   You tilt the crystal on its side and let Jake and Eric tumble across the landscape, out of the crystal, and into your palm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, what to do about all these tiny people...\" you posit.  Wiping them all out at once would be fun, to be sure.  But then again, doing so would limit your future possibilities.  Still, being responsible for extinguishing a whole species of intelligent life, causing an apocalypse.. that isn't something your everyday teenage guy gets to do!  You can hardly contain yourself as your pick up the crystal once more and look inside one last time with a big grin across your face, knowing that every pathetic little runt in this world is now looking up at your gleeful, sky-sized face.  To them, this is an entire extinction event.  You can't even begin to imagine what it would be like in your world, if some giant alien or something literally was holding the planet in his hand to crush like a grape.  The thought of that makes this even more savory to you, knowing that you are the giant alien.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter you finish surveying the interior, you lean just a little bit more forward... and give the crystal a sharp and quick blow.  A thin dust lifts from the surface of the crystal's floor and brushes out the side.  \"Oops... looks like I just blew half the world off the ground.  Too bad for them!\" you say to Jake and Eric, who you have left on the desk under your watchful gaze.  \"Now to finish the job...\" You really enjoy the next part.  You peel the other half of the crystal's roof away, exposing the untouched half of the world's populace.  You bring the crystal to your face and open your mouth.  Then, you slowly stick your long tongue out of your mouth and extend it.  You place the sticky appendage against the floor of the crystal, where it surely has flattened or gathered up a great portion of those still living.  Then, you simply drag your tongue across the surface.  You can feel little grains gather at the tip of your tongue as the wall of flesh consumes one city after another.  You finish, relishing the tingling sensation that the people on your tongue cause as they drown in the saliva inside your oral cavity.\"Thdat thastes gud\" you say aloud so Jake and Eric can hear, and then swallow.  Finally you take the crystal, surely void of *almost* all life, and place it upright at the bottom of a drinking glass you left in your room from earlier.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the survivors of this event can rebuild... and this time, a new civilization can emerge in your own image.  You have the power to shape this new one in any way you want, at this size.  You can picture returning to the crystal world to command the building of enormous statues in your likeness, tiny slaves toiling their lives away in order to avoid your crushing wrath, like the Egyptian slaves on the pyramids.  But that's all for a later date, when you repair the crystal and return.  For now, you have Jake and Eric to toy with!</span></div></div>",

It worked! You quickly kill the engine, and step out to retrieve your prize. Surely enough, a small fissure has appeared in the crystal. You grab the crystal in your hand and rush up to room, desperate to see this world at your new scale. Sitting at your desk, you cannot contain your zest. You slips one of your nails into the crack and begin to pull. It takes effort and you struggle to break the precious gem. Suddenly the crystal is torn open, and a flash of light fills the room. You instinctively shut your eyes, as dimensions collapse into one another within your palm. Whatever you've done, it hasn't turned out as you intended. The light intensified and you suddenly lose consciousness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awake, slightly dazed. You sit up, and look around, trying to gain your bearings. You gasp in shock at the sight that greets you. You have been brought back to the minuscule world, though you are much larger than before. Now skyscrapers that reached your knees, stand no taller than the length of your nail. You body stretches into the sky and you can see clouds at your torso. You seem to have been transported to the original city, and suddenly you see the tiny forms of Eric and Jake, gazing up at you in fear. They look to be an inch tall, almost as small as the micro-inhabitants once were to you. You laugh at the sight of their tiny forms, standing in the even smaller city. You stand to your feet, a true god in this world. There is nothing that even comes close to your enormity. \"Well, well, well, guys, looks like there's only one true giant here\", you say with glee. From this height, the city becomes a grayish blob. You can make out the buildings if you squint. No doubt the micro people have given up all hope of survival once you arrived. You cannot even see them as tiny people anymore, but merely barely visible specks. Your two friends stand petrified as you tower above them. You gaze down at them for a moment, then raise your foot. Swiftly, you drop it beside the two of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sheer force of your stomp knocks them to the ground. Anything beneath your foot is utterly obliterated. You have already killed more people with one step than your friends did since their arrival. Buildings in the vicinity collapse from the shockwave, and a deep indentation of your runner is ground into the earth. You take a few more steps, delighting in the utter destruction you wreak. Thousands upon thousands of families and civilians are crushed in an instant beneath your unrelenting feet. To them, this is the apocalypse, the end of their world. You return to the miniature forms of Jake and Eric. You lie down on your chest, so as to get a better look at your former friends. Your descending body is the last sight of many the city's inhabitants and you destroy even more of the city beneath your body. Even your dick, which has hardened at the new found power you posses, cannot be stopped and demolishes an entire block beneath the head. Finally, you look down at your tiny friends, a massive smirk spread across your face. \"You guys look a bit....smaller than I remember\", you gloat. You wonder what it must be like for them, once proud and mighty giants, now nothing more than ants before you. You scan the city around them. There is still some infrastructure, though everything is either on fire or heavily damaged. A thought pops into your head. Slowly you extend your tongue out and lower it on to the city. You drag it across the surface, gathering buildings, vehicles and fleeing people alike. You stop just before your friends, and draw it back into your mouth, chewing up whatever you collected. It doesn't taste like anything, but you enjoy the display of power nonetheless.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Already, Eric is shuffling his feet around, sliding them across the terrain, effortlessly stamping at different places along the roads.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... you're killing them, dude!\" Jake exclaims.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou say to Jake: \"So?  Should we walk on tip toes or what?  We're giants here and that's the way it is.  You're already stepping on them if you hadn't noticed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right,\" he replies in agreement.  Why don't we try finding one of their towns?  Maybe we can talk to these little guys and see who they are.\"  You nod in agreement, and Jake and you walk across the highwayed landscape, staring at every little sight quizzically and with fascination.  A lot of killing and destruction are left in your wake, mainly on account of Eric deliberately stepping on the most heavily trafficked roads... but there's nothing you could do to not crush these people anyway at this size, short of standing completely still. Before long, you see a line of buildings erected from the ground, the tallest ones no higher than your knees.  The three of you quickly overtake this sight.  The sprawling city is several meters across, and beyond it is a neverending ring of smaller but still crowded buildings -- the suburbs of this little city.  The three of you trudge through one of these towns and stop just short of the main skyline.  Right in front of your own toes is an elevated line of rail that is circling the city.  A long monorail type train of cars comes zipping by your toes.  Curiously, you quickly crouch down and examine the little train as it zooms past your left foot.  Before it gets past your right foot, you bring your hand down and with your thumb and forefinger, pinch the very last car of the train and watch with an intellectual fascination as the train struggles to push forward.  Holding it is an almost completely effortless task for you, but you can feel the engine of the train being strained by this force.  You wonder what the people inside are thinking.   The train suddenly jerks off its track and the front of the car-train begins to lunge off the side of the elevated track.  You quickly dart your other hand under it and catch it.  Finally you lift the entire train up in your palm, rise to your full height, and lift it below your face.  The train, now toppled on its side, is wrecked from your toying with it.  People have climbed out of the windows on top of the train and some onto the fleshy surface of your vast palm.  You scrutinize them with intense interest as they look upon your visage above them.  With the train destroyed, you see no reason to drop it to the ground... so you carefully close your fist around it, trying not to let too many people slip through your fingers (many still do), and then lower the vehicle and its occupants into your shorts pocket for later study.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that done, you look down at the city below.  Already, you see helicopters zipping up out of the expanse below right up to your head.  Suddenly a dozen of them are wizzing about your ears rather annoyingly.  You resist the urge to swat them down or smash them with a clap your hands like you normally do a fly.  As they gather around, you hear a faint male voice announcing something through a little megaphone.  \"Giants... please leave.... destroying our towns... we don't want to use force...\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric responds by blowing at a group of three helicopters in front his face and watching them erupt into flames on the cratered earth at his feet.  \"Nice job,\" Jake says.  \"Now they're going to use force on us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what if they do.  These puny little pricks can't do anything to stop us,\" Eric states proudly.  \"At least we'll get to have some fun,\" he finishes.  You tend to agree with Eric.  Even if you haven't been intentionally stomping on these people as Eric had been, the military will no doubt recognize that you have in fact flattened a good number of buildings beneath your own two feet.  And besides, the military surely can't be that dangerous.  </span></div></div>",

Most of them disperse and escape but two are flung down by your swats.  Within minutes, a few columns of vehicles emerge from between the city's knee-high skyline.  You stay completely still, eyeing everything with intense interest.  Before long, the three of you are entirely surrounded by little green tanks, trucks with missiles across them, and little groups of army men huddled around the vehicles.  At once, all the vehicles open fire.   At first, nothing hurts.  You see little tracers from rifle shots and some little impacts against your ankles but none of it is strong enough to pierce your tough skin.  However, that changes after a shot from one of those long missle trucks.  As you stand there proudly absorbing the blows, you see the missle being launched from the truck.  It flies through the air and makes impact against your ankle and the second it does, you feel as though you'd been stung by a bee.  Instinctively, you draw your foot up into the air and backward, and losing your temper, you grit your teeth and slam it back down on the location of the truck, destroying not only the missile truck but flattening several tanks and troopers as well.  After enjoying the rather nice crunch, you tilt your foot on its side and look down with satisfaction at the almost sheet-flat pieces of metal that lay on the ground, that were once tanks and trucks.  \"Little punks,\" you gloat proudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Eric and Jake take care of the troops nearby, you finish the rest of the forces that attacked you.  Besides simply stamping your feet on top of many of the troopers, at one point you crouch down and straighten out your index finger and push it down on top of vehicles from above, crushing individual vehicles with each poke of your finger.   After that, you start picking tanks up and flicking them away with your fingers.  After annihilating the military force, you rise to your full height once more and get to work on the city proper.  You begin by driving your foot through one the tall skyscrapers.  You watch in amusement as your foot goes clean through, causing the entire building to come crashing down on its side.  Its fall to the ground creates a rather large dustcloud below.  Then, you lean down and grip your fingers around another tall building and forcefully uproot it.  The building starts crumbling away as you lift it into the air but remains more or less whole in your palm.  You watch as tiny people fly out from the bottom of the building as you raise it up to your face.  For fun, you bring the building right up to your eyes and make an act of peering inside by squinting one of your eyes.  Then, you suddenly loosen your grip around the building and mockingly say \"Oops\" as you let it slip through your fingers onto the ground below.   With the military destroyed, the three of you survey the ground around your feet.  Pockets of fire have erupted in several places. And your steps everywhere have left rather amusing looking, sneaker shaped craters where the ground and everything on it has just been crushed utterly.  You reflect on how fun all this destruction has been, even if it was a little immature.   Just by walking around, you've killed probably thousands of people.  You think you could get used to being a giant.  </span></div></div>",

Already you can see ships beginning to depart from the dock, no doubt an attempt to escape the devastation. Not if you had anything to say about it! You stride over to the city's edge, leaving destruction with every step you take but at this point, it doesn't bother you. You're beginning to enjoy this new experience as an all-powerful giant. \"Where are you going\", Jake calls from behind you. By now, he and Eric have finished their assault on the military force. You glance over to see a group of soldiers, cornered against the rubble of a skyscraper and Eric. He's sitting on the ground, no doubt crushing whatever was once there. Giving them a smirk, he quickly swipes at the men, grabbing about half of them. He stands up and pockets the group in his hand and then stomps on the remaining soldiers, crushing them with ease. \"Just taking a look around\", you reply. You continue your stroll through the city until you reach the waterfront. You see ships, big and small, litter the dock. As soon as you arrive, you notice more of the ant-like people scatter to find refuge in the floating vessels. You marvel at your sheer size compared to the ships. Objects that back home would dwarf you, are now no bigger than one of your fingers. The water doesn't look too deep, so you throw off your sneakers, watching them pulverize buildings as they land on the city. Peeling off your socks, you step into the water. Thankfully it isn't too cold and soon enough, you make your way out to catch the fleeing ships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon approach a moderately-sized ship. It looked like a passenger ferry, and you slowly lower your hand underneath it before rising up, lifting it out of the water. You gaze at the terrified people on board, grinning as they fall due to the sudden ascension. The encompassing power you hold over these tiny beings is absolute, and you feel a sudden urge to display it to them. The ship is light in your hand and there is easily a hundred people on board, young and old alike. You bring your other hand over and straightening your index finger, lower it on to the deck. Some people escape in time, but a good number are crushed against your finger. The deck is smeared with blood and crushed remains and you hear tiny screams from the other passengers. However you've spent enough time with this ship. You slowly wrap your fingers around the hull and begin to squeeze. It doesn't take much effort the crush the ship in your hand and you drop the debris into the water. You look around, looking upon the other ships with intrigue. You make your way through the water and pick up two other ships. However these ones you simply place in your pockets to mess with later. You crush another by stepping on it, submerging it beneath the water and other you send flying with a kick. Finally you step out of the water, content with your little game. You look over to Jake and Eric, who are making their way toward the crystal. It seems it's time for a break and you walk over to join them, crushing even more of the city. You grab the crystal and in a flash, you are brought back to your own world.</span></div></div>",

Before long, the skyscrapers that you were just kicking over are as tall as you.  \"Hey!\" you scream out to Jake and Eric  on either side of you but by the time you get it out, you two of them have grown above you by miles!  You stretch your neck up to see their bare legs extending into the sky above, connecting to their towering torsos and heads that are far above the clouds.  No!  You're tiny now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lower your eyes and look all about you in panic.  The only consistent thing of note is that everything -- EVERYTHING is flattened and crushed, as though some giant, flat, waffle iron came down and squashed the whole place indiscriminately.  You realize that is almost precisely what happened -- but not with a waffle iron.  Instead, you realize, it was beneath the waffle-like patterned tread of your formerly gigantic sneaker.  The cars on the road are just crumpled, flat colorful metal rectangles.  Normally they would be life-sized to you, but because one of your feet was planted on this location just a few seconds ago, nothing on the ground extends up more two or three yards.  Everything -- including what is left of the buildings, cars, and trees -- are of almost *exactly* level height to each other, due to the flatness of the underside of your sneaker. There are squashed humans as well, but not many.  You prop your feet up against your knees and realize where most of them are: still stuck to the bottom of your feet like smashed ants.  You are struck by the fact that you might end up the same way, if you don't get out of here.  You quickly run down the lifeless road before you, opposite the direction of Eric and Jake's lumbering forms.  The two of them stamp loudly away after only a few seconds after exchanging words so booming and low that you can hardly understand.   You see tall buildings just a few hundred more feet down the road, along with moving vehicles and the distant figures of humans.  There are no fires there, no destruction.  A clear line of wreckage delineates the border of that untouched zone, which you recognize as the edge of your giant, smoking footprint.  Past the fires and the wreckage, you take cover just behind the last destroyed building.  You peer around the side and see crowds of people gathered at the edge of the road before it cracks, just outside this destroyed area, looking with fear and amazement at what took place here.  You aren't sure if they will recognize you or not.  If they recognize you, then probably they won't be too pleased that you were content to simply stand on top of their civilization while examining them for fun.  Then again, they did strike at you with their military.  Maybe you can convince them that you aren't so bad.   What do you want to do?</span></div></div>",

You take a moment to briefly rehearse what statements you are going to make before you venture upon the crowd and perform.  After running the scenario through your mind a few times, you begin to walk down the street leading to the crowd.  You trot along confidently, making yourself appear as deliberate and bold as possible.  It's not long before the smoke thins and someone in the crowd shouts out at the sight of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look!\"  <br>\r\n\"IT'S ONE OF THE GIANT YOUNG MEN!\"<br>\r\n\"Why isn't he giant anymore?\"  <br>\r\n\"SHH!  He might be able to change size at will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcellent, you think to yourself.  You come close to the crowd and smirk as all the people back away from you in a semi-circle of at least several yards.  This is good, you think.  They still fear you.  You examine the people, noticing they are physically identical to you but their style of dress is slightly different -- more futuristic looking.  The people continue talking amongst themselves to each other until one finally shouts at you directly, asking why you are here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence!\" you shout.  Quickly everyone goes quiet.  \"As you have already witnessed, I am a young man belonging to a species of giant-sized aliens.   What you are seeing now is my reduced form, designed to facilitate communication with you tiny lifeforms.   I warn you: if any of you attempt to attack me in this form, I will immediately change size and tramp my feet down on this location. I think you've already seen what happens to the areas of your city I feel like tramping my feet on.\"  You gesture behind you to the smoking, demolished hell-like neighborhood that you were stepping on a few minutes ago.  \"If you wish to avoid my further wrath, then you will take me to whoever you tiny lifeforms call leader.  If you don't, then just one of my companions will be eager to flatten your whole puny city into dust, just for the fun of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVisibly frightened by your declaration, the people begin talking amongst themselves again, peering at you occasionally.  Finally an older, bald man comes forward.  He looks about fifty or so.  \"We will take you to our city's leader.  Please just stop the destruction.\"  You nod, realizing that you have no control over what Jake and Eric decide to do to these tiny people.  Best not to let them know that, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would prefer that you fly me to him as that is most expedient.  My walking wouldn't be pleasant for your citizens.\"  You prop your foot into the air to display the pulverized people still gunked up on all areas of your sneaker. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a monster!\"  someone screams.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A powerful monster,\" you retort.  The bald man looks at you contemptuosly before finally gesturing and telling everyone else to stay back.  He alone leads you down the road as the crowd watches you from behind.  </span></div></div>",

After all, that's the role you're trying to play, and you damn well better play it up. If they catch even a whiff that you're now just as weak as them... You couldn't even imagine what might happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much farther is it?\" You loudly protest. \"I'm getting bored of all this tiny walking! Maybe I will just walk to your capital at my normal giant size!\" Another contemptuous look from the old man is your only answer, but you match his glare with every bit of anger and annoyance in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething tickles at the back of your mind.

Besides, it's a bit late to call curtains, what with the practical parade leading to the airport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before you can even make it to the takeoff strip, the worst happens. A rhythmic pounding noise begins, progressively getting louder with each passing second. It's utterly alien to you, but a quick look around at the panicked and horrified expressions on everyone else's face is enough of an answer: it's one of your two buddies, now massively bigger than you.

He gets bigger and bigger by the step, and he appears to be looking directly at his feet -- no doubt relishing the inconceivable amount of destruction his footsteps cause and he calculatedly plants his massive feet upon whole city blocks..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd immediately starts running -- and you along with them.  One man in the crowd looks at you at you both sprint for your lives.  \"Please, make him stop!\" he shouts.  You say nothing.  You can barely hear him amid the thunderous footfalls of your giant-sized buddy.  The noise becomes almost impossibly loud and the ground shakes so hard with each step that the crowd is now tripping over themselves as they run, you included.  Too afraid to look back, you notice a slight disruption in the rhythm of the crushing footsteps.  You look back and before you can see what's going on, you hear an explosive-like crash in front of you and then ram headfirst into something rock hard.  You are flung back several yards, dazed and confused sitting on the ground.  You look up in front of you to find a white, foam wall which is the side-tread of Jake's titanic sneaker.  The normally soft rubber foam is tough and hard at this scale. You look from toe to heel, amazed at its sheer length.  The slim but lean giant's foot is the size of an aircraft carrier.  The muddy treads are filled with urban debris and the branded logo on the side of Jake's sneaker is marked with dark smoky spots where it looks like helicopters may have crashed into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hehehe, what's this?  A little squad of ants!\"  You stare up at the sky to see that you and this unfortunate crowd are situated directly underneath Jake's crotch, his two bare legs rising up like spires to where they meet his shorts and pelvis.  You can make out his smirking face, miles higher.  Your mind is consumed with two emotions: terrifying fear and raging envy.  You've been reduced from being a god to being a bug, a speck at the feet of a much more significant, powerful being than yourself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout saying anything further, the sky-sized teen lets out an evil snicker as he lifts a vast sole into the air and a cool shadow envelopes you.

As the dust clears you are left staring at a dirtied white foam wall, colossal in both height and length -- the rubber siding of Jake's all-destroying running shoe. The crumbling rubber monolith shifts and groans from the shifting of Jake's weight as he presses his foot into the earth.  To your unamusingly decreased size and the rest of the victims throughout the city, Jake's sneaker may as well be a weapon of mass destruction, used to terrorize and assert total dominance.  Thousands of men, women, and children have been mercilessly crushed underneath it, you realize.  Not unlike yourself, minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the edge of one section of monolithic running shoe, where you just stood is the edge of a puddle of red gunk seeping out from underneath the rubber sole.  People, you realize, practically liquefied underneath Jake's huge, uncaring foot.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA loud, deep voice thunders from the heavens, as you see Jake's lazily smiling face leering down at staring you and the survivors. <b> \"Sorry little guys, I think I squashed your friends.\" </b> Jake says mockingly. Then, the vast foot lifts off from the ground with the sound and force of a rocket ship, this time causing a sudden reverse shockwave in the direction of the vacuum created by Jake's escaping shoe.  It's remarkable how even such a small movement to him is so impactful to you at this size.  You find yourself wishing more than ever you were back to your own giant size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get up in panic, knowing that Jake is likely to chase down any escaping \"bugs\" that he missed.  But, before you can get anywhere, you hear <b>\"Hey..\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin less than a second Jake crouches down and you feel yourself pressed by two huge objects on both sides of your chest.  \"Noooo!!!!\" you scream.  Jake has singled you out from the crowd and has pinched you in a vice-like grip between his two grooved fingertips.  *WHOOOSH* you are then flung through the air upward, turning your stomach a little, as Jake then lifts you into the air like.a god who has just reached a celestial hand down to pluck some mortal from the earth.  You use both your arms to push down on the grooved fingertips futilely. <b> \"Holy shit.\"</b>  Jake's deafening voice leaves your ears ringing, as you are held in front of his enormous, smiling visage.  <b>\"There you are. When... or HOW, did you get so damn tiny?!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your mouth to speak but the pressure from Jake's gargantuan fingertips is pressing into you so tightly you can only make out a strained wheezing sound, even though you are attempting desperately to scream.  Jake squints, as though trying to see what the matter is, then gives a look of recognition as he realizes he's choking the life out of you.  <b>\"Oh... heh, oops.  Sorry, little buddy.\"</b>  Suddenly the pressure is released and you find yourself hurling through the air, now thinking Jake is letting you fall to your death.  But instead, you land hard on a warm, soft pink landscape:  Jake's fleshy palm.  Even the grooves here are deep enough for you to trip in, and the spongy \"ground\" feels like it's constantly moving.  So distant and vast is the surface that you may as well be standing upon a different planet, albeit an organic one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a minute to catch your breath, heaving as you stand upon a crouching Jake's palm that he's holding under his face, as though you're some sort of coveted valuable.  Jake has always been mild-mannered and understanding, but that was when you were the same size.  Given his disregard for the welfare of the beings of this world, toying with them as you had been, you're praying that he might not see you as disposable as he does the rest of the population here.  Immediately you begin to scream up at his interested face, after catching your breath.  \"JAKE, I DON'T KNOW HOW I GOT SO SMALL.\"  Your throat burns as your scream at the top of your lungs, but Jake just looks at you with two large blue eyes that tell you he doesn't hear.  <b>\"Damn man, I can't hear you from that size.  Look, uhm... I can try putting you in my ear?\"</b>  You nod up and down at him, grateful that he's willing to hear you out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin a minute you find yourself crossing over a perilous gap between a colossal teenager's hand and an ear big enough to fit entire an armada of battleships inside of.  As you step over the dangerous gap, suddenly you feel another WHOOSH and Jake quickly withdraws his hand.  Suddenly you feel a great impact from behind and you are propelled forward into the ear a dozen meters.   Now on your hands and knees, you look back to see a gigantic fingernail, which was what hit you, scraping against the interior of the humid ear canal.  You realized Jake was scratching his ear.  \"Hey be careful!\" you shout.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Ah, oops, are you okay?  You being in there tickles like hell, I wasn't thinking.\"</b>  Inside the tunnel-like passageway of his ear, Jake's voice is acoustically amplified.  It feels like it is coming from all sides, almost like a voice traveling through your head, causing your chest to vibrate.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine.  Damn man, you're loud.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Of course I seem loud to you.  Compared to you, I'm a giant.\"</b> You can tell by his somewhat smug tone, Jake's feeling pretty good about himself at the moment, loving every second of his status as an omnipotent giant, both to the people of this world and to you as well. <b>\"Speaking of which, why aren't YOU?  Do you realize how close I was to stepping on you?\"</b></span></div></div>",

And to be honest..\" you hesitate for a second, wondering if it's wise to inform Jake that you don't know how your shrank or that you haven't the power to grow big again like he is.  However, you recognize Jake is perceptive and smart; he'll see through it.  \"I don't know why I shrank.. and uh, I think I may need your help getting back to normal.  All I can think of is these assholes used some sort of weapon on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Hah!\"</b>  Jake's laugh causes your whole body to shudder, from its sonic power. <b>\"So, you're stuck like these little guys?\"  </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Until we learn more, I think so.  But dude, you're still huge.  You can <i>force</i> them to grow me back to the way I was.  Threaten to squash them all!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake replies in a rather relaxed, uninterested tone.<b>\" Threaten to?  I've <i>been</i> squashing them. In fact, I think I might have already crushed their town hall.  I also already have a lot of these little guys in my pocket. </b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?  Let me take see.\"  You cautiously walk toward the exterior of Jake's colossal earlobe, finding it difficult to maintain balance from the constant vertical swaying, caused by Jake as he walks around.  With every step he takes, the entire cavern lifts up and then down, almost making you feel like you're in some unstable elevator.  You can tell when he purposely stomps on something , because the cavern shifts down more suddenly.  You get to the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"See anything?\"</b> You ignore Jake for a second, marveling at how incredibly high up you are.  You get on all fours so that you can maintain a grip on the fleshy surface and peer out into the horizon.  It's remarkable; Jake's head is so high up in the air that you can actually see thin clouds at this level.  You very carefully inch forward and can make out the edge of Jake's tee-shirted shoulder hundreds of feet below. All around is the distant surface of this world.  The sprawling cityscape surrounding Jake is smoldering and smoking; his huge sneaker prints are scattered everywhere, clearly visible by the level of devastation and the utterly pancaked buildings within them.   As you scan the distant ground, you hear a growing *whirrrRRRR* and the hum of an engine, until a grey aircraft resembling some fighter jet quickly zips from one side of your view to the next, with a WHOOSH, and disappears in a second.  A second later, another aircraft appears in the distance and is coming toward you.  You then see little flashes coming from underneath it and realize it's firing its guns!  You quickly get up and run deeper within Jake's ear.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, you know you've got planes zipping by your head?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Yeah, they've actually been bugging me for a couple minutes.  They're like mosquitos; I just keep swatting them down\"</b> Jake says uncaringly.  <b>\"They started after I began stepping on what looked like their schools, heheh.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you hear a second thundering voice off in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake, what do you say we go back home?  We'll save some of the fun for tomorrow.  Let's use that crystal to get back.\"  You recognize Eric's voice.  Suddenly the entire cavern swirls around and you are thrown to the fleshy ground inside Jake's ear, due to the centrifugal force of Jake turning his head toward your other friend. Eric's proposal hangs in the air for a second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Yeah, alright.  We'll come back later.\"  </b> Jake's statement hangs in the air for a second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, you scream out at Jake: \"HEY, aren't you going to make these people help me grow big again first?!  Aren't you going to tell Eric about what happened to me?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"You think I feel like getting down on all fours with my ear to the ground in order to hear what these tiny little people have to say? Tomorrow I'll bring you back and set you down so you can negotiate with them.  And why would I tell Eric, when I could keep you as my own pet for a night!\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly begin to interject, but no sooner than you can utter out a word does the cavern rumble and the familiar, grooved fingertip of Jake advances into the cavern.  You instinctively duck for cover, but are immediately pushed flat against the surface as Jake bears his finger down upon you and attempts to drag you out of his ear.  \"STOPPPPPP\" you begin screaming.  An uncaring Jake simply continues, and you are then caught underneath his hard fingernail as he scrapes you along the waxy surface until the pressure releases and you are pressed from the other side by ANOTHER grooved digit: Jake's thumb.  Now pinched between his index finger and thumb, you are quickly zipped through the air once more, causing your stomach to turn.  You open your eyes and see two huge, smiling eyes in front of you, large enough to take up nearly your entire field of vision.  Suddenly a giant curtain of pink appears tp fall downward in front of you and back up, nearly causing you to have a heart attack.  Jake is so huge that even the simple act of blinking his eyes is terrifying.  He stares at you silently, with a very subtle smirk across his face, tinged with what you fear may be mischief or malice.  You can tell Jake is thinking, though you have no idea what about.  You decide to scream out :\"What are you doing Jake?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of saying anything, Jake simply smiles even more slyly.  Suddenly you begin to descend faster than you thought possible, while still in Jake's fingers.  Then, when you thought nothing else could go wrong, suddenly everything goes dark and the air turns hot and humid.  You look upward and see up into the sky Jake's still smirking face, seemingly thousands of feet above.  You can also see, much to your horror, Jake's hand holding back a huge band of fabric; the elastic waistband of his shorts.  You realize where you are: inside Jake's shorts, who is holding you down in his crotch!   Your eyes adjust to the darkness and you see right underneath you, a huge tangle of thick wiry pubic hair and in the middle of it Jake's penis.  At Jake's giant scale, the fleshy appendage is huge beyond belief compared to you.  Suddenly the pressure from Jake's fingers disappear and you find yourself falling down into the jungle of hair, gripping onto all the wiry strands for dear life, until you finally land on the titanic sized penis of your friend.   The smell of salt and sweat is thick, and you stand up to see Jake's distance face grinning sadistically.  The jerk is clearly ecstatic about the sight of his friend trapped on his dick; what could be more humiliating?  Before you can do anything, Jake releases his waistband, plunging you into further darkness.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You turn around and start running frantically in the direction of the frenzied crowd that you had been traveling with.  They've already gotten a big headstart on you, which you consider good; maybe you can escape your giant buddy's notice if he sees the miniature sized mob as he scans the ground.  Keeping a healthy distance away from them seems to be the wisest course of action as you scurry through this untouched portion of the city.  Whoever is approaching will surely delight more in toying with (or simply annihilating) a large crowd than he would a lone teenager, you suppose to yourself.  You know that would have held true for you mere minutes ago, when you too strode across the city in your comfortably gigantic size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rhythmic pounding noise continues at a steady pace, slowly getting louder.  You begin to feel the ground vibrate slightly with each thunderous footstep.  You don't dare look back at this point, imagining somehow that gazing up at whoever approaches will cause them to notice you.  Eventually the thunderous steps take on a crunching quality as well, as your titanic friend obliviously reduces buildings and houses into dust beneath his vast, rubber soles. The crowd nears the end of the street, screaming and yelling, and you consider jumping into one of the abandoned cars that are parked on the road.  It would do little to protect you from being squashed should one of his feet land on it, as you know from having purposely stepped on countless ones like it yourself, but it will help keep you out of sight at least.  You swing open the door and get a glimpse of the tall, bare legs that approach in the distance.  The shorts and torso come into view as you look up but the face of the giant is obscured by the sun shining directly down onto you.  You can't delay anymore, so you hop into the drivers seat of the vehicle before you can be seen.  The giant footsteps close in.  You look out the passenger side window vigilantly.  Across the street is a strip mall.  Suddenly the sunny, low roof of the building darkens.  A massive sneaker descends and the structure is no more.  You stare in awe as a cloud of debris settles at the base of the synthetic, rubber monstrosity.  Then, heel to toe, the rubber footwear ascends as the giant takes his next destructive step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough the windshield, you see that the crowd of people you had accompanied have frozen at the end of the street.  The rhythmic pounding stops as your friend spots them, hesitates, then lifts a giant foot and flattens them in the same fashion.  The giant tilts his foot on its side, no doubt to admire the gooey mess that he rendered the crowd into on the bottom of his shoe. As he briefly gloats over the sight, you notice the key is in the ignition of this car.  It doesn't take more than a second to realize now is the time to escape; your friend isn't going to show any more compassion for you than he would the rest of the puny populace.  The car starts, and you head off!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put on the gas and within an instant the engine roars loudly.  The muffler isn't working and your car sounds like it can be heard a mile off.  You panic and floor it, not wanting to stick around.  You head in the direction opposite of your giant buddy and the engine continues to scream.  If you can just make it far enough away...  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it's too late.  You feel the ground shake violently as the giant takes two steps.  Then, the sky darkens as a shadow looms over you; you lean forward to stare up out through your windshield to see a vast set of treads, littered with structural debris, cars, and gunked up bodies rapidly descending... until you and your vehicle are crushed flat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sinister grin, Jake slowly picked up his foot and slid it out of the way.  The humming originating from around his feet was quickly silenced.  Another puny bug squished!  The faint crunch sound that was heard when he stepped on the moving little red matchbox car was satisfying, for sure.    He snickered as he looked down on the half-inch length vehicle which he flattened into an irrecognizable paper-thin crumple.  Too bad for whoever was in there!   As he again began to trample through the cityscape in order to terrorize the populace further with Eric, he wondered where their third buddy had gone... </span></div></div>",

Immediately he lifted his foot and planted it indiscriminately in the city, causing a shockwave that threw several of the miniscule people to the floor and crushing another couple of dozen... as well as causing several thousand dollars' (or whatever their equivalent was) worth of property damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" you called out to him. Eric had always been a little predisposed to violence and you could see a scary look in his eye. He had gotten drunk with power <i>very</i> quickly, and you were a little scared of what he might do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he responded. \"This is awesome!\" he took another step, killing yet more tiny people senselessly. Jake, at least, stood where he was - quiet and reserved as always. There was a look on his face of sheer awe, though.<br>\r\n\"Stop!\" you called again, as the screaming from below increased in volume. You could see them begin to panic and run away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned to Eric. \"Look,\" you said quietly. \"You can kill them all and make them hate us, but that's not going to last. You'll get bored of it after an hour and all you'll have done is murder a bunch of people.\"<br>\r\nHe rolled his eyes. \"You're such a buzzkill.\"<br>\r\n\"Listen. Why don't we make this last? The three of us are gods here, and we've got the only way to get to this world.\" You indicated the crystal in your hand.<br>\r\n\"So? If we're gods, we should-\"<br>\r\n\"Be worshipped,\" Jake cut in, understanding your meaning.<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Eric, narrowing his eyes.<br>\r\n\"I <i>mean</i>, we should make these little people worship us. Fear us, but love us too. We can be proper gods. They can build us a throne. They can obey our every whim. And rather than senselessly murdering them all and wasting this opportunity,\" you said as you gestured pointedly at the craters made by Eric's careless stomps, \"we can make this last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric frowned. \"Alright. I guess that makes sense.\"<br>\r\n\"Exactly. I know you better than that. You're weird, but you're not a genocidal maniac.\"<br>\r\nHe punched me in the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said Jake. \"So how do we go about ruling the world?\"<br>\r\nI frowned thoughtfully, then looked around to see what looked like a news helicopter buzzing around nearby at about chest height. You smiled, then gently reached down. Carefully avoiding the spinning blades - which would still have been painful - you grabbed the bottom of the copter gently between thumb and forefinger, then brought it to your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, you could make out the pilot, who wore an appropriately terrified expression, and behind him a reporter and cameraman. You turned the chopper around so your face was on camera, then smiled broadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello,\" you said quietly, so as not to startle the occupants of the chopper. \"Cut the engine,\" you demanded. <br>\r\nThe pilot complied quickly, turning off the copter's engine and allowing the  blades to spin slowly to a stop. Your smile widened still and Eric gave a chuckle behind you as he peered over your shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reporter seemed to be shouting something, but you didn't hear them. You thought for a second, then delivered your manifesto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The three of us are divine beings,\" you said, making it up as you went. \"We have descended from a higher plane of existence to rule your world. We demand worship and loyalty, or the consequences will be severe. Far more severe than what Lord Eric just delivered to you...\"<br>\r\n\"Lord Eric?\" came his voice from behind you, and you kicked him gently.<br>\r\n\"In return for your undying loyalty,\" you continued, \"we will help this world. We will bring food from the land of the gods to you, the puny mortals...none will go hungry again. If necessary, we will be the deciding factor in any wars. We will judge your criminals and punish them with the harshness they deserve; your prisons will be kept empty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe news reporter's lips moved wordlessly and you smiled. You placed the chopper gently down on the roof of a nearby skyscraper and spoke again, this time more loudly, to the rest of the city. \"To all those running away, come back now. Do not run from us. We are your immortal gods. Treat us as such, or this world will be an ashen mess. I am Lord Matt. This is Lord Eric, and this is Lord Jake. Learn these names. They are the only ones that matter now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned your back to the city and towards your friends. \"How was that?\" you whispered.<br>\r\nThey both looked stunned.  \"That was...uh...weird,\" said Eric. <br>\r\n\"Good weird?\"<br>\r\n\"We'll see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, I'm gonna head back and grab some food. Make good on our promise. Just some bread, some chocolate, maybe some sandwich meat, that kinda thing.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait, what about us?\" said Jake.<br>\r\n\"Stay here and get acquainted,\" you said. \"Don't move too much, you'll crush more stuff. Just maybe sit down. I'll be 5 minutes, tops.\"<br>\r\n\"Alright...\"</span></div></div>",

You appeared back in your garden, and checked your watch. Noon. Alright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou headed into the kitchen of your house and grabbed a bag, filling it with bread, cookies, some bottles of water, meat, etc. Easily-eaten snacks. You grabbed some extra for your friends too. You also went upstairs and quickly got changed and cleaned up, wanting to be a little more presentable for your new tiny subjects. You checked yourself out in the mirror, and realised you had this gigantic dopey grin on your face - you were exciting, giddy at the prospect of literally ruling a world alongside your friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you were done, you headed back into the garden and took the crystal out, checking your watch once more. 12:05. 5 minutes. Like you promised. You headed back to the other world, repeating what you did. One flashing red light later and you were back. Jake and Eric were still there, sat in the wreckage created when they arrived, and you sat down to join them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as they noticed, they asked, \"where the hell have you been?\"<br>\r\n\"Wuh?\" you responded, confused.<br>\r\n\"You said you'd be gone five minutes! It's been two hours!\" Eric indicated his watch.<br>\r\n\"What? No it hasn't,\" you said, looking at the watch. But he was right. The watch said 2pm.<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" you said. \"You didn't change this, did you?\"<br>\r\nEric gave you an indignant look and you glanced at Jake, who shook his head.<br>\r\n\"Guys, I swear I was only 5 minutes. I packed up some food, changed, then came straight ba-wait. You know what this means, right?\"<br>\r\n\"That you can't keep time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, moron,\" you said. \"Time passes faster in this world...like Narnia, except without a Lion god and more...us-gods.\"<br>\r\n\"Whoa,\" Jake said. \"That's crazy.\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah. And yet, not the craziest thing to happen today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paused, working it out. \"OK, so...I was gone 5 minutes, which for you guys was two hours, or 120 minutes...so I guess that means time is 24 times faster here?\"<br>\r\nEric shrugged. \"I guess.\" Always a bit slow on the uptake.<br>\r\n\"So one hour at home is a whole day here?\" Jake asked.<br>\r\n\"So it seems...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou smirked. An idea had struck you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So here's what we do. We make our demands, then we leave. We go home, we eat, we chill out, we make some plans, then in like three or four hours we come back. That'll be three or four days for them, so they'll have had time to adjust to us and do what we asked.\"<br>\r\nEric paused, then said...\"yeah. I like it. Let's do that. Although I want to take some little people back with me.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, I was planning to as well,\" you reassured him, laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" Eric exclaimed, standing and getting into his godly role.<br>\r\n\"Little people! Here are our demands!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched, laughing, as Eric began to list demands. Stuff like construction on statues of the three of them. The removal of all religion that wasn't the church of Matt, Jake and Eric. The clearing of a pathway from where the stone teleported them to outside the city, so the new gods could move around without crushing or killing people. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And complete nuclear disarmament,\" you added. <br>\r\n\"Oh yeah. Nice call,\" Eric said. \"That too!\" he yelled out, finishing his list. Like ants, the people in the city surrounding them got to work. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys ready to go?\" you asked, watching as your two friends marvelled at the endeavor of the tiny people.<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" responded Jake. \"Are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost,\" you said, taking the food out of the bag and flinging it around the city almost at random, distributing it quite evenly. You left the two bottles of water next to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One last thing, little people,\" you called out, and you saw their ant-like scurrying stop for a moment. \"We will now return to our home for a few days. But we would like to take a few of you with us...any volunteers? We'll return you safe and sound. Probably.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a sudden surge of people running back towards the three of you and you grinned proudly as people begged to be taken with you, their new supreme ruler. A bunch of them burst out onto the roof of a nearby skyscraper and you squatted down, bringing your face in close to them, and said, \"sure.\" You reached out and swept a few of them into your hand - you reckoned you had about 9 or 10, which was all you really needed. You watched Eric stocking up on his worshippers, packing several dozen into his various pockets, and you both sighed and laughed. Jake was reserved, like you, taking just a few guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you were all done and the people were safely contained, you decided it was time. The three of you touched the stone, rubbed it, and with a blinding flash of red light you were back home again. You could feel the squirming of little people in your pocket, telling you they had survived the trip. You smiled. This was going to be fun.</span></div></div>",

That'll give them a week to start their age of devotion to us. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and Jake nodded and headed back to their houses nearby. In one pocket you held the crystal; in others, you held the 10 little people you'd taken with you. Once you got to your room, you closed and locked the door, then began to carefully extract them one-by-one and put them on your desk. You pulled up a chair and gazed down at them. It must have been a university building that you raided, because they were all students about your age. 7 guys, 3 girls, from what you could tell, but they were only about half an inch each.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned in even closer and simply stared at them. They  stared back for a moment before they each fell to their knees and in the silence of your room, you could hear their cute little voices for the first time. Just faintly, off in the background, but there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...\" they were saying. \"Be gentle. Please. Our lord Matt, be merciful.\"<br>\r\nYou smiled. They really were worshipping you as a deity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, were you feeling merciful?</span></div></div>",

How about you guys just come and watch some TV with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all nodded repeatedly, as if in a competition to see who could agree with you the most. You chuckled once more at their reverence, then gently swept the lot of them into your right hand with your left. You checked quickly to see if you'd gotten them all, then headed over to your bed. You had a TV you mostly used for gaming, but from time to time you watched shows on it. And now was as good a time as any.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn old episode of Friends was on. Perfect. You could half-watch this, half play with your little worshippers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tipped the contents of your right hand out onto your broad chest and stretched out, half-watching them situate themselves and half watching the TV show. You laughed, and noticed one of them - noticeably blond, probably about your age, wearing a black shirt and shorts - seemed to get the idea the quickest, indicating to the others where they were. He was the first to turn around and see your huge face, and you winked at them. They all dropped to their knees again and began worshipping, and your laughter nearly sent them clean off the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say worship me, little ones. I said watch the TV. There'll be time for worship later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all quickly turned, and again, that one blonde guy was the fastest of them all. As they all sat with their backs to you, watching TV, you watched him. He was talking to the other people. It was as if he was reassuring them - you could make out pats on the shoulder, hugs, etc. He was a natural born leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPartly because you were curious and partly because you only wanted them taking orders from one person - you - you suddenly reached and plucked the little man off your chest. There were some yelps of fear before you. said \"relax,\" and they reluctantly turned back to the TV. You lifted the tiny blonde student up to your face and looked into his eyes and you saw fear and respect, but also conviction - almost defiance. This was one brave dude. \"So what's <i>your</i> name?\" you asked. He replied, but you couldn't hear a damn thing, so you rolled your eyes and dropped him inside your ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Name?\" you asked again.<br>\r\n\"Chris, my lord.\" came a soft voice from right inside your ear. You smirked - this was the first time you'd had an actual conversation with one of your littles.<br>\r\n\"Hi there, Chris,\" you said, as if you were just talking to a friend. \"You seem like a bit of a leader down there.\"<br>\r\n\"Um...um...\"<br>\r\n\"No, it's good. I respect it.\" you rubbed your chin. \"You can be my high priest. I'll keep you here with me most of the time and send you back home now and then to pass on my wisdoms. OK?\"<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say, my lord,\" he responded, predictably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes. \"You can just call me 'Matt',\" you said. </span></div></div>",

Plus, you could bring the crystal with you to work, disappear into your little world on break and a half-hour break would become a six-hour one. You were able to have naps on the royal bed the little people had built for you on the outskirts of the city! They made things for you to sell on ebay, too; you were making a nice little bit of money on the side from that. Life was getting good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric and Jake were enjoying it too. You had allowed Eric to begin stomping through the world, taking several days with a veritable legion of tiny troops to foreign countries, letting him explore. The idea was for him to go and decisively end a few wars, but careless Eric being careless Eric, he was taking the long way around. Jake, meanwhile, was happy to just observe the tinies, to rule silently and allow their worship. He had become known as the quiet and considered one, while you - in their eyes - were the leader. You repeatedly insisted otherwise, though, and managed to divert some of your worshippers equally between the other two.  If nothing else, this was done to placate Eric and Jake; you didn't want them getting jealous and ruining everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll three of you still periodically took some of them back home with you, though you were taking fewer and fewer each time, since you'd already become good friends with Chris. You hadn't let him back yet and he hadn't asked - he seemed content to live in the room of a giant, someone about his age but several orders of magnitude bigger. You thought Chris had started to cotton on that you weren't really a god at all, just some kid not long out of high school and headed to college, only a few months younger than him, that happened to stumble upon a crystal of unspeakable power. But he still worshipped you, even though you told him about two weeks into his stay that he didn't need to do it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thing that amazed you was that for Chris, his university days should have been over. Your godly reign, while only three months long, was three years for the tinies. Chris was being left behind by friends he'd made. You told him that once while you were playing videogames, with him sat on your shoulder watching.<br>\r\n\"I suppose so, lord Matt. But I don't mind.\"<br>\r\n\"Why not?\"<br>\r\n\"I found a...higher purpose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed. \"Well, bein my second-in-command is definitely a higher purpose. But I'll take you home soon, you can spend a few weeks back with your family.\"<br>\r\n\"It's OK, my lord,\" he said, as if mortified by the suggestion. \"I want to serve.\"<br>\r\n\"And I want my servant to be happy,\" you said with a laugh pausing the game and leaning forward so Chris tumbled off your shoulder and into your waiting palm. He was used tot his sort of treatment and didn't even yell out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lifted him up to your face and grinned broadly, confidently. Chris sank to his knees, then nodded. \"Thank you, master.\"<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes at him for the millionth time. \"OK then,\" you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a knock on the door. \"Yo, Matt, you there?\" It was Jake. <br>\r\n\"Yep,\" you called, protectively cupping Chris' body with your other hand as you did so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake came in, saw you were talking to Chris, then smiled briefly before getting to his point.</span></div></div>",

We will rule fore-\"<br>\r\n\"Don't bother, Chris is cool,\" you said.<br>\r\n\"Cool? How do you mean?\"<br>\r\nYou raised your palm and examined the little guy. \"I think he figured out a while back that we're not really gods.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh. But aren't you going to send him back at some point? What if he tells everyone?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, he also knows that while we're not really gods we can still...crush everything we see and piss on the remains, for instance.\" As you said this, you narrowed your eyes menacingly and Chris responded with frantic nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Jake's turn to laugh. \"Sounds like you've got him on a tight leash.\"<br>\r\n\"Nah, we're friends now. Aren't we, little buddy?\" you said, and he nodded frantically again. \"I mean, he's terrified of me, as he should be, but I like the little guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake came in and sat on your bed. \"I think you had the right idea by just keeping one. Too many of them is hard to keep track of. I sent mine back after, like, two days.\"<br>\r\nYou nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I reckon I feel more powerful with just one than with that entire world,\" you said, voicing a feeling you'd had for a while. \"I can manage Chris,\" you said, tipping him from one hand to the other effortlessly, and continuing to do so. \"He's easily managed. And knows he should do as I say, even if I don't ask anything bad of him.\"<br>\r\n\"But when we're in the city...\"<br>\r\n\"I feel like we can't help but destroy stuff. Which is kind of fucking GREAT, but it also sucks...you know?\"<br>\r\nJake nodded. You stopped tipping your hands and raised Chris up to your face again, watching the disoriented little guy right himself in your palm. \"What do you think, little man. You think it's better to rule the world or just one person?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised him to your ear and his soft, lilting voice could be heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, uh, I guess ruling the world is a lot of responsibility...it's hard to keep everyone happy. But all you have to do to keep one person happy is to...um...keep them safe in your crazy giant world.\"<br>\r\nYou laughed and passed Chris to Jake. \"Say that again to Jake,\" you said, dropping him into Jake's now-waiting palm and allowing Chris to repeat what he'd just said to you. <br>\r\nJake laughed as well. \"Crazy giant world, huh,\" he said, pinching Chris between thumb and forefinger and examining him with one eye. \"Well I guess it is to you, little guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a weird pang of jealousy. You didn't like how Jake was talking to \"your\" little guy. You held out your hands. \"Pass him back,\" you said.<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, sure,\" Jake said. But he didn't pass Chris back, he threw him. You were alive to it, though, and extended your arms out, catching the little dude in the palm of your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gave Jake an annoyed look and raised Chris up, but he was happy. He called out, \"that was fun!\"<br>\r\n\"Alright then, little man...\" you said, surprised at this reaction. \"Think fast!\" you said to Jake, and you threw him back. Jake caught him, amd so the game went on and on, throwing Chris back and forth, back and forth. Now and then you stopped to check on him, but apart from dizziness he looked fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed at his exhilirated little yells as he was thrown across the room, you moving further back occasionally to make the throws longer. It was a fun diversion for 5 minutes or so, until Jake caught him and, with a grin, said...\"man, all that throwing made me hungry.\" And then before you could do anything, he'd popped Chris into his mouth!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou yelled out, terrified of losing your little guy, and made to dart forward. But before you could do anything, Jake had swilled Chris around in his mouth and spat him out onto his hand. You saw Chris get up, shaken but otherwise unharmed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, that wasn't cool,\" you said.<br>\r\n\"Oh, relax. Look, he's OK.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Chris' fear had returned, and now he was kneeling and worshipping Jake. You shook your head and quickly plucked him out of Jake's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, little man. You're safe now,\" you said chasing him around your palm with your index finger. <br>\r\n\"I d-didn't mind,\" Chris shouted. \"Do it again if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged. \"Well, alright...\" you said, and popped him into your mouth. You swirled him around, using your tongue to manipulate his place in the mouth. He tasted odd, weirdly salty. But you couldn't taste much because he was so damn small. You felt a familiar rush of power as you realised ending Chris would be as easy as swallowing. But you didn't want to, so you spat him out into your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then...</span></div></div>",

You grabbed a washcloth for him to dry off with and watched him for a while, enjoying the fact that he was waiting for you to make the next move. That hadn't gotten old. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou leaned in, your face filling his vision, and he took a couple of instinctive steps back. \"You're my favourite tiny,\" you said affectionately, reaching out and patting him gently. This was enough to knock him over, but Chris appreciated the sentiment nonetheless. He gazed into your face and shouted \"thank you, sir!\" at the top of his lungs.

You check on Chris to see if he was fine and then saw it.  Next to him, looking shocked and confused as all hell, was a second tiny person.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the -- ?  Where did you come from?\"  Your words cause the little figure to cower in fear, not being at all used to hearing your giant, thunderous voice.  A series of tiny squeaks emerge from the figure, who is frantically signaling, seemingly desperate to gain your attention and understanding.  You narrow your eyes and realize the incredible:  It's your buddy, Jake..!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake!  What's going on..?  How did <i>you</i> get to be so puny?  Your glance at your other tiny friend, Chris, who for all intents and purposes has become a personal slave.  You lean forward, trying to make out the infinitesimal squeaks that Jake is making.  It's pretty funny to watch him try so hard to communicate to you.  You can tell he is panicked and extremely desperate for your giant self to hear him out.  You can't hear him at all, but that's no skin off your nose.  Actually, the fact that you can't hear him and that he can't do anything about it is even funnier.  If you wanted, you could lean closer or lift him to your ear as you had been doing with Chris -- but you kind of enjoy the fact that he is pleading and begging for you to try and listen to whatever he has to say.  Actually hearing him out would kill the fun!  You assume the crystal must have malfunctioned when Jake entered it, resulting in his own size to change.  You assume Jake wants the crystal back so that he can reverse whatever it had done to him.  For now though, the crystal and the universe within remained securely within the pocket of your shorts and you had no intention of letting your now puny friend use it without having some fun first!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dude, sorry.  I can't hear a thing you're saying.  You're too little!  But I'm guessing you want the crystal in my pocket so you can turn big again..?\"  You reach into your pocket and pull the crystal out; within the ruby colored stone you can see the tiny little world, all of its people, their civilization, their structure, their culture and complexities, nestled in the palm of your cosmically huge hand.  You give Jake a devilish grin.  \"Must be quite a difference -- from when you were so big compared to these tiny guys,\" you remark while pointing down to Chris.  \"Now you're the size of a ant -- just like these guys!\"  Your grin spreads even further: \"You know what I've decided, though?  This is going to be a monotheistic society; there can only be one god - me!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou reach down and pick up Jake, laughing cruelly and he struggles to free himself from your thumb and forefinger.  \"Hmm, what to do, what to do..\"  Near you on the floor are your smelly running shoes, laying on their sides; you run competitively so they're pretty potent.  \"Hey, I have an idea.  You can spend the night in silent meditation and prayer, in honor to your god.  They say isolation, hardship, and toil are crucial to a spiritual awakening.  I know a great place where you can find that..!\"  You pick up one of your sneakers, heavily grass stained on the outside and quite humid and damp on the inside -- all the better.  Jake is clearly in a state of panic as he realizes what you have planned.  \"Don't worry; it can't be <i>that</i> bad in there, right?  You lower Jake down into the damp, dark cavernous interior and your eyes light up as he visibly cringes from inhaling the miasma your feet have created within the environment.  \"You might wonder why I'm doing this now but don't worry Jake; eventually you'll see the <i>big picture</i>.  With a last cruel smile, you stuff one of your dirty socks into the shoe so that nothing can escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You looked downward at the tiny college-aged kids on the desk and give them a stern smile.  It was a smile that bordered on contemptuous and playfulness.  You then speak: \"Mercy will be shown when I decide it is appropriate. Getting on your knees was a good start,\" you say with an ominous tone.  Then, you frowned.  \"But you forgot to bow down completely in submission.  I could squash any of you any time I want; I demand complete prostration from ants like you -- not just kneeling!   It seems that I need to make sure none of you ever make that mistake again.\"  You know your demands are unreasonable, unpredictable, and unfair to these little guys -- but that makes it all the more fun for you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finished that last sentence, all ten of the little people break once again to their knees and to your satisfaction, put forth their arms and lay face down, as you instructed.  Anticipating this, you noted the one tiny person who would finish last -- that person would be your example.  It ends up being what looks like some nerdy kid.  He'd do perfectly.  As his nine peers continue worshipping -- <i>appropriately now</i>, you reach down upon him and pinch his little form between your thumb and forefinger.  Then, you bring him up to your face in order to ensure that his entire field of vision consists only of your singular, huge visage.  \"Too slow,\" you state with a devilish sneer.  You hold him before your face long enough for him to witness your evil grin, then without any warning whatsoever, place him back down on the desk alongside his peers, keeping your hand above him.  Before he even has the chance to get back up, you drive your thumb downward.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel and hear a squelch and crunch beneath the huge digit.  Then, knowing his peers are watching, you make an elaborate display of slowly lifting up your thumb, revealing the red, gooey, remains of the tiny kid: half is on your desk, and half is on your thumb which you proudly show your little worshippers. That should drive the point home, you imagine.  Worship you or be squashed like nothing. Amusingly, the little people quicken their bowing and prostrating gestures as they see what you were willing to do.  <i> Cool,</i> you think to yourself.  A smug smile of contentment spreads across your face as you lean back in your chair, your arms crossed behind your head, and then in a display that is purposely as slovenly and leisurely appearing as possible, lift up both of your socked feet from the floor.  Then, knowing full well how overwhelmingly and offensively they must stink from the perspective of your tiny slaves, due to all your competitive running, you grin evilly as you prop the titanic feet on the desk, criss-crossed at the ankles, inches in front of your little slaves to make sure they endure the smell.  Purposely acting oblivious to how unpleasant it must be, you don't even bother trying to suppress the wicked smile on your face, knowing how obnoxiously and annoying prideful it must appear to your subjects.  \"Ahh.

And in those 8 days, incredible progress had been made. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the buildings around where you had originally entered had been cleared away, leaving bare ground for your teleportation spot. The bareness continued for a few metres, in a dead straight line that led out of the city. The foundations of huge statues in your honour had already begun construction not far away. You smiled and turned to Eric, who was in awe. \"You see? How much better is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took the 10 littles you'd taken with you out and put them on the ground - except for one, who you'd grown attached to and wanted to keep around. You put him in your ear and said, \"bet you're glad I cleaned that out, huh?\"<br>\r\n\"Ye-yes, my lord,\" shouted the tiny into your ear. <br>\r\n\"You can stay with me,\" you decided on the spot. \"You can be my...uh...high priest.

The surface of the crystal feels cool to the touch. As you feel its surface, your vision reddens and you lose all senses of orientation and balance. You shut your eyes tightly, as you feel a terrifying falling sensation. In spite of this sensation, you still feel the ground beneath you. What just happened?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer soon lumbers toward you. Your vision is still not clear yet, as the ground is beating rythmically. The impact becomes louder and more violent as whatever is causing it nears. Your vision finally begins returning to normal in the midst of this. You squint your eyes, trying to make out the outlines of things. In front of you is a large red wall, about twize your size. It's smooth and shiny. Wait a minute... this isn't a wall. It's a crystal! And all around you are blades of grass, taller than you! Suddenly it hits you: you've shrunk! And that means that the thundering and shaking of the ground can only be one thing. Your stomach turns. The beats are ringing more cleary now, huge crunching sounds. The impact makes you lose your balance and finally you fall to the ground on the last impact. Everything is silent for a moment. When you get to your knees, you look forward... and then up. Extending upward and over the grass blades are the two long bare-skinned pillars of flesh belonging to one of your giant friends. Your crane your neck back so far that it almost hurts, and see the two legs connecting to a pair of khaki shorts, then to a navy blue polo shirt... and then, almost completely out of view.. the chin and edge of Jake's face. You stumble backward at the sight of your colossal friend. He speaks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't see him, man!\" Jake turns his head side to side. The sound of his voice sounds like thunder to you and makes you want to cover your ears. \"I saw him there dude!\" you hear from another location. No doubt Eric is scouring the yard for you as well. \"What about that crystal?\" you hear Eric continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly one of Jake's gigantic legs is raised into the air as he proceeds to step forward. Adrenaline rushes through you, and your senses heighten and the world slows. His heavy sneaker is raised into the air and is in front of him... and he's about to bring it down right over where you are standing! You see the bottom of his foot close in. Embedded in and between the treads of Jake's sneaker are blades of grass, a piece of gum, and what looks like a dozen mangled bodies of ants that Jake mindlessly stepped on while traversing the yard. The vast surface looms above you and casts a cool shadow and you cringe as the massive thing swiftly lowers down.. until the bottom of his foot is all you can see.  You close your eyes... but you feel nothing except for a strong wind from above. You peek open an eye and look up. Only meters above your head are the treads of Jake's sneaker. It is so close to squashing you that you can actually smell the rubber sole. \"Oh yeah... the crystal\" you hear Jake exclaim. His foot slides to the side and the shadow passes from over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up again, relived. Suddenly Jake lowers his head to look at the crystal... and squints his eyes at the sight of something else: you. You look right into his eyes... and see that he immediately recognizes you. This exchange of eye contact frightens you and you stumble back again.. causing Jake to smirk. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You watch as Jake leans foward, his already huge torso expanding as he moves closer.  He plucks his arm down slowly, and stretches out his fingers to grasp you.  You try to make a break for it the instant you see this happening, quite aware that Jake's intentions are in the best interest of Jake only.  You turn around and run in the opposite direction, between the long grass blades that overshadow you.  Hopefully you can elude his grip inside the grassy entanglement and perhaps even lose him underneath it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dash out of the clearing with the crystal and navigate through the tree-like blades of grass that are twice your height.  You don't hear anything, which bodes well.  You look up into the sky but your vision is obstructed by these grassblades.  You feel as though you have been running for at least twenty seconds now.  Your hopes seem to have been fulfilled.  You've escaped!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as you run, you hear a strange whooshing sound.  You look above you for an instant and see something huge moving in between the gaps in the grassy canopy above.  Then, a loud *thud* sound takes place in front of you.  You turn your head forward again and before you can react, you see a huge white blur.  Suddenly you find yourself sitting down on the muddy floor, dazed and confused, your head a little sore.  You open your eyes and see that Jake has put his foot down in front of you, in order to make you crash into the side of his massive sneaker.  As you stare at the wall of white, blown rubber in front of you, you hear a taunting laughter, as you realize that you really didn't -- and don't -- have any chance of escaping from a being so immensely larger than you.  A hundred yards for you is merely one stride for Jake.  You begin to get to your feet when you feel the wind knocked out of you.  Your body is hoisted into the air and your neck is jerked back, as you realize that Jake is pinching you between his finger and thumb.  Your torso feels as though it is inside of a vice.  The pressure from Jake's grip is crushing your insides!  The whole world spins around as your friend jerks you up violently and levels you with his huge grinning visage.   Desperately afraid of dying, you hear Eric's voice in the distance... but right as it begins, Jake's expression turns from one of cruel jeering into one of concern.  You feel like you're on a roller coaster, as he quickly lowers you down and plunges you in the darkness of his pocket.  The combined pain from both your chest and your head causes you to lose consciousness.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n* * *<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up, you find yourself in a wholly new place.  All around is a thick white fabric wall.  On one end is a long, darkened tunnel.  Above you is an oval-shaped opening.  The ground beneath you is soft and moist.  Your senses return... and one breath of air through your nose tells you where you have been dropped.  You're inside one of Jake's sneakers.  Your giant-sized \"friend\" no doubt placed you here as some sort of sick joke.  Another look through the oval opening reveals that Jake is not watching you at current.  You try to get up... but find yourself unable to move your left leg.  What the...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look in front of you.  Your leg appears to be fine.  You try taking your arm and manually lifting your leg and moving it.... and feel indescribable pain when doing so.  Your leg is broken! You remember when you broke your arm a couple years ago, it at first wasn't painful until a day after the breaking, when the swelling took place.  This injury couldn't have happened long ago.  Images of Jake toying with your unconcious body and sadistically snapping your leg with his fingers flash through your mind, as do images of him carelessly dropping you from a great distance above for fun.  You find yourself disgusted to have ever called him a friend.  Realizing once more that Jake has left you here for future torments, you make up your mind to escape somehow.  You pull yourself across the humid cavern by pulling the fabric floor with your arms.  You reach the inside wall and grab hold.  You find it painfully tiring to climb.  The wall fabric is elastic and easily pulled, but relying entirely on all of your upper body strength to pull yourself up is draining physically.  You are grateful to yourself that you have taken so much care to become strong in the recent years.   It comes as a relief, when you finally finish your ascent and rest on top of the rim of the sweat-saturated sneaker, free of Jake's foot odor.   The fresh air is welcome... but the sight before you isn't.  Leaning over the top of the opening still, you find before you one of the vast feet that was resting inside this huge piece of athletic footwear mere hours ago.  Jake's socked foot is resting prone on the bed, the toes raised to the air.  You see his bare legged calves, his shorts, and finally his rhythmically rising and lowering torso at the distant edge of this stadium-sized bed of his.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide you have no choice but to quietly climb down, and literally avoid waking \"the sleeping giant.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Suddenly Jake lifts his foot back into the air, and it looks like he's serious this time.  You quickly dash away, not even sure which direction you're headed, in order to avoid getting smashed by your so-called friend.  You feel a great shadow overtake you once more, knowing that his sole is coming down right over you.  You tightly shut your eyes and and slide forward on the ground to prepare for your iminent doom... but it doesn't come.  You open your eyes and see that everything is lit up again by the sun.  You look up and see nothing but the sky.  Where the heck did Jake go?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou quickly turn around and right behind you is Jake, bug sized like you!  He has one foot in the air ready to stomp on something, as though he thought he were some sort of giant!   Immediately you cackle at him and he looks at you furiously, withdrawing his leg and setting it back down in a more graceful way than he wanted to a few seconds ago.  \"Let me guess.. your foot hit the crystal?\" you tease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for noticing.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry you didn't get to stomp on me, jerk.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take a joke,\" he replies, dismissively, though you aren't sure if he were really joking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this is what being a bug is like,\" he says, gazing around at the jungle like surroundings in awe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...  speaking of that, I think we should go back to that crystal and try to get big again.  This could be dangerous.\"  As if to drive the point home, the sky darkens right as you finish.  Looming above you is probably one of THE most terrifying sights you have ever seen: a giant-sized Eric, looking down at the ground menacingly.  \"This isn't good,\" you state.   The next thing you know, Eric is leaning forward with his eyes fixed on you, his arm outstretched and his open hand approaching you.  You know by now that running won't help, so you dive into the muddy ground below you face down. The tip of Eric's finger presses down on you, like some kind of huge piston. You feel your ribs almost crack as he carelessly fumbles his giant fingers around you in order to pick you up.  But you lay as flat as you can, not letting him secure a grip.   Before you know it, the ground beneath you rumbles and then breaks apart from beneath and suddenly falls away, as you rise into the air.  Eric, getting tired of trying to pick you up, has just decided to simply drive his fingers into the ground beneath you and scoop up a chunk of your yard -- with you in it!  You get naseuous as your stomach turns from this rapid ascent into the air above.  The ride stops, with most of the earth fallen away, and you tumble violently onto a soft, fleshy surface.  On all sides are Eric's long fingers rising into the air, like stadium lights. Behind one side of this row of fingers is a giant blue wall: Eric's torso.  You quickly grab hold of this giant's skin and kneel down, as you feel the unstable surface of his hand quiver.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly some screaming sounds in the distance above you... and you see the fingers of Eric's other hand descending!  In between two of them are a kicking and screaming Jake, being brought down to your location. Suddenly the giant fingers loosen and Jake falls down a good ten yards and cries out in pain, while the hand flies away swiftly.  Then, you are knocked clean off your knees and back to the ground, as the entire surface is elevated at a hundred miles an hour, like some kind of gigantic, open-aired elevator.  It then halts, and rather than than being welcomed by the opening of some doors, you are welcomed by the huge grinning face of a blonde-haired male.  You are about at his chin level, so you strain your neck up to look at his movie-screen sized eyes looking down at you diabolically.  \"Eric... wait.  Let's just talk.\" you plead, knowing to what ends his sinister eyes could take you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heheh, we'll have lots to talk about\" he booms, the air from his mouth almost blowing you over again.  As he exhales, a sound that is somewhere between a sigh of relaxation and a hiss is let out.   This is definitely bad.  You begin to object, but you are cut off by the sudden clench of his fist all around you, as you are unceremoniously squeezed against Jake's body, the two of you suddenly plunged into the darkness of Eric's vicelike grip.     You can feel a vague jerk take place, as Eric's whole hand brings you down lower.  Suddenly his fingers loosen and you fall into some sort of blackened hole along with Jake.  It stinks badly, like dust and dirt.  You look up and see Eric's fingers pull away and then and all that remains above the opening is the edge of Eric's shirt hanging down against the sky above.  Obviously, you have just been dropped inside the pocket of Eric's shorts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to tumble around violently, as Eric swaggers across your lawn.  Each movement of his leg pushes you this way and that, and sometimes against Jake, as well as a large, metallic object that is at least twenty times your mass: Eric's cell phone.  You may have found a salvation inside this dusty and dirty compartment of Eric's clothing!   There may be just enough room to pry it open, with the help of Jake.  You quickly grab hold of the side of it amidst the tumbling and yell for Jake to grab as well.  He does the same and the two of you then hang on to the side of the metal structure and begin a joint effort to pull it open.  You pull with all your might as you scream for Jake to do the same, shutting your eyes tightly in concentration.  Finally your strength gives and you loosen up, opening your eyes.. only to be introduced to an even more humiliating scenario.  All around you are the blurry, nondescript surroundings of a huge room.  On either side of you are Eric's two fingers suspending the cell phone into the air, with Eric's leering visage looking above you in amusement.  He has apparently lifted his phone out of his pocket -- with you on it!  You again hug the cell phone for your life, afraid of falling down.  Laughing, Eric shakes it and you are thrown off with Jake, but you land again in Eric's other palm -- which finally lowers you on to what you recognize as YOUR bedroom's desk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlad to be out of the clutches of Eric's physical person, you happily step off onto the wooden surface with Jake.  Quickly Eric pockets his phone and hops into your formerly owned chair and leans over you. This is his first chance to really inspect you, you realize.  He licks his lips in excitement at, you can only assume, the prospects of doing anything he likes to his tiny-sized captives.  As he continues his stare, he reaches into his other pocket and plumbs out a familiar red crystal, which he must have picked up after pocketing you.  He shifts his attention to it for a second, then back to you, and leans over and drops the red crystal quite far toward the back end of your desk.  If only you could reach it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour train of thought is broken by Eric's voice.  \"What's it like being a couple of puny bugs?\" he asks.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you try being one and find out for yourself!  Just press hard on that crystal there!\" Jakes screams up at him.  Yeah, like he's going to want to do that, you think.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like the view from up here,\" Eric replies gloatingly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, do what you want now.   Just promise you will let us go, okay?\" You state these words more than ask them, knowing that pleading would only make it more fun for Eric.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll let you go, dude.  I just don't know in how many pieces yet!\" he shouts laughing, quite amused by himself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHoping for the best, you assume that Eric only means that as a joke.  Nevertheless, you decide that you need to figure out a way to reach that red crystal.  Once you do that, you can stand up to Eric -- and maybe find a way to shrink him with that crystal.  Now you just need to survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should we do first, though?\" Eric asks facetiously.  You realize that he has already made up his mind.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sure enough, a big smile breaks out across Eric\u2019s face. \u201cI know exactly what to do with two little insects. Put \u2019em them together and make \u2019em fight!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB-But we\u2019re your friends,\u201d you protest, trying\u2014and failing\u2014to keep the tremor out of your voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot at that size you\u2019re not, any more than I\u2019d consider an ant, or a bug, or an earthworm my friend. And you know how I feel about puny runts who are too feeble even to wipe their own asses.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt\u2019s true: Eric has always had this obsession with getting his own way and demonstrating his superiority, both in sport and in everyday life. In fact, the thrill of imposing your will over younger, smaller or weaker kids was one of the things that brought the three of you together in the first place, which makes it especially mortifying for you and Jake to find yourselves suddenly so utterly tiny and helpless compared even to the smallest newborn baby, let alone your former friend. But while you are pondering this dramatic reversal of fortune Eric is continuing with his speech.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut you know I\u2019m nothing if not fair\u2014\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jake exchange a glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2014so I\u2019m willing to keep one of you, for a while at least. Just for old time\u2019s sake. Which one it is depends entirely on you. You need to prove that you are worthy to be the pet of a mighty god like me, and I think the best way to settle that is for the two of you to fight for the honour. To the death, of course!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jake chuckle nervously, not really believing he meant what he just said, but Eric merely settles himself back in <u>your</u> chair to watch, smiling coldly like a roman emperor presiding over the gladiatorial arena. And like an emperor, he has the power of life or death over both of you, entirely at his whim. He claps his hands thunderously together directly above your heads and issues his imperious command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBegin.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jake circle tentatively around each other, making a few desultory feints and lunges, but trying to avoid actually engaging in any serious body contact. Eric tolerates this for a moment but quickly becomes impatient at your none-too-subtle procrastination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerhaps I should mention that if I feel that neither of you is taking this seriously and making a proper effort, then I may just dispose of both of you,\u201d he drawls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then reaches across and picks up a large textbook from the other side of the desk and holds it with both hands directly above the two of you. Completely overshadowed, you and Jake stop and look up at it in horror. It\u2019s the size of a building and easily heavy enough to squash you both instantly if he decides to drop it. Sure enough, he gives you a wicked grin and suddenly lets it fall\u2026 only to quickly catch it again before it has fallen more than an inch or so\u2014by his scale at least. Eric smirks with satisfaction at the way the two of you have involuntarily cringed and thrown up your arms in futile protective gestures\u2014and then carelessly tosses the unimaginably heavy object aside to land with a earth-shattering <i>thump</i> somewhere down on the floor. The terrifying point is well taken: you\u2019re entirely at Eric\u2019s mercy, so you\u2019ll have to at least pretend to do what he wants and hope for the best, or try to find some way of turning matters to your advantage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jake shakily get to your feet, look each other in the eye, and then slam into each other like a couple of micro-sized\u2014and seriously underfed\u2014sumo wrestlers. You yank at each other\u2019s limbs and clothes and roll over on the ground, doing your best to put on a convincing show for the blood-thirsty spectator gloating high above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric folds his arms and leans back in satisfaction. \u201cThat\u2019s better!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thank your lucky stars that it was Jake rather than Eric who was shrunk: Eric is on the wrestling team while Jake is just a runner. Unfortunately, Jake\u2019s somewhat more wiry body also makes him better able to wriggle like an eel in your grasp. All things considered, you are probably quite evenly matched. But for now, at least, the two of you appear to have an unspoken agreement to make this look as dramatic as possible without actually doing each other any harm. While you wrestle you do your best to have a conversation, masked by loud gasps and grunts on the very slight off-chance that Eric might hear you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>huff huff</i> \u201cYou don\u2019t think he really means what he said?\u201d <i>unhhh</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>oof</i> \u201cAre you willing to take a chance on it? <u>You</u> certainly seemed ready to step on me before you were dumb enough to get yourself shrunk too.\u201d <i>ahhhh</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, I\u2019m the bad guy. <u>You</u> were the one who started all this with your stupid crystal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s really what matters right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel Jake make an attempt at a shrug, somewhere within the mutual death-grip you\u2019ve adopted to fool your captor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, so how are we going to get out of this\u2014or are you planning on making this real?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngry as you are with Jake for trying to stomp you earlier, you can\u2019t quite imagine yourself ending his life\u2014and you\u2019re pretty sure it\u2019s no longer so easy for Jake to rationalise either, now that you\u2019re back to being human-size to him rather than a tiny bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess not. But maybe we can make it look as though it is real?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat! You\u2019re saying we should try to fake it? Are you nuts? He\u2019ll see through that in an instant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe not. Eric never was the smartest, and it must be pretty difficult for him to see us clearly at this size, so we might be able to get away with it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake risks a quick glance up at the face of the colossus, who is all but drooling at the sight of the pair of you tussling. \u201cYeah, you keep telling yourself that,\u201d he shudders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grimace as you flip Jake over onto his back. \u201cWell, do you have any better ideas, dumbass?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment he seems about to say something, then he yanks you back over so that he is now on top. As your head slams painfully onto the wooden surface you snatch a glance at your surroundings. On one side, not too far away, is the edge of the desk and a vertical drop of who knows how many feet. On the other side, at the far end of the table, you see the crystal, lying there oblivious to all the trouble it has caused. If only it was possible to reach it\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Suddenly Eric reaches his arm over to snatch whatever object they possess from Jake's grasp.  The two of them grapple arms for a moment and the disappear from your sight.  What the heck!  You pace toward the location you had just seen them, looking from side to side but seeing nothing except the boundaries of your backyard.  Then you look at the ground at the object they had just wrestled over.  You see the shiny red object nestled in the grass below.  You stand over it, looking at it suspiciously -- wondering if what happened to your friends could happen to you if you touch it.  You decide to be bold and risk it.  But first, you notice that are a couple tiny little ants crawling in the dirt near the crystal.  As you habitually do when you see an insect crawling at your feet, you raise your foot into the air and get ready to stomp the two little things flat.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to lower your foot down on them when see one of them making a strange waving movement with its antennae.  It looks vaguely as though it is aware of its imminent demise, signaling for mercy or something.  After holding your foot over it for a few seconds, to begin to slowly lower it down again... until the other starts waving as well!   This is *too* weird, you ponder.  You raise your eyebrow in curiosity, and lower your foot elsewhere on the grass.  Then, you kneel down and squint your eyes at the two little insects.. and discover that they are not insects at all.  Although almost too amazing to even believe, you notice the figures resemble little human beings on close inspection... not ants.  No more than a quarter inch in height, the two figures' appearance suddenly makes sense to you.  This is Eric and Jake..!  The two of them have shrunk to the size of bugs, and you were just about to flatten them into oblivion!  A playful smirk of amusement spreads across your face as you take this in.  There the two of them are, Jake and Eric, your two tiny-sized friends desperately hopping up and down in between your two sneakered feet, pleading for your attention and your protection.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh yes, you know how to \"protect them\" alright.  First, you scoop the two little guys up with your fingers and then carefully dangle them over the soft center of your palm and let them drop.  You raise your palm to eye level, studying the two little figures as they get to their feet and stand on the fleshy surface.  Without any further discourse, you close your palm around them and pause for a moment to look at your hand.  Then, you lower your hand into your shorts pocket and open it inside, letting your two little friends fall inside.  Unsure of what to do with the crystal, you give it a little nudge with your toe.  Convinced that merely grabbing it will not activate it, you pick it up and drop it inside your other pocket.  You then decide to go to your room and figure things out there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You take them out one at a time to avoid harming them, first Jake, then Eric. They tumble from your fingers onto the hard wooden desk and immediately begin shouting up at you. You can't make out what they're saying at their size and you don't particularly care either. As far as you are concerned, these two have always held you back in life and now it's your turn to get back at them for it. You give Eric a light flick, sending him hurtling back on the desk. Jake immediately changes his tone and tries to run away from you but you aren't content to let him go just yet. You slowly lower your hand and pinch him between two fingers. As you lift him up to your face, he begins kicking and twisting, desperate to avoid your gaze. You smile cruelly at him. \"Well, well, well look what we have here. Some ants seemed to have crawled into my room\", you say, with a look of superiority. You give Eric another tap, making sure he doesn't escape from your desk. You then turn your attention back to Jake, dangling in front of your face. Seeing such a small being and knowing the power you hold over him sends delightful sensations through your body and you feel yourself getting hard. You think how easy it would be to kill him, a simple press of your fingers to turn him to paste. He may have once been your friend but now he's nothing more than a bug, a being below you. \"But you know what happens to bugs right guys?\", you continue. Slowly you begin to adjust your fingers around Jake, applying slightly more pressure. He shouts out, but you continue to squeeze. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny mercy you may have had is slowly evaporating as you think back to all the times these guys annoyed you or embarrassed you. Jake again tries to shout but you increase the pressure. \"They get crushed\", you coldly state. You  squeeze your fingers and in an instant, crush your friend into a bloody pulp. A few drops fall onto your desk, near the terrified Eric. Your penis is now fully erect as you relish the new found power you have. Eric is frozen in place and you quickly grab him, holding him as you once did Jake. Eric is quivering in your hand, tears streaming down his face. You drop him back on the desk, the force of the landing shattering one of his legs. He cries out in pain, but his fate is sealed. You bring down your thumb on his tiny form and slowly crush him. A satisfying squish is heard and your desk is smeared with his gooey remains. </span></div></div>",

You pull them out and let them tumble from your fingers onto the wooden surface of your desk.  Dwarfed by your two feet towering over them, Eric and Jake try to stand up.  \"Enjoy your trip?\" you ask mockingly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric immediately begins shouting something at you.  Finding it cruelly fun to not allow him to a chance to speak with you, you lean forward and give him a quick hard blow and laugh as he goes flying back a few inches.  \"How about another trip?\" you say, \"but where to go...\" rolling your eyes up to the ceiling as though you were pondering something profound.  \"I know!\"  You lick your lips in excitement and then lean over the side of your chair and pick up one of your just-worn sneakers.  Immediately you pinch Eric with your fingers and dangle him around over the opening, grinning at him.  \"Man... get a whiff of that!\" you crudely tease.  Without any further ado, you lower Eric inside the moist cavern and plop him down onto the fabric sole.  You bring it close and look down at him, so that all he can see from inside of the opening is your visage snickering at him from above.  Then, you tilt the sneaker forward and watch him tumble across the sole into the dark, covered area that your toes normally rest in.  You lean over and place the sneaker onto the floor beneath your chair.  You lean forward and take your socks off, one at a time.  You ball one up and stuff it into the opening of the sneaker containing Eric.  Holding the other sock, you then look at Jake, who is staring up at you with nervous concern.  You then nab him as well and dangle him upside down for a few seconds.  With your other hand you slide the sweaty sock beneath your other hand and give Jake a lazy smile as you casually drop him inside the opening.  You take your two hands and open the top to see him tumbling down across the crusty insides of the fabric, finally reaching the particularly stinky bottom.  With the same jeering look you gave Eric, you slide your head back and tie the end of the sock into a knot and carelessly chuck it across your desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your two puny friends trapped inside your footwear, you take out the crystal from your free pocket and twirl it around between your fingers, marveling at what powers it could possibly hold. </span></div></div>",

When you realize that all that's there is a red shiny rock, its mysteries not yet unlocked to you, you lay it down at your side table and close your eyes...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*ring!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour alarm clock is going off!  You rouse yourself up and lean forward, looking at the time... 6:30 in the morning!  Amazingly, you slept through the night and it's time for school.  You don't have time to think about how you slept so long, so you just get ready.  You dart into the shower, wash up, and quickly grab your shorts, a shirt, a couple of socks lying around, and your two sneakers.  After putting it all on, you run downstairs, grab a bite to eat, and run out the front door and run to school.  You get to the front door by the time a strange feeling of forgetfulness starts to eat at you.  You shake it off and head to homeroom, where you normally meet Eric and Jake.  But when the bell rings, they aren't there when you sit down.  The toes of your right foot tickle you a little, while you consider: once in a while the two of them are late for homeroom... but both on the same day?  The bell rings after another few minutes, and you make your way to your first class and sit at your desk.  You look for either of them there too... and then you suddenly remember that Jake and Eric never went home last night.  Finally your memory is jogged... the strange light, the crystal, and the two little bugs.  Eric and Jake shrinking, and you about to step on them!  Your eyes widen when you realize that you may very well be stepping on them right now!  You look down at your feet, stretched out on the floor under your desk as you recline in your seat.  Oopsie...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raise your hand.  \"Can I go the restroom please?\"  The teacher gives your permission, so you stand up, realizing why the toe of your right foot is tingling. You lightly step toward the restroom, realizing that Jake and Eric are right now trapped against one of your feet.  If they're alive, you don't think they'll ever forgive you for this.  You slam the door open and go into a stall, lock the door when you feel confident no one else is around, and sit down on the covered seat of a toilet.  You look down at your right foot one more time, in anticipation... and then finally untie your right sneaker slip it off.  You lift the thing up in front of your face and look inside.  Nothing appears to be on the fabric sole.  You lean closer and try to look deeper inside, where your toes normally rest but amidst the mild odor emanating from inside your sneaker, you see nothing in the dark.  You try shaking it side to side, to see if Eric comes rolling out like a smashed bug.  He doesn't.  You drop the thing to the floor then and then look at your right foot itself.  You bring your foot up to your knee, to look at the bottom of your sock... and you see Eric nestled in some of the threads, right under the arch of your foot.  He must have avoided being crushed by climbing into the gap under your arch.  You pick your little buddy out of your sock, watching him kick away in fear of you.  Your bring your foot back down, and place him right in between your two feet, knowing he wouldn't dare risk the dangers of the giant school.  You lift your foot back up and take your sock off as well.. and sure enough, a miniature Jake comes rolling out.  He's the one who was making your two big toes itch.  No doubt he squeezed under your foot, in between your toes when your foot came thrusting inside.  You look at him staring at your furiously as you dangle his little body in front of your face. You bring him toward your nose and sniff.  Grinning, you suddenly tell him \"You don't smell so good.\"  You then can't help but laugh out loud, realizing how nasty it must have been for Jake and Eric to be trapped against your giant-sized, smelly feet for all this time.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pick Eric back up and drop him next to Jake in your palm.  \"I'm going to try and help you guys when I get home.  But right now we're in school.  I can't just leave.\"  Jake immediately begins screaming at the top of his lungs: \"YOU TAKE US HOME RIGHT NOW AND DO IT.\"  You just smile at him.  \"I'm bigger, so I'm the boss\" you state.  \"You should be happy I'm helping you at all. I could have left you in my sock.  You'd be stuck against my stinking feet all through track practice.  Maybe that's not such a bad idea now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT!\" Jake quickly cries.  You laugh, knowing that he'd beg that you keep him in another spot.  You smile lazily at him, \"and to think, I could have just stomped on you in the grass... okay!  I'll keep you guys in my pocket until I get home.  I'll try not to get too horny... but I can't always help it!\"  You quickly close your fingers over them before they can object, and plunge them into the darkness of your shorts pocket.  You cant help but enjoy how much the two of them are forced to depend on you, and how easily you can silence them by simply slipping them into the pocket of your clothing.  You put your sock back on, slip your feet into your sneakers, and swagger out of the restroom.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You remove your shorts containing your two miniature friends and hang them up inside your usual locker, and change into your athletic shorts.  You kick off your running sneakers as well and tie the much newer ones that you wear for sprinting.  After shutting the locker, you head out.  Track goes by fast, as usual.  By the time it's over, you are completely saturated with sweat.  You decide to shower at home, so you open your locker to change right away, but instead you find your clothes missing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it!\" you shout.  You never lock this locker, because so few of you are on the team and you have never had anything stolen before.  You wonder if someone could have known that your shorts contained people, or why on this day of all others would someone steal a used pair of shorts and a year-old pair of running sneakers?  You dart out of the locker room in your track uniform and scan the parking lot.  At the far end you see a vaguely familiar figure walking away.  You recognize him as Brad, a lean, lanky member of the track team who has a reputation for good looks, smooth charm, and rich parents. A little taller than you, he is wearing a white collar t-shirt, jeans, and sneakers.  Brad is well respected and popular, and you have always had a cold relationship with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly you sprint across the length of the lot and see him open the door to his car.  He tosses in a gym bag and instead of climbing inside, he then shuts the door.  Predicting that he is going to turn around, you quickly dart to the side, behind the closest car to you and kneel down.  You wait, gazing ominously at the demolished anthill that you accidently planted your foot partially over when kneeling.  The ease at which such tiny lives can be destroyed causes you to panick more, as you think of the dangers Eric and Jake face without your protection.  You wait silently as Brad's slow, rhythmic footsteps approach.  You notice his passing out of the corner of your eye, and he doesn't see you.  When you hear him open the door to the school again, you kick off the ground and sprint toward his car.  You aren't even sure if Jake and Eric are in there, but you have to try and look.  You reach his expensive new SUV and try to open the passenger side door.  It's locked, as is the driver's side door.  You can see the gym bag on the passenger seat through the tinted windows. You back away from the car until you reach the edge of the lot and pick up a large rock.  You look around on all sides. The lot is empty, so you throw the rock right at the passenger side window with all of your force.  It smashes clean through, leaving a large enough hole to stick your arm through.  However, the alarm went off instantly.  The car is blinking and beeping loudly.  You panic and unlock the door with your arm, cutting yourself deeply on the broken glass edges of the hole.  You successfully unlock the door, slip your arm out, and grab Brad's gym bag and dart away leaving the door open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run as fas as you can beyond the edge of the lot and hop the fence to the outdoor track.  No one is out here, thankfully.  You quickly hide under the large metal bleachers and crouch down with the gym bag.  You unzip it.  </span></div></div>",

He seems to notice it has been tampered with, as you expected he would, and begins unzipping the bag.  Your rival kneels on the ground sifting through the contents.  He pokes his hands in, out, in, and out.  You think he found his track shoe when his arms stop moving and he leans down closer to examine something.  Then, almost instantaneously, he disappears.  It worked!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rush over to his bag to search the pavement.  You scan the ground intently... and see a tiny moving form scurrying behind the bag Brad left.  You stand over it, smiling, and then quickly lift it off the ground.  Just as you expected, a tiny little Brad is staring up at your looming form in terror.  He's the size of an ant!  \"Going somewhere?\" you tease.  Brad quickly starts fleeing the scene.  He seems to be heading for his comparatively huge car, no doubt wanting to hide from you behind one of the large tires.  With a grin, you lift a foot into the air and follow Brad along the pavement.  It's really quite easy, hovering your large sole over the ant-sized figure who is moving at a snail's pace.  You are easily able to keep your foot above him.  When he gets close to the tire, you simply slam your foot down in his path.  Brad crashes headlong into the side of your sneaker and falls backward.  \"Heheh, not so fast Brad,\" you snicker.  Then, you lift your foot into the air again and hover it over his cowering form.  \"You stole a couple things from me.  Tell me why I shouldn't crush you like a bug.\"  You lower your foot down so it is merely an inch over his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear a little voice coming from the ground, originating from under your shoe.  No doubt Brad is pleading for his life.  You slowly shift your foot to the side, keeping it in the air somewhat in a position above him still.  You can see him motioning something with his arms but you can't hear him.  You bring your foot back and then crouch down, tilting your head to the side so your ear can pick up his little whines.  You can make out something about \"not knowing they were yours\" and \"wouldn't have taken them if I knew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's okay Brad.  Because now I have you too!\"  You bring your hand down and gently pinch Brad's figure in between your thumb and forefinger.  You stand up and raise him to the level of your eyes, inspecting his squirming form, amused by the sight of your tiny rival.  Then you reach into your other pocket and finger for Jake and Eric, gripping them and then dropping Brad and the two of them into just one of your palm.  You lean down at them and say \"You guys probably have a lot to talk about.  You can sort it together while I drive us home -- in Brad's car.\"  You open your own bag and drop the three of them in one of your smelly, old running sneakers and zip the bag, enclosing them in darkness.  You throw your bag into the car along with Brad's -- but not before pulling out his keys. You sit in the driver's seat, put the keys in the ingition, and begin to pull out of the lot.</span></div></div>",

This is the perfect testing ground for the mysterious crystal; the possibilities of who or what you can shrink are almost limitless!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou park on the side of the road; it's 90 degrees out today so you leaving your three little teen pets in the car would likely be a death sentence.  Bearing this in mind, you pick up your bag containing your extra clothes and sneakers and slam the car door shut.  You start by making your way toward a bench and unzip your bag. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sitting on the bench, you lean forward with the crystal in hand, pondering what to do next.  As you do so, you notice beyond the crystal,  down in between the grass, a bustling little ant mound situated squarely (and helplessly) in between your two sneakered feet.  Feeling mischievous, you lift your right foot and slowly press it down upon the ant mound, smirking slightly at the sight of your sneaker smothering the fragile pile of sand and all the grass surrounding it.   You give it a good twist to scuff it out totally. \"Take that, you little fuckers,\" you quietly think to yourself, not much concerned with the fact that they weren't doing anything to bother you except being there.  You always thought it was kind of fun to mess with ants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, that's when the idea hits you.  You could capture these ants, or really any bugs, and have a lot more fun by introducing them to your three tiny friends you have captive within your bag.  You could even make them fight!  You look downward to where you stepped on the anthill and lift your foot off it.  Sadly you seem to have brought on the apocalypse to this particular group of ants.  Looking at your dirtied sneaker treads, you see a smattering of maimed ants, some even alive and squirming around in the maze-like crevices of the rubber sole, but they wouldn't be much fun to use.   You plant your foot back down and stand up, ready to find something else.  It's a park, so there are plenty of ants.  But you could also get caterpillars, spiders, maybe even flying insects.  You unzip your bag and grab the empty water bottle out of it so that you can collect them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stroll the park casually, first heading to a nearby tree up on a hill.  You inspect the bark and notice to your satisfaction a couple caterpillars crawling down the bark.  You'd rather not touch the hairy little things, so you take the cap off the bottle and scoop them up from underneath.  Both slide to the bottom of the jar easily.  Perfect!  You stroll onward and head toward the building that contains the restrooms, wondering if you might find something there.  As you corner the building you feel something sticky and stringy spread across your face.  Reflexively, you swing your arm wildly to bat the spider web off and without thinking, slap your hand against your other arm as you feel something crawl along it.  The initial alarm having worn off, you lift your hand and note with disappointment the mashed remains of the spider whose home you walked into.   \"Damn it,\" you whisper, flicking the little body off. You head toward the other side of the building.  Luckily, now on the alert for spiders, you see another web in the awning of the building along with a nice-sized spider to capture.  You take your water bottle and swiftly but with precision move it through the air to capture the spider inside.  \"Mine now, sucker.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLastly, you figure you may as well get some ants.  It doesn't take long to find more.  You head to the closest garbage can and sure enough there are a couple little black hordes of ants feasting on some crumbs.  You crouch down, and holding the water bottle on its side, start flicking the black insects inside with your free hand.  Naturally the ants panic a little but you're able to get at least ten of them inside.  You close the bottle cap and stand up.  \"Hmm,\" you remark as you glance down on the remaining ants who are still present in the hundreds and scurrying on all sides of your feet.  Not being one to pass up the chance at terrorizing some ants, you sneer devilishly and start stamping around the vicinity, purposely aiming your feet so they land on whatever moves.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter squashing them by the dozens for about ten seconds, a female voice is heard: \"Grow up, jerk!\"  Having already caused immense chaos below, you slow and diminish the intensity of your deadly stomps until you are simply standing still once more, and you turn your head toward the stranger.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax; they're just ants, lady,\" you state dismissively to the woman with a toddler-in-hand who is looking at you with obvious repulsion.   You hardly care; you've been stepping on bugs your whole life.   You walk away, as she states something else that fails to reach your uncaring ears.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make your way back to the bench where your bag sits.  Now's the time: you have a running shoe containing three tiny gladiators: Jake, Eric, and Brad.  And, you have a water bottle containing two caterpillars, a hungry spider, and almost a dozen ants.  Now, you just have to bring them home and you can make them do whatever you want to each other!  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You glance down into your bag and notice Brad, Eric, and Jake, all ant-sized, hopping up and down from the humid, cavernous interior of your running shoe.  Waving their arms dramatically as they hop, they also seem to be chirping up at you.  No doubt desperate for relief from the heat and miasma within your sneaker, you surmise they are begging to be removed from their perhaps less-than-sanitary prison.  \"What's that, guys?  You need to speak up; I can't hear you down there,\" you say with a callous smile, your voice apparently booming enough to startle all three of your captives.  You purposely wait a few seconds in silence, just so you can watch them continue to futiley jump and squeak for your attention, so you can then crush their hope further.   \"I'm going to enjoy the fresh air; you three look like you're having fun on your own.  You must be experiencing all sorts of new sights and smells down there, hahahah.\"  You laugh cruelly and then, ignoring their desperate little squeaking, grab hold of the mysterious crystal and zip the bag back up.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting on the bench, you lean forward and hold the crystal in your hand for a moment, examining its various angles and strange sparkles within.  Before it seemed to work by touch, but here you are holding it and you aren't affected. Perhaps it works through some kind of concentration, you think to yourself.  You spend several minutes focusing on nearby objects.  You think about shrinking a nearby tree.  Nothing happens. Then, you focus again, giving it increased concentration, gritting your teeth slightly as you will it to shrink.  Suddenly, from the corner of your eye, you see a glow!  The crystal lit up!  You repeat your focus on the tree once more, with even more intensity while still keeping an eye on the crystal.  This time, it lights up with greater brightness and then powers back down.  Maybe something smaller will do it, you think to yourself.  You look around and see a garbage can nearby.  You concentrate and will it to shrink down and then a stunning flash occurs.  The light fades quickly and the garbage can is gone totally!  You get to your feet, intending to inspect the can's location, but are startled to feel a brittle crunch under your right shoe.  You gaze down to see what it was and are amazed to see a flattened, piece of metal.  You crouch down and pick up the flattened object.  In an instant you recognize it as the same metal can you were just trying to shrink, only now it is less than a centimeter in length.  Astonishingly, not only did you shrink the can but you also relocated it to the ground at your feet.  It seems you can control not only an object's size but where it appears after you alter it.  With one hand you flick the stepped-on can into the grass like a useless penny, eager to move on to something more interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide to move somewhere more interesting and head over to a busier area of the park and find a bench across from the restrooms.  Jake, Eric, and Brad might get tired of each after a while, you think.  You ought to get them some friends!   Amid the people who stroll on the walkway that you are sitting aside, you take note of an incoming golf cart, steered by what looks a police officer or park security guard.  As mild-mannered and usually well-behaved as you were, you have to admit you never much appreciated authority figures.  As you calmly stare at the approaching golf cart, a familiar flash occurs.  Stunned, you look around, realizing you shrunk the man and his cart almost before you even tried!  Recalling the garbage can from earlier, you lean forward on your bench and look down at the ground below.  Sure enough, a tiny little golf cart, small enough to pinch in between two fingers, is situated on the dirt surface right in between your two feet.  The vehicle is dwarfed by two giant, long objects -- your sneakers -- which can only be described as truly titanic in contrast to the cart and its driver.  As you gaze down, you see the ant-sized officer exit the vehicle, no doubt shocked and confused by his new desert-like surroundings and your two giant rubber-soled, alien-like monstrosities which span the length of huge aircraft-carriers and contain two huge feet to match.  You fascinate to think of the level of detail this tiny man must be experiencing at this scale; you realize he can see every particle of dried dirt trapped in the faded, white foam wall siding of your gigantic sneakers, the scattered grass stains rife along the sides of the dirtied white soles, even the creases in the blown rubber siding under the heels, now collapsed somewhat from a couple of years of supporting your weight and hard impacts from running.  Basically, details which at your normal-sized scale, are mundane, forgotten, and barely perceptible.  You think about exploring this idea later on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thought process is interrupted when you notice the tiny man, having fully exited the vehicle, is staring up directly at you.  You lean in closer in your bench to focus in on him.  His neck is craned way back, straining to see high enough to your looming visage, and the tiny man is staggering backward at the sight of you massive form.  An evil smile spreads across your face as you appreciate how petrified he is at your enormity.  Unfortunately, you never had the chance to decide where you wanted this little guy to appear after you shrunk him, just like the garbage can.  You could pick him up and store him with your friends for later use, or you could have some fun right now by tormenting and terrifying him right here.  Still sitting on the bench, you decide to lift one huge foot. You swiftly bring it above the man and his little cart.  Beneath your hovering shoe, you hear a barely perceptible shout of terror.  Then, with purposeful slowness, you lower your sneaker.  With a devilish grin on your face, you watch the man try to escape the shadow of your sneaker, which you purposely allow him to do, as your foot continues its controlled descent.  Just after the man dives to escape a crushing death, you step down fully, flattening the golf cart with an audible, fun-sounding *crunch*.   Immediately, you lift your foot and hover it over the little man who begins to stand but then trips in fear of the approaching shadow of the vast, rubber treads.  You are truly captivated as you toy with the little man, focusing on nothing else except how terrified you can make him.  Your full thoughts are on being as cruel as possible and terrorizing him for fun. You give him a few seconds to get up and run away again.  He's so tiny that he makes it maybe an inch or two across the imprinted \"desert\" below, patterned after your sneaker treads just from shuffling your feet in the sand idly in the last half hour.  You then halt his escape by slamming your foot down in front of him, swiftly and decisively, perhaps millimeters away, which causes him to bang head first into the mountainous wall of white, crumbling rubber.  The tiny man falls backwards, dazed.   You lift your foot over him once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou snicker cruelly at how easily you could squash him like a bug, taking great delight in how huge you are to him.  Having already caused him intense terror, you could store him like you intended... but then again, there are plenty more out there for you to collect.  You're having fun right now!  Besides, who would know better?  No one was around when you shrank this guy.   And if there are any current potential onlookers, to them you're just some unassuming teenage male sitting on a park bench, toying with a bug or terrorizing some ants with his feet just for the hell of it.  It actually wouldn't be a far off description, you think to yourself in amusement.  In any case, it hardly matters because given what you can do to them, their opinions don't hold much weight over you.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean back slightly in your seat, spreading your arms over the back of the bench comfortably, as though you own the entire thing, watching as the tiny man struggles to get back up.  Almost lazily, you lower your foot down upon the tiny officer with just enough slowness to give him time to get up and run -- but not enough time to escape.  Seeing your gigantic sneaker descend from the heavens, the little man laughably holds up his arms as if to brace himself for the impact.  There's no chance.  Still leaning back with your arms outstretched, you plant your foot down quietly but firmly and hear and even feel a very quiet, sticky *squelch.*  You smirk fiendishly as as you twist your sneaker slightly.  Having done that, you eagerly lift up your foot.  Holding it in the air, you see only a tiny couple red specks and streaks on the dirt where you stepped.  Momentarily confused, you cross your leg over and prop your foot on the other knee, sitting cross-legged with your sneaker sole tilted to face you, still leaning back on the bench with your arms outstretched.  Right in the center of upper-mid portion of the sneaker tread is the ant-sized officer, pressed into a crevice of the maze-like patterned treads, just like who-knows-how-many bugs you've stepped on before.  It's a fascinating mixture of pink, white, and dark red.  With intense interest, you bring your arms in and lean foward.  You focus in further and snicker cruelly when you realize just how thoroughly squashed he is.  \"Cool,\" you whisper to yourself.  His tiny little torso is fully detached from the lower half of his body and one of his arms is missing, likely having fallen off when you lifted your sneaker up to your knee.  A stringy mess of what you guess are his insides are hanging off a little.  His tiny legs are smashed, puny bones and all.  His head is practically crushed flat, one of his eyes actually missing.  You smile callously.  \"Sorry little guy,\" you quietly say to the gorey mish-mash of flesh, limbs and tiny bones, \"guess you're flat out of luck, heheh.\"  You put your foot back down on the ground, amused by the idea that for most of the day, you'll be walking around with a squashed little man stuck to your sneaker, sort of like a trophy.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You find your own shorts and shoes stuffed inside, proving that Brad was indeed the culprit, but there's no sign of your friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou call out their names as loudly as you dare, just in case they've become hopelessly buried inside the pile of clothing or are simply hiding inside a pocket, thinking that you might be Brad come to torment them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're forced to face the possibility that Brad has already pocketed them and carried them somewhere else. In the meantime you are stuck here drenched in sweat, with a bleeding arm and the noise of the car alarm drawing unwanted attention to itself.

When he hears the alarm Brad will probably come back to investigate before he has a chance to dump your buddies. You might now have a chance to follow him. Admittedly it's not a great plan, but it's the best you can come up with for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor now, you need to do something about your bleeding arm. The wound is messy and you've left a trail of blood behind you. You take a random piece of clothing from the bag, rip it, and use the shreds as an impromptu bandage. That will have to do until you are able to get proper medical attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you finish the school door bursts open and Brad appears. He's not alone. You've never seen his companion before. Tall, in his mid-twenties, and with blond hair, he's too old to be a student and he's certainly not a teacher. He must be some acquaintance of Brad's. From what you can see of him you suspect he is not the kind of person who is likely to help your friends...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them run over to the car. Brad shuts off the alarm and looks around for the culprit. He's clearly annoyed by the vandalism and you can't help but smirk at his misfortune - but then your grin fades as you realise that the trail of blood from your arm leads all the way back to the car. You can only pray that the guys are too distracted to notice the stains on the ground...</span></div></div>",

It's starting to become clear that Brad has arranged a meeting of some kind. As you watch you see him take something out of his jeans pocket and hold it out for the blond man to inspect. You're too far away to see what it is, but when the guy takes a sudden step back in surprise you can guess all too clearly what Brad must be holding. There's no doubt in your mind that he has one or both of your friends in the palm of his hand!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, a broad grin spreads across the blond guy's face and he starts poking and prodding at whatever is trapped in Brad's hand. A moment later you see his thumb and forefinger pinch together and lift <i>something</i> into the air. As he holds it up you can just about make out a tiny dark speck between his fingertips. You bite your lip and continue to watch with horror. You can only imagine the terror your friends must be feeling right now, being so tiny and at the mercy of a pair of snickering giants. Jake or Eric - whichever is in the blond guys's grasp - is probably kicking and screaming, partly from sheer terror at being carelessly dangled hundreds of feet above the hard gravel of the car park, and partly from the pain of being pinched between a colossal thumb and forefinger. The other is probably equally frantic, seeing his friend helpless but being himself unable even to escape the giant palm that is currently holding him. It must seem like there's no possibility of rescue...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad allows his friend to toy with his tiny captive for a while; in fact, it looks like he's enjoying every moment of it! Finally, however, he makes a gesture and the blond man reluctantly drops the \"speck\" back into Brad's palm. Then the guy pulls out a wad of notes and it all becomes clear: Brad is intending to sell your tiny friends! You've never liked the douchebag, but you never imagined that even he would stoop so low...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately, his greed has worked in your favour on this occasion. Evidently the man doesn't have enough money on him so Brad stuffs your friends back into his jeans while they continue talking. A moment later they shake hands and the man walks away. You have a nasty suspicion that they've arranged a deal and that the guy is merely going to fetch more cash. Like it or not, this might be your only opportunity to rescue your buddies!</span></div></div>",

However, your furious cogitation is interrupted when Brad unexpectedly turns towards your hiding place beneath the bleachers and yells out to you:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay, you can come out now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou instantly freeze, hoping that this is just some kind of bluff, but after waiting for a moment Brad glances at his watch, taps his foot in mock impatience and then calls again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s no good pretending. It\u2019s pretty obvious you\u2019re there. You\u2019re not exactly good at the whole sneaking thing, you know, leaving a trail of blood like that for anybody to see. Hope you didn\u2019t injure yourself too badly breaking into my car, by the way\u2014we\u2019ll talk about you paying for the damage later. Actually, I\u2019m pretty surprised Jeff didn\u2019t notice the mess, though I guess he was too interested in getting his hands on your little friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJeff\u201d is clearly the blond goon who intends to buy Jake and Eric. Unfortunately you have no idea how much time you have before he returns so you\u2019ll need to act swiftly, one way or the other. You warily emerge from your hiding place and begin walking cautiously towards Brad, your eyes flicking around suspiciously in case Jeff is hiding in ambush. You\u2019re uncomfortably aware that your injury will likely rule out any possibility of a frontal assault, even against Brad on his own, but maybe you can somehow achieve your objective through guile?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you reach the SUV you deliberately position yourself so that the body of the vehicle is safely between the two of you. He appears to accept that: for the moment at least neither of you can lash out at the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d he snickers with satisfaction, \u201cI was wondering how long it would take for you to show up looking for your teeny little friends.\u201d He lingers over those final three words, clearly relishing the power he now has over them\u2014and by extension over you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat have you done to them?\u201d you reply, trying to keep the note of anxiety out of your voice. \u201cI want to see them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure you do! Don\u2019t worry; I\u2019ve been taking very great care of them. It doesn\u2019t do to damage the merchandise, you know.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce again the words have obviously been carefully chosen to provoke some kind of response from you. Brad watches you closely for any reaction, but you\u2019ve already resolved not to give him the satisfaction and maintain your best poker face despite how sickened you are by him referring to your poor miniaturized friends as a simple commodity. Disappointed by your apparent stoicism he shrugs and reaches into the pocket of his jeans to retrieve Jake and Eric. He tosses them carelessly onto the front of his SUV\u2014while making sure to keep his hand close enough to snatch them back again in the event of any rescue or escape attempts. The two tiny figures tumble onto the gleaming surface and immediately begin hopping up and down like dancing fleas as their bare arms and legs are burned against the sun-warmed bodywork. Brad grins maliciously at the pathetic sight, watching with amusement as they finally settle down and begin looking apprehensively backwards and forwards between you, no doubt wondering what new torment is in store for them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is low, even for you, Brad,\u201d you start. \u201cLet them go: they\u2019re terrified.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad merely shrugs. \u201cThey\u2019re losers; always have been. You know, it\u2019s actually kinda ironic that they ended up like this. They always loved to push around the smaller kids, and now <i>they\u2019re</i> the smallest guys on the planet! Karma really is a bitch!\u201d He cackles harshly, quite aware, of course, that Eric and Jake are also listening in horror to every word. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you care so much about them anyway. They were never really your buddies. They always used to talk and laugh about you behind your back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite your lip involuntarily. There\u2019s probably some truth in that, but it is equally likely that Brad is playing mind games with both you and your friends for his own twisted enjoyment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFrankly, I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t decide to sell them yourself\u2014after having some fun and games with them first, of course.\u201d He winks coarsely at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is too much, and you decide to set him straight: \u201cYou might be willing to treat human beings\u2014people you know\u2014like objects or slaves to be sold, but I was brought up to respect others.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour rival all but brays with laughter at this little homily. \u201cYeah, and I suppose that\u2019s why I found them stuffed inside your dirty pants while you went out to play on the track!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou\u2019re about answer back with some snappy retort about how weird he is, stealing your used shorts for his own pleasure\u2014but he doesn\u2019t give you the chance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBelieve me, they were overjoyed when I came along to rescue them. They told me all about you dumping them in your shoes and socks, not to mention being bounced around next to your stinking crotch in those shorts of yours. I\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t go all the way and make them clean your dick for you. I hear you\u2019re always up for that kind of service.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bunch your fists and flush with anger and humiliation at his words, not to mention guilt at his barb regarding your earlier power-trip, but you\u2019re aware that he\u2019s still baiting you, trying to throw you off your guard. Time to put a stop to that, you decide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you betrayed them by stealing them, holding them hostage, then putting them up for sale to the highest bidder? Well, guess what: there\u2019s not going to be any sale. You\u2019re going to hand them back to me and walk away.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad simply raises an eyebrow. \u201cOr what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a deep breath and look him directly in the eye. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen what happened to them. If you don\u2019t give them back I\u2019ll shrink <i>you</i> down, and make you just as tiny. Maybe even a bit smaller. Who knows?\u2014perhaps that buddy of yours will be willing to buy you instead!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere\u2019s an instant of total stillness, in which Jake and Eric anxiously look up at Brad, no doubt praying he will believe you...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Be still my heart!\u201d he exclaims in mock terror. \u201cAll fear the mighty Crystal of Shrinking!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe basks in the expression of shock that has appeared on your face. \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s right: your goofy buddies told me <i>all</i> about that cute little toy you found.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe directs his attention downwards for a moment, addressing Jake and Eric directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust think, guys, if you hadn\u2019t been so quick to spill your guts about how you <i>accidentally shrunk yourselves</i> with the crystal I might actually have taken your friend seriously. You could have been back safe in his hands and on your way home by now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he looks back up at you and gestures at the two tiny figures that are now shoving and yelling at each other in futile recrimination. \u201cLike I told you: losers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only gape like an imbecile, crushed by the failure of your admittedly feeble plan. You don\u2019t dare make a grab for Jake and Eric now. Brad is watching you like a hawk in case you try to snatch them, and you are terrified that the ensuing fracas could result in them being smeared across the front of the windshield like bugs. However, you don\u2019t have any further opportunity for introspection as the smug figure on the other side of the car breaks your train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo let\u2019s see it then, the famous crystal.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI... don\u2019t have it on me right now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it\u2019s true, you don\u2019t. The object that has caused you and your friends so much trouble is still sitting on your night stand where you left it yesterday. You were in too much of a rush this morning to remember it, but even if you had you probably wouldn\u2019t have taken it to school with you in case it was stolen. What a pity you never applied that same logic to tiny Eric and Jake...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, ain\u2019t that a shame,\u201d drawls Brad insincerely. \u201cYou see, I might have been willing to take your pretty little magic jewel in exchange for your miniature buddies. I guess I\u2019ll just have to settle for a thousand bucks from Jeff after all.\u201d He pauses to flash his overly-white teeth at you. \u201cUnless you can make me a better offer, of course.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c<i>A thousand bucks?!</i>\u201d you gasp. You\u2019re not sure what you find more shocking: the realisation that his price is so far out of your reach\u2014or that Brad is willing to place monetary value on two human lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn cash. Take it or leave it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad waits for a moment, watching with obvious enjoyment as the emotions play across your face. He knows as well as you do that you could never find that kind of money at such short notice. Once he is satisfied that the true helplessness of your situation has hit home he reaches down and swipes up Jake and Eric in one easy movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSay goodbye to your little friends,\u201d he says. \u201cI guess you won\u2019t be seeing them again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce more the two struggling figures are plunged deep inside the pocket of Brad\u2019s jeans. Jake and Eric are so small and puny that they cannot even push aside the heavy fabric to make their way back up to the top. Brad opens the door and starts to get inside his SUV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWAIT!\u201d you yell at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe pauses and looks at you expectantly. \u201cYes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve still got the crystal. At home. If you take me there I\u2019ll give it to you, just so long as you let me have Jake and Eric back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad beams at you. \u201cYou see, I knew you\u2019d do the right thing if I gave you sufficient motivation. Okay then, let\u2019s go. But don\u2019t even <i>think</i> about trying anything on the way. Just remember, people as small as your friends are pretty damn fragile and it would be <i>such</i> a shame if they were accidentally squashed because you were dumb enough to think you could rescue them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, this appears all too true. In fact you can\u2019t help but eye Brad\u2019s pocket anxiously as he sits down in the driver\u2019s seat, praying that even this simple action doesn\u2019t harm the two little guys tucked inside the deep folds. You force yourself to take a few slow deep breaths and then settle down next to him inside the SUV. If Brad is willing to go along with this exchange then so are you. While you don\u2019t much like the idea of your rival having an object that can potentially shrink people, you can take some comfort in the fact that he will have no more idea how it works than you do. More importantly, you will have Jake and Eric back. However, you know Brad well enough not to take everything he says at face value, so you\u2019re not going to relax until you have your friends safe and sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo intent are you and Brad on watching each other for signs of betrayal that neither of you see Jeff come round the corner just as you start to drive off, or notice as he runs in vain after the SUV with his arms waving...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For the rest of the ride, silence covered the car only broken by the electronic directions. Your heart beats out of your chest as you round the corner to your house. You're about to trade what could most likely be the most powerful weapon in the world to a careless brat. Before you have a chance to further second guess yourself, Brad swings into your driveway. You guys walk up to the front door, your friends still swinging in his pocket. The door was open so you both walked in and to your room. Even though you know you shouldn't care what Brad thinks, you couldn't help but feel embarrassed when you and him walked into your messy room. <br>\r\n     \u201cNice room,\u201d he says mockingly.<br>\r\n     \u201cSo wheres the almighty crystal?\u201d he says in the same tone.<br>\r\n     \u201cOn the nightstand.\u201d you reply, trying to sound confident. <br>\r\n     He approaches the crystal and you can see the greed in his eyes. He picks it up and examines it from every angle.<br>\r\n     After about a minute you decide to speak up. <br>\r\n     \u201cSorry to... interrupt, but I held up my end of the bargain, so you do the same.\u201d you say, stretching out your hand. <br>\r\n     He turns around and stares at you, crystal still in hand.<br>\r\n     \u201cOh, but I'd much rather do this,\u201d <br>\r\n     Before you can react, he points it at you and you feel power all around you and you shut your eyes tightly. It stopped as quickly as it began. You did't even have to open your eyes to know that you met the same fate that your friends did. How did he know how to work the crystal? You open your eyes, only to be greeted by two colossal pillars of flesh that were Brad's legs. It didn't take you too long to notice that you weren't sitting on the carpet. The stench was terrible, but very familiar. You looked down and your face quickly reddened. You were sitting on the crotch of some underwear you left on floor. You stared up at the smirk on Brad's face. you had to crane you neck so much that it hurt, considering you were no more than a quarter of an inch.</span></div></div>",

You haven't fully processed what has happened, but it's exciting none the less. You enter your room and shut the door gently behind you, intent on studying both the crystal and your shrunken friends. You slowly reach into your pocket, reaching in to grab the little shrimps one by one. First Eric, then Jake are deposited onto the hard, wooden surface of your desk. Next you take out the crystal, the source of everything that has happened. It feels cool and hard between your fingers. you've only examined it for a few moments before it begins to pulse with light. You quickly drop it onto your desk, terrified of falling under the same predicament as your friends. The crystal vibrates as the light becomes brighter. Both Jake and Eric have started to run away from the crystal as it continues to whir with energy. The light engulfs your vision and you close your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment, the flash of light dies, and you open your eyes to an amazing sight. Sitting on your desk, is a miniature city. You cannot believe your eyes as you look over the tiny skyline. The city is alive, and you watch tiny cars move about rapidly, no doubt trying to comprehend the current situation. Jake and Eric also gaze in wonder at the tiny metropolis before them. They easily stand taller than any skyscraper, and you all look down at the scurry of activity below. The people are barely visible to your naked eye, appearing as tiny colored dots, but you assume it is a much more different experience for your tiny friends. This presents a whole new slew of opportunities for you. Up to now you were simply going to toy with your friends, but now you have two different sizes of shrimps to mess with. A broad smile crosses your face, as you begin to ponder the possibilities. </span></div></div>",

A miniaturized but fully real bustling city has just been sprawled out on your desk, sitting on a strange circular metal plate that wasn't there before.  At first glance you would guess the entire thing is about 3 feet in diameter.  Meanwhile, its tallest skyscrapers look to be no bigger than perhaps half an inch high -- if even that.  You lean down from in front of your desk, trying to get within eye level of the densely populated metropolis.  You can see teeny cars going this way and that.  Tiny specks which are its people are everywhere.  <i>\"Cool,\"</i> you think to yourself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only imagine what these people are feeling, seeing your huge visage before them.  Your face must easily take up half of what they call their sky. They must be terrified!  In their situation, at the mercy of some massively huge teenaged male, you know you would be.  Well, you say to yourself, time to have some fun!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring Jake and Eric for the moment, you decide to demonstrate your authority to these puny lifeforms.  Feeling you want to be cruel for no reason, you lift your hand over the city, letting it hover there for just a moment so that all can witness. A faint shadow envelops a section of the busy city.  Then, with a devilish grin spread across your face, you curl all of your fingers into your palm save your index finger, and then slowly drive your finger downward into the first busy-looking section you find.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*crunch*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops..\" you state sardonically.  You very slowly lift up your finger.  You noticed you obliterated at least three of their \"skyscrapers\" which were squarely located in the city block you just obliterated.  As your finger ascends, several other buildings nearby who were initially spared by your colossal fingertip collapse inward into the crushed indentation you created resulting in further destruction. With the ground destabilized by the impact, the nearby structures have no chance.  Delighted by the destruction you've caused, you lean down close to the \"ground zero.\"  You focus your eyes to see that several roads have been crumbled into dust, along with scores of cars and pedestrians who have been flattened by your apocalyptic finger.  This is awesome, you think to yourself.  You can't help but feel impressed by the utter carnage and chaos you caused below just by pressing your fingertip down into the city.  In moments flashing little lights flicker below as emergency vehicles approach the scene. Good; now they know who's boss!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inspect your fingertip next.  You frown when you notice that amid the massive grooved surface of it are tiny patches of crushed debris and barely perceptible pink splotches resulting from the many people who you've squashed.  You sneer and use your thumb to flick the detritus off your fingertip into the air.   Then, you smile; this is only the beginning.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As you watch the chaos below, you note that there barely perceptible grooves presenting both horizontally, vertically, and diagonally throughout the metal plate which this city stands on, upon your desk.  Some of the sections are square, some oval, some even triangular.  Curiously, and without much concern for the damage you cause, you bring forth one of your thumbs and drive your thumbnail underneath one section.  Then, you reach your other hand over and use your other thumbnail to separate the opposite section.  With both thumbs, you push the two neighboring sections in opposite directions.  You do try to avoid senselessly destroying any of the buildings but as you succeed in separating one section from another, a couple buildings unavoidably topple over from the instability your movements cause.  However, you successfully break away one section from the whole of the miniature city.  The metal plate acting as the section's foundation is sturdy and small enough to fit in your palm.  The section you separated is circle-shaped, unlike some of the others which are square, triangle, or oblong.  If you had to guess it is about an inch in diameter; small enough to fit inside a petri dish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should you do with this city-section, you think.  You notice next to your bed the pair of overturned sneakers you were wearing most of today.  <i>Perfect.</i>  You bring the city closer in, right up to your face. \"Hey you tiny aliens; you guys want to go exploring?   I've got an idea for you!\"  You give the city-section in front of your eyes an excitedly cruel grin.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with your free hand you pick up one of your smelly running shoes that you wore today; you inspect it briefly.  Dirty and grass-stained, this prison will do nicely!.  Although you are a pretty well-groomed and clean guy, there isn't much you can do about the all-day smell of your feet that permeates your sneakers due to your competitive running.  Actually, you're sort of proud of how they smell.  The more they stink, the manlier you feel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little guys are lucky,\" you state.  \"You're going to be experiencing an environment like no other that exists anywhere!  You might make discoveries that could prove earth-shattering back home!   It's a semi-enclosed environment, and unfortunately I'm just too big to experience the intricacies of this habitat.  But from what I have smelled of the, uh, flora and fauna within, I can say without any doubt that it's quite a complex and robust ecosystem. Definitely a unique one!  Maybe your scientists can grow something out of what's already growing within it!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a rather sadistic laugh as you bring your giant shoe up with one hand and lower the city-section down into the humid, cavernous interior.  You lay the section, which is about the size of a quarter, gently on the damp, worn fabric insole and gently nudge it toward the toe section of your sneaker where it is darkest and most humid.  You grin wickedly; within your sneaker is an entire city-section of intelligent beings; hundreds of civilians and families, maybe more, forced to endure the smell your feet have created within. At your colossal scale, the miasma within your running shoe must be overwhelming to these little microbes, you delightfully think. You've run in these sneakers for a couple years now; who knows what vast numbers and varieties of moisture-loving microbes have made their home inside of your footwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fantasize about how their historians, generations from now, will document and and describe the period wherein their city was seized by a giant teenage alien and then made to languish within the giant, evil teen's stinking sneaker: an embarrassing era for them to be sure!  You also excitedly wonder if the noxious environment created by your feet may be truly harmful to your little slaves.  You can just picture them all wearing gas masks right about now!</span></div></div>",

If they tried to leave your desk, they knew they could be stepped on any time without you even realizing it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit down at your desk and lean over the city; the city is as busy as ever.  Teeny tiny vehicles move around in all directions.  Flashing lights were are ambulances are seen everywhere responding to the damage you caused earlier.  <i>Perfect.  </i>Your victims it seems followed your rules. No one, or at least no noticeable number of people, tried to leave.   You gaze down at them curiously for a minute, delighting in the thought of how petrified they must be to see your smiling visage in the sky.  You pick up your sneaker which you left on your desk and gently reach your finger in until you feel the edge of the quarter-sized city section you placed within last night.  You can only imagine what they had to endure within the dark interior of your sneaker.  You feel a brittle crunch as you dig your nail into the city and pull it into view.  You really had no way of getting it out without crushing some buildings, unfortunately.  You are satisfied to see the city mostly intact, though.  You gently pick up the quarter sized section of the city and place it roughly back where you removed it from the larger city.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then lean down and inspect closely and are delighted in what you see.  Entire buildings seem abandoned; cordoned off with barely perceptible bright yellow strips of tape. There seems to be a full on quarantine!  You snicker with boyish glee.

You've always fancied yourself a cut above the rest of your peers but this experience solidifies that status. Here, there is no question that you are superior, almost god-like due to your sheer size in comparison. All it takes is a press of your finger to reduce their buildings to dust, to end their lives beneath the crushing weight of a single digit. You cannot begin to imagine the terror that they must be experiencing, having just watched as you obliterated countless lives beneath your fingertip. To be nothing more than microbes must be utterly horrifying to these tiny inhabitants, you imagine. Still, you're glad the crystal brought this city to you. For once, you can be your true, cruel self without worrying about image or perception. The thoughts of these people hold no weight over you and you are happy to crush them as you would some unwelcome bug. Knowing that they can comprehend their demise, that they can see you as a god before you destroy them makes it all the more savory. Sure, crushing a bunch of mindless insects underfoot is mindless entertainment, but dominating an intelligent species, people with lives and hopes and dreams, that is a euphoria unlike any other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention. Your two friends have begun to make their escape, away from you and the city before them. Despite the new playthings you have acquired, you aren't content to let them leave just yet. Lazily, you lift a hand into the air and move it over the city. No doubt, the tiny residents probably think you're going to crush more of their buildings beneath your palm, but you ignore the temptation to do so for now, instead focusing on grabbing the would-be escapees. It isn't difficult, and soon you hold them both tightly in your grip. \"Really, guys? There is literally an alien city in front of you and the first thing you try to do is escape\", you say, improvising a tone of disappointment. Truth be told, you're more interested in examining the city than tormenting your captives. There is just more possibilities with an even smaller scale of people and so you quickly make your mind up. \"Stay here while I fuck with this city\", you sternly announce. You drop them into an empty pencil case on your desk. They tumble into the dark opening and you go to zip it up. Before fully closing it, you give them a brief warning. \"Oh, and if you try to escape, I'll squeeze you 'till you pop, got it?\", and with that, you seal them into the dark and pencil-scented prison. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChaos has engulfed the city. One moment, pedestrians had been going about their day as usual, working, out walking and doing normal things. The next, a great light had filled the sky, like a flash of lightning, magnified like nothing they had ever seen. Soon afterwards, the sky was gone, replaced by the terrifying visage of a teenage boy. His enormity was beyond comprehension and he filled the sky with his smile. Smaller giants could be seen on the horizon, at the eastern end of the city, though they did not share the same callous expression as the bigger one. Many road accidents had occurred, as drivers stared out their windscreens at the sight before them. All across the city, people looked up in fear and horror at the smiling face that gazed down at them. To them, he was a god, and he soon demonstrated his absolute power. It happened so quickly but was more devastating than any terrorist attack or natural disaster. The giant curled all but one finger into a fist, and like a meteor falling from the heavens, brought it down upon the city. It was unstoppable, and he casually killed 564 men, women and children with a single touch. Nothing survived beneath his fingertip, reducing skyscrapers to dust in an instant. It was the end times for them, and pure fear erupted among the populace. Nothing could stop this titan, even without effort buildings toppled over, killing hundreds more. People screamed and cried for the nightmare to end, but their cries for on deaf, and frankly uncaring ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look over the city once more, looking to wreak more havoc. You lower your face closer to the city, trying to get a closer look at the people fleeing below. They are truly tiny, looking no bigger to you than grains of sand, but you can sort of make out their forms if you look hard enough. You feel the need to experiment a bit more with your newfound power. After all, the city takes up a large portion of your desk, and it appears to be fairly industrialised in every corner. There could easily be millions of tiny humans, gazing up at you and wondering if you will kill them next. The thought greatly appeals to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin again, and give the city a quick blow. Instantly, people, cars and pieces of building are thrown about from the powerful gust. They are all sent flying in the air, smashing into buildings and shops. Another tower is knocked due to your actions but before it can collapse onto the city, you move your palm to catch it. Again, countless more are crushed by your actions but you care little for their death, your attention focused on the building on your hand. You lift it up to your eye to examine it. The windows are all shattered and the base has become deformed. You peer inside to see little red blotches, staining the glass, along with a few survivors. Truly the smallest of your actions is cataclysmic for these people. A great number of lives has already been ended by your actions. Finished with the building, you move your palm over the city once more, and let it fall back down. Glass, steel and rubble descend on the desperate inhabitants, crushing and skewering them like bugs. Next you extend your finger once more and press down on the surface. This time, you drag it across the city, tearing up roads, and demolishing everything in its path. Nothing survives your finger, and a deep trench is engraved across the foundations. You spot a densely crowded group, located in what looks like a city square. You want to move these people, without killing them immediately. Using your nail, you dig it beneath the ground, under the group. Slowly, you lift the section using your nail and grab it with your fingers. Dozens are immediately reduced to bloody remains as you grab the edges, unfortunate enough to have been standing in the wrong place, at the wrong time. You move this section away from the city and onto your other palm and slowly tilt it. You now have a collection of two hundred or so tiny people within your hand, and you ponder what torture to inflict.</span></div></div>",

You could just kill them, a simple clench of your fist and they would be reduced to messy smears in your palm. You could keep this batch as your personal slaves, forcing them to do the unspeakable, knowing that refusal meant certain death. However darker thoughts begin to take hold in your mind. You've always enjoyed asserting dominance whenever you could, but until now you've been subdued by society's \"standards\", forcing you to conform to the expected behaviour. You have the opportunity now to be as cruel and as evil as you want, without any repercussions. Sure, you've already killed a great number due to your actions, but that was you just playing around. Now you want to properly annihilate this puny, sub-human city that sits atop your desk and all the pathetic microbes who dwell within it. You see yourself as a vengeful, all-powerful god, bringing the fury of the heavens down upon the unfortunate people below. No doubt, any psychologist would have a field day with your psychosis with thoughts like these, but who cares? No one will ever know about this tiny city and its worthless inhabitants. The world wouldn't believe you if you told them anyway. Looking down at the terrified captives standing in the vast plane of your palm, a sinister smirk crosses your face. You do not care to discern men, women or children. To you, they are all the same: bugs for you to crush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBolstered by your disturbing but thrilling desires, you slowly begin to close your fingers around your captives. You watch the frenzied movements of the crowd as they desperately plead with you to spare their lives. A few of the braver souls even jump off your hand, preferring their airborne chances to those atop your appendage. Their screams reach your ear as little more than a barely perceptible tinkle, and you look down at them with malice one final time, before swiftly clenching your fist. You feel a series of small \"pops\", causing you to laugh. These people are truly pathetic! Slowly, you unfurl your fingers to admire your handiwork. Your palm is dotted with numerous red splotches, bits of microbial dismembered bodies here and there. You wipe your hand off the underside of your desk and turn your attention back towards the city. Smoke billows from the previous \"encounters\" as panic engulfs the metropolis. \"Your god is very angry with you little fuckers\", you say with sadistic glee. The city is roughly the size of your desk, so it shouldn't take too long to destroy. You take a final look at the mostly unblemished cityscape before you begin your assault and smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, you shoot your hand out and swat at some of the \"skyscrapers\". Immediately, they break apart and fall like dominos, showering the pedestrians below with a mixture of glass, concrete and office furniture. It's amazing how easy it is to knock over their puny buildings, and for the next minute or two, you flick at a few other towers, instantly reducing them to rubble, and sending deadly projectiles of metal and concrete across the metropolis. After a while, you tire of your little game of \"dominos\" and look for your next sources of entertainment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lone subway train catches your eye. Obviously, some previous act of yours has sabotaged its ability to run and so it has become marooned on a single stretch of track, a metal unmoving prison for those unlucky enough to be inside. Using two fingers, you pinch the end carriage of the train, and slowly hoist it up in front of your eyes. It dangles in front of your face like a metallic string of spaghetti, and you peer inside the carriages to see tiny people strewn about the place, screaming and in utter fear of your presence. Their actions do little to evoke anything other than excitement out of you, pondering what to do with your little captives. All the destruction has made you hard as a rock, as your penis stiffens against the tables underside. Looking at the carriages swaying in the air, a fun thought springs to mind. </span></div></div>",

Despite your best efforts, a few of the people fall past the surface, descending down towards your legs on the ground below. You have little sympathy for them, instead focusing your attention on the collection you have gathered before you. They seem startled from the sudden change in surroundings, and you watch with amusement as they attempt to pick themselves up and process what has happened. No doubt they cannot comprehend how a being as massive as you are to them can exist, nor how anything could casually tear apart their city. They have begun to amass in small gatherings, groups of little people staring up at you in utter fear. At least, that is what you assume they're doing. At their scale, you cannot discern much of the actions of your little captives. They are simply too small for their gestures to translate into anything substantial. Still, if your prior antics have taught you anything, the simple thought of crushing these beings beneath your fingers like unwelcome pests is satisfaction enough. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to be a bit creative with this batch though and decide to play a little game. In as stern a tone of voice as you can muster, you begin to outline your commands. \"You gaze upon your new god, puny ones. Worship me or face my wrath\". While it may sound stupid for any normal person to hear you say such a thing, to the microbes below, it may as well be the voice of God himself. You lower your face closer to the desk, hoping to discern the servitude of these people in greater detail. You can barely make out their imperceptible actions but it does appear that they have understood your command. Watching them bow before you, you are once again struck by the sheer size difference. These people are no bigger than ants to you, small ones at that. You could easily crush a hundred or so beneath the tip of your pinky finger. You smile at the thought. Looking over to the city, you watch as the smoke rises over the decimated portion, where you established \"first contact\". You have within your possession, a fully fledged and sapient population, who you could easily destroy if you so desired. Nothing in your life would ever be the same.</span></div></div>",

Late morning, browsing the Internet, preparing to meet his girlfriend. The last few days had been going great for him, work hadn't been too stressful and he was progressing smoothly in his bio-engineering course. He had been out walking through the busy streets when it happened. A flash sparked from the sky, brighter than any lightning strike. A great and terrible roar echoed all around, throwing everything into chaos. Tim was knocked to the ground by the force of...whatever had happened, he wasn't sure. Was it some kind of attack. Around him, the city descended into madness. Drivers, distracted by the event, slammed into street lamps and other vehicles. People looked up in fear, expecting a fiery nuclear inferno or worse. Tim joined them, craning his neck to see whatever had caused the eruption of light and sound. The sight that greeted him was un-Earthly. The sky itself...convulsed...like some sort of morbid kaleidoscope. It didn't make sense, yet it was happening. After a few seconds another flash blinded everyone, its intensity greater than the first. Tim's eye were screwed shut but before he opened them, the screaming started again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the first view had startled him, Tim was utterly in shock with the second. No more did the convulsing mass of clouds and sun hang above him. Instead a hazy, monotone white replaced it. But what scared him beyond anything else, was the being that had consumed the horizon. It looked like teenager or a guy in his early 20's. But his size was incomprehensible. An expression of curious surprise was etched on to his monumental face. Tim was frozen, unable to understand what he was witnessing. The thing was simply huge! He could easily grasp buildings between his fingers, destroy entire blocks beneath his palms. The giant stirred briefly, his face contorting to one of delight, with a smile that was tinged with malice. \"Cool\", he boomed. The behemoth began to move his hand, the speed of which took Tim by surprise. Around him, people had begun to find their voices, screaming in abstract fear at the sight before them. The hand hovered over the buildings in the distance, a looming symbol of devastation. Tim's mind was racing. Amber lived in the apartment building there, directly below that monster's hand. Adrenaline coursed through his body as Tim hoped against hope that the giant wouldn't do anything, or that Amber was in some other part of the city. But he knew that on Saturdays she liked to stay in, usually waiting for him to call over. Tim started to sprint through the sea of distraught onlookers, desperate to stop the unstoppable. It was all for naught and he watched as the monolithic finger of the giant crashed into the city. Immediately a rush of wind threw him back, as the sound of collapsing concrete rang all over. Tim screamed, knowing she was gone, crushed like hundreds of others beneath the touch of a god. The giant lifted his finger, admiring his work as more buildings collapsed from the impact. It was catastrophic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few minutes felt were horrific, as if Satan himself had climbed out of the depths of hell to torture them. After unfathomable destruction and countless deaths, Tim found himself looking up at the callous being, bowing feverishly. The giant had commanded them to serve him, lest they incur his wrath. Tim felt a mix of pure fear and hatred, hating the monster that had killed so many, but powerless to stop it. So he, like a hundred or so others, continued their gestures of servitude to their new god. He towered above them, a living mountain. Any time he had made contact with the city, tremours tore through the ground. There was simply no comparison between them and him. He knew this, and seemingly enjoyed tormenting them. Just as the thought passed Tim's mind, the giant moved again, no doubt to toy with them further. He reached beyond his worshipers, into the damaged metropolis that lay smoking behind them. After a few moments, the giant's fingers clenched another writhing group of people. There must have been 2 or 3 hundred, held thousands of metres above Tim, directly in front of the smirking giant. He looked at them for a few moments, not caring for the ones who slipped through his grasp and fell to the depths below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly he did something unexpected. He slowly opened his mouth, rolling out his tongue beneath the mass of people. He held them above his tongue, before letting them fall. Tim watched as hundreds of people were deposited onto the tongue of the giant, before he drew them into his gaping maw. His mouth closed, sealing them inside. As if for a captive audience, the giant the captives in his mouth for a bit until he finished with an exaggerated swallow. He let out a laugh, not caring for the countless lives he had sent to an early grave. Tim couldn't understand what they had done to deserve this fate, the mere playthings of an uncaring teenager. He crushed them, demolished their buildings and ate them like candy. The giant looked down at them, an evil glare in his eyes. \"Who knew you shrimps were tasty?\", he said. Tim lost all hope, looking up into his eyes. He hoped his death would be swift. The giant stirred again and rose higher still, standing to his full height. His shorts came into view, but Tim was cast into shadow by the long erection that stretched his apparel. The giant was a truly sick creature, deriving such pleasure from the suffering of others. Suddenly he leaned over, no doubt to torment the city further. This action though, drove the hardened shaft straight towards Tim's group. Immediately half of the group, men, women, children were crushed beneath the giant's crotch. Tim had been positioned slightly to the right and avoided the sudden attack. He began to run, hoping against hope that he might escape. Looking over, he saw the giant raise his palm before slamming it down, destroying everything beneath. After that, Tim didn't look back despite the screams and sounds of calamity echoing behind. He just ran.</span></div></div>",

You savor the seductive power you can wield over this tiny civilization.  With a finger, you have the power to eradicate them, or spare them.  You have the power to alter the course of their civilization's entire future.

Dozens upon dozens of others were running alongside him, people of all kinds.  Professionals in business suits foolishly carrying briefcases, unkempt homeless people wearing tattered scraps of clothes, college-aged couples in casual dress, parents dragging toddlers in tow.  A scant few who were well-conditioned ran ahead of Tim, but he was still just barely ahead of the middle of the stampeding back.  The unfit and the infirm were struggling far behind in the rear, he saw as he spun his head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll this, just to get away from a single self-indulgent teenager who appeared to enjoy being as purposely cruel and terrifying as possible to those smaller than him.  To Tim, and the people of this city, the massive teenager who leered down from the heavens was almost incomprehensible.  How could nature allow such a giant being of destruction to even exist, they thought.  How was it fair?  Did some species, like Tim's, evolve so pitifully as to be treated like his race were a plaything for a single teenage male of another species to torture, terrify, and crush as he pleased?   What was reality;  that Tim and his people were normal-sized and that their giant bully was some sort of massive death-bringing God?  Or was it that Tim and his people evolved on the smaller-sized end of the larger cosmic scale, and that this cruel, sadistic aggressor had no heavenly qualities except the advantage of having evolved to be massively bigger than Tim and his kind?  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim's train of thought was abruptly halted when a cruel laugh boomed from overhead.  He was about to turn his head once again when suddenly the wooden surface on which he stood quaked violently.  Before him, an almost impossibly huge, fleshy wall lay that was not there before suddenly lay in his and everyone else's path.  It was the giant teen's hand, gargantuan in size, laying palm up.  The massive hand practically engulfed the entirety of what Tim could even see, so lengthy was it.   Not only was this giant's hand as big as a mountain range, it was gargantuan enough to crush one.  Tim was about to stop in his place when suddenly an booming, thunderous voice was overheard from the sky above.  Tim looked up at a grinning visage, his emotions mixed by both fear and hatred.  \"Get on,\" the giant's near-deafening voice  stated.  \"Or else..\"  Tim knew it was no empty threat; not only was his people's over-sized oppressor perfectly satisfied to toy with and terminate his kind, he also clearly enjoyed being the unstoppable tyrant that he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTim found himself desperately clinging to the grooved wall of flesh that comprised the side of the giant's aircraft-carrier sized palm.  He kicked into the spongy flesh as hard as he could to gain footholds with which he could kick off and gain elevation and climb upward before the giant would capriciously move his hand.  Hundreds of others were doing the same; the chaos was overwhelming.  People were pulling others downward, kicking others downward, all in a desperate attempt to make it into the palm of this cruel alien-like titan.  Tim didn't want to look back; he already knew the giant teenager in the sky would be enjoying the mass panic.  At this point, Tim couldn't have felt any less significant, degraded, and forgotten than he already did.   The same giant teen who had demolished entire neighborhoods of his city with his fingers was now commanding his \"subjects\" to climb onto his palm for whatever cruel fate he could devise or be annihilated themselves.  </span></div></div>",

Glancing over it, you notice the crystal sitting at the city's edge, shimmering in the afternoon sun. Almost instinctively, you grasp it once again, feeling its cool hardness in your hand. Within your possession is some mystic artifact, able to shrink people, transport entire cities and who knows what else. Mulling over these thoughts as you caress the crystal, you think about the city, if it were even smaller, small enough to fit under your palm. Suddenly, light emanates from your hand, beams shooting out in all directions. The familiar flash bathes the room in a red glow once more as cosmic energy compounds the space in your bedroom. After a brief moment, you open your eyes, and to your shock, the city has shrunk further. What once took up your entire desk, now resides in an area no bigger than the cover of a pocket dictionary. Strangely, the shrunken figures of Jake and Eric have disappeared aswell. You frown, unsure of whether they had escaped during the light show and lean over the desk to investigate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScreams echoed around the city of Satal. A monstrous being had overtaken the horizon, his size utterly incomprehensible to the terrified denizens. He had been big before, but now they were truly nothing to him. The entire city could fit under a single hand, so huge he seemed. Everywhere, chaos erupted. People did their best to escape the horror but there was little they could do. He was simply too huge, too monumental to be ignored. The giant stirred, his entire torso expanding into the horizon, his perturbed face replacing the sky. Truly, this was the endtimes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou lean over to examine the area of your desk where your shrunken friends had once stood. There's nothing there except a few stray pieces of lint. You sigh, unsure of your next move, until something catches your eye. Down on the wooden surface of your desk, is a small, coloured speck, barely perceptible. You lean closer to see if perhaps your friends got caught in the flash and were shrunk further. After focusing for a minute, you let out a laugh. It was Jake and Eric all right, except now they were truly nothing. They barely passed a millimetre in size, if even. At this scale, they were probably no bigger than the denizens of the micro city. You smile evilly down at your former friends. You could easily kill them. All it would take is a press of your finger and they would cease to exist, reduced to nothing but a tiny smear on the vast surface of your desk. But for now, you're more interested in destroying the pathetic city that sits atop your desk. Besides it's not as if your \"friends\" will be able to escape now, not at their scale. You recline back in your seat and look down at the shrunken metropolis. You move your hand over the city, hanging it above them. It would be so easy to crush them all beneath it, you think to yourself. With this crystal, you've practically become a god.</span></div></div>",

As nice as it is to be so majestic in comparison, maybe you should appreciate the city's intricacies in more detail. What would be very interesting, you think, is to isolate a portion of the city for the sake of further study.  Perhaps you can contain it somehow.  You then recall that in your attic is a collection of large, clear glass jugs, about 12 inches in height with a base nearly as wide, that belong to your cousin, who manages a nearby brewery in town.  The bottles had a small opening at the top that could be plugged with a rubber cork.  Perfect, you think to yourself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple trips to and from the attic, you have several of these large glass jugs sitting atop your desk, behind the miniaturized city.  Now, you need only to use the crystal, which you've grown to learn operates on your thoughts, to alter the size of the city and transport different sections of them into the bottles.   With the crystal firmly in hand, you focus in on the densest, busiest, more developed section of the micro-city and picture it adjusting size to fit within the glass jug nearby.  A familiar red light shines.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen your eyes open, you sit amazed.  It worked.  You gaze in awe at the glass jug standing before you.  Lined up against the glass walls are small office buildings arranged just how they were on your desk.  They are less tiny than before, to fit the scale of the jug, most office buildings now being measuring inches in height.  Gridlocked roads intersect the sections of buildings, filled with colorful little cars and flea-sized people, some huddled in masses looking in terror at your visage through the clear glass, others scurrying in all directions in a panic.  You snicker to yourself at your newly found self-importance to these people.  At the very center of the bottled city are the tallest, most impressive towers.  Much taller than the rest, some are nearly as tall as your hand would be if you held it out in front of you. They would be equivalent to the tallest skyscrapers in your own world, you surmise.  Around a couple are tiny little patrol aircraft, which resemble helicopters.   You're fascinated by the detail within; you can make out ornate designs that decorate these towers. Each one is a different shape, with its own unique style.  You can't help but appreciate the sophistication of these architectural wonders.  This city represents a microcosm of this tiny race's way of life, you realize.  Now, the whole city and its people are yours.  You uncork the bottle and lean over the jug in order to get a total top-down view of the city and its mite-sized population.  Looking through the bottle's opening with one open eye, you imagine the utter terror your captives must be experiencing-- to these microbes it as if the the sky suddenly opened from the heavens, to reveal one gigantic, evil eye glaring down at them from above the clouds.  </span></div></div>",

After bottling the first city, you were left with just the tiny, unwanted neighborhoods that were of no real interest.  You first toyed with them, slowly pressing your index finger down on them here and there, crunching neighborhoods, until finally you grew bored, stretched your hand out, and swatted down on the entire urban sprawl which easily fit underneath your palm.  The debris attached to your hand was sort of cool looking, you thought, as you rubbed your hands together over your wastebasket in order to remove the remaining detritus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the weeks after, you had used the crystal to summon several more cities from several other worlds, bottling the most impressive ones.  Before long, you had about a dozen of these bottle cities, each containing a fully developed race of people no bigger than fleas.   Each had its own structural designs, its own sort of style.  You were pleased with how your collection was going.  For the majority of the time, while you spent your summer days hanging out with friends, you'd keep the bottles lined up next to each other on a couple tables against the wall in the basement, which you had also temporarily turned into your bedroom during the summer to get relief from the heat.  It was perfect in that no one ever came downstairs, so you didn't have to worry about anyone discovering them, and during all the time you were at home, you could be there to monitor them and even sleep knowing they were close by.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBest of all, you had immediate access to them whenever you wanted.  At first you thought it would be interesting to let these cities develop freely without any intervention, but that quickly became a boring prospect as your curiosity grew and you couldn't resist interfering and toying with the cities further. You loved the idea of being revered (or feared) as a god.  Now your wish was fulfilled: you had gone from the role of ordinary teenage guy, and moved on to the role of a massive giant who collects worlds.  Your old life in the normal sized world seemed to matter less and less, while your life as an omnipotent titan to these people became your main focus.  These were intelligent sentient races, sized down to fit in bottles,waiting to be terrorized and tormented by you, a temperamental deity.  Fate couldn't have chosen a better guy than yourself for that role, you think to yourself, brimming with all sorts of fiendish ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPart of your cruel fun included leaning down and tapping on the glass of one of your many bottled cities with your finger, causing loud tinking sounds within.  This action alone would send thousands of people in the streets screaming in terror.  You did this from time to time to all the cities, in order to remind them that their giant collector could easily smash them all into oblivion if he wanted. Soon every population was conditioned to fear your unmistakable approach.  Whenever you walked over, your captives experienced a series of rhythmic *THOOM*s in the distance that progressively grew louder, accompanied by increasingly intense tremors until your massive form lumbered into view, seen from the waist up, and overtook their entire sky.  Having witnessed your tyrannical nature, they knew anything could happen!  Many ran indoors hoping to escape a potential impending doom.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your victims, each day was unpredictable, as you devised creative ways to mess with them.  Sometimes you'd suck some of the bottle's air into your mouth and swiftly recork it, resulting in a depressurized environment in which air was so thin that it stifled their ability to breathe.  You would wait several seconds so that you could lean your face close to the glass and see how long they could go before most were writhing on the ground suffocating, and finally uncork it, restoring the air's natural state.  Other times, you would uncork a city, and with your mouth blow downward, causing devastating winds that toppled buildings and sent cars flying.  Always, they would recover and repair the damage at surprisingly remarkable speeds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn truth, how you dealt with the cities depended on how interesting they were to you.  There were certain cities who you messed with less than the others, perhaps because they were more pleasing aesthetically.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the cities that you liked least, you would be an absolute tyrant, eager to mete out your whimsical wrath with a variety of sinister deeds, like an old testament God.  One thing you enjoyed was to take a bottled city in your hands and shake it, causing varying degrees of destruction and havoc.  You would watch through the glass, smiling fiendishly as thousands perished.  Skyscrapers would be ripped off their foundations, sending up clouds of debris, and causing untold casualties.  Other times, when you just wanted to remind a city who was top dog, you would crack open the glass, causing deadly glass shards to rain down.  Then, you would reach your hand inside and target their most sacred buildings: schools, hospitals, nursing homes.  With sadistic glee, you would press your index finger down upon these structures that contained their most vulnerable-- the sick, the elderly, and the innocent. With cruel precision, the specific structures and all who were within them were crunched flat, while the rest of the city witnessed your atrocities in abject horror.  Afterward, you would transport their city into a new bottle in which they could rebuild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou preferred to use the crystal outdoors in remote areas, like a school parking lot after hours or behind some abandoned building.  Not all the cities which you summoned from other worlds ended up with you bottling them. One city which you wanted to keep met its demise in your car's backseat on one hot day.  After shrinking and bottling it, you left it in the backseat of your car to play racquetball with a friend for a couple hours, only to find upon your return that nothing inside was moving anymore and the glass bottle was hot to touch.  The entire population had roasted within their super-heated glass green-house.  Apparently, tiny little people shouldn't be left alone in a hot car, you realized.  Disappointed, you shrank the lifeless glass tomb down even further, to the size of your fingernail, then stepped on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSometimes the crystal would bring you a city that was too similar to one you already had or was just downright boring and trashy.  You had little interest in or regard for these.   For fun, you would shrink such a city to the size of a quarter in front of you.  Then, you'd take a few steps forward until it was located squarely in between your two huge feet.  You delighted in how terrifying your thunderous approach was to them, accompanied by the earth-shaking impact of your mountainous sneakers landing on either side of the city, like enormous white alien spaceships. For a few moments, you would stand over the coin-sized city like a titanic monster.  You delighted in the thought of how petrified the population would be as they saw you looming over them like Godzilla, only bigger, and casting their entire world in shadow.  That there existed a guy like yourself who could squash thousands to millions of intelligent lifeforms, unique in their own way, with one movement of your foot, was no doubt horrifying to each city.  But to you, the thought was exciting.  With an evil smirk, you would lift one of your giant, rubber-soled monoliths and hover it over them, then slowly bring it down, feeling a little crunch underneath.  Sometimes, to your immense amusement, you'd find some of their little skyscrapers pressed into the patterned treads of your sneaker when you took them off hours later.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoutinely you command the cities to offer up a small group of people to be your personal servants (or slaves, really).  Knowing the penalty for refusing would be having their city smashed or stamped on by your feet, they never failed to produce their offerings.  You weren't sure how they decided who would go; surely none of them volunteered.  You assumed their respective governments mandated it in their own way.  Perhaps they sacrificed their weakest.  For all you knew, some might have had a Hunger Games type event where they selected tributes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would force your personal slaves to do whatever devilish desire your fiendish mind could come up with. Sometimes at night you would lean back in your chair and get them to march up and down your penis shaft until you ejaculated, grinning mischievously as clean-up personnel waded through the white, sticky substance containing your spermatozoa.  Sometimes you would aim right into the opening of a bottled city.  You'd look on with boyish glee as entire neighborhoods were consumed by your seminal fluid, no doubt drowning hundreds.  You were unfailingly amused at the dried, yellowish mess that could be seen the next day.  On a long hot day you would pull off your running shoes and command slaves to attend to your sticky feet.  You would watch with satisfaction as tiny little men tunneled between your toes, scouring for lint and toe cheese.  You were amused by the fact that they wore gas masks and haz-mat suits whenever they did this; as though they regarded your feet as some toxic hazard.  You were a very clean guy with good hygiene, always well-washed from head to toe.  But to these infinitesimal mites, everything was magnified. After a long day of activity, even the slightest buildup of sweat or bacteria must have been potent to their tiny senses, you figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow having finished reminiscing, you look toward the center of the room again.  Today you had three of the cities sitting on your desk, lined up.  You had been feeling froggy and felt like doing something with them.  You recline back in your chair, prop your sneakered feet on your desk, criss-crossed at the ankles, in front of the bottled cities, unconcerned with the deafening *THOOMs* heard and felt by the populations within.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the tiny people's skies were overtaken by the appearance of an enormous pair of dirtied white rubber treads, with all sorts of plant matter and detritus on display.  Beyond the outstretched legs sat their tyrannical owner, reclining and pensively thinking about what to do next.  </span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rick's life seemed to be perfect.  He was a young adult getting ready to make his mark in the world.  He had been excelling in his schoolwork as well as his after-school job.  The thriving teenager could hardly contain his excitement to graduate and move out of his parent's house.  That was how he felt two weeks ago, anyway, until the arrival of the giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRick and everyone he knew had become prisoners of a being of unimaginably titanic proportions, who gave them no name.  Upon seeing this being for the first time, his first words were to them were: \"You have a new God.\"  Rick remembered it like it was yesterday.  He woke up from his sleep, anticipating going to school.  However, when he looked out the window, the sky was no longer blue.  Above his neighbor's houses was a pitch black darkness that spanned infinitely upward.  There were no stars, no moon, however.  It was an unnatural darkness and in the distance, what looked like a transparent screen or shield that distorted whatever was in the beyond.  Then, only half-dressed, Rick sank to the floor as the entire house shook violently.  After, he and his family ran outside.  All their neighbors had done the same and were standing in their driveways, confused.  Then Rick heard a cacophony of panicked screams from all directions.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when the sky suddenly flashed a blinding white; after the temporary blindness wore off and their vision adjusted to the brightness, their \"new God\" was seen.  From behind their glass sky was the distorted and enormous visage of what appeared to be a impossibly sized giant male human, possibly the same age as Rick.  The titanic being had an evil smile on his face and was studying them intently, watching  their reactions with fascinated precision.  The entire horizon on all sides, even behind where Rick and his neighbors faced, was surrounded by two titanic hands that were sticking to the the glass barrier.  The hands were so massive in scale that Rick could see the grooved pattern of his fingertips pressing against the class.  From outside their glass prison, the giant male relished his status as an evil god as he picked up his newly bottled city and held it in front of his face for examination, enjoying every second of the terror he knew he was causing within.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the beginning, Rick's kind did not know what to call him because he never cared to give them a name.  People began to uniformly refer to their captor as \"the giant,\" for to them that was what he was and how they assumed he saw himself.   When they saw through their glass prison that other bottled cities were kept within similar habitats to their own, many in the society had speculated that perhaps the giant was an alien, perhaps a young scientist collecting and studying much tinier forms of life.   It was a frightening prospect to be sure.  They wondered that perhaps being a giant, he was indifferent to the interests and desires of the thousands of microbe-like specimens he owned and who looked up to him like a god.  Not seeing them as people, he was unconcerned with their wishes to be free.   That was what they guessed.  But the truth, they soon found out, was much worse: not only did the giant seem to enjoy watching the distress he caused, the giant acted as cruel as possible and terrorized them for fun.  Without any warning, he would cause random acts of mass murder and destruction, sometimes simply by pressing a gargantuan fingertip down on their neighborhoods and snickering evilly from the heavens, echoing throughout.  He had also played other cruel games with them, some of them vile and unspeakable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a week, Rick and his kind were so petrified of the young, giant male that they almost dared not mention him in conversation in dreadful fear that just talking about him might somehow bring him forth, even though he was too large to ever hear them.  At any moment he or anyone he knew could be in the wrong place when the giant came, and be smited by a giant, undiscerning fingertip.   His approach could never be predicted, but it was unmistakeable.  The ground shook rhythmically and a deep *THOOM* *THOOM* *THOOM* *THOOM* was heard and grew louder until his lumbering form appeared in the sky above, always with a wicked smirk.  Each time was terrifying; people screamed and ran indoors, fearing the giant would cruelly toy with them or destroy their entire world, as they had witnessed him do with neighboring bottled cities.  Each time they heard the giant coming, Rick and his kind would huddle and secretly hope the giant would select any city but theirs to examine or torment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir newest development came when the giant picked up their habitat and placed it on the floor, squarely in between his two massive feet.  The male giant wore two well-worn running shoes, mostly white in color with blue patterning scattered throughout, and they spanned the length of a countryside. The synthetic objects were composed of different materials, mostly porous blown rubber and fabric-like mesh.  Just one of the  gargantuan sneakers could smother their entire city, Rick guessed.   Along the crumbling white rubber soles were grass stains and streaks of dirt.  At this scale, Rick could even appreciate tiny divets and creases in the foam siding of the heel, signs of it slowly crushing under the owner's immense weight and impacts over a long period of use. Rick felt smaller than ever - like ant in the grass who made the deadly mistake of crawling too close to some merciless guy's running shoe for the first and last time.  Rick swallowed in fear; he didn't even have to wonder happened to any bug who dare show its face around this merciless and destructive giant. </span></div></div>",

Looking down, you could tell that the populace was starting up at you in fear. \u201cBEHOLD, YOU OWNER IS HERE. ALL WILL BOW DOWN TO ME,\u201d you boomed. Waiting a few minutes for their worship, you continued \u201cI HAVE DECIDED TO SEE IF YOU WHICH OF YOU MICROBES HAS BUILT THE BEST CITY. I WILL VISIT EACH ONE, AND THE GREATEST WILL BE SPARED. THE OTHER TO WILL FIGHT TO THE DEATH. WHEN I COME DOWN THERE, YOU ALL MUST GREET AND OBEY ME.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou took all of the bottles off of your desk and placed them on the floor. Taking the crystal, you only had to just think of being inside the city before you we\u2019re surrounded by a light. When you opened your eyes, you were in the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking around, it seemed like a completely normal place. The streets were clean, stores were open, people carrying on with their lives. From what you could tell you were in a residential part of the city. You began walking around, looking at the different parts of the city. Beyond you could see skyscrapers, and further than that was the glass. Outside of the glass were the other bottles, the other cities you held captive. And, squinting, you could see even further. It was a massive space, but it was clearly your room. In the farthest distance, way, way, way away, you could see your Timberland Boots that you occasionally used when you were doing yard work or hiking. Except these didn\u2019t look like boots that would help you climb up mountains; they were the mountains that you would climb up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked around, you continued to run into the people you were holding as your pets, only in this case they were the same size as you. Everything looked normal. You got a decent 30 minutes of exploring until you ran into a 10 year old boy. First looking at your face, he then glanced down at your sneakers. \u201cYour the giant, right?\u201d He asked. \u201cYes. How are you?\u201d You say, almost instinctively. The boys face turned angry, and then he shouted \u201cI hate you! You killed my family back when you grabbed our neighborhood and shoved it into your sweaty armpit and never returned it! Where are they?\u201d You never wanted to deal with pests like this, but you felt compelled to respond, \u201cLook man, when they went into my armpit, the neighborhood disintegrated. I don\u2019t know where they went. They might be crawling on my floor, might have suffocated in my armpit, might have been crushed by the contact of hitting my pits. Either way, they\u2019re gone.\u201d Then, realizing you didn\u2019t have to put up with him, you added \u201cyou don\u2019t want the same fate, do you little kid? If so, quit fooling around\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe kid ran away, and soon you were surrounded by helicopters. Trying to use the crystal, you realized it wasn\u2019t working. Then you heard loud booms in the distance. You couldn\u2019t tell if it was their military gearing up for a strike or a giant approaching.</span></div></div>",

You squint your eyes as you look past the oily smudges left by your fingertips when you held this city in your hand as a giant, to see something large moving in the distance.  Immediately you feel you feel butterflies in your stomach, realizing what is taking place.  Another \"giant\" is approaching, uninvited and definitely unwelcome by you!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ground begins to quake rhythmically, causing you and many others of the tiny citizens to stagger with your arms out-stretched to maintain balance, the once-blurred figure grows in size as he approaches.  You can make out a huge torso, as you crane your neck back, wearing a polo shirt, and underneath that torso a pair of shorts worn on two long, athletic-looking legs.  Then with shocking speed,  on one side of the glassy wall a massive, long white alien-like object crashes down, followed by another object on the other side of the city, identical in size, weight, and color: two titanic sneakers, containing two huge feet to match.  The impact from the last footstep is powerful enough to cause even parked cars to shift, and even buildings to shift off their foundations, as you hear the unmistakable sound of buildings collapsing and the horrified screaming of your fellow tinies.  The synthetic rubber monstrosities groan deeply as they settle under the owner's immense weight.  The entire bottled city now sits helpless on the floor, at the mercy of yet another giant, who you recognize as your good-natured friend Kyle.  Once a slim, clean-cut guy of slightly above average height, now he was a massive, lumbering giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Huh?\" </b>you hear your gigantic friend thunder overhead ominously.  Kyle then crouches down, causing the dirtied rubber soles of his two giant sneakers to slowly peel off the ground slightly at the heels, causing a sticky, squelching sound.  You look directly overhead into the sky and to the circular hole at the top of the bottle, where a large blue eye hovers over with intense interest.  <b>\"Holy shit...\" </b>, he booms in his normally gentle voice.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Crouched over the glass bottle he found on the floor, Kyle leaned his head closer.  With one eye shut and the other eye hovering directly over the round opening on top, Kyle focused his vision down upon the tiny world within.  Below the clouds contained within the bottle was the most miniature of cities, with skyscrapers no taller than four to five inches in height.  Countless more buildings spread throughout, most no bigger than his fingernail.  Rows of buildings were separated by narrow striations.  Focusing in harder, Kyle witnessed barely perceptible masses crowding these roads, that were composed of hundreds, maybe thousands, of barely perceptible specks.  Their movement was fluid-like, the masses shifting in shape, as different crowds moved in different directions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were people, of course.  Struck with terror by the single giant, blinking eye that gazed down on them from above the clouds, the panicked masses screamed and shoved one another as they scrambled through the streets, as though escaping the eye's gaze would shield them from all harm, although Kyle could not appreciate this.  However, by this point, their entire society had been based on nothing but fear, conditioned by their experiences at the hands of their last titan-sized tormentor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd although the huge male crouching over them was different from their previous tormentor, his size was no less fearsome.  Beyond the glass walls of their imprisoned city were planted his two giant, sneakered feet, spanning for what seemed like miles. The two sneakers groaned deeply from the giant's barely perceptible shifting, as the soles peeled off the floor.   Grass-stained and streaked with dirt, the white rubber siding was creased and diveted from use.  That such objects could be manufactured at all defied all comprehension to these people; so gargantuan were they.  Even with the combined production of every factory known, no amount of raw material even existed to build just one of the synthetic objects worn by this giant being.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis curiosity yet unsated, Kyle extended one finger and with his fingernail, gently tapped on the side of the glass.  He watched with fascination as the swarming masses along the roads quickened in their movements, shifting even more chaotically in response to his actions.  He then leaned his head back from the opening and stooped his head even lower, wishing to see the movements from the \"ground level.\"  Taking his right hand, he gently wrapped his huge fingers around the top of the battle, where it narrowed off, and began to tip the glass bottle toward him at a slight angle.  Although he anticipated that this would cause even greater chaos within, Kyle's attitude at this time resembled more of a scientist, not a sadist, as he was merely studying the behavior of test subjects who even collectively were much less significant than he was.  By contrast, Kyle was a massive giant, and they were far too tiny to be discerned as individual men, women, and children to a being of his size and significance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, the world was turning on its side, literally.  Cars, people, and objects of all kinds were hurling violently into the air, tumbling down once-flat streets that now sloped steeply.  People inside buildings crashed through glass windows and storefronts, sometimes raining down upon others.  Entire buildings toppled over.  Outside the glass barrier, the giant's huge visage watched in intense fascination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle noted how easily disturbed the frail cityscape was, as he tipped it on its side; each and every action was felt within.  Not knowing where his friend was or why the bottle was left on the floor, Kyle believed he could not simply leave it here for anyone to stumble upon.  With that conclusion, he righted the bottle and as he stood up, he gently picked up the glass bottle with both hands prepared to take it home with him.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before your very eyes is an entire city, filled with countless minute people, all with their own individual lives, hopes, dreams. It is an interesting comparison, to be sure. Your hand alone would be enough to snuff out the majority of the populace, a simple press of your palm would be enough to obliterate their skyscrapers. You continue to ponder over the recent turn of events, content to allow your little captives to wallow in their own existental fear for a moment. By right, this city should not exist. The very idea of human beings, no bigger than a millimetre in height, seemingly defies all comprehension. Their bodies should simply cease to function at their size and yet, you watch with fascinated gaze as they scurry about their micro-metropolis, causing little accidents here and there and they desperately seek an escape from your grasp. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe city itself proves an interesting study. It measures roughly 30 cm a side, a fairly square outline with a multitude of little buildings peppered throughout, like upright sprinkles. To think the structures that tower over you in your world are no bigger than half a finger to you in theirs. The mere thought of the absurdity of it spreads a wide smile across your face. As you watch over the tiny city, trying to discern the activities of the micro-inhabitants (no easy task), you realise you hold total dominion over these people. Their lives belong entirely to you, and you have the power to alter their little trinket of a city as you see fit. You're not entirely sure if you want to annihilate them all yet, doing so would end your fun prematurely. On the other hand, the crystal which gleams in the afternoon sun may be able to summon entirely new ones for you to mess with. The thoughts flow around your head, feeding your impulses. For the first time in your life, you were truly able to act however you wished, without fear of negative repercussions or consequence for your image. After all, no one would believe you if you told them. A tiny city, full of bite-sized humans, suddenly appearing on your desk with a magic crystal? You'd make a great application for the local asylum with that tale, no doubt. Instead, you are happy to keep this particular story to yourself, and like any old fairytale, the giant is the dominant oppressor of the little people, a role you fully intend on fulfilling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",
