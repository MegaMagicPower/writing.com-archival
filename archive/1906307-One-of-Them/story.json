One of many dead vehicles outside of Marty's Grocery, the old vehicle was left completely stripped. The hunk of metal framing was his one salvation, blocking unwanted view and concealing his presence from the shambling troupe of rotting corpses between him and a possible meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dead wandered aimlessly, their uncoordinated steps scoffing against cracked asphalt. Their flesh was a deteriorated grey, their past ethnicity masked by time and rot. Soft gasps and groans escaped their forms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"God, I hate these assholes. They weren't here earlier. Are you even sure there is any food left in there?\" David whispered from Andrew's left flank. He was a tall man of Native American heritage. His salvation army jacket stretched to encompass his broad form, the butt of his pistol was made visible at the waist of his ragged blue jeans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can only hope. Last time I was here I had left a few shelves untouched. Didn't have the room in my backpack.\" Andrew replied distantly, the lion share of his attention focused on the movements of shambling horde before them. \"There are only six of them out front.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And probably a fuck ton inside.\" David scoffed, arming himself with his pistol. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Andrew brandished his own firearm, it was a browning 9mm, a sweet piece that he was given on his 17th birthday by his father. It had saved his life more than a few times. Ejecting the clip, Andrew counted the bullets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got seven rounds left. You?\" Andrew said, gently sliding the clip back into its housing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only three. What do you want to do, Andy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew gave the undead another glance before saying, \" The back is already boarded up, so that's a no go.This is a tough sell. One of us can distract them while the other sneaks in. We'd meet back up with the others afterwards. Or, we can try and fight our way in. We use our guns only if things get too hot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid took a moment to reflect on his options. \"What do you think?\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"I hope you've eaten your Wheaties today, Andy.\" David said with a grin, releasing the wooden baseball bat he wore on his back from its leather strap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, that's why I'm here.\" The words were carried with a sigh as Andrew clutched onto a foot of lead blood stained piping he had kept in his back pack. \"Stay close together and watch each other's back. Try to avoid using your gun unless completely necessary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men gave each other a curt nod of understanding before springing from the safety of cover,  Before the undead could acknowledge their presence, David had made the first move of the skirmish. With a powerful over head swing, David brought the brunt of the bat down hard, cracking the weak partially rotted skull of a long past dead teenage girl. Already in mid swing before the girl could collapse onto the floor, David had made contact once again against the skull of a freshly created cadaver of an obese man. Each following blow from the Native American's bat was as precise as it was savage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know I'd of been better at baseball if I could of practiced on Rots.\" David found the time to say in between gasps<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Andrew slid the metal cylinder clear through the eye socket of an advancing Rot as it spasmed violently from the attack. His aim impeccable and his kick forceful enough to send the corpse sliding off his weapon, Andrew prepared for the second Rot, a middle aged man wearing tattered business casual. Merely a foot behind the first creature, the Rot and lunged towards Andrew with surprising speed. Andrew met the undead's charge with a horizontal swing of his blood caked steel rod. The impact made a sickening crack, knocking the monster to the concrete. The creature groaned in protest as it slowly began to lift itself back up. With heavy boots, Andrew proceeded to stomp on the monster's head, feeling the resistance of cranial bone give way, Andrew continued to bring down his foot until grey matter painted the pavement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aah, fuck.\" David snarled as he wrestled with two of the Rots. He kept one at bay, holding out his bat laterally, but the other was at his flank. Andrew knew he couldn't reach that one with his weapon in time. He decided....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span> With one quick fluent motion, Andrew freed his pistol from its holster and leveled the firearm at the direction of Rot proceeding towards David's flank. Andrew put his lungs to work as he drew in a deep breath. Andrew was taught to shoot at an early age and in a world full of walking rotting targets his accuracy proved invaluable. All it took was a twitch of his index finger to make his browning pistol bark. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As the shambling corpse lunged towards David, the creature stopped abruptly. It jolted its head to the side as a mist of ruddy color permeated the area around the bullet's exit wound. The creature fell limp to the pavement a foot short of David's position.  David, no longer boxed in, immediately took the absent space to back pedal and provide some distance between him and the Rot that pursued him.  With a little more room, David poised his bat and awaited the foul smelling corpse of a young man. The transfer of energy from his feet to the striking end of the bat created such a loud and resounding impact against the Rot's skull that it bowled completely, falling to the floor and contorting in wild spasms. It hissed bitterly before David loomed over it, <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry kid, it's either you or me.\"  David punctuated the statement with another blow from his viscera stained bat, He continued to labor strike after strike, raining down lung taxing blows until the creature's head was little more than mush smeared into the street..<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God damn, that was close!\"  David howled jubilantly, a wide smile stretched brazenly across his face. \"You really saved my ass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I know.\" Andrew sighed, his eyes quickly darting back and forth, surveying the area.  \"How many do you think heard that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Fuck if I know.\" David lamented. \"Maybe only a few? Or maybe a parade's worth. You never know how many are going to show up for the dinner bell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"Well, we've came to far to leave now, right?.\"  Andrew reasoned   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I know all to well how sneaky those fuckers can be. If we both go in together, it'll be easier to watch each other's back, but if we don't have a watch those assholes can swarm of us without warning. I for one would rather make sure the Rots don't surround us.</span></div></div>",

The thinking of having two hands on the task assured them they could be in and out in a hurry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for them, it was not to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't so bad at first. The rotting limbs of the dead don't allow them to sprint. Not like the movies, so they were never going to be on the scene particularly fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew and David busted down the glass door, nearly breaking it in the process, and entered the market. Predictably, many of the supplies inside were either expired and no good or completely gone. However, there were some diamonds in the rough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew skimmed down the stores aisles, picking up a few cans and some cereal boxes which were somehow still containing edible cereal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid raided the front end, checking cash registers, offices, and anything out of the way, hoping that it would've averted the eyes of looters who would have been in a similar predicament as himself and Andrew. While he found plenty of money, he was not as successful as his comrade, and only came away with a small selection of utility trinkets, including a monkey wrench, a hammer, box cutter and a bottle of water, somehow untouched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the dead would wait no longer. The duo had made a lot of noise, between Andrew's gun and kicking down the door as they did. Unfortunately, they never bothered to seal the door particularly tight, which allowed the dead to enter seamlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConveniently for David, his eyes were on the door before the dead came in. Just a couple rotters at first, so he was able to crouch behind a conveyer belt, hidden from view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew, on the other hand, was totally out in the open, scavenging in the middle of an aisle. The dead noticed him immediately. At first, there were just a couple, but there were definitely more. Based on the background noise, consisting of grunts, groans, growls and other inhumane sounds, there had to be a least a dozen, if not more. Andrew didn't have the rounds to kill them all. To make matters worse, the back door was thoroughly barricaded; no chance there'd be enough time to free it to allow them to escape that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndrew, pistol drawn, stared down the zombies pouring into the market, somewhat afraid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Andrew do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was alone, so that wouldn't justify wasting a bullet and further risking attracting more. However, this one wasn't alone. It was joined by a second, and eventually a third zombie, which gradually noticed Andrew, unhidden, and began to stumble towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Dave, we really should get going now! They're starting to show up!\" Andrew called out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"J-just a sec!\" David replied, seeming frustrated</span></div></div>",

Those are the rules.\" Andrew whispered, a wry grin stretched across his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" David groaned, defeated. \"If I die, Andy, I want you to know you're an asshole.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Noted.\" Andrew nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n David arose from his crouched vantage and ran across the parking lot, screaming aloud \"Hey, dead head douche bags! I'm delicious and nutritious!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The dead immediately spurned into action, their haggard broken forms twisted, their gasps heightened by wanton desire. Shuffling at a frenzied gait, they proceeded after David, leaving a open gap between Andrew and the store. Still in a crouch, Andrew quieted his breathing and made his way to the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The inside of Marty's Grocery swept in shadow. Small pillars of light beamed out between the cracks of boarded up windows revealing the dust in the air. Andrew had a good idea about the lay out of the store since the last time he had been there, but there was no way he was going to rely on memory alone. Unzipping his back pack, Andrew retrieved his flash light and made his way deeper into Marty's Grocery. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Flanked by empty shelves, Andrew slowed his approach as the silhouette of a lump on the floor stood between him and progress.</span></div></div>",

A putrid brown visage of rotted skin loosely sagged, as if the creature wore a slackened mask of human flesh. Its eyes were pale and dusty, all color in its iris robbed away by time. It bore a twisted gate of malformed black teeth that looked wickedly jagged. Tattered garment  encompassed the monster's withered form. A response triggered solely on reflex, Andrew's hand fell to his weapon. With a solitary frenzied bludgeon from his pipe, the creature fell limp before it could recognize Andrew's presence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With a heavy exhale, Andrew moved forward.</span></div></div>",

The lump on the floor stirred into motion as Andrew passed. A flash of pain struck the back of Andrew's shin as he felt tight pressure grip onto him. Andrew attempted to pivot in hopes to turn his light on what had grabbed, but he had lost his footing and was tugged to the floor.  His flash light slipped out of his hands, falling a few feet away onto the tiled floor, spinning to illuminating the cadaverous sunken eyed former employee that had grabbed him by the shin.  Andrew kicked at creature's head with his free leg, attempting to free himself, but to no avail. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get the fuck off me.\" Andrew sputtered, as the creature crawled over his body. Its flesh was cold and clammy. Grasping onto his browning, Andrew leveled the pistol at the Rot's head and pulled the trigger. A muzzles flash and bark summoned a litany movement and dull groans that emanated all through out the store. The bullet ripped open a ragged hole in the monster's face, but that did little to slow its advance. The monster revealed a rotted smile before hiding its teeth and inch deep into Andrew's stomach. Again, Andrew fired his pistol, but the shadows all around Andrew now stirred, encompassing him, and soon, consuming him.</span></div></div>",
