He rubs his eyes, wipes his blond hair out of his face. Shurely he had a bit to much drinks the other evening. The last evening... He couldn't remember anything after leaving the dorm for the party.<br>\r\n\"Great\", he thinks \"a blackout.\"<br>\r\nAs he trys to get up he feels an something awful in his stomach. He HAD to much drinks the last evening. But wait! This wasn't his room! Where was he? Jake tried to look around.<br>\r\nHe was lying on a large white field, but what was ist? Jake touched the material. It was some kind of textile. But is was large! The whole thing must have been about 90 yards long he estimated. He tried to find some other object that might tell him where he was. To his right the white field opend to a greater area, which suddenly became very similar to him.<br>\r\nThere was his computerdesk, his cupboard, this was his room. And the field in which he lay was his bed. But it couldn't be. It was... LARGE!<br>\r\nHow could his room and the whole world around him have gotten greater from one day to another? Then he understood: He must have had shrunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut how? That wasn't possible. How should he have been able to change his size in that great dimension during one night, not noticing anything about it?<br>\r\nIt was strange. But it wouldn't help if he stayed in bed and trying to figure out how he had come into this situation. He had to do something. He needed help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCareful he aproached the edge of his bed, which to his advantage wasn't more than a mattress that had been smashed into the corner of his room. So he wouldn't have the problem finding a way down. But still for him the floor was about 13 feet lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake took the risk and trys to climb down the mattress. He gets the feeling beeing able to gain hold on the soft cotton wall, only now recognizing, that he is completly naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the visites to the fitness center had paid. It only took him a few seconds to reach the ground. And now? He checked the area. Here was a bit a trash lying, a stack of CDs, some dirty clothes, but nothing what could help him in his situation. Jake started thinking about where he could have put his mobile phone. Why shouldn't he phone a friend of his? But no sign of the mobile. It probably lay somewhere on the computerdesk. For the moment it whould be the better choice to investigate the door, he thinks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut after getting closer to the door Jake realizes, that this wouldn't be his way either. The door was closed, possibly locked and although he was now small, Jake wasn't that small, that he could squeeze himself under it. While continuing thinking about a solution for his problem something else disturbes his thaugts: Stomps. Steps? Thomeone was in the hallway behind the door. Jake tries to concentrate more on the sound when suddenly another sound appears: knocking. The person must have reached the door to Jake's room and was now knocking. Afer a few seconds the knocking repeated. Them again something strange happend: Jake heard how a key was shifted into the lock of his door, turned round and opened the door. Jake steps back as the great wooden board aproaches him. The hallway on the otherside is dark as allways. Jake notices a giant figure directly infront of him. So there wasn't not much light he only is able to see a shape, but it seemed to be definenetly human. Obviously the person didn't take any notice of Jake and entered the room. This was his chance: He now could leave his room and enter the hallway. But what about that person? Wasn't this anyone he could ask for help?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich choice should he take?</span></div></div>",

No one could say what could have happend if he had stayed in the near of the stranger. But now new problems started to appeare:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now. Jake was 2 inch tall, not much bigger than a bug and could be easily be crushed or worse. He would have to search someone for help. He notices that the door to the left and the door to the right of his room weren't closed proberly. He could easily make it in. But it still was quite risky because he didn't knew much about his two neigbours. The only thing he could say was, that the room to the right beloned to a guy named Owen. The room to the left was a two-bed-room occupied by two girls, named Rachel and Ivy. While woundering about the options he had, Jake notices a bag which had been dumped in the hallway. It was the bag of the paperboy. He didn't even knew, that a paperboy was distributing the newspaper to the dorm, or maybe a student was the paperboy? Anyway, it got time for another decision.</span></div></div>",

Jake makes you way through the maze of candy bar wrappers and you see a gigantic mattress. There seems to be something on the mattress and he thinks it might be Owen. Jake thinks for a bit, and comes to the conclusion that if he gets to Owen and wakes him up somehow, then Owen can get him to proper medical authorities. <br>\r\nJake begins to climb the sheet to the top of the mattress, after about 5 minutes he made it to the top only to discover that what you thought was Owen was really just a couple of pillows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Jake heard huge booms coming from the hall. They seemed to stop at the door. Jake heard what sounded like keys in a lock, and the door opened. <br>\r\nThere stood Owen. Jake had not seen Owen for a few months and almost didn't recognize him. He had defenitely put on his 'Freshman 15', or in Owen's case the Freshamn 25. Owen entered the room, stretched and yawned. He pulled off his tight t-shirt revealing his little boobs and big jiggly belly that stuck out about 4 inches and slouched a bit over his shorts. He then walked over to the mattress, which felt like a an earthquake to Jake. <br>\r\nJake began to run to the other side of the bed, because he was sure that Owen was going to collapse onto the bed. He was running frantically, but it was too late, Owen had already leaned forward onto the mattress. Jake ducked for cover but the force of Owen's weight was too much and Jake flew up and accross the mattress.<br>\r\nJake opened his eyes slowly. He was on his stomach, and he rolled over onto his back.<br>\r\nHe started to remember where he was, he then turned on his side and saw a huge peach colored, convex like wall with a large hole in the center.<br>\r\nThen the wall started to inflate and deflate, that's when Jake knew that this was Owen's belly.<br>\r\nWhile Jake was thinking about how to get Owen's attention, Owen decided to get more comfortable and began to roll over. <br>\r\nJake ducked for cover, but Owen's belly was moving too fast and covered up Jake.<br>\r\nEverything was pitch black. Jake could hardly breath. He knew that above him was over 200 lbs of blubber that was pressing down even harder.<br>\r\n\"Atleast he didn't have rock hard abs\" Jason thought to himself, trying to get free.<br>\r\nHe was crawling along, with the softness of Owen's belly rubbing along his back. He eventually came to what seemed to be Owen's belly button. Jake could stand all the way up in it. He stretched, took a breather, and thought about what to do next.</span></div></div>",

He reached over to his nightstand and grabbed a pack of Marlboros, and placed one in his mouth.  Jake looked up over the hairy, flabby belly and saw Owen light up the cigarette.  Owen exhaled a stream of smoke in the air and watched the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake decided the best way to get Owen's attention was to climb his belly and get a little closer to his face.  Jake began his ascent up the hairy belly.</span></div></div>",

Yes, yes it's me, I've shrunk, you have to help me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwen looked at the tiny man on his huge belly.  He could feel himself getting rock hard.  Owen had always wanted to be a giant - so much that he'd purposefully put on 25 lbs and was only hooking up with very small girls.  As he looked down at Jake, he knew he would've preferred a woman on his belly, but the tiny man would do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owen, can you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jake, listen.  I'm going to help you.  But how?  Call the police?  What will they do, take you to the local lab and let them run experiments on you?  That doesn't sound good, bro...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake thought about it.  Owen was probably right.  He started to get a little scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what can I do, Owen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you hang tight with me tonight, and we'll figure something out tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwen took a final drag on his cigarette and stubbed it out, exhaling a giant cloud of smoke down on Jake.  Jake coughed, but dared not comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, okay...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake turned around, and now saw Owen's giant erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, Owen, should I set in the floor or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He slid down the belly, and into Owen's huge fluffy mound of pubes, which were waist high to him.  He walked up to the base of the huge dick - realizing, now, he was probably around two inches tall.  Owen's cock was probably about ten inches hard, five times Jake's size, and appeared to be almost 30 feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake turned around and saw Owen was rubbing his massive, hairy belly, and could see smoke drifting up into the air.  Jake reached out and placed a hand on the massive member.  It felt just like imagined it would, similar to his own, but much, much bigger.  Jake got closer, and tried to wrap his arms around the huge penis.  He couldn't reach his arms completely around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lemme give you a hand, Jake.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwen reached down and wrapped his giant hand around his cock, engulfing Jake.  Owen began to grind the little man hard against his massive erection.  He only went about thirty seconds before blowing his load - which was about ten more seconds than Jake lasted.  Owen released Jake, and Jake stumbled back into the pubes, falling into a huge puddle of Owen's cum.  Owen reached down, and placing a finger on Jake's tiny body, he rolled him around in the semen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOwen lifted Jake's cum-soaked body out of his pubes and dropped him on his belly.  Jake looked across the giant belly and up between Owen's man breasts.  Owen lit another cigarette and blew smoke down on Jake's tiny body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You began to rub yourself on his shaft as you licked all over it and hugged it. You him as you realise he began to cum in his briefs as he moans in pleasure.

You started to slip to the cockhead as he came all in his mouth and over you. You fell into his mouth. You ate up all the cum you could as he also swallowed some cum. He moved you to the side of his mouth as he ate it all. Then you walked over his tongue as he tasted all over you. \u201cSo that\u2019s what humans taste like!
