You rush towards Caribou and send him flying with a punch to his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Awesome.\"</span> you say as he lands several yards away from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbrown\">\"What the --?!\"</span> Caribou asks with shock as he recovers, barely having enough time to stand before being floored again by an axe kick to the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"Too slow.\"</span> you remark as you flip away to avoid a large scythe that had appeared from his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he picks himself up from the ground, he asks, <span class=\"cbrown\">\"Who the hell are you?!\"</span> You can tell that he's getting really angry, but also sense a note of fear in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"My name is of no concern to you.\"</span> You reply. <span class=\"cblue\">\"I guess now would be a good time to try out one of my new powers.\"</span> you think to yourself, remembering that there could be almost anything in Caribou's hidden arsenal. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Change...\"</span> you begin as energy starts to accumulate around your arm. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Giant Hammer!\"</span> you finish as the energy first forms a sphere in the palm of your hand before taking the shape of an extremely large hammer, which then materializes and falls into your open hands. <span class=\"cblue\">\"This is so awesome!\"</span> you shout with excitement. Seeing you momentarily distracted, Caribou tries to flee. <span class=\"cblue\">\"NO YOU DON'T!\"</span> you holler bringing the Haki infused hammer down on his head causing him to go unconscious and some of his loot to burst from his swamp-like body. Realizing that you wouldn't be able to collect the bounty on his head to pay off Nami to let you in to the crew (even if Luffy wants you to join, they'll still be a little suspicious of you) if he escapes, you decide to try materializing some sea-stone handcuffs. \"Let's give this a try. Change...\" the hammer starts to fade back into the energy that you had created it from and swirl around your arm again. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Sea-stone handcuffs!\"</span> The energy forms back into a ball, then forms a pair of handcuffs and a matching key. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Okay, I can create handcuffs, but are they sea-stone?\"</span> you wonder to yourself, feeling a little more drained than when you had created the hammer. Not wanting to risk the possibility of Caribou escaping from the cuffs because they aren't sea-stone, you decide to try them on yourself. Opening one of the cuffs, you place it on your wrist and close it. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Since the hammer disappeared when I made these I think that I should test it with my other power.\"</span> Focusing your thoughts you try activating the multi-multi fruit. <span class=\"cblue\">\"Multi Multi Duet!\"</span> You wait for about to minutes thinking that the fruit might have a delayed reaction before exclaiming <span class=\"cblue\">\"YES! I can create sea-stone objects!\"</span> You quickly un-cuff yourself, then lock up Caribou.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do now?</span></div></div>",

There wasn't a whole lot that interested you, mostly just swords and the odd gun here or there, but as you were preparing to haul off your offering to the Strawhats, you spotted something out of the corner of your eye that drew your attention like a moth to flame. Lying there was a large great-sword. A little bit of sand covered the hilt, but you could see that it was beautifully made. You walked over and went to pick it up, but the moment your hand wrapped around the hilt you felt a light pulse, almost like a heart beat, that quickly faded. Perplexed, you wondered what that was for minute before shrugging it off. As you picked the sword up you remembered that great-swords were supposed to be really heavy, but this one felt rather light. Figuring that it probably is just your new found strength in this world, you swing the sword a few times to get a feel for its weight. As you look over the beautiful blade, you realize that there will be times in this world when you will not be able to use your powers without great risk to yourself or those around you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! Did you get rid off that guy that popped out of the barrel?\" a mermaid asked popping up out of the water. This startled you enough that you quickly turned and pointed the sword at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that it was one of the mermaids that you had saved, you spun the sword and set it on your back before answering. \"Sorry about that, you just scared me. Yeah, I knocked him out. He's unconscious and cuffed over there on the ground.\" You point at Caribou's body a short distance away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't mean to scare you and thanks for saving us.\" she responds, smiling as her friends appear at the surface of the water. \"I wish I knew your name and that there was someway we could repay you.\" she adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, there are a few things you could help me with.\" you answer, rubbing your head in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really!?\" they ask in surprise. \"What are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First, is there somewhere I keep this guy until I leave?\" you ask picking up Caribou's unconscious body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we could talk with Madam Sharley about holding him at the Cafe, but I don't know if she'll be okay with it.\" one of the mermaids answers after some deliberation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks. Second, do you know where the Strawhats are at on the island?\" you ask. \"Or at least Luffy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I think he was at the Cafe himself. One of his crew was unconscious and the New Fishman Pirates and princes were looking for them.\" the first mermaid answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, thanks.\" you say as you start to walk off in a random direction. Remembering that you don't know your way around the island you turn back and ask, \"Could you girls do one more thing for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't tell me,\" another mermaid says, \"you don't know the way to the Mermaid Cafe and would like us to take you there, right?\" You hang your head in shame and slowly nod. This causes all of the mermaids to laugh for a bit. \"Sorry,\" the same mermaid says as she wipes a tear from her eye, \"of course we'll show you the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mermaids begin diving under water when you stop one. \"Uh, I can't swim.\" you say loud enough for her to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" she asks stunned. \"I can teach you real quick if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis thought enters your mind and you unconsciously start to drool before snapping out of it. \"It's not that I don't know how to swim...\" you start answering, when she gets the drift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. You have the powers from a cursed fruit, don't you?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I have the powers from two of them.\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, hold on, I'll go see if one of the others has some bubbly coral with them.\" she says diving into the water to catch up with the other mermaids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go. This should help.\" one of the mermaids says as she creates a bubble large enough for you to sit inside. As you step into the bubble you grab a rope that you had tied around the bubble that you put Caribou in and ask, \"Okay, now how is this going to work exactly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll just pull you along until we reach the Cafe.\" a mermaid says. \"But we would really like to get your name so that we can properly introduce you to Madam Sharley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh right.\" you remember. \"Sorry, let me introduce myself. My name is...\"</span></div></div>",

You start drooling again when you feel that weird, heart beat-like, pulse snapping you out of your daze.

Realizing that the bubble is the only thing keeping him safe he calms down and starts plotting his escape. <span class=\"cbrown\">'Once I'm on land I'll change into my element form, kidnap a few mermaids, and escape.'</span> He then realizes how weak he feels and looks at the cuffs on his wrists. <span class=\"cbrown\">\"These are sea-stone aren't they?!\"</span> he screams and starts thrashing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"SHUT UP!\"</span> you yell, activating your conquerer's haki and yanking on the rope to his bubble.

I will not stay in a bed where those two can get to me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing that those are two of the Strawhat crew?\" you ask one of the mermaids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" she answers. \"Chopper-san has been having some trouble keeping Sanji-kun in bed. Apparently, he is having some problems with blood-loss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah. I see.\" you respond. \"Could you watch this for me real quick?\" you then ask, indicating Caribou as you put him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... sure, but what if he wakes up?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, he can't do anything but run around while those cuffs are on his wrists and I have the only key.\" you answer proudly as you flip the key like it was a coin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" she responds feeling less worried about her temporary job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk down the hall to the door where the noise is coming from. You open the door and find yourself looking at the back of Sanji's head. 'Perfect' you think and quickly deal a blow to the back of his head that would knock even Luffy unconscious. Sanji falls to the floor and starts dreaming about something. Almost as soon as Sanji hit the floor, Chopper was at your throat in his horn point form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you and why did you just attack Sanji?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can call me Double Devil Fruit Drake or just Drake if you would rather.\" you answer moving Chopper's horn's away from you neck. \"And to answer your second question, Doctor Chopper, I hit Sanji in order to knock him out so that you could put him back in his bed.\" you add knowing what Chopper does when complimented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That doesn't make me happy, you idiot.\" Chopper responds as he does his happy dance. This continues for a minute or two before he calms down and carries Sanji over to one of the beds. \"Thank you for your help Drake, but you should never harm someone suffering from the amount of blood loss that Sanji has. I have no clue why he's acting like this though.\" he adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I may be able to clear up the confusion there. It's those two.\" you say pointing to Chopper's 'nurses'. \"I think that Sanji spent the two years that you were seperated on an island full of people like them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would explain why he only acts like that when they talk to him.\" Chopper comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" you agree as you begin to walk out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Drake!\" Chopper calls after you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\" you ask turning around. \"Do you need something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a few questions that I want you to answer.\" he says. \"First and foremost, why do you call yourself Double Devil Fruit Drake when everybody knows that one person can't have two Devil's Fruit powers?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that is not necessarily true, Chopper. I am one of two people in this world capable of eating two Devil's fruits and surviving. The other person is the man that captured 'Fire Fist' Ace. He goes by the name Marshall D. 'Blackbeard' Teach.\" you answer. \"Come, walk with me.\" you say walking back to where you had left the mermaid and Caribou. Chopper tells his 'nurses' to watch Sanji until he gets back and runs down the hall after you. When you get back to the mermaid you find that Caribou is still relatively out cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know him!\" Chopper yells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured as much. I caught him about to kidnap some mermaids and I think that, had he succeeded, you and your crew would have been blamed.\" you tell him, much to his surprise. You pick Caribou up, sling him over your shoulder, and continue your walk toward Madam Sharley's room. \"You said you had a few questions Chopper. Go ahead and ask, I don't mind.\" you say to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right! I forgot about the other questions that I had.\" he says embarrassed. \"What brings you to Fishman Island and where's the rest your crew?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll answer those in reverse order. I have no crew to say but one of my powers allows me to make as many duplicates of myself as I want, so you could say I'm a crew of one.\" you reply smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. You mean like my friend Robin's power?\" Chopper asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sort of, but my power isn't limited to just body parts.\" you respond. \"Or for that matter just me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!?!\" he shouts, shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I can create duplicates of a weapon that I'm currently using or even other people.\" you say. \"And as for your other question, I came here to hopefully join the crew of the Strawhat pirates.\" you add smiling. \"In fact I was planning on using this guy's bounty to bribe Nami.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wanted to join our crew?\" Chopper asks astonished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. I'm a big fan of the Strawhat crew.\" you reply. \"Any other questions?\" you then ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one. You say that one of your powers allows you to duplicate yourself and anything and anyone you wish, but what is the other one?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, first, your assumption isn't entirely correct. I can only duplicate someone else if they are okay with it.\" you begin. \"Second, my other power allows me to quickly swap the weapon that I am currently using for another one. I can also create an object out of pure energy, for example, the sea-stone hand cuffs that Caribou is wearing, though it took a lot of energy to create those.\" you finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drake-san, Chopper-san, we're here.\" the mermaid says to you as you reach a rather large door.</span></div></div>",
