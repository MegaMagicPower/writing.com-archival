I reach up to touch my face and it isn't there. My heart begins to race and I try to touch my chest to feel it, but my torso is also missing. I start to become frantic, I want to run, scream, call for my mom, for my sister Olivia, for Joey...Joey, I had almost forgotten about him, I wonder if he's alright. What happened to him? What did the shadow do to him? I thought that the shadow had killed him. The shadow has never left anyone alive before, but why not kill Joey. I ponder all the questions running through my mind, but a voice breaks my thoughts, \"Hello Damon...It's been such a long time.\" The devils voice again. I knew this wasn't good, I'm in a pitch black place with no body, that could only mean one thing, I'm dead. \"No, not dead Damon, guess again.\" He chuckles. I'm utterly confused, if I'm not dead then why don't I have a body? \"Don't you remember Damon my boy?\" Remember what? I know my past with this foul creature, how could I forget any of that. It has haunted me for months. Every night sleep is impossible, but I never miss it, the nightmares are worst than the vivid memories. \"Hahaha, so you have forgotten, but that's not quite a surprise, it was traumatic.\" What was traumatic, having to deal with the torment the devil caused me, not being able to tell anyone about it, what else was more traumatic than that? \"The death of your father.\" My father, I know he died, but I don't remember how... \"Let me refresh your memory.\"   </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Blackness took over my vision and I suddenly knew what it would mean to not exist. I couldn't feel. I couldn't hear. I couldn't see. I couldn't smell. I couldn't taste. There was nothing. The only thing that proved I still existed were my thoughts. But I soon lost those as the devil forced controll of my senses to recreate the setting of my father's death.<br>\r\nMy pupils had shrunked completely and my eyes had appeared black. Sunlight pierced the black hole that was my eye and I would've screamed out in pain if I could, but the devil still had controll. I was just a pawn. Once my eyes adjusted, they focused on a small park. Bright colors seemed to sing out to the bright, blue, cloudless sky. Out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw the shadow crossing the street, but it was just a man wearing all black. I found myself running toward him as the devil wished me to follow the story this man would be in. I walked in his shadow and I glanced up at his hair. We'd reached the end of the street and he turned slightly enough to where I could see his face. I inhaled sharply. He looked exactly like me.<br>\r\nThe look alike crossed the street and I followed him on my own now. The devil laughed as he knew he'd captured my curiosity. I'd meant not to give in to him, but, as always, he found my weakness.</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">NOTE: THIS IS RATED E. PLEASE KEEP IT THAT WAY. (Though I understand that cursing is sometimes necessary. Use dashes (d---) if you must.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubject: The angel of death, but he's not mean, he's a kid who had the job forced on him. He's quite nice actually. But not nice to the point of seeming gay. I'd guess he's about 13. I've writen about this before so I might be picky about his character. I started a novel when I was younger so its really immature writing, but I redid the intro. I'll put that in. Though the rest of it seems out of place. I'm going to use this as a brainstorming activity and the storyline is open. If something about the intro confuses you, just make something up that will make sense cause I have some explanation, but its not all that great. Like I said, I was younger when I wrote this. LET YOUR CREATIVE JUICES FLOW!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnder my bed, in this claustrophobic space, I writhed in pain. In the darkness, my eyes saw things that weren\u2019t there: shadows, flames, death. I saw the death, and felt it as though it were my own. I tried to close my eyes to the images, but they were in my head: My sister\u2019s face, Joey\u2019s face, my mom\u2019s face, some other man I didn\u2019t recognize, but he had hair as black as the shadows crawling beneath my bed. One of the shadows appeared to reach for me. I stifled a scream and crept closer and closer to the wall. As soon the shadow retreated an inch, I jumped out from under my bed and glanced at the clock, 1 A.M. My body involuntarily arched as a convulsion ran up my spine. I felt a scream building up in my throat. <br>\r\nI acted quickly, grabbing a jacket, the house keys and my sneakers. I closed the door behind me and locked up to keep my mom and sister safe, but I knew I would need more than a lock to keep this away. I put on my shoes and jacket and started walking. I knew my way around this town in the dark from many similar trips. <br>\r\nI glanced up at the sky, there was no moon. I looked uneasily at the street lamps, my only source of light, begging them not to go out, though I\u2019d never seen a street lamp that was off, unless it was broken. The only sound around me was the fall wind and my sneakers crunching the leaves under my feet. I kept my head down and my hands in the pockets of my jeans. My steps faltered as one of my shadows disappeared. I turned around and saw the street lamp off...and not broken. I turned as if to keep walking down the path I was on, but I couldn\u2019t look away from that street lamp. I kept turning back and forth; path, lamp, path, lamp. I was looking at the path when another shadow disappeared. My heart rate accelerated as I began to realize this wasn\u2019t a coincidence. More shadows disappeared as I ran by each street lamp. Flames jumped into my vision as if commanding me on which way to turn. I knew there was no running from this and he did too.<br>\r\nI heard a soft chuckle drifting over my shoulder as if it was afloat in the wind. Darkness passed over my eyes as a cloud over the sun. \u201cDid you miss me?\u201d It asked, the devil's voice was full of malice and the need to torment me again. I looked around and realized I was on Joey\u2019s street. This wasn\u2019t a problem until Joey\u2019s front door opened. I staggered back shocked. There was nothing I could do. How do you hold back a shadow? So I opened my mouth to scream, but nothing came out. I felt it on my lips, \u201cJoey. Joey, run! Run, get inside!\u201d The shadow kept laughing and circled around me, clearly enjoying my pain. I saw the shadow pass over Joey\u2019s face and saw his eyes widen in shock and fear. I couldn\u2019t move. My feet were rooted to the ground as I urged my muscles to run to him. For the first time, I saw part of the shadow clearly, his hand. I saw his palm go to Joey\u2019s ear, but it continued through his head swiftly and the shadow vanished. His purpose fulfilled. <br>\r\nAs if I were in a dream I was running but my movements were sluggish. As I looked beside me my surroundings weren\u2019t changing. I wasn\u2019t going anywhere. It seemed to take eternity, but I finally made it to Joey. I called his name but he was unconscious, but alive. Then everything went black...<br>\r\n[DOT DOT DOT] (dramtic XD)</td>",
