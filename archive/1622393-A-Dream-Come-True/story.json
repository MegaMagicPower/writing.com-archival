Suddenly you felt a strange tingling sensation throughout your body and you looked down at yourself to see an amazing sight. You shrank several inches in height, your jeans morphed into a short red &amp; white skirt, your grubby sneakers changed into a pair of white girl's sneakers, your socks turned into girl's socks and your t-shirt morphed into a tight fitting top that matched your skirt. Even more amazing were the changes to your body, your feet became much smaller, your legs became smooth and very shapely, your hips grew outwards...becoming extremely curvy, and your ass filled out considerably as you felt a distinct 'sucking' sensation in your crotch. And as you held your now manicured hands out in front of you...you felt...and saw two mounds of flesh grow from your chest, filling out your top. The final change was your head, your features became feminine and your hair grew long, turned black and shifted itself up into a ponytail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus Christ!!!\" you said, as you reached up to feel your new breasts and your toned stomach, and after another few seconds you slipped a hand into your skirt and probed the distinct outline of a vagina through your panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing across the street at the girl you saw that she now looked exactly like you, right down to the t-shirt, jeans and sneakers she now wore. Yet she continued on her way as though nothing was wrong, as if...she had always looked like an 18-year old guy. \"Wow!\" you muttered to yourself in your new sing song voice. Your new body couldn't have been much over 16 years old, and was extremely feminine, even sexy! You couldn't believe what had happened, your new power was indeed real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the teenage 'girl' disappeared around the corner of the street, you looked around, wondering what you should do next, it was quite a decision.....</span></div></div>",

What's up, girl?\" Jason asks as he lets you in. You're a little weirded out that he didn't have any sort of strange reaction, but you let it go. Apparently your shifting does something to reality to adjust for the changes, and you silently thank your parents for giving you a name which can easily be turned into a girls' name. As you walk into the living room of his house, you are greeted by his little sister Shania and his mother, who both go back to respectively My Little Pony and a romance novel. They too appear to have no reaction to your new form, strange as it all appears to you it seems perfectly normal to them. This requires looking into at a later time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou plop down onto Jason's bed, and kick off the sneakers you are wearing underneath the cheerleader uniform. He tosses you a Mountain Dew and you deftly catch it before opening it and taking a swig. \"So, what brings you here all of a sudden?\", he asks, \"Yesterday you mentioned having to buy some new shoes, you done with that yet?\". Slightly confused, you think back and remember both not saying that and saying it. Perhaps this shifting thing also adapted reality in other ways, to help you fit into the new role better? Thinking quickly you reply \"No, not really. Thought I'd pop by here first, see what's up with you\". And before you can catch yourself, you say \"You know, maybe you could come along when I go buy shoes. I don't know the town all that well yet and I could use the company\". Blushing furiously, you feel like sinking into the ground but Jason appears not to notice, and instead puts on some cargo shorts and sneakers and gets up. \"Alright, I'm game. Let's go!\" he says, before walking out of the door, quickly followed by you.</span></div></div>",

You grabbed a bag from the counter and placed it in the middle of the restaurant. \"Okay, everyone, give me all the money you have and place it into that bag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, everyone started fumbling through their wallets and purses, taking out any cash they had on you and placing it in the bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" you said to them.

The fact everyone in the restaurant was under your command without question was exciting. The possibilities were near infinite! The best part was the fact you did it seamlessly as well. Literally, whatever you imagined them doing, they did. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou thought hard and returned everyone back to their blank states. The entire place went so silent you could hear a pin drop. You decided to bring some normalcy back to the restaurant, keyword being SOME. The workers went back to making food, and people started to purchase more food, or even repeat their order. In just a few moments, the place was bustling again despite the only lights on were from the displays and whatever sunlight came in through the closed shades. It did almost look like everyone went back to normal, but of course, your mind control made people do some strange things. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne older woman in business attire picked up her chicken wrap meal from the counter and was ready to eat. She stopped however when she saw the entire thing. She was a bit frustrated and went up to the clerk at the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me sir, I asked for semen on my chicken wrap!\" She said scolding the worker. \"Fix this or give me a refund!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worker was a large sweating man barely fitting into his uniform, not attractive in the least bit. He complied with her command and immediately dropped his pants and grabbed the chicken wrap. It took him a few moments of furiously beating his cock but eventually he ejaculated right on her food. He made sure to get as much semen as he could all over it before returning it to her. She gave a polite smile and bit down into the food, enjoying it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked back to a small kid's area and found 3 grown men playing with dolls. They giggled and compared the toys they believed to come from the kid's meals they ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh! This one has purple hair!\" One of the men squealed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Share Becky! I wanna play with it!\" Another one whined. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey started to fight in the small corner and caused a lot of commotion, yet no one stopped them .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearby there seemed to be teenage girl fixated on rubbing her ass against things. Her tight leggings showcased a very plump butt, which she smushed against any surface she could. Eventually she found her way to the table of a family enjoying food together. Like it was okay, she rubbed her butt on the father of the family. He did the best he could to keep eating and not a single person in the family acknowledged the stranger<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This story was based on a dream I actually just had not 5 minutes ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, it's based on that dream. I changed things around a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour name is James Wakefield. You're an 18 year old Caucasian male. You just moved to a new town to start a new life; you'll be going to the local community college there as well in a month.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou recently had a dream where a voice said you can not only shapeshift just by snapping your fingers, but you can mind control and hop between alternate universes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you shapeshift, the person you shapeshift into, regardless of location, turns into you, clothes and all. They always assume they've looked like that, and will continue on their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can not swap others, or shapeshift others. You're the only one that can shapeshift.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, I know some of you are going \"BUT I LIKE TO SWAP OTHERS\" and I understand that. Which is why I'm taking a new approach at the always loved idea of swapping others. You can mind control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can do things as simple as having your college teacher give you an A on the test you purposely failed, to more amusing things like having a high school football player act as if he was a 6 year old girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo mind control, you just snap your fingers and results will occur; they will stay in that state of mind until you change them back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, for the fun part; alternate universes. You have your universe you're in right now, but you can jump into anything; tv shows, movies, magazines, comic books, the works. As long as whatever you jump in has a story, you're fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, when you hop into another universe, you have to know who you'll take on the appearance as; once you know, just snap your fingers and you'll find yourself in that universe, in the form of that person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRULES:<br>\r\nI'm usually not that strict on rules, but I feel I should enforce them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Nothing too sexual. I don't want a detailed erotica story. Save that for another interactive. If they have sex, say they did. That's it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) This rule is similar to rule 1. Don't play with yourself. You don't need to shapeshift and play with yourself every single time i.e. playing with boobs, touching your new vagina, and so on. The only exception is groping yourself when you first hop in, but then you stop playing with yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Like rule 2, this isn't an erotica story. If you think it'd fit well for an erotica story, don't post it. I WILL EDIT YOUR POST.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you have any questions, feel free to message me.<br>\r\n</td>",
