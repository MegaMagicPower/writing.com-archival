Don't even think about looking through my Dust!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the heiress went to the bathroom while Ruby just pouted from her spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she smirked, \"Well... it's not like she would notice anything strange if I move fast enough~!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Ruby puts her Comic down and briefly used her Semblance before she carefully opened the briefcase and began inspecting each vial of powdered Dust, \"Let's see what we have here... some Ice Dust, not surprising... Fire Dust... Lightning Dust...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes, Ruby decided that she had seen enough was about to close the case when she noticed another vial of powdered Dust that she had somehow missed, \"Hmm? What's this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPicking the vial up Ruby saw that it was filled with Dust... only of a type that she does not recognize and was a rather odd color.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of Dust is this? Gravity? No, it would've been purple...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was so focused on this unknown Dust that she didn't notice the bathroom door had opened and that Weiss was not pleased seeing her partner rummaging through her briefcase, \"RUBY! What are you doing?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Weiss! I was just-!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut in her panic, Ruby accidentally dropped the vial she was holding causing it to shatter on the floor, releasing the Dust and cover Ruby completely while Weiss stood in disbelief and shock at what her partner just did. But at the same time, she was also confused at what kind of Dust she was looking at as the color of the Dust alone was something that she had never seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither of the two girls said anything as the cloud of Dust slowly dissipated as Ruby coughed and closed her eyes when...</span></div></div>",

What's wrong? Is there something-\" Ruby stopped when she noticed that the room seemed to gradually shrink before her eyes before she felt her clothes feeling tighter than usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Ruby check herself and her eyes widen in shock when she noticed that her sleeves were slowly slipping up her arms! Then both girls heard ripping sounds and looked at Ruby's feet and saw that her stockings were ripped open in several places!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"R-Ruby... You're growing!\" Weiss blurted out, still in shock at what seemed impossible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby stared at her partner in disbelief, \"What?! But, I can't possibly be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't get to finish her sentence when her the red lacings started to creak and soon Ruby found it a little hard to breathe as she reaches 6 feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanicking, Ruby quickly removed her black belt as well as her precious red hooded cloak onto the floor. But as she was about to try to remove her boots, several of the lacings snapped off and then her blouse ripped open at where her chest is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weiss... help...\" Ruby pleaded as more of her clothes started to rip in several areas and her boots now feel really tight as she closes in at 6'4\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha-what can I do?! I don't even know what that Dust you inhaled is!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't help to make things get any better as Ruby's clothes soon start getting torn apart as first the lacings holding her skirt snapped causing the skirt to fall onto the floor passing 6'6\" exposing her panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby's stockings had since been ripped up leaving her almost bare in the lower half of her body. Next, her blouse continued to get ripped up as the hole where her chest is expanded before her shoulders tear at the bouse's seams as she passes 6'7\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing, Ruby tried to cover her self as her painfully tight boots bulged as a result of her expanding feet. Ruby couldn't say anything before she passes 6'8\" and her bouse finally splits up halfway into two pieces, while at the same time her toes finally made progress emerging out of her boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is now half-naked in only her smaller, tightening underwear and what remained of her boots!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss stammered, \"Ruby... s-stop growing! You're g-getting too big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I- I don't know how!\" Ruby exclaimed as she passes 7 feet and to her embarrassment, her bra snapped and fell off her exposing her breasts!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlushing bright red, Ruby covered her breasts as her panties stretched and dug into her thighs before they too snapped off as she passes 7'2\", forcing her to try and completely cover herself! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby then looked down and saw that her feet had finally broken out of what remained of her boots.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss continued to stare as Ruby kicked off her destroyed boots but continued to grow as they looked at each other in shock.</span></div></div>",

You have to get out here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe now 10 feet Ruby looked down at Weiss in confusion, \"Huh? What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough a little intimidated by Ruby looking down at her, Weiss explained, \"What do you think would happen if you keep growing and stay in our dorm?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment confusion was all Ruby could feel until her eyes widened at the implication, \"Oh no! If I stay I could get trapped in here! I have to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut at that moment, she suddenly winced and without warning, Ruby's growth suddenly sped up as she quickly passes 12 feet and slammed her head into the ceiling!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" Dazed, Ruby tumbled forward and managed to stop herself from slamming into the floor. After shaking her head, she now finds herself on all fours hovering over her partner who fell on her back and slightly raised her arms. \"Weiss! Are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss didn't reply as she looks up at the 14 foot (and still growing) Ruby and her mind raced, <i>\"How much bigger is she going to get?!\"</i></span></div></div>",

Aaa-CHOO!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing Weiss could do but watch as her partner rose up with each sneeze before Ruby hits her head on the ceiling after sneezing over 9 feet causing her to fall on her butt.

She then noticed that the bathroom wall where the cabinets are had cracked in multiple areas and immediately, Weiss realized Ruby's other foot was likely on the other side. And if she were to make an educated guess when compared to how big Ruby was at around 18 feet tall... then that must mean she may be over 24 feet now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned, Weiss stood back up as the reality of the current situation dawned on her, \"Oh my... I-I'm trapped!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b><u>Back in the Dorm</u></b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ruby finally sneezed, her eyes were shut closed when she rapidly grew much more than usual due to the added effects of her partner's remaining Dust. All she heard was a deafening explosion quickly followed by the sound of glass shattering and suddenly feeling very squeezed in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned as she sniffed in annoyance as the itch disappeared before she shook her head and slowly opened her eyes... she soon wished she had kept her eyes closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was stunned when she saw how <i>tiny</i> and cramped her Team's Dorm was now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe winced when she realized she was in a bent forward position with most of her back and shoulders pressing against the ceiling, her breasts were pressed against her lower thighs, her butt pushing against their closet, and her left hip and legs had pushed her Team's bunk beds. This resulted in her sister's bunk crashing onto Blake's bed due to the books holding it up scattering due to either the explosion or Ruby's hip and leg slamming into the lower bed when she grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for Ruby's own top (hanging) bed... two of the ropes had broken from the ceiling while the other two were somewhat holding it up. Her partner's bed was pushed by her hip and was slightly damaged from the hanging bed's two legs crashing into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby then noticed that her right foot was also through the bathroom door while her left was pressed against the adjacent wall cracking it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped when she remembered that Weiss was still inside and soon heard Weiss' muffled cry that she was trapped!

She was about to respond when her cat ears picked up more sounds coming from... Ruby's bunk?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough a little cranky at being woken up so late at night Blake rubbed her eyes and thanks to her Faunus trait she was able to see the dark dorm.

And she can clearly see that Ruby is growing even bigger!

Ruby's bunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What-?\" That was all she had to say before Blake literally dragged her off the bed. The noise also woke Yang up as she rubbed her now red eyes in irritation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss stammered as she stared wide-eyed at her growing partner, \"Y-Yang?

Her arms and legs are now dangling off to the sides of her bed as her crotch slid closer to the footboard while her head and shoulders pressed against the adjacent wall propping her up.

She then reshifted in her bed in a somewhat more comfortable position and continued to sleep unaware of what she and her Team were about to see when they all wake up in the morning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Morning</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n6:00 am(ish)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*beep* *beep* *beep* *beep*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of the Teams clock alarm caused all the girls to groan before Blake shuts it off. Ruby yawned and groaned as she knew that Monday had arrived<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want to go to class today!\", Ruby muttered as she pulls on her covers to cover herself up more... only to notice that something felt... off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGroggily opening her eyes Ruby sat up and stretched-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*rip*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby blinked in confusion as she heard a ripping sound and then glanced down only to suddenly feel wide awake when she saw her cleavage and the ripped tank top!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh- what the?!\" She stammered before she threw her bedsheet away and gasped when she saw her pajama is now ripped and torn in several areas. That was when she finally noticed that her bed and the Dorm seemed... smaller.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfused, Ruby hopped off her bed. But when she looked down, she suddenly felt dizzy when her perspective looked much higher than usual. This caused her to stumble and fall on her butt causing her to yelp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer yelp stirred her Team a bit as Weiss muttered, \"Ruby... what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously sis, just a few more minutes okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Ruby, now wide awake, slowly stood up and looked around her Dorm in confusion, \"Um... did everything shrink or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bit irritated, Yang sat up, \"What on Remnant are you talking about sis? The room is...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat every Yang was about to say disappeared when her eyes widened at the sight of her now really tall \"little sister\", \"What, R-RUBY?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby turned to her sister, and that was when she noticed that Yang also looked smaller as well. In fact, everything and everyone looked smaller to her! \"What... what's going on? Why is everything smaller? Why are my pajamas like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Weiss and Blake had also woken up. At first, they were annoyed and grumpy at the noise the halfsisters were causing, only to freeze up in shock when they saw their now much taller leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby... it's not us that became small; you're bigger!\" Blake exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?! But, how?! How am I so big now?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss said nothing as her mind raced in confusion until she recalled yesterday's incident, \"... there's no way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caught the other three's attention, \"Weiss, do you know why my sister is suddenly this tall?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss shifted uncomfortably, \"I think... it may be because of what happened yesterday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yesterday?\" Ruby parrotted in confusion before her eyes slowly widened. \"You mean, the vial I accidentally dropped? The one that had that strange Dust?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving been told of what happened with the \"Dust incident\", Blake and Yang glanced at each other before Blake asked, \"Weiss, are you sure you don't know what that Dust even is? Or what it was supposed to be used for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Schnee Heiress shook her head, \"I asked my father if he knew what it was, but all he said that it was a prototype that I was to test it to see what it could do. However, he explained that there was supposed to be some information as well as instructions that came with the briefcase, but I told him that I did not see any.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang raised an eyebrow, \"So your dad just forgot it or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss shrugged, \"Apparently <i>someone</i> was supposed to supply me the info and have it in the briefcase, but had been misplaced somehow. So he had to... \"discipline\" the person before they had to either try to find it or just resend another copy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby, having calmed down somewhat, tilted her head, \"Did they find it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Weiss' sigh, the other girls knew the answer was a 'no'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a result, they had to make another copy and it is supposed to arrive sometime today. Where I will likely would've retrieved it after School.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one said anything for a while before Yang of all people voiced her concerns, \"Well, what do we do? I mean, breakfast is about... <i>*glances at their clock*\"</i> an hour away. And we, of course, have to go to class.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby went pale at that, \"What?! I can't go to class like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang shook her head, \"Ruby, we probably have no choice right now. But maybe we could ask Pyrrah if we could borrow her clothes for you to wear?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Weiss suddenly yelled before she grabs a measuring tape to check how tall Ruby actually is. Only to blink when she read the result, \"...I don't think Pyrrah's clothes can fit on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Weiss? How tall am I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are 6 feet 10 inches tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"That's nearly 7 feet!\"</i> Ruby mentally screamed as her situation became more problematic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... she could stay here until we get back. Maybe say that she got sick or something along those lines?\" Blake suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Weiss shook her head, \"I don't know... the whole school is bound to find out about her new height eventually. So, I hate to say this, Ruby may just attend class anyway just to get this over with now rather than later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang glanced up at Ruby, \"Your call sis.

Though Weiss said that they will have to either come up with some cover story or explain Ruby's condition to an adult, (and likely have to show what said 'condition' is). Perhaps Professor Goodwitch or even Professor Peach.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nEither way they also hope to figure out what the mysterious prototype Dust Weiss received the previous day was once the info arrives later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss crossed her fingers hoping that the information her father sent would properly arrive. Preferably earlier than usual given how her father decided not to send the info onto her Scroll but by a fast service delivery instead. All in an effort to \"not leak this to any competitors\" as he put it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid quote was not well received by her teammates, and she could not blame them. <i>\"It's always going to be about profits for the Company...\"</i> Weiss thought bitterly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Several minutes later</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Yang <i><b>finally</b></i> finished cleaning up and use up so much precious time focusing on her hair she, Weiss, and Blake were all dressed up in their School uniforms, ready for the start of the School day.

Okay?\" Weiss explained/asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby nodded, \"Yeah, I'll see you guys later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that _WBY left and met up with their sister Team, JNPR, and had to explain that Ruby is \"not feeling well\".

Go on ahead without me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJNPR accepted and said their goodbye and hope that Ruby will feel better as Blake closes the door to her Team's Dorm.

Once again, Ruby sighed, \"I hope we figure out what that Dust was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned, just what was that particular Dust supposed to be used for? It just does not make any sense that it caused her to grow so tall overnight. And Weiss did say that it was apparently a prototype. But, for what? What use is there for a Dust to make something grow bigger?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby rubbed her head trying to come up with any ideas before giving up. \"No use just sitting here.\" She glanced around the at Dorm, <i>\"I gotta use the time I now have until the Team gets back. Whenever that is.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaybe she could find something to distract herself to pass the time? Perhaps watch TV or play some games?

Hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, she did not get to use the bathroom yet and it would be nice have a nice long shower. \"Hopefully Yang did not use up all the hot water... *groan* again...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby remembered during one weekend when her sister used the shower first, but used it for a ridiculously long time. It was only after Weiss banged on the bathroom door and yelled at Yang to finish up already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, she, and Ruby were annoyed having a cool/cold shower (which led to a gods awful pun from Yang... again). Blake on the other hand simply left the room and borrowed JNPR's bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby shook her head at that particular memory, \"Whether it's at home, Signal, or Beacon... Yang really, really loves her hair...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, find something or first take a, hopefully, warm shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut then, Ruby is supposed to be \"sick\".

Hopefully, there's still enough hot water left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Ruby walked towards the bathroom and entered it. Due to her new height, she had to slightly crouch down to enter. After she closed the bathroom door Ruby then glanced down at her torn pajamas and began to undress. She knew that her pajamas were going to be small now, but it was still annoying to try to take them off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe first pulled down her trousers, and only had a minor difficulty thanks to her wider hips. Then she pulled up her tank top and the only issue she had was pulling it up over her head as she sighed after getting it off, \"*sigh* If I was any taller I would've ripped that apart!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, all that's left is her rather snug panties. Thankfully that was easy due to how elastic it was. Ruby is now completely naked as she puts her pajamas away on a cabinet. \"I hope they're not as difficult to put back on... or any clothes we have anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby then sighed, she and her Team will have to deal with getting her new clothes later. As Ruby was about to head towards the shower, she paused as she glances at herself in the mirror. She crouched down a bit after seeing only her neck was in her view. Ruby saw that she still looks the same, just a lot taller than usual. She checked herself out in a bit of wonder at how everything looked much smaller and lower than what she was used to. Even grabbing a bottle of hand soap and marveled at the size difference as she recalled how it originally looked in her hand before she became so tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she put the hand soap back, Ruby then frowned. Her mind was still on that unknown Dust that caused her to grow this much. No matter how much she tried, it did not make any sense why Weiss' dad would send her something that was experimental. Let alone the effects it had, on Ruby at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby then spent a few minutes trying to come up with ideas about what use that Dust had. Maybe it was something for farming? Like increasing the size of fruits and vegetables? Then again, would it even work on plants anyway? If it is for farming, then the only other possibility is animals. She drooled a bit at the thought of table-sized cooked meat that would make for a great feast with both Team's RWBY &amp; JNPR. Maybe even have some room for more people to join in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Ruby's stomach growled loudly, causing her to blush, \"Aww man... they're about to have breakfast by now...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, there was nothing she could do now as she walked towards the shower and turns it on. Ruby then checked the temperature and thankfully the water was still warm and felt the temperature rise a bit. In response, she readjusted the valve and managed to get the right temperature she wanted and entered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby sighed in relief for a moment until she once again noticed the height difference as the cascade of water hits her chest instead of her head. She grumbled as she once again bent down a bit and starts washing, \"Being tall sucks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just after she puts on some soap into her hair, unbeknownst to her, she began to grow again as she slowly began to rise up in height!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe frowned as she felt the water flow seemingly get lower and had to (much to her annoyance) initially adjusted the shower head up a bit. Yet the water seemed to still get lower. Growling, Ruby washed off the soap and opened her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay! What is going on?! Is the water pressure getting lower or something-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice suddenly froze up when she saw that the shower head seems to be getting lower! Then Ruby noticed that her head and shoulders are above the curtains!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh? What-?\" Was all Ruby to muster as she grew past the 7 feet mark and still rising as she looked down and her eyes widen as the shower floor not only seemed to be getting further away from her view, but Ruby also saw her feet getting close to the sides!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took a step back in shock, \"I'm growing?! I'm still getting bigger?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfusion and fear filled her mind as she fumbled with the curtains to open them as ...</span></div></div>",

I have to be more careful. Everything is too small or short for me now. Oh, and I have to shut off the Shower first and dry off. Can't waste whatever remaining hot water there is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Ruby froze when a thought came to her at the last part, she started to grow again suddenly when she was in the shower.

She made sure to not bother to close the curtains so that she can get out a little more quickly when she's done.

She briefly winced at how lukewarm the water now felt but shook it off before lowering herself down to her knees.

She then cupped her hands to gather the water dripping from her face and splashes herself onto her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe briefly recalled that she had left the curtains open, <i>\"Weiss would be very annoyed if she saw me do this at my original height with the curtains still open. And causing the bathroom floor to be soaking wet.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as Ruby wanted to amuse herself at that thought, she shook her head (her hair spraying water everywhere and onto the bathroom floor as a rult) before pulling back up to let the water hit her chest and wiped her face off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Ruby, focus. I have to see if I'm right and that I can somehow grow because of water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the water out of her eyes, Ruby nervously looked down at her soaked hands and waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe briefly wondered how long it took for the effect to happen, only to have that train of thought quickly interrupted when this time, she felt a tingly sensation! It quickly spread her entire body causing Ruby to shiver as she stared at her hands and down at her body.

Yet, even as Ruby grew to 25 feet in height, she actually enjoyed this feeling of confinement, enjoying feeling the sensation of growing larger and larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the ceiling cracked against her back and shoulders pressing against it until Ruby's head hit the shower wall and broke the connection of the showerhead, causing a torrent of water to soak her head. And like before, her body quickly absorbed as much as possible, causing her to explode in growth as she had never felt before up till now as she shot up in size to 40 feet. Her butt breaking down the wall and into her Team's Dorm room, her feet smashing through the shower wall destroying more pipes causing a massive amount of leakage to hit her legs, and also breaking through the ceiling allowing Ruby to push herself back up and now with her upper body out in the open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dorm building groaned under Ruby and showed signs of cracking under her rapid growth. And with all the commotion, several people gawked at a giant (and rapidly growing) girl suddenly burst out from one of the Dormitories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby then winced at the blinding morning sun and as she put up her arm to momentarily shielded herself from being blinded.</span></div></div>",

What else am I supposed to do now?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ruby pondered on what to do next, her stomach suddenly growled!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess that answers my question.\u201d Ruby said with a blush as she got off the bed and headed out to mess hall and see if there is something to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ruby finally arrived and entered the mess hall she wasn\u2019t surprised that no one was inside at the moment, meaning the few weekend faculty kitchen staff were likely out in the City of Vale for whatever their own reasons were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRegardless, Ruby smiled as she skipped to the kitchen and before long she was in front of the refrigerator.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s see what\u2019s inside.\u201d She said as she opened the refrigerator door and took a look.<br>\r\nInside there were a few different kinds of food neatly arranged but her eyes lit up as she quickly locked onto a plastic container filled with cookies topped with chocolate ships and *gasp* strawberries!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby licked her lips, \"Ooo, those cookies look so good! And they\u2019re topped with strawberries, my favorite!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just as she was about to grab the container, she noticed that there is also a small milk carton with an unlabeled symbol that she has never seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, must be a new brand. And I am kind of thirsty.\" Ruby muttered as she inquisitively analyzed the milk then looked back at the Cookies, and then back at the milk before she shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, why not just have both?\u201d she said before she grabbed both the cookie-filled container and the small milk carton before closing the refrigerator door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExiting the kitchen, Ruby quickly sat down at one of the tables and quickly opened the container and milk carton.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby paused, \u201cShould I have gotten a glass for the milk?\u201d she pondered before shaking her head, \u201cNah~, I\u2019ll dip cookies in milk some another time.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Ruby set upon the cookies first and instantly loved them the moment the first one was devoured. Then she tried the milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cHmm, there\u2019s a slight taste that I can\u2019t put my finger on it. But all in all, it's not bad!\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t take a minute for Ruby to finish eating the cookies before downing the entire milk carton with a satisfied sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPah~! Like I told Yang back on initiation, <u>I don\u2019t need help growing up, I drink MILK!</u>\u201d Ruby declared while raising the empty milk carton in victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter gathering everything, Ruby went back to the kitchen and threw the carton in the trash while placing the empty container on the kitchen counter and leaving a note thanking and apologizing for having the cookies for herself but enjoyed very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell!\u201d Ruby started as she walked out of the kitchen before stopping before the first row of tables with her hands on her hips, \u201cI\u2019ve had my fill and I suppose I could go into Vale and see if there is anything else to do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before Ruby took a few steps forward toward the main doors, her stomach suddenly growled and bubbled loudly causing her to bend over and clutch her stomach in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby groaned before she thought back to the milk, <i>\u201cI forgot to check if that milk had already past the expiration date-!\u201c</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\u201cGroooooowl!\u201d</b> Her stomached now suddenly <i>roared</i> causing Ruby to fall on her knees as the pain intensified and now spread throughout her body!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTearfully, Ruby feebly pleaded for help, \u201cOoh... it hurts!

Ruby felt the trees being knocked over and crushed beneath her feel shorter and shorter as she grew, now over 700 feet already and still rising rapidly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby whimpered in pain as she looked down to see the ground rapidly moving further away from her as she continued to grow to 1000 feet!. She then glanced around to see the cliffside actually breaking in certain places under her massive increasing weight. Her eyes widen as she recalls that there is a docking bay at the bottom of the cliff, so now the people down there are probably panicking at not only at falling pieces of the Cliff, but also at the sight of Ruby. If Ruby was not in so much pain or had stopped growing by now she would've at least moved away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she can't. She's too immobilized in pain as she grew past 1300 feet!

It's not the world that had shrunk... it's me... I'm... so much bigger somehow!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby took a few steps backward while letting the note fall out of her hand as she looks around her in disbelief.

Something in it caused me to grow this big!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that in mind, Ruby walked to the trash bin and rummaged through it before finding the empty carton and examined it to try to figure out where it was from and who made it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut to Ruby's dismay, other than the symbol there was no information whatsoever anywhere on the carton. Defeated, Ruby dropped the carton back into the trash and after looking down at herself again, sighed, \"When I said I drink milk to grow up, I didn't mean like this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding back up Ruby compares herself to the kitchen and had to make a guess that she is probably over 8 feet!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I as tall- or rather taller than... what was his name again?

Yeah, I think that was his name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven so, Ruby could barely comprehend that she is now much taller than the tall tanned skin male member of Team CFVY.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But now what do I do-?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby suddenly cut herself off when she glanced at the clock and saw how much time had passed!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my gosh!

If you were feeling sick, then why didn't you say anything?\" Weiss asked, annoyed that her partner may have been sick the whole day but never said a peep that she was \"feeling odd\" and could've jeopardized the team if she \"felt\" worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby pouted as she slapped her knees in response, \"I did not feel sick! It's just something I can't explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... I'm guessing...\" Yang started and (much to the team's dismay) smirked, \"You're probably having some growing pains. Which means dad's Xiao Long trait must be... <i><b>\"Kicking\"</b></i> in!\" She joked while using one of her legs in a kicking motion to put a little more emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the Team groaned and could've sworn they heard an audible \"Boo!\" from team JNPR's dorm as Ruby threw one of her pillows squarely into Yang's face before removing her sleep mask and hopped off her (hanging) top bunk bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be using the bathroom for a bit.\" Ruby said and walked off to the bathroom while her sister bemoaned why she got hit in the face for her \"masterpiece\", resulting in Weiss and Blake to collectively facepalm and sigh at the blonde before going back to their own devices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter closing the bathroom behind her, Ruby sighed before walking toward the sinks and looked into the mirror. All the while Yang's \"joke\" earlier was still echoing in her head as she examined herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of having a quote on quote \"growing pains\" was something Ruby has some mixed feelings. While becoming a bit taller or maybe as tall as her sister is one thing, she would rather not want to stick out so much if she grew so tall. After all, Ruby would rather be a normal (even if a taller) girl than be the center of attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she was soon cut from her own thoughts when her body suddenly started to heat up quickly, causing Ruby to gasp in shock and grasp the sink counter as she started to feel dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening t-to me?\" Ruby stuttered as the heat built up more causing her to buckle on her knees while still holding onto the counter and close her eyes tightly, praying that this would all end quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to her relief, it did end and Ruby opened her eyes and raised herself up on the sink counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she tried to regain her bearings, she noticed something felt... off about her clothes. Confused, Ruby looked down at herself and blinked as she noticed that her stomach and legs are showing more skin than usual. She also felt her tank tops straps are somewhat digging into her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Did my pajama's just got smaller all of a sudden...\" Ruby trailed off as she looked back at the mirror and stepped back in shock to see that her clothes did indeed look smaller on her but also that the sinks seemed lower from her perspective!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"D-did I just grew?!\"</i> Ruby mentally screamed as she doubled and tripled checked herself in disbelief going as far as to pinch herself thinking this is all just a dream only to feel pain and see that her new perspective had not changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oww~. Okay, so it wasn't a dream. I actually did grew taller! ...somehow.\" Ruby trailed off as she checked herself out in the mirror in wonder and tried to estimate how tall she is now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I almost as tall as... Yang?\" Ruby guessed as she recalls that her sister is about 5'8\" if she remembers correctly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she couldn't help but be worried as she looked at her hands, \"But there's no way anyone could grow this quickly right?

The voice was enticing, whispering honeyed words in her ear. She might've actually obliged if not for another voice exactly like her own that held the other at bay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was all so strange. It was like she had an imaginary angle and devil on her shoulder. In the end the angle seemed to win out and she regained her thoughts. As enticing as it was, she wouldn't abuse her new stature. She wasn't a bully like some people she knew. No, she was a huntress in training and her goal was to help others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby?! Ruby!?\" said girl was snapped out of her thoughts as yang frantically jumped in front of her, waving her arms. To the Amazonian-like girl, seeing her 'big' sister who now barley reached above her stomach jump up to gain her attention was actually kind of adorable. Is this what Yang felt like 24/7? \"Ruby?! Is anybody in there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby blinked. \"Yeah, I'm here.\" she laughed nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good.\" Yang smiled, although it did little to hide her worry. And a tad bit of her envy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is insane.\" Weiss said quietly. She was the most envious of the group. Understandable considering now that Ruby was the biggest she was now the smallest. That didn't sit right with her, but she elected to keep her thoughts to herself. This was neither the time or place to get upset. Especially since all Ruby had to defeat her now was sit on her. The thought made her shudder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did this happen?\" Blake finally asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\" Ruby answered. She then went on to explain her day and what went on in the bathroom. Needless to say the rest of her team was stumped. From Ruby's explanation it was just another typical day at Beacon Academy. So then what could have caused their team leader's growth spurt?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you've told us everything Ruby?\" Weiss inquired. Ruby might have described an average day, but the situation right now said anything but. What was she missing? People just didn't have random growth spurts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I swear that's it!\" Ruby sighed. If there was something that happened out of the ordinary then she didn't know. A strange day at Beacon Academy was just another day at the office. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright sis. Just try to stay positive and... enjoy your new stature. We'll try to figure something out.\" Yang started. \"In the meantime you might want to... uh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Ruby asked as she noticed Yang's growing blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What Yang is try to say is, uh...\" Blake paused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiess simply facepalmed. \"They mean you're indecent and in need of clothing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby's eyes bulged as she forgot she was totally naked. She yelped before grabbing Yang's bedsheet and wrapping herself in it. It didn't cover much, but it was just enough to cover her private parts. Even if she had to show a little cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what now?\" Blake asked the mini giantess. \"You're still the leader here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby's team looked her expectantly. \"Right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She was the tallest person in Beacon as far as they could tell. Just the mere sight of her would raise questions. Then there was the fear of if she'd grow again. What if she became so big her enormous tushy crushed the whole school? Now that would be a real disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good plan Rubes. So, any body have any ideas on where we should start?\" Yang asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeis was the first to speak. \"The school's curfew is in full affect so the CCT is locked down. Though we might be able to get into the library to look for some answers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a good place to start.\" Blake agreed. \"We should also retrace Ruby's steps during the day and look for anything that might be amiss.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan!\" Yang grinned.

Ruby will be the biggest concern... No pun intended.\" Weiss glared at the blonde who was stifling a laugh.

I'm not really fit for stealth at the moment.\" Ruby said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry too.\" Yang apologized. \"Well, let's do this!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAIT!\" Blake called out. \"Is it wise to go as one group?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang now looked confused. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As a group of four it'll take more time to search for clues. However if we break off into teams of two or by ourselves we'll get much more done quicker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see what you mean.\" Weiss nodded. \"But at the same time we can't leave Ruby alone either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long stretch silence before Yang broke it. \"It's your call sis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Weiss, however, looked skeptical at the plan as she voices her skepticism, \"No offense Ruby but, are you sure that is a wise decision? Given that you are over eight feet tall, it's going quite difficult to not be seen. Not to mention, we do not know WHEN you are going to start growing again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh... I'll be fine! I mean, yeah I'm not going to be stealthy since I'm so tall now, and... yeah I don't know if or when I'll start growing again, but I'll manage! Really!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss still looked skeptical but begrudgingly nodded and prayed that her partner/leader will not be discovered. And hopefully not grow bigger anytime soon. The thought of Ruby towering over the whole Academy made her shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough Ruby did not show it, she is very nervous, <i>\"At least I hope I'll be fine! I don't want to be seen like this!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether it was because of being so tall or the fact that she is naked and only has her sister's bedsheets wrapped around her body for cover. Or likely both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the whole Team got ready to head out. With no way of knowing when Ruby would grow again Weiss, Yang, and Blake remained in their pajamas. The Team also only got their Scrolls to message/call each other if they found anything or wanted to check up on each other on their progress. Ruby did find it to be odd holding onto her Scroll now that it is so much smaller in her larger hands. She even worried if she could even message or call her Team.

Yang, on the other hand, was frozen on the spot as she stared wide-eyed at her growing big \"little sister\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, as Ruby grew, her butt touched the Top Bunks and while her bed creaked as the ropes holding it up started to strain, the same could not be said for her sister's bunk as the books holding it up collapsed, causing it to come crashing down onto Blake's bed. Said Cat Faunus was mortified at the loss of those books (and the prospect of losing the rest if her leader grew too big) but winced when Weiss shrieked, \"Yang! Get out of there!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang snapped out of her daze and then looked to her teammates already in the hallway before glancing back at the now 15'6\" foot Ruby. \"Yang get out of here! I don't know how much bigger I'm going to get!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, Yang turned and rushed out to rejoin Blake and Weiss and they all could only watch as Ruby continued to grow bigger and bigger with the sound of their Dorm being turned to ruin as she grew to 16 feet. Though the only things they could see of her through the door right now are her large hands, thighs, and hanging breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Ruby frantically looked at her shrinking surroundings the Dorm got smaller and smaller to her growing frame. She felt her back pressing into the ceiling while the bunk beds still being pushed by her legs and she soon felt her feet touch the bookshelf. There was nothing she could do but lower herself onto her stomach in order to give herself some more room. She stared at her Team still in the hallway and occasionally backing up toward Team JNPR's Dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe glanced at their sister team's closed-door, <i>\"They must have heard the noise right? Oh... I don't want them, or anyone to see me like this!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, like it suddenly reappeared, the heat she felt began to die down!<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"G-guys! I think it's finally stopping!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, even from the hallway _WBY could see that her growth had slowed considerably. But they could not help but worry about a new problem; if Ruby stops growing... how is she supposed to get out? And more importantly, <b>when</b> would her next growth spurt happen? The fact that it happened so soon after her last growth had rung warning bells in their minds. Especially Weiss as her mind raced at the thought of Ruby growing even bigger and whether it would be soon after this growth or happens later. She gulped at the thought that her partner could grow as big as the Beacon Tower or perhaps... even bigger than that...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as Ruby felt the heat almost fade away she...</span></div></div>",

It was an almost Crimson red dust that seemed to resemble muscle fibers. \"What you got there, Weiss?\" Ruby asked curiously as she snatched the dust away from her and moved it away from her. \"Don't touch that, you dolt!\" Weiss protested trying to get it back, but failing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was able to run away from Weiss, but tripped as she looked at Weiss and not where she was going. The dust got all over Ruby and no where else. Weiss helped Ruby up and looked incredibly angry. \"How dare you! That's a new experimental dust you just destroyed!\" The angry heiress yelled as Ruby started to feel hot. \"Why is it so hot all of a sudden?\" Ruby asked ignoring Weiss. \"I don't know!\" Weiss answered angrily as Ruby looked around. There was nobody nearby. \"We will catch up later. Alright? I'm going to go run and try and cool down.\" Ruby said thinking of washing her face in a nearby bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ruby got to the bathroom, she felt much more colder and bigger than earlier. She looked in the mirror and noticed something odd. Ruby's sleeves had a bump. When she poked the bump, it was rock hard. \"What the?\" Ruby asked herself making sure no one was present and then locking the door. She took her other arm and ripped off the sleeve to reveal a muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When did I get that?!\" Ruby asked in shock and in awe as she began to heat up again. This time she saw it. Her bicep expanded and she could hear her clothes ripping. She took off her shirt momentarily to reveal her smoking hot abs. \"I don't even think Yang has a body like this!\" Ruby exclaimed admiring the view as she flexed her biceps. Her arm used to be a measly 3 inches thick, but this new dust caused her bicep to bring that to 8 inches. Her breasts seemed to have increased by an entire cup size and she took off her leggings to check her legs as well. Her legs were longer and 3 to 4 inches thicker than they were earlier. Ruby loved this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby cooled down now and felt as if she was done growing. She put back all her clothes and heard a couple tears. She wore the torn sleeve as a badge of honor to show her newfound strength. On the way out she broke a sink fossit to see how strong she was. It didn't snap off, but she was able to crush it completely. \"I'm going to love this.\" Ruby said to herself with a grin as she broke the door handle off the door and opened it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at her dorm room, she couldn't find anyone. Which, to her, was good so she could push her limits of growth and strength. She saw Weiss's briefcase on her bed and broke it open. There was tons of the experimental dust. But she thought about whether or not she should take it.</span></div></div>",

She injected the dust into her bloodstream this time and felt it a rush go through her entire body. Her body heated up as she began to grow. Her legs were much more toned now. Her arms growing another 4 inches, making them her biceps one foot long. She was now 6'2\" with breasts growing a cup and a half and a butt much more round and firm. Her clothes ripped off mostly, but she didn't mind. Ruby went into the bathroom to check out her new body. \"I'm loving this!\" Ruby exclaimed with excitement as she flexed her biceps and moved her pectorals and breasts up and down. Veins were starting to show on her bicep and she loved it. Just then she heard the door open and chatter. \"That was a good shopping trip. I wonder where Ruby is.\" Yang said as the three stood still in their tracks as Ruby walked outside the bathroom almost crushing the door frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weiss had a new experimental dust and it kind of did this.\" Ruby explained showing off her muscles. \"That dust was just meant to amplify attacks!\" Weiss exclaimed in shock. \"Well, it did amplify my attacks. I'm MUCH stronger.\" Ruby explained with a grin as she lifted the book shelf with ease just to show off. \"Well, can I have some of this stuff?!\" Yang asked excited. \"No. This wasn't meant to happen. We don't know how this affects humans or faunus yet! She could be a completely different person!\" Weiss exclaimed angrily. \"Oh alright.\" Yang said disappointed. \"I feel great, Weiss. I don't think I'm any different. Just stronger... more... powerful.\" Ruby explained as she towered over Weiss. Weiss stepped back in fear and said, \"o-of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what did everyone buy?\" Ruby asked. Blake showed some books. Weiss showed a couple dresses and dust vials. And Yang showed some different looking clothes, but still fitting her usual show off style. \"Can I see those, Yang?\" Ruby asked. \"I just bought these!\" Yang protested. \"Good.\" Ruby said as she grabbed one. \"Sis, let go.\" Yang said. \"A growing girl needs clothes!\" Ruby exclaimed as she let go of the shirt and grabbed Yang by her stomach. The team watched in fear. \"What I say goes. Understand? I'm stronger than you. There is no saying no to me!\" Ruby asserted as she squeezed lightly, which still caused an immense pain for Yang. \"S-sorry sis. Take it!\" Yang cried as Ruby put her down. Ruby patted Yang on the head, \"good girl.\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang's clothes fit Ruby alright. They were kind of tight and would most likely rip if she took another vial. When team RWBY quickly left in the morning with Ruby, she thought about taking another vial before class. </span></div></div>",

I should take over beacon. No, the world! With the power of this dust, I can become the strongest person... no goddess of all time!\" Ruby plotted. Ruby grabbed five dust vials and took them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby grew to 7'9\" and was about half the size of the room in muscle. \"Yes!

Nobody knew what had caused it, being overuse of dust, just natural human evolution, or a weird mutation, but the two girls, despite being born only slightly larger than the average baby, began to grow in height and muscularity at an incredible rate.  By age 3 both girls were five feet tall and packed with muscles.  By age ten they were fifteen feet tall, walking hulks that their father had to walk on eggshells to ensure they wouldn\u2019t seriously hurt others whenever they played.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis immense power, still not widespread among the populace, had the authorities of Beacon take a keen interest in the two girls, particularly after an incident where Ruby Rose stopped a robbery of Dust with nothing but her bare hands.  And so, the two sisters were sent off to the institute to master their power along with other notable specimens, both human and Faunus.  The world\u2019s scientists had dubbed them \u201cGigants\u201d, a new subspecies whose presence would become more common as generations passed, but were still fairly uncommon as the world of the \u201clittle people\u201d hastily attempted to adjust for their giant, super muscled forms.  And while Beacon had a fairly substantial Gigant population, most of the students were still regular sized people in the shadows of these colossi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling at the backstory she had come up with, Ruby began to change herself and others.  She was willing to give this power to others, but she would be the strongest, naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo while there were some impressive Gigants on campus, like their friend Jaune, a 25 foot tall hulk of a boy whose clumsiness and good heart endeared himself to Ruby (even if he was awkward as anything around girls still, Ruby making sure to not change the personality aspects of the boy too greatly lest he turn into a jerk) they still weren\u2019t nearly as powerful as Yang and Ruby.  Yang was 30 feet of power and femininity, with massive breasts, a butt to die for, and enough muscles on her frame to lift up an entire mountain.  She was always using Beacon\u2019s Gigant sized workout equipment to push her power to new limits, and her body showed the results of this exercise, with definition complimenting her sheer bulk.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd yet she was dwarfed by her not-so-little sister, a 40 foot tall titan (who may still be growing, in case Ruby ever felt like she deserved to be even bigger) with muscular size that gave her the most incredible figure.  Long, massive legs that could crush anything between them into powder, and crush anyone beneath them into paste.  A chest that effortlessly held up her enormous shelf of a bust as it stuck out with no effort.  Arms that could hold up an entire city without feeling much strain.  Hips and a behind that would hypnotize any man fortunate enough to gaze upon their massive shapes.  And still the cutest face on top of it all.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby smiled at the changes she had made to the world, and to herself, before adding three final details.  The first was that the world had made it a point to get stretchable material for Gigants to wear lest they hulk out of their clothes on a regular basis.  To that end Ruby was wearing a workout outfit, a T-shirt and booty shorts that left nothing to the imagination.  The second was that Gigant spurts were sudden and dramatic, able to occur, well, whenever Ruby saw fit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe final detail was that the little people were in awe or fear of the Gigants, as Ruby\u2019s two bullies from earlier, in this reality, bragged about their strength until they saw the colossus in front of them, at which point they cried and begged to not be squashed.  Lucky for them, Ruby was content with seeing the two braggarts shake in fear whenever she walked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this taken care of, the new queen of the Gigants stomped back to Beacon with her enormous hips swaying to and fro, thinking about what kind of team would be there to greet her.  Oh sure, her sister had to get in on the power, but what of her other teammates?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a spring in her earthshaking step, Ruby Rose headed back to the campus grounds to see what her changes had done.  With the new \u201creality\u201d of sorts filling in the blanks to the circumstances she had introduced, Ruby remembered she was looking for a spot for the team to practice that wouldn\u2019t put little people in danger, lest some random practice maneuvers result in her or Blake squashing an unfortunate little.  The others were probably wondering what took her so long.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of, Ruby began to piece together the backstories for the other members of her team.  Blake was still a cat Faunus with a quiet, aloof personality, but now she was 27 feet tall and almost as muscular as Yang, with her massive frame accentuating her entire body, particularly hips and legs that could send her flying forward like a bullet.  Slowly but surely she was warming up to the other members of the team, and while it was subtle, it was clear she was happy to be around people her own size, and Beacon gave her the opportunity to see other Gigants, something that wasn\u2019t present in her life before she came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat of course, left Weiss.  Teeny, tiny, Weiss.  Like Blake and Jaune, Ruby didn\u2019t want to change aspects of her personality or backstory, otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be the Weiss she remembered.  Weiss, unlike the others, wasn\u2019t a Gigant, but one of the little people.  She believed that she was the strongest and most capable of all of the students present, but was quickly rid of that belief when Ruby picked her up between two fingers the first day they met.  (Not in a mean way, she reasoned to herself, but a curious one).  Being the smallest among a team of gigantic, muscled huntresses in training had made Weiss focus intently on her studies, while trying to grapple with the feeling of being physically outclassed in every way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd according to her own rewrite, they were waiting for her at the front gate.  Weiss standing at the feet of Blake and Yang, who both were wearing the same tight of Gigant-friendly workout clothes as Ruby, clothes that complimented their enormous sizes, and made Weiss\u2019 prim and proper outfit seem even more out of place.  Little people would occasionally get a look at the two shapely Gigants before quickly moving to keep out of their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d Yang said.  \u201cYou were gone all morning.  I was starting to wonder what happened.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on Yang, you know I\u2019m a big girl.  I can take care of myself.  It was just harder than normal to find a spot to practice.  But I found one!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we better get going then,\u201d Yang said.  \u201cWe\u2019ve only got a few hours before the afternoon lecture.\u201d  Blake nodded in agreement, before extending her hand to the comparatively tiny Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s quicker this way,\u201d Blake said.  \u201cRemember when you tried walking to keep up with us and almost got lost in the forest?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d Weiss said with a groan as she accepted the boost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then,\u201d Ruby said, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d  She couldn\u2019t wait to see the dynamic of her team with their new scales in place.</span></div></div>",

Due to its substantial Gigant population, a specific section of road was kept aside for little pedestrians and vehicles on an elevated surface so they would be more easily noticed by passing Gigants.  Naturally Gigants had most of the road to themselves, walking muscled towers that no little would dare try to impede lest they be crushed underfoot.  The only way to travel on a Gigant road would be like Weiss was doing reluctantly, being perched on Blake\u2019s shoulder safe from the girls\u2019 thumping feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut besides that, it was a regular road, and judging by the sound, it meant others could catch up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPhyrrha?  What are you doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 29 foot tall redhead with muscles big enough to upend a small town and chuck it into orbit smiled as she began to slow her pace and walk alongside the others.  She was wearing the same T-shirt and short combination as the others, only in the colors of her armor from before the changes were made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was looking for somewhere to train with Jaune.  Our old spot was a bit too close to some little people houses and they filed a noise complaint with Beacon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLucky for you, we found a spot!\u201d Ruby proudly declared.  \u201cFollow me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe P in Team JNPR smiled at the girls as she walked alongside them, while Ruby, unknown to the others present, subtly began to fill in her backstory.  Unlike Team RWBY, only half of Team JNPR were Gigants, her and Jaune.  Phyrrha was helping Jaune get his skills up to snuff in private, the boy\u2019s natural strength from being a Gigant with muscles comparable to anyone save Ruby (But no force in the world was going to be as big or muscular as she was), and useful, if not flashy Semblance, was hampered by his distinct lack of skill in using that power.  Luckily he had a great tutor and a drive to learn everything that he admittedly should have known before coming to Beacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was also clear to anyone save the thickheaded boy that Pyrrha had a thing for Jaune, and Ruby was happy to show them a space they could be alone.  She couldn\u2019t have been the only one who thought they would make a cute couple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI appreciate it Ruby,\u201d Phyrrha said, her muscles idly flexing as she walked with the girls.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, really,\u201d Yang said.  \u201cGigants should look out for each other, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose you\u2019re right.  It\u2019s still annoying when you think you\u2019ve found a spot, only to find out that it\u2019s too close to an area with little people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t blame yourself,\u201d Blake said.  \u201cIt\u2019s not our fault their buildings and bodies can be so fragile.\u201d  Turning to Weiss, she offered a quick, but sincere \u201csorry.\u201d  Weiss said nothing, but it was clear that she was bothered by the huge women speaking so dismissively of normal sized people despite her best attempts to hide it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell just know that we\u2019re happy to share!\u201d Ruby said.  \u201cAs long as we haven\u2019t called dibs on the place first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we\u2019re almost there!\u201d Ruby said.  \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</span></div></div>",

We were just getting some last minute preparations done before we met up with Pyrrha to train. It looks like we all had the same idea.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like it!\u201d the scarlet colossus giggled.<br>\r\nNora Jumped up from her seat.<br>\r\n\u201c  Come on! Lets get going! I wanna see some giants flex!!!\u201d the hammer wielder punctuated this statement with a crab flex.<br>\r\nRen didn't say anything, maintaining his calm demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone began doing various exercises.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang was doing one armed push ups while carrying massive boulders on her back.<br>\r\nBlake was practicing with Some kind of new technique involving her duplication semblance. <br>\r\nJaune and Pyrrha were going through some combat drills and refreshing themselves on their fundamentals.<br>\r\nAnd Weiss, Nora, and Ren were sparring with each other.<br>\r\nRuby found the sight quite enjoyable, everyone just working and training together, But she knew what would make this moment even  better.<br>\r\nShe focused on her semblance, playing the trump card she made when she created this scenario.<br>\r\nThe colossal girl felt her body fill with a pleasant warmth, energy suffusing every cell in her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby cooed as her muscles bulked up, doubling and tripling in size and beyond.<br>\r\nHer curves ballooned from their already massive size to even more absurd levels.<br>\r\nAnd finally her towering form inched up higher and higher to dizzying new heights.<br>\r\nPleasure coursed through her being, her moans shook the very land increasingly more intense as she gained in size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026\u2026..good!\u201d the silver eyed giantess gasped out.<br>\r\nRuby let out a sigh of satisfaction as she basked in the after glow of the growth spurt.<br>\r\nLooking  down at herself, she saw that she had grown to 120 feet of height, three times what she was before!<br>\r\nThis put a smile on Ruby's face.<br>\r\nShe also noticed that she was in nothing but her bright red underwear, not that she cared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of loud moans and stretching clothes caught the Titaness's attention, her fellow Gigants were finishing up their own growth spurts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Yang was trying to finish off her 200th set, the familiar sensation of an oncoming growth spurt  filled her being.<br>\r\n\u201cMore *grunt* power huh? Alright then, GIVE IT TO ME!! \u201c<br>\r\nHer push ups became faster and faster  as the boulders seemed to shrink on top of her back and her rapidly expanding tits a great cushion beneath her, her grunts of effort became intermingled with groans of pleasure that made the earth quake and rumble even harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake stopped mid sword swing from  the clearly sexual sounds her partner was making only to double over as the very same sensations overcame her.<br>\r\n\u201c A-Another spurt? And it's so powerful too!\u201d<br>\r\nThe Black cat faunus's body stretched upwards while her hips, thighs, and ass piled on more and  more mass along with her muscles. <br>\r\nIt was all she could do to keep herself from raising her own voice into Rumbling cries of ecstasy.<br>\r\nMuch like their fellow Gigants, Jaune and Pyrrha were preoccupied with their own growth.<br>\r\nThe white knight's impervious pectorals became even more massive and even his junk swelled outwards wildly.<br>\r\nThe Spartan's mighty back widened  alongside her bulking shoulders while her ass grew thicker and firmer from expanding glutes.<br>\r\nAnd both of their bodies grew taller and taller. They didn't bother to stifle their moans<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll while this was happening, the three little people watched in awe at the spectacle, with a little bit of worry thrown in in Weiss's case, she had never seen so many Gigants experience a spurt in the same place before and never this greatly either.<br>\r\nThe growth spurt would eventually Peter out with the Gigants standing at their monstrous new statures.<br>\r\nBy the heiress\u2019s best assessments, she figured that Ruby, Yang , Blake, Pyrrha, and Jaune were now 120, 79, 72, 76, and 75 Feet in height respectively. <br>\r\nShe also noticed that their clothes were pulled so taut across their bodies that they appeared in danger of snapping off and left nothing to the imagination, her face became beet red when she saw that her leader was wearing nothing but a Red bra and panties, also being stretched to their limits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery Gigant present was admiring their new bodies with wonder and curiosity at the new depths of power that they possessed.<br>\r\n\u201cOh yeah, I'm definitely digging this!\u201d Yang said as she flexed both of her arms in a double bicep pose.<br>\r\nBlake gave her behind a good shake.<br>\r\n\u201c I'd have to agree.\u201d<br>\r\nPyrrha flexed her massive lats in a double bicep pose of her own.<br>\r\n\u201cMore power is always welcome!\u201d<br>\r\nJaune stood there making his pecs bounce in a side chest pose  with a self satisfied smile on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA great shadow was cast upon them at moment.<br>\r\nThey all looked up to see the Half naked hulking form of Ruby looming over them.<br>\r\nThe scarlet girl smiled down at them, basking in their looks of awe<br>\r\nThey the four smaller Gigants stood there astonished by the silver eyed colossus's sheer size, the fact that she was in only her underwear compounded this.<br>\r\nThe two boys blushed at the sight only for JNPR\u2019s Amazon to cover the blonde knight\u2019s eyes while Nora bopped Ren on the head.<br>\r\nMeanwhile Yang walked up to her sister while Weiss looked on mortified and Blake blushed heavily.<br>\r\n\u201c Wow. Guess growing so much bigger than everyone else can have its down sides Huh.\u201d The blonde brawler said motioning towards the Crimson haired girl\u2019s indecent state.<br>\r\nRuby just waved it off.<br>\r\n\u201c I don't really mind. Besides, it's a crime to cover up a body like this!\u201d <br>\r\nRuby punctuated this statement with a single flex of her right arm, the bicep  bulged to immense proportions.<br>\r\nThis caused Yang to chuckle.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat ever your say Rubes.\u201d<br>\r\nThe blonde brawler went back to her feline partner's side and started talking to her all the weights she could probably lift now.<br>\r\n Ruby felt seemingly boundless energy course through her veins, she felt as though she could carry the entire world on her shoulders .<br>\r\nAnd yet, she wanted more.<br>\r\nThe only problem was that she already used the \u201cGigant spurt\" card and couldn't use it again so soon after the fact without it creating suspicion.<br>\r\nShe wracked her brain for a solution.<br>\r\nSuddenly, she got an idea.<br>\r\nA very awesome idea.<br>\r\nOnce  more that day, she focused on her semblance and made a few more adjustments to the timeline.<br>\r\nRuby opened her eyes and found that nothing had appeared to have changed but just to make sure.<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys. Remember my semblance?\u201d<br>\r\nYang turned to face her.<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean the thing that allows you to alter the form, traits, and properties of stuff at will? Yeah, what of it?\u201d<br>\r\nRuby's grin seemed to threaten to split her face, which made most everyone present quite concerned.<br>\r\n\u201cWell I've been working my butt off for while now training with it and I'm proud to say that I've reached a new level of power over my semblance!\u201d Ruby declared with pride in her voice.<br>\r\nThis got everyone's attention.<br>\r\n\u201cThat's awesome Ruby! Show us what you got.\u201d<br>\r\nRuby had to think for a second on how to demonstrate her power.<br>\r\nHer face twisted into a very suggestive grin when a very lewd idea came to her.</span></div></div>",

Where we compete in a series of challenges designed to test our new limits!\u201d the titanic girl declared theatrically.<br>\r\n\u201cOh and before you ask, I will not be participating in these games directly.\u201d Ruby added realizing the inherently unfair advantage she would have.<br>\r\nYang was still feeling very much overwhelmed by what was happening but she couldn't lie to herself about not feeling curious.<br>\r\n\u201cOkay then. Let's say we all agreed to playing this game of yours.

What do you guys think? It might even be fun.\u201d <br>\r\nThe other Gigants spent a few minutes considering the pros and cons of such an offer before finally settling on a decision.<br>\r\n\u201cIf you're going to participate, then I'm game\" Said Blake, still very much unsure about the whole thing.<br>\r\nPyrrha was on the fence about it but agreed as well.<br>\r\n\u201c this does sound interesting so I'll give it a try!\u201d<br>\r\nJaune simply shrugged. <br>\r\n\u201c I'll take a crack at it.\u201d<br>\r\nRuby brought her hands together with glee.<br>\r\n\u201c Excellent! Let's get started right away!\u201d she exclaimed happily.<br>\r\nBefore she could do anything however, Nora piped up from down below.<br>\r\n\u201cNow wait just one darn second! You guys can't start a game and not include us!\u201d Nora shouted , speaking for her fellow little people who didn't ask for it.<br>\r\nNora continued her righteously indignant tirade before they could stop her though.<br>\r\n\u201cYou think just because you guys have bigger bods you can just dismiss us? That's discrimination!\u201d Nora declared in a accusatory tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby took a moment to consider what the hammer wielder said.<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what? Your right!\u201d<br>\r\nRuby once more donned a  look of concentration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three little people watched the Crimson Gigant\u2019s furrowed expression wondering what she intended to do.<br>\r\nThey were caught off guard when a strange warmth suddenly spread throughout their bodies .<br>\r\nNothing seemed to happen at first, but when their clothes started to feel uncomfortably tight, it became apparent to them what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were growing bigger!<br>\r\nAlmost as if in response to their collective revelation, the growth began to accelerate!<br>\r\nThe bodies larger and larger while the three hunters looked on in disbelief.<br>\r\nThey also noticed that they weren't just growing in size but also in musculature as well!<br>\r\nAlong with other things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, their growth began to slow down before  stopping all together.<br>\r\nBoth Nora and Ren now both stood at  74 feet tall while Weiss stood at 75 and all three of them were now unbelievably muscular and were possessed of truly exaggerated sexual characteristics.<br>\r\nThey were also only in their underwear, Ruby remembered to grow those as well at the last second. <br>\r\nHer fellow Gigants gawked at such a display  of power.<br>\r\nThe three former little people had mixed responses .<br>\r\nRen felt thoroughly dumbfounded  by his transformation  while Nora was completely enamored by it.<br>\r\nMeanwhile Weiss was predictably having a breakdown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHoly crap this is awesome!\u201d<br>\r\n Nora said excitedly while performing a series of poses in her bright pink bra and panties.<br>\r\nRen stood there in his emerald boxers in silent awe not really paying attention to what the hyper active girl was saying .<br>\r\nOn the other hand Weiss was hastily trying, and failing, to cover up herself and her stylized ice blue underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c W-W-W-WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO US RUBY!?\u201d <br>\r\nWeiss boomed, causing massive earthquakes to shake the entire forest all the way to the School grounds and even the city and causing massive fissures appear all over the landscape.<br>\r\nWeiss quickly clamped her hand over her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby Beamed  at the trio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI turned you all into Gigants.\u201d She said matter-of-factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss looked up at Ruby in mind twisting disbelief .<br>\r\n\u201cY-YOU CAN JUST DO THAT!?\u201d <br>\r\nWeiss once again boomed, causing yet another earthquake to tear through the land  and creating even more fissures.<br>\r\nShe clamped her mouth shut again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYep!\u201d Ruby said nonchalantly.<br>\r\nWeiss stood in place in a stupefied posture.<br>\r\nThis was insane.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crimson haired Titaness stood up to her full towering height.<br>\r\nShe grinned down at her friends with her hands on her fertility idol like hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Now that that's settled,  lets get started!\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The clearing they had found to practice in was dead in the middle of the forest, with roving packs of Grimm and wild animals by the area.  It made any little person sized exploration extremely dangerous for the unskilled, but for the girls it amounted to a slight annoyance from small rodents.  Other than that, it was an ideal workout ground, varied terrain, lots of sunlight for those tall enough to not be overshadowed by the trees, and plenty of space.  Pyrrha appeared to be impressed as well, breathing in the air with a smile.  The only one who seemed concerned was Weiss, whose discomfort with being among Gigants was starting to peak, her attempts to hide it failing as the girls warmed up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor some reason, this reaction made Ruby giggle, not because she disliked Weiss, but because it was interesting to see the prideful and composed heiress clearly out of her element.  In fact, seeing it made Ruby think of the last change to the world that she was keeping in her pocket just for a situation like this.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had gotten a taste of how dramatically the world had changed due to her and her friends increased height and muscles, and now she wanted more.  More size, more muscle, and more power to accentuate the difference between Gigants and little people.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo while the team and their guest were warming up with sparring, Yang suddenly stopped, bending over slightly.  Blake and Phyrrha were next to follow, with Ruby feeling the effects last.  Back on campus, the other Gigants, such as Jaune, were also likely feeling the start of what was coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOoooh!\u201d Yang said, but her face showed no discomfort.  Instead she showed a wide grin, feeling her muscles engorge and her body expand.  \u201cMore power!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother spurt?\u201d Blake asked.  \u201cIt feels...pleasant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPleasant, but powerful,\u201d Phyrrha said.  \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ve ever come on this strong before!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was lost in the pleasure of the spurt she had started, feeling herself engorge and expand.  It was transcendent in a bizarre way, as there became more of her.  More size, more muscles, and just more of her body.  It must have been how an animal felt after shedding its skin, or after a caterpillar emerged from a cocoon to become a butterfly.  She was leaving her old, smaller self behind and emerging as something bigger and better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u201cSo...strong!\u201d Was all she could say as her body expanded to new proportions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile on the ground, Weiss\u2019 discomfort turned into full blown fear as she saw her friends grow  even larger.  She knew that Gigant spurts were unpredictable, and she had seen them during her time at Beacon, but never this many, this close, and above all, this much.  She began to feel like a bug in comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the spurts had finished, and luckily for the girls, their attire had performed in its job admirably, stretching to the limit but keeping the Gigants and their new scales clothed.  Yang was the first one to look at her new body, clearly impressed by what she saw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, check these guns out!\u201d Yang cheered as she flexed her enormous arms.  \u201cI\u2019ve gotta be at least twice as big as before!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt looks like we\u2019ve all more than doubled in size,\u201d Blake said, looking on at her monolithic legs and huge hips.  \u201cBoth in height, and in muscle.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDoes this happen every time you come out here?\u201d Phyrrha asked as she looked on at her new frame, flexing a back that was powerful enough to hold the entirety of the campus on it.  \u201cBecause we will run out of room at Beacon quickly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomehow I doubt it,\u201d Yang said, as she continued to flex, hearing her voice reverberate with a deeper but still undeniably feminine tone.  \u201cToo bad though, I\u2019m even bigger than Ruby.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSORRY YANG,\u201d Ruby\u2019s voice bellowed before she adjusted it, looking down at the others before going into a crab flex to show off her enormous upper body.  \u201cI\u2019m still the BIG sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig is right,\u201d Blake joked.  Using the trees as a guideline, the estimate of the girls more than doubling their size was correct.  Yang had gone from 30 to 69 feet, her from 27 to 62, Phyrrha from 28 to 66, and Ruby from 40 a whopping 92 feet tall.  Their muscle mass had also proportionally increased, complimenting their figures while making them appear unmatched in power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHuh, don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ll ever let me the bigger one,\u201d Yang joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNope!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all laughed, deep bellowing laughs that shook the forest and made Weiss feel even smaller at their feet.  Looking up at the girls, she did her best to not show fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat was...something alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething great!\u201d Yang said, flexing an astronomical bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, sure.  But after that, should we get back to training?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Her fellow Gigants returned her enthusiasm with nods of confirmation. Meanwhile poor Weiss found herself knocked down on the ground with her ears ringing from her leader's earthshaking voice. At this point Wiess was regretting not declining her roommate's offer to train with them. It was obvious to anyone watching that she was clearly out of her depth But Nooooo, she just HAD to prove that she could keep up! \u201cDamn my stupid pride.\u201d The Schnee heiress thought to herself.<br>\r\n Meanwhile Ruby thought  of a brilliant idea to have some fun. <br>\r\n\u201c Hey guys  You know what I'm thinking?\u201d the red tinted asked with a playful  glint in her eyes.<br>\r\nYang recognized that look. It was the same look the towering teen wore whenever she was planning something mischievous.  <br>\r\n\u201cNo\u2026 what are you thinking?\u201d the blonde brawler responded cautiously.<br>\r\nRuby\u2019s face split into a wide grin. \u201cI'm thinking we break in our new bods with a little sparring match!\u201d the scarlet huntress exclaimed, she was itching to give her body a test drive after all the changes she made.<br>\r\nHer fellow classmates on the other hand did not share her enthusiasm, responding to her suggestion with  exasperated sighs and groans.  <br>\r\n\u201c Awww come on guys! I really want to see what we are capable of now!\u201d  Ruby whined.<br>\r\nHer teammates were having none of it though.  <br>\r\n\u201cFat chance sis! We've been down this road before and I'm not gonna waste my time.\u201d The blonde bombshell said in a voice used to her sister's  antics.<br>\r\n \u201cYang's right Ruby, you'd just win as usual.\u201d Blake said  as she  cleaned the dirt off her weapons (she would have to have them readjusted to her new size later)<br>\r\n\u201c I tend to have to agree with the others. I\u2019m not really in the mood to get flattened by the \"Queen of the Gigants.\u201d  The Spartan warrior quoted.  <br>\r\n\u201c You guys are no fun!\u201d  Ruby pouted with her arms crossed over her massive chest like a little kid who was told she wouldn't get to  have her favorite candy. The sight was actually pretty comical considering her titanic physique.<br>\r\n\u201cOk how about this?  You guys can team up against me and are allowed to use any tactic and method you see fit. In fact I won't even move from this  spot.\u201d Ruby tried to reason with them.<br>\r\n\u201cRuby-\" <br>\r\n\u201cOk fine! I\u2019ll make  you a deal. If you can make me move from this spot I do what ever menial tasks you decide to give me for a month!\u201d The silver eyed huntress bargained.<br>\r\n \u201cI really don't think this is a good idea.\u201d The eldest xiaolong sibling said, doubt evident in her voice.<br>\r\n\u201cOh come on! It's not like anyone's going to get seriously injured right? I'll make sure if it!<br>\r\nAs she said this she made a another change to reality. She granted herself the ability to increase the durability of anyone or anything she wills to astronomical levels which she now passes off as her semblance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang looked unsure of herself. \u201c I don't know Rubes\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPllleeeaase?\u201d Ruby  pleaded, giving  her friends the most pathetic  puppy dog eyes she could muster.<br>\r\n The three  smaller gigants  spent the next three minutes weighing the pros and cons of their leader/friend's proposal before finally coming to a decision.<br>\r\nYang shrugged \u201dAh what the hell I'll give it a shot. Your on Rubels!  What do you guys say?\u201d Yang motioned towards the other two gigants who were still on the fence about this whole thing.<br>\r\nRuby looked pleadingly into their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake hesitated for a  few seconds before finally  coming to a decision . \u201c Well If Yang's ok with it then I guess I'll join in too.\u201d<br>\r\nThe three massive maidens  turned toward Pyrrha. <br>\r\nConfronted by her classmates expectant gazes, the Mistral champion let out a sigh.<br>\r\n\u201c If I\u2019m out voted then I guess I\u2019ll play along.\u201d The Spartan girl stretched her arms over her head to work out any kinks, giving a magnificent display of her mighty rack and abs as she did. <br>\r\n\u201c I could use the work out anyway.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cOh thank you, thank you, thank you!\u201d Ruby shouted ecstatically,  clapping her hands and jumping up and down like the schoolgirl she was. Incidentally as she was doing she was once again causing small earthquakes. Weiss, having just recovered from her previous spill was once again thrown for a loop as the very earth shook with enough force to violently throw her to the ground.<br>\r\n Ruby was about to get started with the sparring session when she remembered  something important.<br>\r\n\u201c Crap I almost forgot!\u201d the  young huntress stomped her way towards her little friend's position and crouched down before her. <br>\r\nWeiss was picking herself off the ground for the second time this morning when she was startled by the vast shadow that was suddenly cast upon her. Weiss craned head up to meet the gaze of her first friend and leader, which was partially obscured by her titanic tits.<br>\r\n\u201c Hey Weiss! me and the girls are going to spar for a bit and since it might be troublesome for you considering the disparity between our sizes, I don't mind if you decide to sit this one out.\u201d Ruby said, trying to be considerate of her comparatively tiny friend.<br>\r\nWeiss's mind was  in a buzz.<i>\u201cAlright,this is your chance to leave Weiss! She's given you an out. You don't have anything to prove so just take it and leave!\u201d</i><br>\r\n\u201cNo!! I will Not  \u201c Sit this one out\" Ruby Rose!\u201d Weiss cried out in righteous indignation.<br>\r\nBeacon\u2019s resident ice queen dug her heels into the ground. \u201c I will prove to you and everyone here that I am more than capable of pulling my weight on this team!!!! <br>\r\n<i>\u201cGods damn it Weiss!!\u201d</i>she internally cursed at herself.<br>\r\nRuby gave the heiress an incredulous look. \u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d the crimsonette inquired.<br>\r\n\u201cYes I'm very sure.\u201d Weiss answered firmly. <br>\r\nRuby was not convinced. \u201cAre you rrrreeeaaally sure?\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cYes! yes I'm sure! Just get  on with it already you dolt!\u201d Weiss shouted angrily in annoyance.<br>\r\nRuby stared at the icy girl for a good before  eventually shrugging.<br>\r\n\u201cSuit yourself.\u201d Ruby  got up and made her way to her position for the exercise.<br>\r\nAs Weiss observed the hypnotic sashay her leader's titanic hips and ass, she was already regretting her admittedly foolhardy decision. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat have I gotten myself into this time?\u201d The Icy huntress mumbled to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later and everyone is in their agreed upon positions, assuming battle stances.<br>\r\nRuby meanwhile stands before her opponents triumphantly with her hands on her hips. <br>\r\nThe Titaness smirked down at them. \u201cAll right. Lets get this started!!\u201d<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Before the girls all got into position, Yang spoke with her group, trying their best to figure out a strategy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can\u2019t go toe to toe with Ruby to move her, especially now that she\u2019s even bigger.  If we\u2019re going to have chance against her, we need to hit her from all angles and try and surprise her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s four of us and one of her,\u201d Weiss said from her perch on Blake\u2019s shoulder.  \u201cWhat we should do is create a distraction in the front.  Blake and I are ideal for that with out semblances.  Then you two, as the strongest here, each go for one of her legs.  If you two ram into them at the same time, you should be able to knock her over right on that huge, huge, huge...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, Weiss?\u201d Blake asked, worried that something had come over their little partner.  While she had nothing against the heiress, and appreciated her help with studies, she was more than a bit worried about a little person trying to go head to head with a Gigant, despite her insistence on training with her massive team members.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Weiss said, clearing her throat.  \u201cAnyway, if both Yang and Phyrrha attack while Ruby is distracted, your new bodies should have enough power to knock her right over, and out of her little circle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s as good as plan as we\u2019ve got,\u201d Phyrrha said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, with everyone in position, the four girls looked on at the grinning titaness; hands on her hips as she waited for the assault.  Unfortunately for Weiss, the little huntress realized exactly what the physical difference was between her and Ruby, causing her to shake in terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was unaware of the girls plans, or Weiss\u2019 immense regret about agreeing to spar with Gigants that had grown larger than a six story building for little people.  She was filled with a giddy energy, wanting to see just how much raw power she now had in comparison to her teammates.  The thought caused her to giggle, which was the final straw for Weiss\u2019 resolve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAHHHH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss, wait!\u201d Blake shouted, but it was too late.  The heiress had leapt forward as quickly as her legs and glyph could take her, propelling her like a bullet into the air as she prepared to strike with as many attacks as her weapon and glyphs would allow.  Unfortunately for Weiss, she soon realized the foolishness of her strategy as Ruby merely reached out and grabbed her in her massive hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFE, FI, FO FUM,\u201d she giggled aloud, \u201cI CAUGHT A HUNTRESS AS BIG AS MY THUMB.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time, the other three charged forward, trying to think on the fly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss lost her nerve!\u201d Yang said.  \u201cNow what?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can still make the plan work!\u201d Blake said as she charged forward, using her semblance to create shadow clones and hoping the the numerical assault would at least confuse Ruby.  The assault was quickly noticed by the crimson huntress, who looked on at the tiny Weiss in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, but I\u2019m going to need both my free hands for this!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick throw, Ruby tossed Weiss into the air, the heiress screaming all the while, as one of her massive hands effortlessly batted aside two of Blake\u2019s shadow clones.  The actual Blake used the distraction to try and launch an attack on Ruby\u2019s torso, but found herself all but bouncing off their leader\u2019s immense, thick muscle.  Ruby couldn\u2019t help but smile at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy turn!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby, come o...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one front push kick, all 62 feet of Blake was sent flying out of the clearing on top of the trees, causing the titaness to marvel at her raw power.  Luckily she had ensured no one would be hurt during the exercise, because that kick could have turned a six story hill into powder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby wasn\u2019t the only one thinking about her raw strength and size as Weiss yelled, flying through the air until she hit something soft and thankfully yielding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha!  You okay Weiss?  Weiss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the heiress she was holding against her chest, Yang saw that Weiss was clearly spent mentally.  She shook her head at the tiny heiress, wondering what possessed her to challenge her sister directly given the immense size and strength difference.  In a weird, dumb kind of way it was admirable for a little person to want to challenge a Gigant directly, but challenging Ruby head on before was a bad idea.  After she had more than doubled in size and muscle it was nothing short of idiotic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, no time to worry about bravery vs stupidity.  Gently placing Weiss on the ground where she wouldn\u2019t be accidentally stomped, Yang returned to the task at hand.  And with Blake and Weiss were out of it for now It meant Phyrrha and her had to try and knock Ruby out of her circle without the benefit of a distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStick to the plan!\u201d Yang yelled as she charged towards Ruby\u2019s right leg.  Phyrrha nodded as she went for the left.  Interestingly, Ruby didn\u2019t prepare any defense, more curious if she could stand up to what the two girls were about to do.  Yang grinned to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou always were a bit too confident,\u201d Yang said to herself as she charged the leg.  With Phyrrha in synch, both girls tackled Ruby\u2019s legs with enough force to topple a mountain.  They could only hope the muscle mountain that was the leader of Team RWBY would fall as well.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As she began to sway to and fro, Ruby began to regret not paying attention to the attack from all sides.  Between the three Gigants pushing against her legs, the ice on the ground causing her to slip, and the Arma Gigas Weiss had summoned, she was rapidly losing her balance, swinging her massive arms back and forth comically in a desperate attempt to stay upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKeep pushing!\u201d Yang yelled.  \u201cWe\u2019ve almost got her!\u201d  The other Gigants grunted in agreement, moving against the monolith that was their team leader as she struggled to stay upright.  Even with their new, bigger bodies, pushing against Ruby was exhausting, but none of the team were set to give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her position below her massive teammates and Pyrrha, Weiss grinned.  If they could just knock Ruby over onto that humongous butt of hers, she would be completely out of the circle she had to defend.  Victory would be theirs, Weiss would have something to lord over the mountainous team leader forever, and she wouldn\u2019t have to do chores for a month.  Directing the ice and Gigas to push, she felt victory was in hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby meanwhile, was realizing she was going to fall over in a matter of seconds.  She had to accept that.  But what she didn\u2019t have to accept was falling the way they wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore ice!\u201d Weiss yelled.  \u201cThat will tip her!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the ice form under her feet, Ruby put her plan into action.  She used the ice to allow herself to fall forward, right on top of the group.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook out below!\u201d She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook out!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMove!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the huge shadow loom over, Weiss began to move as quickly as she could, but it was too late.  With a mighty thud, Ruby hit the floor chest first with enough force to shake the ground as far as the campus.  Looking around, she realized that falling forward had kept most of her body in the circle.  She was also very glad the durability semblance was present for the girls, lest they be crushed under countless tons of muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, that was something, huh guys?  Uh, guys?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, Yang was the first to recover, poking her head out from underneath Ruby\u2019s massive breasts.  Her face clearly showed annoyance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDammit Rubes!  We almost won!  You couldn\u2019t fall backwards and just give it to us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat kind of a team leader would I be if I just let you win?\u201d Ruby asked.  \u201cBesides, it was close!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling two other forms squirm underneath her chest, Ruby giggled as Pyrrha and Blake poked their heads out.  They didn\u2019t appear nearly as upset as she thought they would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen I said I didn\u2019t want to get flattened,\u201d Pyrrha said, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you were literally going to try to flatten me.  But still, that was definitely a good workout.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not hurt, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust my pride,\u201d the spartan girl said.  Blake nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCould you please get up?  It\u2019s kind of hard to talk when I can\u2019t move.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, right!\u201d Ruby said, lifting her massive form off the ground.  Free from Ruby\u2019s titanic chest, the other girls stood up and dusted themselves off, none the worse for wear, but all upset that the \u201cQueen of the Gigants\u201d had bested them again even with their new, bigger bodies.  Apparently the power boost didn\u2019t matter as long as Ruby was still the biggest by a clear margin, making it clear that brute force wouldn\u2019t be enough to win the day.  Still, all three girls were feeling closer to their goal of winning a match with Ruby than ever, so they couldn\u2019t bring themselves to be too upset.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of the others...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, where\u2019s Weiss?\u201d Blake asked.  The girls looked around, only to gasp when they saw her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was flat on the ground, having been crushed by Ruby\u2019s crotch when she fell, unhurt, but once again out of it, groaning as she finally freed herself from the ground.  Ruby covered her mouth in embarrassment as Yang laughed at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops!  Uh, sorry Weiss!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNew plan next time a pack of Grimm show up,\u201d Blake deadpanned.  \u201cWe push Ruby onto them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat might be overkill,\u201d Yang joked, causing Ruby to sigh a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won, so why does it feel like you guys beat me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cChin up Rubes,\u201d Yang said.  \u201cYou\u2019re pushing us...or crushing us, like a good leader should.\u201d  Ruby nodded, reasoning to herself that the team was improving if they were able to come up with a plan like that on the fly, and she was improving if she was able to beat them regardless with quick thinking.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the rather comically climactic ending to this bout it was safe to say that the girls had their fill with  training exercises today  and made their way back to school. Back at the campus grounds Ruby couldn't help but appreciate her most recent changes to reality. Almost every gigant had  more  than doubled in size, their massive bodies filling out their form fitting clothing more profoundly than they did earlier this morning. Their hyper muscular physiques, their immense bulges and curves and the way the \u201clittle people\u201d reacted to them, though nowhere near as impressive as her own bulk, the aspiring huntress ,nevertheless, found completely mesmerizing, tantalizing even. Ruby had to wipe saliva from her mouth as a hunger she had never really explored before began to take root. However she could indulge in<i>\u201cthat\u201d</i> later. For now though, she was content with exploring this new reality she created. Her friends and teammates decided to part ways for now  to take care of some business. Yang wanted to take a shower and clean off all the dirt and grime she accumulated from their contest earlier, Blake returned to their dorm to catch up on her reading, Pyrrha said that she had to meet up with her teammates, claiming that they agreed to do something together later today, and Weiss said, in a rather curt tone, that she had some studying to catch up on, most likely she wanted to get some serious personal training done if the events of today's activities  were anything to go by Ruby reasoned. With classes not being available today due to last minute renovations and her friends doing their own things, Ruby  was left alone with nothing to do. She pondered on what to do with herself for fifteen minutes before deciding that she would go surf the web at the school library to learn more about the world she created.  Ruby  was in awe at the size of the building. Scaled for gigant accessibility, it reminded the scarlet tinted girl more  of an  oversized amphitheater filled with books than an actual library. Ruby wandered the building for abit. Bookshelves as tall and wide as buildings covered every square inch of surface. The young woman figured that a little person could easily get lost in this place if they weren't careful. <br>\r\nAfter walking around for a bit, whilst basking in the gazes of her fellow classmates and school faculty members in awe of her titanically proportioned bod, she found  what she was looking for. A gigant scaled computer desk complete with PCs set neatly in a circular pattern. As she approached she found that the chairs and desks, despite being massive by normal standards in this world , were comically small before her Behemoth frame, Ruby chuckled at the site. Ruby had to use three of the gigant sized chairs in order to rest her epically scaled derriere comfortably which elicited another chuckle from the massive girl. Leaning rather uncomfortably forward in her seats, she typed in her password and got to looking for any hits on her web browser of choice.  One of the first things she learned was that ever since the advent of gigants, the four kingdoms have had to spend billions of taxpayer lien in order to provide them with basic amenities such as  food,water, clothing, and shelter. This coupled with the reality of Gigant growth spurts have given rise to fears of a global economic crisis . Ruby decided to note that tidbit of information for later.  The second thing she learned was that the Gigant population have been invaluable in mankind's battle against the grimm, the unbelievable power their towering frames afforded to them allowed them to make short work of the creatures of darkness. As a result civilization has seen a period of growth and expansion the likes of which it has never seen before. Some settlements have even been built around wherever a gigant has made their home. Many have taken it a step further by creating nomadic caravans that follow wandering gigants around wherever they go. Ruby found that bit of information very interesting and decided she would definitely look into that later. The third and final thing she learned was that many of the world's truly powerful gigants are regarded as something akin to living weapons of mass destruction and as such are registered with the  governments of the four kingdoms. Ruby found this as something of a shock but not really when she thought about it. Briefly she went to check on her scroll and, sure enough, she found a document labeling her as a \u201c Person of Mass Destruction\u201d and the relevant legal information along with it. This both surprised and amused Ruby greatly.<i>\u201c Wow. Guess I\u2019m a pretty big deal huh?\u201d</i>Ruby thought to herself. Driven by curiosity, the silver eyed girl typed in her own name. She was quite surprised when she found that  her inquiry returned eighty million hits!  She clicked on the most recent article and began to read. What she found made her very  intrigued.  Most of it were things she already knew. She was one of the first gigants recorded and was the largest and most powerful  on record but what really raised an eyebrow was that she was regarded as something of a celebrity and as a living landmark, that last one made Ruby blush a little. Apparently many people come far and wide just to get a glimpse of the towering beauty, Vale has made millions of lien from tourism thanks to her. Ruby had to admit that she was a little embarrassed about being a living tourist attraction but was also quite flattered. This next one however really surprised her. There are rumors of cults forming in the underbelly of society with Ruby as the center, worshipping her as a goddess and a harbinger of  a new age for the world. Ruby wasn't sure how to feel about that last one and decided to ponder it some other time. With her curiosity satiated for now, the young prodigy got up from her seats and made her way towards the exit. <br>\r\nThis was a lot of information to unpack, most of it sending her imagination into overdrive, she would definitely explore these scenarios later. Now though Ruby  was once again wondering what to do next.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><br>\r\nThere were so many questions that Ruby had for the world, and especially her own power.  The rise of Gigants had stretched the resources of the four kingdoms to their limits, but the rapid expansion of the population into areas previously held firmly by Grimm opened up land for resource use that would have been impossible in a word without them.  With the Gigants growing in size and number, it seemed that the world, at least for the moment, had reached a balance, albeit a rather delicate one.  If she changed the world again, such as giving the world a way to mass produce food and cattle, how would that affect society?  She had made it a point to not change the circumstances around her friends too greatly, lest the changes alter them so much they stop resembling her friends.  At the same time, if she could eliminate the worries of resource drain, there would be no limit to how big she could make herself or her fellow Gigants, and she greatly enjoyed being a towering, shapely colossus and the sight of such.  Walking out of the library, she had come to an important conclusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe really wanted some cookies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading on the road into town, and reasoning to herself that she would be better served looking at the city without her friends wondering if her big head had gotten a bump, she decided to head into the city to see how much it had changed in new reality, and to get some Gigant sized cookies.  <i>Those had better exis</i>t, she thought to herself, <i>Or I\u2019ll make them exist</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trip to the town was interesting, with passerby\u2019s on the \u201clittle people\u201d part of the road stopping or slowing down to observe the monolithic Ruby in all her muscular, busty glory head towards the city.  Once she had gotten into town, she noticed a similar setup, with roads and sections specifically for the Gigant population that were hastily being redone to account for their ever increasing scale.  Walking around to find the bakery, she noticed another unexpected sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake me back with you Ruby!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut me in your boobs Ruby!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA crowd of little people had cheered for her arrival, saying things both flattering and not so flattering as she walked through the entrance to the town.  Even a Gigant or two stopped what they were doing to stare and cheer for the titaness as she entered the city.  It was flattering but odd.  That being said, the two 60-something foot tall Gigant men cheering for her was quite the welcome sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she would deal with them later.  Her priority right now was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA bakery!\u201d she cheered, leaping into the air and causing a massive quake.  Many of the little people fell to the ground, but none of them seemed to mind, since they got to see Ruby\u2019s titanic tits bounce while she did.  Heading over to the bakery, she also noticed that none of the buildings showed any signs of strain.  She figured in this universe, buildings were probably reinforced from the get go to deal with the strain of Gigants walking around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe building didn\u2019t have a standard entrance for customers.  Instead, it was a window for customers similar to a drive thru, and both a menu and see through glass so people could see all the various treats for sale.  She was greeted by a Gigant who was sitting down to fit himself in the area, the growth spurt from earlier putting space at a premium.  If she had to guess, he was working here as a part time job while attending Beacon.  Given the height of the building compared to her own enormous frame, she had to bend over to see the window, giving the crowd behind her a great view of her massive rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby!  You\u2019re looking lovely today!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey there!  Tight fit?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know how the buildings have to keep being adjusted.  Especially when we have spurts like this.  I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s as bad for me as it is for you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll give you more head space by the end of the week.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope so.  So, what can I get you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA box of chocolate chip cookies!  Big ones!\u201d</span></div></div>",

How come!?\u201d The young  titaness shouted, a very unsubtle level of desperation in her voice. The man just shrugged. \u201cWe've had a massive back order on baking order for baking ingredients for a few weeks now and we have yet a single crate.\u201d The man readjusted the collar of his shirt. \u201dJust as well though. With the economic  crisis we're in right now,  the  kingdoms can't afford to expend any resources on anything as flagrant as confectionery treats. In fact, many bakeries and candy stores have had to close Down as a result.\u201d The man gave the girl the most apologetic look he could muster as he said this but it would do nothing  to make her feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cThis can't be! This won't be!!!! I refuse to live in a world without cookies!!!\u201d</i>the silver eyed colossus shouted in a mix of anger and defiance in her mind.  Yes. she would save her favorite treat. The only question was how. She didn't want to change things so much that her world stopped resembling her world, that was half the fun of this! She pondered on this conundrum for a few minutes until she  got a brilliant idea. She closed her eyes and called upon her true semblance and reshaped reality once more. She added a new component to the Gigant race in the form of an aura that passively  makes the  environment and everything in it astronomically  more fertile and more bountiful with the passage of time. The strength and range of effect of this aura is proportional to the size and strength of the Gigant.<br>\r\nWhen Ruby opened her eyes again she was overjoyed to see the shop was practically overflowing with baked goods of every kind, even Gigant scaled  ones!  The man came up to the counter again, this time with a huge smile on his face and, to Ruby's great delight, several stacks of massive Gigant scaled cookie boxes. <br>\r\nThe Titaness drooled at the sight. \u201cis it really okay for me to have all this?\u201d she inquired towards the clerk, finding it strange that he would give her so many boxes when she only paid for one. <br>\r\nThe Gigant man nodded. \u201c take them. There on the house! We've been experiencing a massive surplus of goods for awhile now. So much so infact  that we simply don't know what to do with them all! So were giving a bunch of boxes for free for every purchase!\u201d the man handed The Titaness the cookies  who was more than happy to take them off his hands. After saying goodbye, Ruby made her way down the with extra pep in her step, causing small earthquakes as did. The aspiring huntress had to pat herself on her back. Another problem solved thanks to her godly semblance! Once more she felt very silly for living in fear of her power for so long.<br>\r\n <i>\u201cOkay. I got my snacks! Now what?\u201d</i> the scarlet juggernaut thought to herself.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>With a spring in her step and several boxes of her favorite snack in hand, Ruby began looking through the city for something else to do.  Already she seemed to have improved the world substantially for the better, between giving humanity a weapon that could defeat the Grimm, ensuring no one would need to go without food or snacks, and giving the people of the city a great view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I earned this</i>, she thought, happily munching on cookies big enough for ten little people to have.  Walking down the road, she came across something that she couldn\u2019t help but be curious about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was an outdoor gym, scaled for Gigants.  The hypermuscular men and women strained against weights that would require industrial equipment to bring them over in pieces, as they overshadowed a much smaller building, presumably a gym for little people.  Considering all the questions she had about what her body was capable of, the Goliath of a girl figured it was worth a try.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys. Can I try?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe people at the various pieces of equipment gasped a bit, making Ruby wonder for a brief moment if they had done something wrong, before one of the guys hastily nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby!  Guess you wanted to try out your new body after the growth spurt, huh?   Good thing we kept enough weights around for everyone\u2019s new scale, but they might be a bit small for you...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll manage,\u201d she said, putting down her boxes of cookies and heading towards a squat rack, which in this case was a massive bar between two pillars.  Getting as low as possible so she could fit between the pillars, Ruby bent her legs, waiting for the bar to be readied.  With the other gym members loading the bar as heavy as it could go, Ruby raised her legs, and found it effortless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow,\u201d was all she could say before squatting the unfathomably heavy weight as if was a light bag.  She continued back and forth with her repetitions, the colossus\u2019s massive legs effortlessly moving the weight around.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to Ruby, as she did so, a crowd of little people began to form around the gym, all eager to see her demonstrate her power (and not minding the view of her gigantic ass as she squatted).  When she finished 100 repetitions and put the bar back, the crowd was more than noticeable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, you guys don\u2019t mind, right?\u201d she asked while holding her head with her arm.  \u201cI didn\u2019t ask them to come, really!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd all nodded, with one of the guys saying \u201cIt\u2019s good for business.\u201d  Smiling and nodding at the support, Ruby moved on to a bench and a bar that held enough weight to make it droop on the edges.  Yet the massive girl was able to lift it fairly effortlessly.  After the 80th rep, she finally began to feel a burn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I can\u2019t believe how light this feels!</i>  She began to wonder if there was any limit to her strength when a slight ticklish sensation formed on her midsection.  Putting the bar up, she noticed an odd sight.  It was a little person who had climbed on the equipment while she was zoned out, presumably to feel the shapely colossus up close.  She began to turn a deep shade of red when two fingers lifted the little voyeur from his spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, you know the rules.  You can look, but you can\u2019t touch without a girl\u2019s permission.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up from her place on the bench, Ruby turned her head to see who had caught the little pervert.</span></div></div>",

It's you!\u201d The young goliath shouted happily in excitement, accidentally shaking the earth and shattering many windows as well as nearly bursting the eardrums of the surrounding \u201clittle people\u201d when she did. Ruby gave a sheepish apology before turning back to her friend. Juane and his 65 foot self smiled warmly at Ruby who was also glad to see her. <br>\r\n\u201c You know. One of these days you're gonna have to get a handle on those outbursts of yours. That is if you don't mind procuring property damage bills for the city\" Juane  jabbed at Ruby albeit in good faith.<br>\r\nRuby's face was beet red \u201cYeah I'll keep that in mind.\u201d She scratched the back of her head as she said this. Her chipper attitude immediately returned afterwards. <br>\r\n\u201c So what brings you here?\u201d the silver eyed colossus inquired her fellow team leader. As she did she noted the boy's incredibly shredded body. It was magnificent even by most Gigant standards, she had made sure of that herself. Even so, this was the first time she actually saw it in person. She also noticed, to her delight, the very noticeable bulge in his elastic sweat pants.<br>\r\n\u201cUh.. Ruby?\u201d<br>\r\n\"Hmm-What!?\u201d Ruby yelped in surprise, shocked out of her  voyeuristic trance by her friend's voice, she also quickly  wiped her mouth off of any drool, praying that no one noticed the reason for her  distraction. <br>\r\n\u201cI was telling you about how  my team and I wanted to get  a workout in before we went out on our mission.\u201d The young man answered with a little bit of confusion towards his fellow leader's behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh right. Guess I was just lost in my thoughts.\u201d  Ruby  really  needed to get a handle on her libido, which was incredibly hard to do considering the fact she currently lived in a world born out of her deepest fantasies. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them chatted for a bit until they saw they saw the rest of  team JNPR enter the building .<br>\r\nPyrrha's 66 foot self, having changed into a cleaner set of  her outfit from earlier, greeted the two leaders from the entrance. Ruby also noticed the two forms of Nora and Ren sitting atop the Spartan girl's shoulders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora greeted Ruby with her usual bubbly energy and made a comment about how Ruby should \u201cshow  off the goods\" to her adoring fans and make a buttload of cash from it. This elicited another blush from Ruby and for Ren to chastise the hammer wielder. <br>\r\nThe three Gigants went to their gym equipment of choice and  began to work out with great gusto.<br>\r\n Pyrrha was going to town on the leg extension, moving  the mass of multiple city block with each curl in quick succession. <br>\r\nMeanwhile Juane was pumping out reps on the chest fly like a champ, the amount of force and pressure he generated  between his  mighty pectorals was enough to crush countless tons of coal into the hardest and purest of diamonds, outstripping  even the strongest of hydraulic and gas based pressure machines ever built by man by an astronomical margin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby, wanting to push herself even further, added five times the amount of weight on the bar then before, she used her durability semblance on it just to be safe.  She began to dead lift the weight with terrifying ease, pounding out reps at a speed  unheard of. Ruby driven further by curiosity, experimentally attempted to  lift  the weight with one arm and found that it was just as easy to so as it was with two. Everyone in the  gym,  her friends included, had their eyebrows raised in awe at the unimaginable  display of might. The scarlet tinted giantess smirked at their reaction and decided to show off in earnest. In a few moments she had procured a second Gigant scaled barbell identical to  the previous one and proceeded to lift both of them up effortlessly and began to curl them like oversized dumbbells. The crowd from before and the gym occupants audibly gasped at the sight. With one arm, the Silver eyed  colossus was pumping a weight that would've taken every other Gigant in the building working together to even begin to budge it and she doing easily with one arm and with two of them at that!<br>\r\nRuby almost didn't notice that the crowd around her had expanded greatly since she started, so in the zone she was.<br>\r\nWhen she finally finished, The scarlet goliath  dropped the two barbells on the ground, creating an earthquake that was felt throughout the city and even back at the school and leaving  sizable dents in the gym's reinforced floor. <br>\r\nWhen Ruby finally came down from the after glow of her work out, she noticed the quite disheveled appearance of the crowd and immediately knew what happened.<br>\r\n\u201cOops! Sorry everyone! Guess I...haha.. got a little carried away.\u201d Ruby sheepishly rubbed the back of her head as she said this.<br>\r\nA few minutes uncomfortably passed, everyone rendered speechless by what they saw.<br>\r\nJuane was the first person to regain his composure.  \u201cWow Ruby! You really are the Queen of the Gigants!\u201d Juane exclaimed with visible awe on his face. <br>\r\nRuby smiled at the compliment. \u201cHehe\u2026thank.\u201d Ruby said while blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby and team JNPR  continued their workouts for another two hours before they were satisfied , Ruby's fans being whipped up into an rapturous frenzy after her latest exploit all the while.<br>\r\nJuane and his teammates said their goodbyes to before making their  back to beacon to get ready for their mission. <br>\r\nAs Ruby left the gym she thought about what to do with the rest of her day .<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Team JNPR had departed to take care of that assignment, leaving Ruby feeling both impressed at her monumental power, and a bit hot and bothered at the sight of Jaune as a muscular Goliath.  She knew Pyrrah\u2019s feelings for the boy were unchanged, but would she mind sharing?  Hell, there\u2019s enough of her to go around, she could have the entirety of Team JNPR with her and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing deeply to take in everything, Ruby decided to head home, just so she could process the day and all the information about her world.  Not to mention it would be easier to prod her teammates subtly about what she wanted to do with JNPR rather than ask and find out she committed a major faux pass.  With that train of thought, the bright red from her face slowly faded as she headed home, hoping to ask the others about it.  Speaking of home...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wonder what Zwei\u2019s like in this universe?\u201d she idly thought on the walk back to Beacon.  Was he going to be a handheld doggy or a super sized pupper?  She hadn\u2019t seen anyone walking around with pets, let alone Gigant scale ones, but maybe she hadn\u2019t looked hard enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer admirers waved her off when she left the city, but even on the road, the occasional car would still stop to observe the colossus mid-walk in an attempt to see her titanic tits bounce or get a view of her astronomical muscles.  Unlike the city however, no one shouted at her or attempted to directly court her, but Ruby swore she could see a few little people either walking or in cars slap their boyfriends when they stopped to take her body in.  It made her giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she had made it back to Beacon, noticing a lot of construction going on from the entrance to the exit.  It made sense, with Gigants growing bigger and more muscular whenever Ruby had a whim (although she planned to hold off for the foreseeable future), spaces needed to be redesigned to fit their bodies.  Even buildings that seemed to have plenty of space to use were being adjusted to fit the possibility of future growth spurts, with Gigant students helping construction crews fit things into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, right there, just a bit to the...ugh.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo Gigant men were doing their absolute best to lift a massive pillar for a new wing of the lecture halls, but even they were having trouble with the weight.  Deciding to give the pair a hand, Ruby walked over and effortlessly lifted the pillar into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMind?\u201d One of the men said, his short brown hair fluttering with the wind.  \u201cYou kidding?  It was taking us forever to get that thing into place.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, thanks Ruby,\u201d the other said.  Nodding at the man and his brown haired co-worker, Ruby stared intently at the two and their muscled forms.  Maybe she could just take them home instead if Team JNPR wasn\u2019t receptive to her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby?  You alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh you know,\u201d she nervously chuckled, hastily thinking of an excuse, \u201cI\u2019ve gotta lot of studying to do, but I didn\u2019t want to go by without helping.  Well, see you later!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing in relief, she finally made it back to her dorm to ponder the social norms and who would be receptive to her new feelings.  As she walked in, she was greeted by...</span></div></div>",

The room itself appeared similar, only magnified for the girls\u2019 current scale.  By the same token, the beds appeared to have reinforced frames designed to hold up through Gigant growth spurts.  The sole exception was a raised platform of stuff that held books, furniture, and a bed at little person scale, which she presumed belonged to Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick shower and a change into a fresh shirt and pair of shorts with a black and red color motif, she laid her body down on the bed and thought over how much had changed, and how much she was still unaware of.  Social norms, the presence of criminals like Torchwick and his thugs, whether or not Jaune and Pyrrha would return her affections or think she lost it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve never felt like this before,\u201d Ruby thought aloud.  \u201cGrowing ten stories tall really puts you in the...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped when a quick shadow passed through a corner.  Her eyes immediately perked up, noticing something in the corner of her room that wasn\u2019t supposed to be there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss?  Blake?  Yang?  Are you back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo response.  Looking in the corners of her room, she saw movement, and her curiosity was piqued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZwei?  Is that you boy?\u201d she asked, but again, received no response.  Looking at a trash can, she quickly moved it out of the way, and gasped at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was twelve little people.  They all appeared just as shocked as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the?  What are you doing here?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral of the little people tried to run, but a quick stomp from Ruby\u2019s foot in front of their escape path put an end to their attempts, knocking them off their feet.  They cowered in front of the towering huntress in training as one man stepped forward, his head lowered and his voice apologetic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGoddess Ruby, we\u2019re so sorry!  We just wanted to get a glimpse of you up close, especially since it was reported you grew even more!  Please don\u2019t report us to the authorities!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Ruby was incredulous.  These little perverts snuck into her room to see her in private?  Lifting one up in her hand, she noticed that he was a man about her age, maybe a year or two older.  So tiny.  So weak.  So fragile.  She could do anything she wanted with them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW...what are you going to do to me?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scarlet colossus grinned at the sight in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou came here to see me up close, huh?  Get a good look at Mount Ruby?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entire group nodded, which only caused Ruby\u2019s grin to widen.  Lifting the twelve up into her hands, she deposited them on her bed, then took her shirt off, revealing her enormous breasts and steel plated abs for the entire group to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat if I said you were going to get a better look than anyone else?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, sensually, she removed her shorts and tossed them to the side, baring her humongous hips and ass for the group of little perverts.  They were mesmerized by the sight, even as she sat down on the bed, the shockwave knocking them all off their feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cClimb Mount Ruby, little men!\u201d  The group didn\u2019t hesitate, and soon they were climbing all over her gigantic muscles, the girl biting her lip at the feeling.</span></div></div>",

One of the men, who was a stocky fellow with Smooth black hair who appeared to be in his early twenties, was expertly teasing her  huge right nipple both of his hands,  waiting for it to stiffen completely  before roughly  biting  down and nibbling on its tender flesh, an act which elicited rather adorable squeaks of pleasure from the scarlet Titaness. <br>\r\nMeanwhile, a man of  solid build and fiery orange hair, had dived head first deep into her cavernous cleavage and braved it's depths, the sensations caused by the man's constant wriggling between her great bosoms were utterly delectable to the Titaness, forcing her to clamp down on a particularly loud moan that threatened to escape from her lips.<br>\r\nAt the same time, two of the tiny people, who appeared to be twin brothers with brown shaggy hair and very scruffy appearances, climbed all over the fleshy cliff face that were her indestructible abdominals, exploring every nook and cranny of  the perfectly sculpted slabs of muscle. When one them found her navel, they immediately began lick it's inner walls and play around with her belly button.<br>\r\nOne of the little voyeurs, who turned out to be an attractive woman with purple hair around her sister's age, much to Ruby's not unwelcome surprise, saw fit to traverse the silver eyed colossus's monumentally muscular and shapely thighs along with six other individuals, taking great care to rub them down with her body  and kiss every square inch of their surface, the others having followed suit.<br>\r\nAnd finally, the boy from before who was somewhere around Ruby's age, a nerdy looking little thing with messy navy blue hair, was deposited onto a swollen perfectly formed pussy by the Gigant queen herself as a reward for having the enormous balls required to say to her face that they essentially broke into her room to peep on her. The boy thanked the gods for his incredible fortune, wasting no time as he attacked the Pearl of flesh that was the Titaness's clit with his rough hands and eager tongue. The act filled her with such sudden and intense pleasure that she nearly screamed.<br>\r\nThis went on for an hour and a half with Ruby\u2019s \u201ctiny\" lovers meticulously caressing and worshipping her towering hulking form, bringing her closer and closer to climax when she suddenly plucked them up from their positions and brought them before her face.<br>\r\nFor a brief moment,  the little people were confused by why they were stopped and more than a little worried, believing that they had done something wrong and that their goddess was angry with them, until they saw her grinning at them.<br>\r\nRuby, having been struck with inspiration for how to finish things up, tore off any clothes they hadn't yet taken off in one Smooth motion and plopped down on the bed, disorienting them. When they got finally got their bearings, they presented with the sight of  their idol standing at her full height grinning down at them. <br>\r\nThe silver eyed colossus smirked at her tiny lovers one more time before turning around and presenting her immaculate god like ass before them. Realizing what was about to transpire, the little people braced themselves for it with great anticipation, all while wearing the stupidest smiles one could ever see on their faces, Ruby giggled at their eagerness. <br>\r\nRuby gave her titanic posterior a little shake and a smack before finally dropping her full weight upon her guests all at once, creating a small  earthquake that shook the entire school  to its foundations. <br>\r\nIt was times like this that she was glad that she came up with  the idea to give herself the power to enhance durability. This way she could play  as rough as she wanted without worrying about hurting anyone.<br>\r\nShe took a few seconds to savor the sensation of having a bunch of tiny bodies squirming beneath her before she got to work. Slowly, ever so slowly,  she began to rub their bodies up and down before picking up the pace, she could feel their genitals rubbing against the skin of her ass and the folds of her pussy lips, making her even more wet than she already was.<br>\r\nFor another thirty minutes she maintained this rhythm,  once more getting closer and closer to blissful release, her movements becoming more frantic and desperate, her moaning getting louder and more frantic, until finally, she could take no more and came violently on top of her lovers who at the same time were experiencing their own explosive climaxes. The orgasm seemed to last for an eternity before subsiding into a warm afterglow, all the while the Titaness had her hand firmly clamped over her mouth as to prevent her voice from causing property damage for the second time today. <br>\r\nTen minutes have passed since she finished her session with her dutiful fans, her still very nude form gazing down at their  still forms, passed out from exhaustion and over stimulation.<br>\r\nThey looked very cute sleeping away like that, they reminded her of little dolls or small mice.<br>\r\nRuby, still feeling quite energized, wonders what she should do next.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Being so close to victory over Ruby only to have it slip through her fingers in the most embarrassing way possible was frustrating, at best.  She had used the rest of the day to ponder exactly what had went wrong and more importantly, how to deal with a team that felt like it was literally outgrowing her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMost of the \u201clittle people\u201d on campus didn\u2019t seem to take it nearly as hard as she did.  They sharpened their minds, working on skills like stealth, support, and strategy for their Gigant counterparts, able to direct battles when they weren\u2019t such a big target.  The truth was many of the normal sized (Weiss was not a fan of the term \u201clittle people\u201d even as it became more and more commonLy used among the Gigants on campus) had their own skills to support their teams and were welcomed help.  But the Schnee heiress always felt she was destined for greater things, and to be revered as a frontline general.  Those dreams were dashed the day she met Ruby and was literally handled by her like she was a doll.  And the gap in power was only widening.  Worse, she knew it was widening, and her insistence on being seen as a physical equal to her Gigant teammates would soon be laughable if they kept growing bigger and more powerful.  A reminder of that difference was seen as she headed for her dorms, a Gigant scaled sign warning of the \u201clittle people\u201d entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the entrance to the dorm scaled for \u201clittle people\u201d, Weiss entered her room and was prepared to throw her books down and rest for a bit.  Instead, a bizarre and erotic sight filled her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby Rose, completely naked, was lying in her bed with a dozen little people pleasuring her.  They all worked dutifully on various parts of her colossus body as she occasionally let out a moan or gasp to show her pleasure at their efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was taken aback by the spectacle that was the Gigant woman being pleasured by a group of men and women that could fit in her hand with relatively little difficulty.  Numerous feelings sprung up in her mind, annoyance, disgust, jealousy, and awe, but none of them allowed her to look away from what she was witnessing.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby had never mentioned doing anything like this before, and neither had any of the others.  There were some obvious attractions between teams (like how anyone with working eyes could see Pyrrha liked Jaune) but usually that was between people of the same scale.  Was this even allowed on campus?  Or were Blake and Yang also using their bodies to host orgies for little people?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny pondering of what she was seeing and who she should report this to was interrupted by the sight of Ruby standing over her bed, shaking her ginormous behind as she prepared to sit on the all too willing little people, thankfully protected by her durability semblance.  The earthquake from her body hitting the bed knocked Weiss off her feet, which must have been at least the third time today Ruby had inadvertently done so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spectacle continued in front of Weiss\u2019 eyes, as Ruby rubbed her gargantuas ass on the private parts of her little lovers while nearing an orgasm of her own.  She could feel her own hand reach below before stopping herself, the jealousy she felt of this shapely monolith boiling to the surface.  The jealousy peaked along with Ruby\u2019s pleasure as she stifled a yell and orgasmed onto the bed and the little people, who all laid down exhausted from their session with the scarlet colossus.  Weiss, meanwhile, was left unsure of what to do with the sight she had seen.</span></div></div>",

The colossal cat Faunus had a rather busy day when she returned to campus, having to, along with the other Gigants, drop off her weapons for readjustment to her new scale, then practicing and studying for a bit in the afternoon before finally being able to make the trip to the library to switch out some older books for newer ones.  With everything done for the day, she wanted to just go home and relax with some reading before dinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe walk back was uneventful, save a powerful jolt that came from the apartments.  Like everyone else on campus, she had gotten used to the shockwaves that could have been anything from a few Gigants tripping to Ruby dropping all of her weight on something at once.  Their team leader, for all her grace on the battlefield, was still prone to pratfalls and the like, such as this morning.  The problem was that she was now so big that whenever she did trip or the like, everyone would feel it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAt least the building is reinforced,\u201d Blake idly thought to herself as she opened the door to the dorm room, only to gasp at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBlake!  You\u2019re back!\u201d The silver eyed Titaness gasped, completely nude and judging by the sweat and smell, having done something lewd.  \u201cUh, it\u2019s not what it looks like!\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was taken aback by the sight.  The girls usually had a system to avoid changing directly in front of each other, not to mention none of the girls were crude enough to do anything lewd in front of the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat it...what the heck is that on your bed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over to Ruby\u2019s bed, by a significant wet spot, she noticed a dozen little people, all nude and judging by the expressions on their face, very happy with what had just transpired.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid I what?\u201d Ruby asked, scratching the back of her head with her enormous arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou had sex...with little people?  How did they get in here?  And why didn\u2019t you call the faculty?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, they came in to see me.  You know, peepers.  So I thought that as long as they were here, I could have some fun with them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was consensual!\u201d Ruby protested.  \u201cNone of them objected, none of them were uncomfortable!  We all had fun.\u201d  Her defensive expression soon turned into a playful one as Ruby went up to Blake going \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t think they would mind playing with another Gigant.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe invitation took Blake aback as she put down her books and wondered just what Ruby was saying.  \u201cYou think little people...want to have sex with me?\u201d  The scarlet huntress nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve got this little fan club, apparently.  Little people who think that we\u2019re gorgeous.  And I\u2019m sure it\u2019s come up in your books, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused Blake to blush heavily, because Ruby was right.  She had read a few...saucy novels recently about love between Gigants and little people.  Or in the case of the one she was about to read, a group of Gigant girls and a village of little people.  But that was a book.  This was reality.  And yet an offer to make one of the fantasies she read about come true was right in front of her, with willing participants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d\u2028<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably not a good idea to tell the others.  Not sure how they\u2019d react.  But us?  We\u2019ve got ourselves a bunch of little people that want to pleasure us any way possible.  And since they\u2019re little people, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a commitment.  We can have a regular relationship with people our own size too.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo one\u2019s your size Ruby,\u201d Blake said with a deadpan tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRelatively.  Look, if you\u2019re not comfortable right this second, it can wait, since I know they\u2019re gonna be back for more.  What do you say?\u201d</span></div></div>",

However, before she could say anything, Her leader's massive hands wrapped around her torso and she was lifted clear off the floor as though she weighed nothing.<br>\r\n\u201cR-Ruby!?\u201d Blake cried in a panic tone.<br>\r\nRuby just gave her feline friend a another wide smile before slamming her down into the bed.<br>\r\n\u201cOOOF!\" was the sound the cat Faunus made as all the air was forced out of her lungs.<br>\r\nAs Blake lied down on her bed, Ruby began to enact her plan.  first she used her semblance to completely restore the stamina of her little lovers from her earlier romp and then she used it to conjure at least twenty more into being. They were all little people,  both human and faunus,  of various shapes and sizes, likes and dislikes, and demeanors. But they all had one thing in common, their desire to please their goddess!<br>\r\nThe silver eyed colossus gave her creations a satisfied smirk before scooping them up in one big pile in her hands. She then deposited sixteen of the little lovers all over Her feline comrade's body and the other sixteen onto her  own.<br>\r\nWhen Blake came back to her senses, she noticed what  her leader and friend was doing and began to freak out. <br>\r\n\u201cR-Ruby w-what are you doing!?\u201d Blake shouted in a mix of  shock and embarrassment.<br>\r\n\u201cJust trust me all right? You are going to love this!\u201d Ruby reassured Blake as best she could, it also <br>\r\nhelped that she used her powers to secretly emit an aura of calmness and comfort.<br>\r\nThe  effects were  immediate, in an instant, Blake became more relaxed and accepting of the situation.<br>\r\nMeanwhile to tiny orgy goers  had started to do their work. A duo of tiny men were rubbing their bodies <br>\r\nagainst the Giant Ninja girl's areola and stiffening nipples, causing Blake to squirm around in pleasure.<br>\r\nThree more of them were groping and kneading  the tip and base of her ears, eliciting a pleasured moan <br>\r\nto escape from her lips powerful enough to shake the entire apartment to its foundations.<br>\r\nLastly, four of the little explorers literally got inside het pants, her underwear to be exact, and began to <br>\r\nplay around with her clean shaven pussy. <br>\r\nBlake was in a state of  pure bliss! Never in her wildest dreams did she ever imagine that sex with little <br>\r\npeople could be this good! She wanted more. She wanted so much more! A sentiment which Ruby was <br>\r\nmore than  happy to oblige. The scarlet Titaness once more picked up her normally aloof friend with a <br>\r\nsingle mighty hand and held her in front of her. The stray  was somewhat startled by this action but not <br>\r\nreally panicking like she was earlier, more curious about what the girl was planning than anything else. <br>\r\nThe Book worm's eyes did raise however when the much larger girl tore off both her pants and <br>\r\nunderwear in one fluid motion.<br>\r\n\u201c W-What are you planning Ruby?\u201d Blake\u2019s said starting to  get worried again but was immediately <br>\r\ncalmed down by  her leader's comfort aura. <br>\r\n \u201cOoooh you'll find out\u201d Ruby stated cryptically.  The scarlet  huntress slowly turn her catlike playmate <br>\r\naround until her substantial  derriere was facing her. Then, without warning,  she grabbed  seven of the <br>\r\nremaining tinies in one hand and jammed them directly up that bodacious booty. <br>\r\nBlake's mind went blank, the sensations she was experiencing deified all of her previous experiences,<br>\r\nNot that she had that many. The seven little people were squirming and writhing around within the <br>\r\ndepths of her ass, somehow getting at every sweet spot. That when she felt it, one or two of them had <br>\r\njammed  their little peckers deep into her anus, that was the last straw. She came violently, releasing a <br>\r\npowerful torrent of cum from her spasming cunt, screaming and moaning all the while, the apartment <br>\r\nwas now in a constant state of violently shaking and quaking now.<br>\r\nRuby ,not wanting  to  be left out, picked up the giant cat girl and placed plopped down on top of her <br>\r\npowerfully built naked body and  began to tease and play with her friend's body, using her semblance to <br>\r\nmagnify the experience a thousand fold!<br>\r\nBetween being pressed against her leader's godlike flesh and the sensation of their tiny partners <br>\r\nexploring and worshipping the two women's bodies as they made love, The Cat faunus's mind went <br>\r\nblank as her faculties became compromised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, at point came where Blake could take no more and came again even harder than before! So <br>\r\nhard, in fact, that her release was more akin to a highly pressurized water cannon, the stream strong <br>\r\nenough to shred the bed to pieces, punch a hole in their wall, and keep going until it ripped through the <br>\r\nentire building and off into the horizon where it would eventually strike at a cliff or  mountain side and <br>\r\ncause a massive landslide.<br>\r\nRuby eyebrows were raised  quite  high. She went to comment on how she didn't know  her feline <br>\r\ncompatriot had it in her but found that she was completely out cold.<br>\r\nRuby giggled at the sight, her normally aloof friend/lover was curled up against her titanic bosoms like a <br>\r\nlittle kitten. <br>\r\nRuby nestled her closer to her chest and stared at the ceiling  wondering what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

These intruders found their way into her dorm room, and Ruby willingly used them as toys.  They had to be reported to Director Ozpin, and Ruby had to be told that being a musclebound giantess didn\u2019t give her the right to just have sex in the same place they all shared.  It was called common courtesy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for the Schnee heiress, her attempt to confront Ruby over her wanton sexual play was interrupted by the presence of their cat Faunus teammate.  Blake had confronted a naked and defensive Ruby over play, and for a brief moment it appeared that Weiss wouldn\u2019t have to yell her lungs out at Ruby, because Blake was going to ask all the difficult questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA-all right!  I\u2019ll do it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd now Ruby was lifting Blake up and tossing her onto the bed with her own set of \u201clittle people\u201d (Weiss groaned internally when she said that, a bit annoyed that she was using the term now) crawling over her body.  There were now two Gigants taking in the sexual revelry from the little people all over their massive, muscular bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was bizarre.  It was obscene.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was also kind of hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Weiss\u2019 confusion and annoyance, she found her hand slipping down her skirt and slowly beginning to pleasure herself at the sight before her.  It was a combination of seeing the act on such a grand scale with so many specimens, and the kinky feeling of seeing all those people being controlled completely and utterly by two women who could crush them underfoot.  It was clear as well that Blake was enjoying the experience, moaning loud enough to ring Weiss\u2019 ears at one point, the heiress still not used to how powerful the voices of the Gigants had become with their increased size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Ruby\u2019s moans became louder and Weiss\u2019 rubbing faster and more vigorous as their little fan club continued.  Ruby apparently didn\u2019t think this was enough, as she lifted Blake and shoved a few of the little people up her behind to continue pleasuring her.  The action clearly drove the cat Faunus to climax, as it seemed to be literally explosive in scale.  Weiss could have sworn there were cracked windows and a hole in the roof before she looked again and saw the apartment cleaned and fixed.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cW...what happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at herself, away from the peacefully resting forms of Ruby, Blake, and the little people, Weiss realized that she had stained herself with her own excited reaction.  And she needed a cold shower before she was going to confront anyone about what had occurred.  A long, cold, shameful shower.</span></div></div>",

Immediately, she went to resolve the first issue by taking a long, cold shower so her mind could reset itself.  During it, the feeling of annoyance with what she had seen and done had turned into a full blown feeling of insult.  Ruby had violated so many rules at this point, and on top of all that, had invited Blake into her kinky fun as well.  This could not stand.  It would not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she returned to the main room, cleaned and dressed in a fresh outfit, she looked at the two peacefully resting Gigants and did the only thing she could.  She yelled.  Through a megaphone that she had gotten for field exercises when she was worried about her voice being drowned out by Gigants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat is wrong with you two?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoused from her nap, Ruby looked over at the furious Weiss and waved.  As she turned to face her, Ruby\u2019s enormous breasts pointed right at Weiss; Ruby\u2019s body involuntarily reminding the Ice Princess of the insurmountable physical differences between the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Weiss!  Sorry I\u2019m not more presentable, but...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh uh, you\u2019re not smooth talking your way out of this!\u201d She yelled.  \u201cI saw everything!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to Ruby, Blake began to awaken from the mechanically boosted yelling and looked at the furious Weiss.  \u201cEverything?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou two had sex with little people!  Intruders!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby could only look on at Weiss with a surprised look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou saw all that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Schnee heiress nodded.  \u201cEvery last lewd...lewd...detail.\u201d  Ruby was set to respond when a loud growl from her stomach echoed through the dorm room.  Turning to Weiss and Blake, she asked another question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to discuss this over dinner?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI am pretty hungry,\u201d Blake said.  Weiss could only sigh heavily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI should eat something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n___________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Beacon dining hall normally had its population of Gigants eating separately from its normal sized population, however, given the increasingly common presence of mixed-scale teams, the Gigant dining halls had numerous tables for the \u201clittle people\u201d to eat at with Gigants.  Elevated platforms gotten to by elevators put the people at eye level with their Gigant teammates in normal circumstances, but considering the growth spurt and Ruby\u2019s colossal scale even among her Gigant brethren, Weiss was still looking up at her teammates as they ate dinner, a rice dish with chicken thighs and vegetables, naturally in far greater quantities for Blake and Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could report you both to Director Ozpin right now and...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou really think they\u2019d expel me?\u201d Ruby asked smugly.  \u201cIt\u2019s our word against yours.  And that\u2019s two to one.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThen...I\u2019ll find those perverts that snuck in!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was consensual!\u201d Ruby said defensively.  \u201cIt\u2019s not like I was grabbing random people off the street!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Blake added.  \u201cI was uncomfortable at first but no one was unwilling.  After a bit, everyone calmed down and we...had fun\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBesides, that would mean them confessing to sneaking into Beacon, at which point...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby\u2019s defensive expression turned into a cute grin as she looked on at Weiss.  The Schnee heiress could only look on confused, wondering where Ruby was going with her little plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou watched us have sex, but didn\u2019t try to stop us at any time.  Didn\u2019t yell, didn\u2019t call for security, didn\u2019t use your semblance to freeze the tiny people in place, which you could have if you were focused on nothing but stopping me from having fun...and instead you watched.  Right?\u201d  Her grin widened as she waited for the inevitable confirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...was shocked!\u201d Weiss said, with her voice showing the same defensive nature that Ruby showed mere moments ago.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween bites of her dinner, Blake could only say \u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything to me either, but you were there before I showed up, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShocked!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJealous?\u201d Ruby asked, tilting her head slightly.  Weiss, in the span of a second, thought about her feelings of being a normal sized huntress in training next to colossal musclebound giants and giantesses, and how her bubbly teammate was the biggest and strongest of them all.  How all her studying still couldn\u2019t close the physical gap she insisted on measuring herself with.  It all came out in two words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat you didn\u2019t get to join us.  I\u2019m thinking next time some little people break in, which given everything going on around me, is sure to happen...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re encouraging it,\u201d Weiss said, trying to hold onto her sense of moral outrage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not!  But rather than start a huge incident, maybe next time, you join us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss\u2019s eyes went blank when she heard this, replying with a flat \u201cWhat?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s gotta be frustrating...watching that, and not being able to participate.  I mean that\u2019s why I invited Blake, and she had a great time!\u201d  The cat Faunus nodded between bites of food as Ruby continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, I won\u2019t ask you to do anything you don\u2019t want to.  But maybe what you need...is some stress relief.  You know?   I\u2019m sure it would help, and it\u2019s not like we\u2019re forcing people to do things they don\u2019t want, and we\u2019re not the ones looking for them!  So if they show up again, maybe you join in?  Everyone\u2019s happy.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Looking around her small section of the room, Weiss decide to go and view her Gigant roommates\u2019 side. When she got to the opened wall where she could interact with the rest of her team, she saw that her teammates already left the room. Running back to her bed to check the clock on her nightstand, she saw it was already 11 am.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis shocked the Schnee heiress.

She looked down at the sleeping forms of her tiny lovers and scooped them up with one hand before laying down on her back and placing them between her titanic boobs, she giggled at the sight. She made herself comfortable by resting her head on her hands  while draping her perfectly sculpted left leg over the other. <br>\r\nOver the  course of an hour, Ruby laid down in her bed simply staring at the ceiling. With her having at least  taken the edge off her libido, her mind naturally drifted back to her earlier concerns such as the  overall state of the world , the new social norms that would  have inevitably come about from having an entire race of giants walking around, and of course, Juane and Pyrrha. The scarlet Titaness wondered how to best broach the subject of forming an intimate relationship with them. Briefly she considered using her reality semblance to make it happen but wasn't too sure about that, perhaps as a last resort. But then again, would that  be ok?  She thought really hard about it before giving up and deciding to cross that bridge when she got there. <br>\r\nThe next thing  she thought about was the world. In the relative time span of a single day, the world was almost completely unrecognizable from before she changed things. The Gigant population has, in its own way, made the world a much safer place for humans and faunus, able to easily drive away the creatures of grimm from settlements and providing the entire world access to a limitless wellspring of food and resources simply by existing. Speaking of which, she would have to look into the long term effects of that particular aspect of gigant nature later, it sounded very interesting ,along with the fact that whole settlements have apparently been built around their presence, it was a strange idea to the girl but not in a bad way.  She also recalled something about how some Gigants are registered as living natural disasters and even weapons of mass destruction, this gave her an insightful idea of the politics of this world which made her wonder about how the four kingdoms utilize their Gigant populations, especially the super militaristic Atlas.<br>\r\nAtlas. some of her best friends are from Atlas, Weiss being chief among them and the other one being Penny .<br>\r\nThe day they first met was one of Ruby\u2019s fondest memories. There are some discrepancies the timeline of events though. In the original timeline Ruby had  literally bumped into her  as she was evading her chaperones. Imagine her surprise when she learned that her new friend was actually a robot of all things! They went on this epic getaway sequence where Penny's chaperones chased them all over the block, concluding when they crashed into a garbage bin. <br>\r\nIn the new timeline however, they met when Penny was knocked bodily into the air by Ruby when she wasn't paying attention to where she was going. Ruby \u2018s endless deluge of apologies only ended when she noticed the intricate machinery under her damaged skin. Penny pleaded with her to keep her robotic nature a secret and Ruby couldn't think of a good enough reason to decline. They spent a few minutes getting to know each other and instantly hit it off.  When the lovable android's  chaperones began to close in on her, she started to panic. In that moment, Ruby, seeing her friend in visible distress, decided to help her. Thinking quickly, Ruby plucked her friend from the ground and placed her deep into the depths of her cleavage, much to the robot girl's surprise.  Ruby would then feed the Atlas goons a line of bull about seeing a ginger haired girl  somewhere in the local mall when questioned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she felt the coast was clear, she pulled her metallic friend from out of her cleavage gave her a sheepish apology. Fortunately,  she didn't seem to mind, mostly just happy to finally have some breathing room. They would spend  the rest of the day just chatting with each other and enjoying the other's company. Eventually, the time for the  cybernetic huntress to go home had approached.  Spent another minute talking with each other before saying their goodbyes, at which point Penny activated her boot thrusters and rocketed off into the distance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the present, Ruby  wondered what her mechanical friend was doing these days, she did hope she was doing well, what with all the drills and tests she was forced to do make sure she was in perfect  working order.  The Silver eyed colossus recalled the chipper automaton mentioning something about her being designed to defend humanity from threats like the grimm and terrorists but that can get pretty dangerous for a little person, even if their made of metal. Briefly she wondered what  her friend would be like as a Gigant. Would she be able to do her job even better?<br>\r\n<i>\u201ctoo bad she's a robot.\u201d</i>Ruby thought  to herself.<br>\r\nA wide grin began to form on her face.<i>\u201cAnd why should that be an obstacle?\u201d</i><br>\r\nA plan forming in her head, she called upon her true semblance and began to her work.<br>\r\nFirst was her backstory. If she wanted to do this she would have to come up with a way to Justify her robotic friend's existence as a Gigant without compromising a fundamental component of everything that made her who and what she is. <br>\r\nRuby thought of this for a while before settling on a idea.<br>\r\nWhen  she was  done she reviewed her work.<br>\r\nIn the new timeline, after the advent of Gigants, the various governments and research institutes of the world began working tirelessly to  ascertain the bizarre nature of their physiology to little or no avail. That was until one atlas scientist and robotics expert, Penny's \u201cfather\u201d, found a way to not only replicate the phenomena but also to have it manifest mechanically using a method that he has yet to disclose to anyone. He spent years designing a defense system that would harness this technology in order to safe guard the people of remnant from any conceivable threat. The culmination of all that research was penny herself, built in the image of a friendly, if not unbelievably huge, girl in the hopes that the public would be put more at ease in her presence. <br>\r\nIn this new timeline,  their meeting occurred when one day, as Ruby was on a stroll through the emerald forest, she was struck by the sound of what she could she only describe as a thunderous boom followed by the ear piercing screech of an object moving through the air at unbelievable speeds. Ruby  turned  towards the source of the noise. In one moment, she saw a massive ball of flame careening  through the sky at ludicrously massive hypersonic speeds, it's heat and wind pressure scorching and upending any boulders or  trees in its flight path, before crashing into a nearby lake with such force that the explosion that it generated  was reminiscent of a small nuclear blast. The cataclysmic impact created shock waves that utterly annihilated most of the forest, shredded half the school, and  even produced earthquakes powerful enough to shake the entire country side, nearby settlements, and even the city of vale to its  very foundations, Ruby recalled that the event was all over the news for weeks and nearly sparked an international incident.<br>\r\nRuby, having tanked the lion's share of the blast like a  champ, found herself buried under a massive pile of dirt and rubble. With a single kick, she freed herself from her earthy tomb and dusted her self off,  she noted, to her annoyance, that her clothes had been reduced to mostly burnt rags that barely covered anything but decided that she would take care of that later. For now though, she had to figure what that was all about.<br>\r\nWhen the dust finally settled enough for to make out her surroundings, the sight she beheld took  her breath away.  Where there was once a lush green forest, now sits a massive crater of glass and molten stone, even topsoil  was shorn away for miles.  The Silver eyed titan made her way down the crater in order to get a closer look at  what ever caused this. As she reached the center she made out the form of a humanoid silhouette crouched down in a sort kneeling position. Eventually, she was able make out key features. The source of the impact appeared to be a  ginger haired girl around her age. She was clearly a Gigant, standing somewhere around at, at the time of this memory, 33 feet tall, ( she's  72 feet tall after the  growth  spurt)possessed of an incredible musculature typical of her kind and a pretty substantial pear shaped body, she had hips and thighs for days and an ass that just wouldn't quit! Ruby would muse to herself in appreciation.  The  mysterious girl, seemingly having sensed her presence, got up on her feet and to face her. The mystery girl gave Ruby one of the biggest, brightest smiles she had ever seen.<br>\r\n\u201c Greetings friend! My name is Penny! What is your name?\u201d the now named girl stated with an disarming amount of energy with an outstretched hand. <br>\r\nRuby was caught off guard by the girl's cheery demeanor, she definitely was not expecting this. Then again, she hadn't really known what to expect when she came down here. <br>\r\n\u201c Uh\u2026 I\u2019m Ruby?\u201d said the titanic huntress as she returned the handshake, unsure of what to make of this bizarre situation.<br>\r\n\u201cNice  to meet you Ruby!\u201d Penny shouted as she  energetically  shook her new friend's hand which caused her tits to bounce all over the place, incidentally, the girls tits were kind of on the small side by Gigant standards but were still very much bigger than her head.<br>\r\nIt was at this moment that the girl seemed to notice the state Ruby was in, causing her to don a look of concern on her face. <br>\r\n\u201cOh my goodness! Are you alright? You look as though been through quite an ordeal.\u201d The mysterious girl inquired worriedly as she fussed over Ruby's soot covered body and the burnt, crumbling rags that were once her clothes.<br>\r\nFor her part Ruby couldn't help but chuckle at that, she found the girl's earnest attitude endearing.-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>-\u201cI'm doing pretty well considering the number you did on the forest.\u201d Ruby gestured at their surroundings.<br>\r\nThe odd girl seemed  confused  for a second but,as she looked around at the veritable hellscape  that surrounded them, understanding began to don on her.<br>\r\nThe doll like girl's  joyful emeanor  visibly dimmed after that, settling into one of shame.<br>\r\n\u201c Oh\u2026 I-I'm reeaalllyy sorry! I didn't mean for this to happen! I-I was just\u2026.never mind.\u201d <br>\r\nThe bow wearing giantess drifted off her last sentence, staring down at the ground. <br>\r\nIt was at this moment  that Ruby heard a crackling sound, the kind associated with damaged electrical equipment.  This confounded the scarlet Titaness, there shouldn't be any such machinery for miles. <br>\r\nthat's when she noticed the light of electrical discharge coming directly from her mysterious companion.<br>\r\nOn the freckle faced girl's left leg was a gash with torn skin and the unmistakable appearance of incredibly advanced and intricate machinery.<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa. What's up with that?\u201d Ruby asked with a combination of shock and awe in her voice.<br>\r\nPenny appeared confused by the inquiry until she followed her new acquaintance's gaze. <br>\r\nIn a panic, she placed her hands over her wound  and crouched down,her back turned to Ruby in a futile attempt at hiding it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was understandably befuddled by the girl's reaction, had she done something wrong?<br>\r\nShe went to check if the green clad girl was okay when  said girl suddenly tackled her into her chest <br>\r\n\u201cPlease, oh please don't tell anyone about this! I'll get into so much trouble!\u201d  the apparently cybernetic girl pleaded with her, desperately pushing against her chest as she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red tinted young woman threw her hands up. \u201c Oka, okay! I won't tell anyone  just\u2026. Just tell me what's going on.\u201d Ruby gently placed a hand on the girl's shoulder as a gesture of good will.<br>\r\nThe usually chipper girl seemed unsure of herself for a while but after a few minutes she finally conceded.  <br>\r\nPenny proceeded to tell Ruby about her life's story. About how she was actually a robot built as an attempt at creating a synthetic Gigant, About how she was not to interact with the general public until \u201cshe was ready\", and how she was made to perform countless tests until was sick of them and decided to bail on her latest combat exercises and make a break for it.  <br>\r\nThis was a lot to take in for Ruby. An actual android? Not only  that but a Gigant<b>android</b>?This whole situation felt like something out of a science fiction novel. <br>\r\nOf course , this would lead to a very important question to be asked , how did she get that  \u201cwound\u201d? Ruby would further  inquire.<br>\r\nPenny would  explain that as she made her escape, the Atlesian military summoned a small fleet of some of  their fastest  fighter craft ever built to give chase! Try as they might though, they was no way they could hope to catch up with a machine of her caliber, especially a Gigant powered one! <br>\r\nPenny delivered that last sentence with a hint of  pride in her voice, much to Ruby's amusement.<br>\r\nIn a last ditch effort, the military were forced to make use of an experimental anti Gigant weapon in order to subdue her. She was halfway across the ocean when she was struck by an incomprehensible force in her left leg, causing her to lose control and make an emergency landing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd that's when I met you.\u201d Penny said with that pep Ruby had become acquainted with.<br>\r\nThis was a lot to process for the silver eyed warrior. That a machine such as penny  could exist, and that the Atlas military is  developing weapons capable of taking on Gigants, although that last part she kind of expected something like to come about sooner or later. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c So what happens now?\u201d Ruby asked , unsure of  what any of  this could mean going forward.<br>\r\nThe titanic super robot bore a pensive expression on her face. \u201c I don't know. But I don't what to go back to atlas. At least not yet\" penny absentmindedly kicked a stone on the ground causing it to be jettisoned through the air at super sonic speed, Penny winced from that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cD-Don't get me wrong though, I love my father and the people at the labs it's just\u2026\u201d Penny trailed off as if searching for the words. \u201c They can be sooo\u2026. Smothering sometimes. You know?<br>\r\nRuby nodded in sympathy, her own experiences with her father were quite exasperating sometimes but she loved him to pieces.<br>\r\nAll of a sudden the Mechanical maiden went ram rod stiff, causing Ruby to become very concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c My sensors are picking up high speeds movement from military aircraft 80 kilometers from our position! They'll be here in ten minutes! Penny  grabbed her hair in thick tufts as she began to panic.<br>\r\n\u201c The blast from before fried my internal thrusters. It will take me at least thirty minutes for my automatic repair functions to make them usable again! Oh what should I do?\u201d<br>\r\nRuby, seeing her new friend's distress, knew what she had to do.  She wound up a right hook before delivering a mighty blow to the ground beneath them. Once more, the land shook with fierce intensity as the very earth split apart in  great fissures for miles causing  hundreds of thousands of tons of molten material to spew up from the ground in great geysers. The monumental young woman shouted at a stunned Penny to get her attention and motioned for her to follow her into one of the holes she made where afterwards Penny would use her thermal weaponry to sear the hole shut,  concealing them from her pursuers.  Three  whole hours passed with them sitting in that dark man made cave waiting for the authorities to lose interest. In the meantime, the two of  them passed the time just talking to each other about life, their hobbies their interests, anything really, and in that time the two of them became fast friends. When the  coast was finally clear, Ruby  punched another massive  hole out from the ground to make an  impromptu exit. <br>\r\nRealizing that she should probably head home to face her father\u2019s inevitable wrath and get it over with, she said her good byes to Ruby and jetted off into the sunset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the  present, Ruby reviewed the new Timeline with a satisfied smile on her face. She  really  wanted to see Penny again but than again maybe she should wait until tomorrow.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She would have her come over in the morning, and the best part was, she knew just the excuse to have her do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMorning soon came and after the Goliath girl had sent her little lovers on their way, she began to wash up and went to have breakfast, hoping that the others wouldn\u2019t be suspicious of any wrongdoings.  When the others awakened, none of them said anything to confirm they had any suspicions, but just to be sure, Ruby had her semblance cause someone to knock on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWere we expecting a visitor?\u201d Yang asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that I can recall,\u201d Weiss said.  \u201cMaybe someone\u2019s here to make sure that you guys have extra room.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll get it!\u201d Ruby said, opening up the door, and smiling at who was on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSal-U-Tations!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight of Penny at the front, a Gigant girl bigger than everyone else save Ruby, got everyone\u2019s immediate attention as Ruby went to hug the 72 foot tall girl.  Ruby half expected the cheers of a studio audience for her guest to echo, but instead settled for welcoming the musclebound android to her dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPenny!  What brings you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I wanted to see how you were, especially after yesterday.  I experienced an incredibly powerful growth spurt and more than doubled my size and muscularity, but with no Gigants by...my home,\u201d she continued, deciding not to casually drop Atlesian military secrets in front of Ruby\u2019s friends, \u201cI decided to come and see how you all were.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Ruby said, \u201cwe\u2019re all a lot bigger after yesterday, and something tells me that it\u2019s not going to be the last time either.  But since you\u2019re here, why don\u2019t you come with us for our morning training?  You guys don\u2019t mind, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMind?\u201d Yang asked before reaching to shake Penny\u2019s hand.  \u201cCan she keep...whoa!  You\u2019ve got a grip on ya, huh?\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAs do you, Yang, is it?\u201d Penny asked.  \u201cI\u2019m happy to meet more of Ruby\u2019s friends.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a chuckle, Yang let go of her grip, surprised her usual hand crush introduction didn\u2019t work on this girl.  Almost like her grip was literal steel.  \u201cYeah, something tells me you won\u2019t have a problem keeping up with us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake nodded at the new girl, who returned the gesture, while Weiss couldn\u2019t help but look on at her with a slight air of suspicion.  Staring at her up and down, Penny took notice and lifted Weiss onto her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou must be Weiss.  Ruby has said many things about you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood things I hope,\u201d Weiss said, trying her best not to show any discomfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d Penny answered.  \u201cShe said you were the smartest girl she knew.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPenny!\u201d Ruby said, a bit of embarrassment in her tone, but it was too late, as Weiss grinned from her spot in Penny\u2019s palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell my body may not be huge, but my mind is colossal.\u201d  A slight tone of arrogance went over her voice as the girls all laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess no one minds if you join us Penny!\u201d  The orange haired girl smiled and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWonderful!  I\u2019m looking forward to seeing what I can do with my new scale!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the introductions done with and breakfast finished for the other girls, the group headed on their way.  Weiss was still enjoying the compliment that she had been given, Yang was ready to test the strength of Ruby\u2019s friend, and Blake was wondering exactly where Ruby met this chipper but exceedingly formal girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat reminds me Ruby,\u201d Blake asked, \u201cwhat are we supposed to be doing today anyway?\u201d</span></div></div>",

They decided to send another team in to give us a hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother team?\u201d  Turning around, the group saw the familiar faces sent to help them.  Ruby smiled and waved at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJaune!  Pyrrha!  You guys came to help us!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about me?\u201d Nora asked, somewhat perturbed at being ignored, causing Ruby to blush a bit.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Nora.  So, team JNPR was called in?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jaune replied.  \u201cIt must be a lot of Grimm if they needed two teams with Gigants to deal with the threat.  And...who\u2019s this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSal-u-tations Jaune!\u201d  The orange haired woman quickly moved to shake Jaune\u2019s hand, who was surprised at the sheer power of a girl that was taller than anyone there save Ruby.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMy name is Penny.  Ruby invited me to participate on this search and destroy mission.  I am glad to meet you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSame,\u201d Jaune said, looking on at his hand after this girl shook it with an astronomical amount of force.  Pyrrha introduced herself as well, although the group did not have to walk far to find their first target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGrimm at 3:00!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see them!\u201d Ruby said, running forward and throwing a punch at what were creatures that were relatively the size of a small dog compared to her.  One blow was all it took to send the entire group flying, causing the girl to smile at her victory.  That was until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at her behind, Ruby blushed a deep shade of red.  A Grimm had bitten it and was ravenously trying to pierce the impenetrable skin, but to no avail.  What it was doing was causing her to focus on the stares of everyone there, Jaune and Pyrrha in particular.  She had hoped her escapades with her little fan club would be enough to take the edge off, but the young woman was still, for lack of a better word, feeling randy.  With a mischievous grin on her face, Ruby bent her behind towards the group, causing all of them to blush, and sat down, utterly destroying the Grimm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that...standard procedure?\u201d Penny asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, it is not,\u201d Jaune answered, still flustered from what he saw.  Standing up to her full towering height, Ruby wore the same grin as before when facing her teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, the Grimm here can\u2019t hurt us.  Maybe we can have some fun with them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFun?\u201d Pyrrha asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, have some fun getting rid of them.  Turn the pest control here into a game.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to the group, Ruby subtly began to call upon her semblance again, not so dramatically as to change their minds, but to make the group more at ease with the idea.  Grins formed on the faces of all the Gigants present, even Penny, who was more curious about the sensations Ruby felt than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo, what do you say?  Plenty of Grimm, and a lot of things we can do with them.\u201d  Her voice was husky and sensual, making no secret of what she wanted to do.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Sure the girl had always had a bit of an adventurous streak, but never did they think that she had it in her to be so...wanton.  They were all set to ask what Ruby was suggesting when a horde of Grimm ran towards the group.  Yang, grinning, stepped in front of the horde and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou want to see fun?\u201d  Smiling, she let the creatures leap at her and attack, their claws unable to even scratch her armor like skin, but ripping her clothes to pieces.  Ruby, realizing what was about to happen, created a case full of replacement uniforms for the group, then sat back and looked at her sister\u2019s attempt to one-up her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang\u2019s massive bare breasts were exposed for all, causing Jaune and Ren to blush heavily.  Wantonly caressing them in front of her prey, she saw a few Grimm charge her, and let the feral beasts fall right into her waiting cleavage.  Turning back to the group, she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow here\u2019s the fireworks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a squeeze of her majestic mammaries, the Grimm were crushed between two walls of fat and muscle as Yang sensually rubbed her breasts together.  Both Jaune and Ren blushed an atomic red as they took in the sight, a reaction Pyrrha took notice of.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake offered a chuckle as she saw a rather large approaching pair of bear like Grimm,  the Ursa Major.  Rather than charge them, Blake merely laid down and let them approach.  Faster than the creatures could react, she caught them between her shapely thighs, squeezing so hard they turned into paste.  Running her hands up her legs, she posed for the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOops.  Guess they couldn\u2019t take the pressure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss\u2019 eyebrow raised quizzically at the sight.  This wasn\u2019t the Blake she knew.  Nor would the Blake she knew let attacking Grimm slash her shorts clean off her body, just so she could squeeze them between her thighs and enjoy the sensations of their desperate struggles against her most sensitive body parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNora, are you seeing this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, and I\u2019m kind of wondering why.  Right Ren?  Ren?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike Jaune, Ren was transfixed by the sight of Blake\u2019s gorgeous legs and humongous hips turning Grimm into paste.  For her part, Penny observed the situation quizzically, wondering about the sensations feeling felt and eager to duplicate them.  Meanwhile, Pyrrha had been just about done with Jaune\u2019s staring at other girls, and took him by the hand to get to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPyrrha?  What?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe want to get rid of these creatures efficiently right?  I have an idea.\u201d  Seeing a very large lizard like Grimm approaching, the Spartan girl grabbed the creature and pressed it between her and Jaune\u2019s body.  The power of the pair of super muscled bodies turned the Grimm into dust, a process that Pyrrha was eager to repeat with crowds of the creatures, taking her time grinding against Jaune as she did so.  Ruby couldn\u2019t help but giggle at the sight.  If the thickheaded body didn\u2019t take the hint by now, nothing would get through his head.  Maybe she could join in.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Yang meanwhile saw that one of their audience had been taken away, and laughed, looking on at the tiny form of Ren.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess that means you get the show all to yourself, huh?\u201d Yang giggled, holding her bare breasts right next to Ren\u2019s face as she dropped them on a pack of approaching Grimm.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo do you prefer top or bottom?\u201d Blake asked, swinging her massive legs in front of the boy, and utterly crushing a separate group of the creatures close to her nether regions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss\u2019 confusion only grew at the display, and how out of character it seemed for the pair.  Her and Nora began to question what they should do.</span></div></div>",

ways, Ruby was rapt with attention towards the objects of her affection's  very intimate embrace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two giant hunters grinded their bodies against each other in a surprisingly passionate display that ground up and crushed any Grimm unfortunate enough to find themselves in between the two of them  as though they were a very lewd and sexy trash compactor. <br>\r\nAny Grimm that wasn't being mashed into a fine paste were biting and tearing  away at  their armor in an attempt to deal any kind of damage, this resulted in the two Gigant members of team JNPR giving everyone present a very bizarre strip show , Ruby especially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby  salivated at the sight .<br>\r\nThe way the vermilion Amazon pressed her massive heaving breast against the indestructible  slabs of granite that were the white knight's pectorals.<br>\r\nHow the boy's massive bulge strained against the crotch of his pants until his cock literally burst free from its prison and  its shaft slapped against the Spartan\u2019s black panty clad folds.<br>\r\nHow their perfectly sculpted muscles flexed and  rubbed against each other while simultaneously crippling and reducing any stray Grimm that gets too close into an opaque mist with the slightest twitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too much!<br>\r\nShe couldn't hold herself back anymore!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby stood up from her spot and stomped her way towards the pair, crushing any Grimm underfoot as she did.<br>\r\nDriven by a lust and a sense of urgency that she had never known before, the colossal scarlet huntress was completely unaware of the fact that, even as this was happening, she was subconsciously emitting an invisible field that made almost every living thing within a 500 mile radius from her become assaulted by  unbearable levels of horniness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shield users Were deep in the midst of their Grimm exterminating  dry-humping  when they felt a large shadow cast upon them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPass the immense shelf of the scarlet Titaness\u2019s massive breasts, the pair could make out their friend\u2019s face which had become one of almost pure lust  along with a mischievous glint in her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you guys mind if I join you?\u201d Ruby  said in the most seductive and husky tone the two of them ever heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaune was more than happy to add another person to this  (the more the merrier after all) but Pyrrha wasn't so sure on the idea. <br>\r\nBefore she could make any objections however, the Spartan was suddenly struck by the  overpowering force of Ruby's subconscious \u201cLust waves\" and any doubts she might've had about the prospect instantly melted away, most likely in the form of the cum running down her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby smiled at them and picked them both off the ground as though they weighed nothing  and pulled them into her embrace, pinning them both against her left boob with one arm, causing the two smaller Gigants to let out yelps of surprise.<br>\r\nThen with her other arm she grabbed a couple of Grimm and shoved them in between the space of the three Giants mighty chests and proceeded to sensually rub her two partners up and down her chest at a slow pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby relished the sight of the Black creatures struggling desperately in their fleshy tombs only to be crushed utterly like tiny bugs between the three mountains of muscle and sex.<br>\r\nThe silver eyed Titaness could feel more of the shadowy beasts climbing all over her body and unleashing more futile attacks on her person in a vain effort to destroy her. <br>\r\nShe giggled  when she looked  behind herself and saw a few packs of  Grimm crawling all over her building sized ass, trying to tear it apart and failing miserably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of the beasts scratched and gnawed on the fleshy globes with savage intent and pulled at the skin but were unable to deal even the slightest amount of harm or pain in exchange for their massive casualties.<br>\r\nIf anything, the sensations Ruby felt were akin to the ones she felt when her little fan club endeavored to service their goddess, only with far more participants and each one of them being more aggressive forceful than all of the fan-club combined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe towering girl let out loud  literally  earth shaking moans from the pleasure she felt , the combined  stimulation from all of the Grimm\u2019s impotent attacks and having the two people she's wanted the most for awhile now in her powerful arms pressed against her boobs driving her all kinds of crazy.<br>\r\n Five minutes passed with Ruby just pressing her two lovers against her chest and they moaning and squirming in the throes of their own ecstasy, due in part to the effects of Ruby's Horniness field, while Grimm crawled over their bodies biting and tearing at their clothes until all three Gigants were left in nothing but their underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was  then that Ruby's super human senses detected the  movements of a substantially large horde of Grimm coming in from her right , they must have numbered in the hundreds of thousands. <br>\r\nit would appear reinforcements had arrived, not that it would matter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout skipping a beat, the scarlet Titaness turned so that her back faced the horde and bent over slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then clenched  her butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe resulting shock waves and thermal energies that were  released instantly erased the massive horde from existence and tore out a massive cone shaped trench of molten stone and glass spanning hundreds of miles and reaching 400 meters deep.<br>\r\n Any Grimm that were still on the Gigantic girl's ass were either completely vaporized or were subjected to such unfathomable pressures from inbetween her God-like cheeks that every atom that made up their physical being had been fused into neon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby chuckled to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the horde taken care of, The crimsonette moved on to the next phase of her plan.<br>\r\nIn a single blur of motion, the Titaness tore off what was left of her two playmates\u2019 clothes before tearing off her own, both the blonde knight and the Spartan's eyes grew wide with shock and they turned to face their much larger friend with a question on their lips only for said friend to wink playfully at them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suddenly dropped down on her butt ,which caused a minor earthquake to form, and held her Gigant lovers in one arm, and with the other, she snatched up a few stray Grimm.<br>\r\nRuby  then deposited  one group of the bone masked monsters in between her titanic mammaries and the other in between the  valley of her thick thighs  and lied herself down on her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPyrrha and Jaune  weren't really able to figure out what the massive teen had planned, so lost in the fog of lust that they were, but figured it had to be something good, if the girl's previous exploits were of any indication. <br>\r\n <br>\r\nWith all the pieces now in place, Ruby picked up her two lovers in both hands placed them into position.<br>\r\nWith Pyrrha, the lustful Titaness dropped her on top of her chest, the Spartan's huge toned ass landing on top of the first group of Grimm but not killing them, Ruby had plans for them.<br>\r\nWith  Jaune, he was made to rest upon the Gigant queen's mighty thighs and had his massive cock guided between them, making the knight gasp from pleasure .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she was ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby began to  slide  Pyrrha up and down her chest at a rhythmic pace, making sure the Grimm were rubbing up against the Spartan's pussy,  whilst tweaking her hardened nipples.<br>\r\nThe Amazon let out her own earth shaking moans in response, the feelings she was experiencing were unlike anything she  had ever experienced before,  the sensations magnified a thousand fold thanks to the unknown horniness field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, the red reaper began to Rub her thighs together at a similar pace.<br>\r\nJaune was driven wild with animalistic lust, the sensations of having the much larger girl's plush yet unthinkably powerful thighs wrapped around his meat and the effects of the lust field bombarding his brain with pleasure.<br>\r\nThe experience was further enhanced by the numerous Grimm trying to slash away at the Titan's indestructible flesh rod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three  Gigants went at it like this for ten minutes in a constant rhythm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was in bliss.<br>\r\nShe had been waiting for this moment for the better  part of two days and it was well worth it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found herself wanting more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore of this. More of them. Hell, more of herself even!<br>\r\nAnd she knew just how to get it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silver eyed Titaness devoted a portion of her brain power that wasn't being concentrated on sex towards her semblance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had decided to increase the size of the entire Gigant population again by 40% and for herself a whopping 60%!<br>\r\nShe could already feel the changes start.<br>\r\nHer body slowly began to expand outwards in all directions at a rapid rate.<br>\r\nHer muscles grew larger, harder, denser and astronomically more powerful than they ever were before!<br>\r\nHer curves ballooned outward,  becoming more outrageous and alluring with each passing moment.<br>\r\nAnd finally, her body stretched  ever taller towards more Imposing heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, in the midst of being lost in the throes of pleasure, Pyrrha could feel that another growth spurt was occurring within her, driving her even more wild!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026.much\u2026\u2026..POWER!!!!\u201d Pyrrha yelled inbetween gasps, her voice shaking the land increasingly harder as it deepened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, Jaune  let loose a mighty roar to the Heavens when he felt the growth come on as well and thrusted into the Scarlet Titaness's thickening thjghs even faster and harder!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlongside her muscles and height, Pyrrha's own curves had ballooned outwards explosively and any Grimm still on Ruby's expanding torso became buried beneath the increasing mass of the Spartan's ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile ,  Jaune began to thrust even harder as he felt his cock lengthen and thicken along with the rest of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Part of it was because he had other things to focus on, the other part was that he knew Nora wouldn\u2019t take it well.  But with breasts bigger than his entire body being lustily shown off for him by the musclebound blonde, and the black haired cat Faunus showing off legs and and an ass that could bury his entire body, he was finding himself enjoying the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on little guy, you know you want to touch my big bad Grimm smashers,\u201d Yang teased, the nipples right in front of his face.  As he reached for them, she softly poked him with the breast, knocking the boy on his behind and giggling, but then leaving the breast there for him to grope. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone likes what he sees,\u201d Yang said.  Blake, not willing to let herself be upstaged, lowered her colossal booty right in front of Ren, shaking it close enough for him to touch it, before turning her attention to some errant Grimm and crushing them underneath it.  Once the creatures were thoroughly destroyed, she resumed her giant scaled lap dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think he likes this a bit more,\u201d Blake teased.  \u201cIsn\u2019t that right little guy?  What if I said you could play with it as much as you\u2019d like?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe confusion Nora and Weiss had felt at the way their friends were acting had gone from mere subtle confusion to full blown questions.  Something was clearly wrong, and they couldn\u2019t put together what, if anything was making them so horny.  Of course, with only two guys in the immediate area, and one of them throughly being occupied by two other girls physically, Ren was the only one there.  Did fighting Grimm put them all in the mood?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe questions were tabled by loud moans from both Gigants as massive grins formed on their faces, with it clear they were enjoying the feeling.  Both girls then began to visibly expand, the feeling of growth clearly being enjoyed by the grins on their faces and moans of pleasure.  Blake even took advantage of this, placing her growing behind directly in front of Ren while Yang flexed and bounced her bigger pecs from her new height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re getting bigger!\u201d Nora said, surprised and worried at yet another spurt occurring without any warning, and a rather powerful spurt at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Weiss asked.  \u201cIs something feeding the girls?  Why are the spurts happening so close together?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe concern was not shared by the Gigants, who welcomed the growth with open arms.  As far as they were concerned, getting bigger and stronger was a gift, one eagerly awaited and enjoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMore to play with, right little guy?\u201d Yang asked as she swung her bigger breasts, annihilating a group of Grimm.  At her new height of 97 feet tall, she felt quite good about having a body to show off for the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell we\u2019re running out of Grimm,\u201d the 85 foot tall Blake said, reaching for a group of the creatures to grind them to paste between her monstrously muscular thighs.  \u201cAnd that means you\u2019ll have two big girls all to yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRen eagerly took to the invitation, groping Blake\u2019s legs as she laid down and extended them towards him, while Weiss and Nora could only look on with further confusion.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Confusion reigned across the forest as earthquakes from the Gigant\u2019s sexually charged play pounded the ground.  To one side, Ruby was enjoying some rather intimate time Jaune and Pyrrha, while directly in front, Ren had abandoned any semblance of restraint and was being handed between Blake and Weiss.  To another side, Penny was observing the latter two, wondering if they wouldn\u2019t mind sharing the little man with her, while also taking in her new height of 101 feet tall.  Off to another side was a gigantic canyon, stretching as far as the eye could see and extending deep into the earth.  Weiss unsure of what, if anything caused it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the plus side, the Grimm had been all but wiped out, Penny using her new, larger stature to deal with stragglers while imitating what she saw the other girls do to the creatures.  Judging by the smile on her face, she was starting to enjoy herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think the mission\u2019s...accomplished!\u201d  Nora said.  \u201cYou want to talk to them or should I?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet me try,\u201d Weiss replied, doing her best to stand upright with the constant quaking.  \u201cIf worse comes to worse, drag Ren off by the ear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora nodded, but seeing Ren burying his body in Yang\u2019s gigantic \u201cGrimm smashers\u201d as he licked and teased them convinced her that such a task would be easier said than done.  However, as she went forward to confront her pre-occupied teammate, her feelings changed from annoyance and frustration to jealousy.  How she wanted to be the one he was teasing, rather than the Gigant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNora?  Nora!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss\u2019 words snapped Nora out of her daze, as she saw Ren handed to Blake, who let the boy tease her behind and hump her legs.  Before Nora could fall into another daze, Weiss lightly tapped her on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s something...in the air.  It\u2019s making everyone horny.  It might be the same thing making them grow.  Not sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt can be overcome.  Try and focus on how annoyed you are with your team.  It helps keep the lewd thoughts out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding at her friend\u2019s advice, Nora began to think about how bizarre the day was, and the source of her annoyance.  There was only one way to express it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRen!  What the hell are you doing?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Ren looked to one side to see what had made that noise, but Blake was quick to stifle any doubt by rubbing him directly into her most sensitive area.  She bit her lip as the feelings coursed through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got plenty of woman in front of you to work with,\u201d she teased.  Nora\u2019s screams fell on deaf ears when it came to Blake and Ren, but Yang was quick to pick them up, looming over the tiny pair from her monstrous height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t interrupt when we\u2019re busy. That\u2019s rude.\u201d  Her voice rumbled the pair to their bones as they looked on at the blonde brawler\u2019s enormous face.  Weiss, breathing deeply, attempted to be diplomatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang, doesn\u2019t this seem...off to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOff?  We\u2019re having fun, and Ren is clearly enjoying himself, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t force it on him.\u201d  From his position, Ren offered a thumbs-up gesture, which unfortunately for Nora, eroded the last attempt at supporting Weiss\u2019 diplomacy plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou listen here you overgrown bimbo, this isn\u2019t how you should AHHHH!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mere tap from Yang sent Nora back several feet as Weiss grimaced at the sight.  Gathering herself, she attempted to get through to her teammate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhen have you ever been this forward with anyone?  You\u2019ve known Ren and the others for a while now, and all of a sudden you want to use him as a toy?  And Blake, Miss Quiet, exposing herself to a guy in the sight of others?  This doesn\u2019t seem the least bit weird to you?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJealous that he prefers big girls?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not jealous!\u201d Weiss shouted.  \u201cI\u2019m confused!

Yang begged her friend with desperation in her voice.<br>\r\nThough Blake was still hesitant to stop, seeing her partner look so desperate triggered something in her that gave her a moment of clarity.<br>\r\nBlake  observed her surroundings and looked down at her posterior and recoiled.<br>\r\nShe immediately pulled Ren out of her butt and placed him gently on the ground.<br>\r\n\u201c I\u2026I-I'm sorry I\u2026..don\u2019t know what came over me.\u201d  Blake said, shocked at her own behavior .<br>\r\n  Weiss let out a  sigh of relief.<br>\r\nFinally. they could get to the bottom of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ruby was lost in the moment, all rational thought she possessed had been compromised by the effects of her own horniness field.<br>\r\nShe had grabbed large handfuls of the Spartan's substantial rear and Groped  it relentlessly  while the Amazon  was squeezing and sucking on the Gigant queen's thick nipples.<br>\r\nAt the same time Jaune slammed away at the scarlet Titaness's succulent thighs, grunting like a feral beast.<br>\r\nBut he wanted more.<br>\r\nThe white knight  pushed himself further up Crimson huntress's mighty legs until he was directly infront of her thick soaking pussy.<br>\r\nHe then lined his dick up the folds of her muscular mound and, in one quick motion, thrusted his god like took deep into the waiting slit.<br>\r\nRuby's mind was set ablaze, it was unlike anything she had ever felt before!<br>\r\nThe force of her moans was physically altering the surrounding landscape, the very earth shifted and rippled in chaotic and unnatural ways due to liquefaction.<br>\r\nRuby lifted the Amazon in the air and flipped her upside down slammed her crotch directly on top of her face where she then started to eat her out.<br>\r\nThe screams of ecstasy Pyrrha let out compounded the effects of the ground distortions causing litteral landslides and great fissures to appear all over the landscape!.<br>\r\n The unimaginable pleasure that Ruby was experiencing caused the effects of her horniness field to magnify a hundred fold!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack with the rest of the group, Weiss was in a state of complete panic.<br>\r\nIt appeared as though the world was ending around her.<br>\r\n\u201cW-What the Hell is happening!?\u201d Weiss said as she was physically knocked to the ground  as it undulated violently beneath her feet.<br>\r\n\u201cG-Guys! We have to-\" her words died on her lips as she witnessed her teammates engaged in all manner of indecent acts, having been whipped up into an uncontrollable sexual frenzy. <br>\r\nPenny was on her back locked in a deep kiss with Blake laying on top of her while Yang had her arms wrapped around the android's thick leg, mashing her cunt against the android's own while Ren is  sandwiched between them.<br>\r\nWeiss felt herself losing her metaphorical shit.<br>\r\nThis has clearly gotten way out of hand.<br>\r\n\u201cNora! T-The others. They've  succumbed to whatever\u2019s in the air! We have to-\u2026..Nora?\u201d<br>\r\nWeiss's words fell on deaf ears for Nora was currently too busy shoving her hand into her panties , digging furiously into her vagina while she rubbed her breast under her shirt, her face twisted into one of complete mind melting pleasure.<br>\r\nWeiss felt a wave of despair wash over her as her fellow little person fucked herself for all she was worth.<br>\r\nWeiss was on her own.<br>\r\nThe ice princess Racked her brain for any clue as to what was causing this madness.<br>\r\nShe covered her ears as Ruby let out another earthquake inducing moan. Annoyance filled her breast as she remembered how all of this started when her leader suggested that stupid game.<br>\r\nThen everything clicked.<br>\r\nSomehow. Someway. Ruby was the one causing  this wave of arousal that has gripped everyone.<br>\r\nWith renewed resolve, Weiss began to make her way to Ruby only to be stopped completely dead in her tracks as an untold amount of arousal bombarded her all at once.<br>\r\nThe pleasure\u2026\u2026.it was indescribable! <br>\r\nIt was as though every atom that comprised her makeup were all erogenous zones being simulated all at once by a army of sex partners.<br>\r\nWeiss fell to her knees, unable to even speak and barely able to think of anything other than sex and getting fucked.<br>\r\nThe team's predicament was quite dire indeed .<br>\r\nFortunately all was not lost.<br>\r\nWhile Yang was in the process of fucking both Penny and Ren at the same time, she was desperately trying to break free from the field's influence but it was an uphill battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan't\u2026\u2026stop\u2026\u2026can't\u2026\u2026.control\u2026Myself!\u201d<br>\r\nYang struggled heroically against the burning lust that consumed her mind and body but no matter how hard she tried she just couldn't stop herself from screwing her teammates.<br>\r\nAs the earth quaked and rumbled beneath the weight of their love making, the towering  Brawler could hear her sister's moans of ecstasy pierce the heavens.<br>\r\n\u201cR-Ruby\u2026\u2026.. she\u2026\u2026 must be\u2026\u2026.. the source!\u201d Yang mentally deduced correctly.<br>\r\nIf someone could just get to Ruby they could find a way to end this!<br>\r\nBut how?<br>\r\nAs the blonde bombshell continued to helplessly thrust into the overly formal  android, her eyes caught the sight of the schnee heiress frantically jilling herself off. She was just within reach!<br>\r\nWith a Herculean display of willpower, Yang reached down from her position and grabbed the Icy huntress.<br>\r\nYang then proceeded to rapidly shake the heiress up and down which had the intended of snapping her out of her lust induced stupor.<br>\r\nWeiss blinked  in confusion, eventually looking up at her fiery teammate.<br>\r\n\u201cW-What?\u201d Weiss asked dumbly.<br>\r\nYang grunted, she could feel the lust overtaking her.<br>\r\n\u201cY-You\u2026\u2026have\u2026\u2026.to stop this! Yang said, Barely able to get the words out.<br>\r\nThe Brawler  drew her arm back and threw Weiss in Ruby's general direction at ludicrous speeds.<br>\r\nAs the icy huntress screamed in mortal terror, Yang could only pray that it was enough.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Flung through the air, Weiss kept her wits about her by focusing solely on the annoyance at her gargantuan team leader.  The things she had kept in her mind, the annoyance, the anger, the concern, all served as a buffer, albeit an ever so-thin one, against the lust storm that Ruby was somehow generating.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was heading right for Ruby\u2019s face and she knew that she would only get one shot at snapping the massive girl out of her sexual haze.  Clutching her rapier, she focused on her semblance, and her voice, hoping that what she was about to do would get through to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKNOCK IT OFF YOU MASSIVE SLUT!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time Weiss had yelled her proclamation, even if it was drowned out by Ruby\u2019s moaning, glyphs were summoned all over her mouth, covering it with ice and sealing it shut.  A second batch of glyphs formed over her nose, causing her to panic from a sudden lack of oxygen.  This panic was all that Weiss needed, bouncing onto Ruby\u2019s tremendous naked tits and pointing her rapier directly at the scarlett huntress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWAKE UP YOU STUPID BIMBO!  I DON\u2019T CARE HOW BIG YOU GROW, YOU\u2019RE STILL A SLUT!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Ruby\u2019s attention focused fully on the ice on her mouth and nose, snapping it with a mere twitch of her muscles, the moans and actions of her sexual partners stopped, replaced with a rather jarring and sudden restoration of their senses.  Pyrrha, realizing where she was sitting, quickly lowered herself back onto the ground, causing an earthquake as she did so, while Jaune looked equal parts confused and mortified at what he had done in front of everyone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking off to the side, it appeared that the distraction was successful in dissipating the \u201clust storm\u201d of sorts.  Blake lowered Ren onto the ground and began apologizing profusely to him, while Nora just hit the emerald hunter on the head repeatedly for having sex with the gigantic cat Faunus.  Whether Ren would realize what motivated Nora to do that was a question for another time.  Yang meanwhile, began to heavily apologize to Penny, only for their new friend to reassure the blonde brawler that her actions were not her own fault, therefore guilt was not necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat left the apparent source of this massive, destructive, sexual frenzy.  All 147 feet of Ruby Rose, who despite her towering frame and having muscles bursting from every part of her body that could reshape the earth rather effortlessly, appeared surprisingly...vulnerable.  Weiss, however, refused to let any sympathy cloud her judgment as she was unsure if the effects of the lust storm had worn off.  Until then, her mind was strong, disciplined, and furious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t \u2018Weiss\u2019 me, bimbo!\u201d the Ice Princess yelled at her team leader.  \u201cWhat did you do?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memories of what had occurred flooded back into Ruby\u2019s mind, but she was entirely focused on what she had done with Jaune and Pyrrha.  \u201cI wiped out the Grimm...and Jaune and Pyrrha...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCreated some weird trance that made everyone in the area hornier than rabbits!\u201d Weiss continued.  \u201cNot to mention you utterly destroyed the surrounding area!\u201d She added, pointing to the seemingly endless canyon created by a mere clench of the Gigant\u2019s enormous behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cB...but...\u201d. It was clear that whatever Ruby had intended, this was not part of it.  As the others all began to circle on the compromised team leader, Weiss continued her verbal assault.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou did something to us that completely destroyed our inhibitions!  And I want an answer...now!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt clicked in Ruby\u2019s head what had occurred.  Her instinctual use of her semblance had made everyone as horny as she was, and then made everyone, herself included, hornier.  Her desire for more had made them more by making all the Gigants grow even larger.  But that explanation would reveal her greatest secret to Weiss.  Worriedly, Ruby fumbled for an answer.</span></div></div>",

At first, she thought about merely using her ability to erase all their minds; make them all forget this little \u201cincident\u201d ever happened.  But she couldn\u2019t bring herself to alter the memories of her friends so radically.  They were her friends, and that meant that they deserved to be treated as people, not toys that she could just alter with impunity.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut just because she wasn\u2019t going to alter their memories, didn\u2019t mean she couldn\u2019t alter the circumstances to support her alibi.  Maybe deal with the damage that had been done as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, looks like that spurt really drove our essences into overdrive,\u201d Ruby said.  The excuse seemed to draw a confused look from Weiss, making the Scarlett colossus grin.  This was step 1.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEssence?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Ruby said.  \u201cOur fertility essence.  The same field that makes everything around us more fertile and stronger also can trigger feelings of intense lust if too many Gigants are in the same area, not to mention the bigger we get, the more powerful the field becomes.  So many of us, expelling so much aura, not to mention the fields interacting like that can cause Gigants to experience growth spurts!  It becomes an endless feedback loop of lust, growth, and hallucinations.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHallucinations?  You mean like the...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss gasped when she looked over to where the massive canyon had formed.  It was gone.  Not completely, a gulf did exist, but it was rather short, instead of extending out as far as the eye can see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe canyon!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWas probably stopped by my semblance,\u201d Ruby said.  \u201cYou know they\u2019ve had me train it to confine damage to a small area.  Ever since that one time Yang and I decided to spar alone,\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI remember that,\u201d Yang said, giggling.  \u201cI also remember that they forced you to apologize publicly for what happened and forced you to help clean up the entire campus...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Yang,\u201d Ruby said, slightly annoyed at being reminded of the incident she literally made up, \u201cI know, I know.  Point is, we were safe, but Weiss snapped us out of something that could have been...worrying.  You\u2019re the hero here!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss grinned for a moment, but quickly returned to her indignation with the massive huntress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, and what about the way everyone was act...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on Weiss,\u201d Ruby said, standing to her full height.  \u201cYou know the lust field wouldn\u2019t make people do anything they didn\u2019t want to do, it just removes inhibitions.  Like Jaune and Pyrrha.  We could all see it...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t change the subject!  Why was it focused on...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd apparently Blake likes little guys,\u201d Ruby said with a giggle.  Ren\u2019s brief smile was quickly erased by Nora hitting him on the back of the head.  Meanwhile the cat Faunus could only blush at the way she acted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe way I see it, we kept everything contained, and it could have been a lot worse.  Next time we just need to be more careful.  Besides, we got the Grimm didn\u2019t we?  As far as I\u2019m concerned this mission was a success!\u201d</span></div></div>",

(In her case a lot but details.)<br>\r\nThe scarlet huntress plopped down on her bed, causing a rather strong minor earthquake to shake the campus, and stared up at the ceiling.<br>\r\nRuby had decided to spend this time to simply\u2026..reflect.<br>\r\nShe thought back to her childhood, before she rewrote everything.<br>\r\nWhen her semblance first manifested she was five years old.<br>\r\nShe was playing on the playground down the road from where she went to elementary school.<br>\r\nThe young woman recalled  playing with a bright red ball, it was one of her favorite toys.<br>\r\nShe would always dribble the rubber sphere to see how long she could keep it up, she did all sorts of tricks with it.<br>\r\nBut on that day, she made a mistake and dropped it and it rolled out onto the middle of the road.<br>\r\nThough her father and uncle Qrow had told her many times to look both ways before crossing any street, such thoughts had completely fled her young  mind, she was too concerned with getting her ball back to care.<br>\r\nThe little girl ran out onto the street and chased the runaway ball down.<br>\r\nWhen she finally caught it, she was filled with a sense of relief and joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happened next would forever be burned into Ruby's memory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as the child went to return to the playground, a car horn blared loudly and she turned to see where it came from.<br>\r\nA Truck, a blue one to be exact, was barreling towards her at high speeds.<br>\r\nShe was like a deer in headlights, the mortal terror that she experienced in that moment paralyzed her and robbed her of any decisiveness.<br>\r\nRuby recalled that right before the truck hit her, one thought had made its way into her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to get out of the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very next moment she found herself back on the playground watching as the truck crashed into a nearby gas station.<br>\r\nRuby was visibly shaken by the entire ordeal, having narrowly avoided death.<br>\r\nBut more importantly she was very confused by these turn of events. <br>\r\nWhen and how did she move to this spot?<br>\r\nIt was later that day that she learned that the driver had suffered a stroke while driving on the road home from work and fell into a coma.<br>\r\nHer family had fused over her for hours when they heard the news but she didn't really pay them any mind, her thoughts were on the mysterious circumstances of her narrow escape.<br>\r\nA full week had passed with nothing else of note occurring and the events of the car crash already fading from everyone's memory.<br>\r\nIt was a sweltering summer morning that day and Ruby was sitting on a bench somewhere in the local park pondering on how she seemed to mysteriously teleport to safety before  she was hit while the rest of her family was doing their own thing.<br>\r\nAt this point the little girl was feeling unbearably hot, she felt as though she would drown in her own sweat.<br>\r\nShe heard the sound of an ice-cream truck driving by with its iconic jingle ringing in the air.<br>\r\nShe could've gone for some ice-cream right then but she didn't have any money and she couldn't ask her father or uncle to buy her some <br>\r\nBecause she had recently gone to the dentist to have a cavity filled.<br>\r\nRuby watched the truck longingly as all of the other kids had ice cream served to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she wouldn't do for a cone right about now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then felt something cold and wet on her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her hands was an ice-cream cone with three scoops of cookie dough ice-cream, her favorite.<br>\r\nThe child dropped the cone out of fright.<br>\r\nAs she watched the frozen treat melt away on the asphalt walk way, she felt her confusion and  fear from the car crash return ten fold!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was happening to her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was determined to find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, Ruby had been combing through her memories trying find some pattern , some correlation between what happened today and what happened last week but couldn't think of anything .<br>\r\nIt was so frustrating!<br>\r\nThe little girl was practically tearing her hair out trying to solve this puzzle and giving  herself a headache in the process.<br>\r\nNone it made any sense!<br>\r\nThere didn't seem to be any connection.<br>\r\nThe only thing that came close was the fact both time she wished for something to happen.<br>\r\nRuby paused in her train off thought.<br>\r\nIt couldn't be. There was no way.<br>\r\nCould it?<br>\r\nRuby put both hands out in front her and began thinking about her favorite snack.<br>\r\nAlmost immediately a jar of freshly baked cookies materialized in her hands without any fanfare.<br>\r\nThe little girl\u2019s breath caught in her throat.<br>\r\nShe took one of the warm gooey treats and took an experimental bite.<br>\r\nit's just like what mom used to make.<br>\r\nThe revelation of what she just discovered blew her young mind.<br>\r\nShe was the cause of those bizarre occurrences. But how?<br>\r\nHer mind went back a week before the crash. She was being trained by her uncle Qrow in the ways of hunters and had just learned how to unlock her aura.<br>\r\nThis could only mean one thing.<br>\r\nThese weird events, this power, was her semblance.<br>\r\nThe largest of smiles appeared on the little girl's face.<br>\r\nShe had her semblance! And it was a cool one too!<br>\r\nShe would spend the next few hours testing out her newly discovered semblance before showing it off to her family.<br>\r\nHer family responded with mixed reactions.<br>\r\nHer sister Yang thought that her semblance was really cool and started asking her to make all kinds of things.  Her father and uncle on the other hand shared a look of concern with each other, never before in all of mankind's recorded history has a semblance of such power and potential ever manifested before.<br>\r\nThe two of them would sit young Ruby down and give her a very serious discussion about responsibility and wisdom, though most of it would go over her head, she was too busy basking in the awesomeness that was her semblance.<br>\r\nIf only she had listened to them back then. Then perhaps she could have saved herself from a lifetime of heartache.<br>\r\nOver the weeks that passed after discovering her semblance , Ruby recalled, to her eternal shame, that she had started to become more spoiled and more arrogant as the days went by.<br>\r\nShe would use her powers to always get what she wanted whenever she wanted it, and the things she wanted slowly became bigger and more extravagant than the last.<br>\r\nAt some point she even began to pass the time by playing pranks on people.<br>\r\nThey started innocently enough but as time went by her mischief became meaner and more cruel.<br>\r\nIt all came to a head once when her sister Yang confronted her about it.<br>\r\nRuby couldn't remember the details of the argument but it had something to do with Ruby playing a very mean spirited joke on one of her classmates.<br>\r\nThis back and forth went on for thirty minutes, with yang call her out for being a jerk and Ruby dismissing her concerns.<br>\r\nEventually, Yang had had enough of Ruby's nonsense and actually punched her in the face!<br>\r\nEnraged, Ruby shouted at her sister for her to go away.<br>\r\nAnd then she was gone.<br>\r\nRuby's eyes went wide with horror.<br>\r\nShe ran downstairs to her father and uncle to tell them what happened and to get their aid.<br>\r\nHer father and uncle gave her an incredulous look and asked her who this  \u201cYang\" person was.<br>\r\nA weight as heavy as lead fell into the pit of her stomach.<br>\r\nShe up to her room and looked through all of the photographs she possessed to look for any sign of her sister's existence.<br>\r\nThere was nothing. <br>\r\nShe was gone, erased.<br>\r\nShe \"went away\".<br>\r\nThe scarlet girl's eyes filled with tears and she cried a loud sorrowful cry<br>\r\nGuilt wrapped around her soul like a noose, sucking away any good in her life.<br>\r\nShe didn't care about the toys or the pranks or even that Yang punched her.<br>\r\nShe just wanted her sister back.<br>\r\n\u201c Ruby?\u201d<br>\r\nThe scarlet child's head shot up and she turned to see the source of the voice.<br>\r\nIt was her sister, alive and well!<br>\r\n\u201cIs something wrong Rubes?\" The wild haired child said in concern.<br>\r\nLarge fat tears welled up in the scarlet child's eyes.<br>\r\nShe ran towards her big sister and embraced her, an endless deluge of apologies from her mouth as she sobbed into her sister's shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the last time she had ever used her semblance, until today that is.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

No longer will she live in fear of herself!<br>\r\nFrom now on she would not hold herself back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crimson Titaness shot up from her bed  with a bright smile on her face and a fire in her belly, inadvertently causing a rather strong earthquake to shake the school so hard it actually compromised the campus's infrastructure.<br>\r\nShe was going to unleash her power to the fullest!<br>\r\nBut now she was confronted with a new dilemma.<br>\r\nHow exactly would she go about doing this?<br>\r\nThough the young woman was determined to go through with this idea, she didn't want to do anything that would hurt anyone.<br>\r\nShe racked her brain for a solution.<br>\r\nIf only there was a place where she could go all out without worrying about her surroundings.<br>\r\nIt was then that a wicked idea came to her.<br>\r\nShe stomped over to her to her closet and placed her hand on the door.<br>\r\nShe focused her semblance for a few seconds before stopping and opening it.<br>\r\nThe space within the closet had been extended into a vast  corridor that seemed to stretch for miles, her clothes lined the walls of the vast hallway, some of them were identical copies of her usual attire while every now and then a unique design would pop up.<br>\r\nRuby smiled at her handy work and stepped inside to begin her journey, making sure to close the door behind her before she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young woman had spent  the better part of three hours walking down this dimly lit corridor and hadn't gotten any closer than when she started.<br>\r\nPerhaps she over did it a bit with the whole \u201cfantastical passage way hidden inside a closet\u201d idea.<br>\r\nRuby shrugged to herself and continued walking forwards with purpose. <br>\r\nThe titanic huntress stopped in her tracks when a thought occurred to he.<br>\r\ncouldn't she just make herself appear at the end?<br>\r\nThe silver eyed huntress giggled at her own silliness and upon her semblance.<br>\r\nThe next thing she knew she was standing in front of a wooden door.<br>\r\nRuby let out a happy tune and opened it.<br>\r\nInside was a space identical to the interior of her closet before the change except that it was remade to be large enough to fit Ruby\u2019s entire body.<br>\r\nThe space inside was quite claustrophobic, by Gigant standards at least, and literally only had enough space inside for her to stand up.<br>\r\nBut that was ok, she had planned for it to be this way.<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes and focused on her semblance.<br>\r\nWhen she next opened them the space had grown to the size of the dorm room.<br>\r\nNice. <br>\r\nShe used her semblance again and the room had grown to the size of the campus and after that <br>\r\nThree times as big.<br>\r\nRuby floated in the air, having made the room expand away from her.<br>\r\nThe Crimson giantess looked at what she'd done so far and give it an appreciative nod.<br>\r\nThat was a good warm up.<br>\r\nNow it was time to get really started.<br>\r\nThe red Gigant then sped up the rate of expansion by a vast margin, the room grew until it matched the size of the city and then beyond!<br>\r\nAnd she was far from done.<br>\r\nIt grew until it rivaled the  area of vale, then the continent of solitas, until encompassed the entirety of Remnant .<br>\r\nShe still wasn't satisfied. It was time to take it to second gear!<br>\r\nShe made the dimensions of the room until rivaled the sun, the solar system,  the entire galaxy  and then beyond, each time the process sped up just a little bit more.<br>\r\nEventually,  she stopped and appraised  her work so far.<br>\r\nShe found herself self floating in an empty black void that stretched on for eternity in all directions.<br>\r\nIf her calculations were correct, she had expanded the inner dimensions of this room to the point that it was comparable to the theoretical scale of the entire universe!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that was a lot of closet space.\u201d she would chuckle at her self.<br>\r\nOh god\u2026. She was turning into her dad and sister.<br>\r\nRuby shivered at the thought.<br>\r\nIt's time to get back to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gigant queen then placed  both of her hands  in front of her and focused.<br>\r\nAt first nothing happened.<br>\r\nThen suddenly, a spark of light flickered into existence, It seemed to vibrate a bit , as though it were dancing.<br>\r\nThen the spark grew until it became it became an orb of nigh infinite energy and potential the size of a basketball.<br>\r\nRuby held the orb in her hands and  hefted it's weight, Ruby smiled in satisfaction.<br>\r\nThe Titaness then drew her mighty arm back and chucked the sphere with all her might into the endless void she created at a speed that no mortal instruments could ever hope to calculate.<br>\r\nIt twinkled in the distance like a star.<br>\r\nAnd then it exploded<br>\r\nA nigh infinite amount of heat and energy expanded outwards from the point of detonation in all directions at speeds astronomically faster than light.<br>\r\nRuby took the blast head on like a cham.<br>\r\nWhen the scarlet goliath opened her eyes she found herself swimming in an endless ocean of inconceivably hot primordial matter.<br>\r\nSo far so good.<br>\r\nShe then stirred up the material  with her semblance until it became an endlessly churning maelstrom.<br>\r\nThis next part was going to take a hot second  so she accelerated the flow of time within this entire space by a factor of billions of years per minute.<br>\r\nEverything sped up around her as though someone pressed forward on a video.<br>\r\nThe burning material cooled until it became vast gas clouds.<br>\r\nThe clouds coalesced into dense burning masses that eventually became stars of various types including dark matter stars!<br>\r\nThe entire life cycles of these  stars played out in seconds until eventually they either exploded into super novas or became neutron and dwarf stars and even pulsars.<br>\r\nThe burning hot material generated from the violent deaths of these of the star would eventually become nebulae that would eventually birth new stars that would produce an endless number of planetary and celestial bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby began  to slow time back down to  normal once everything reached a point that she liked.<br>\r\nThe scarlet Titaness now found herself floating in an endless starry expanse that spread out before her.<br>\r\nIt took her breath away.<br>\r\nThis all came from her.<br>\r\nA wide smile split across the crimson Titaness\u2019s face.<br>\r\nShe felt the light from the stars caress her nude form, her clothes having completely ceased to exist from the explosion from earlier.<br>\r\nA sense of power and pride filled her being but most importantly a sense of peace.<br>\r\nThis was the first time in her life she had ever pushed her semblance this far.<br>\r\nIt felt good to cut loose.<br>\r\nRuby shot off at speeds trillions of times the speed of light and soared through the twinkling void.<br>\r\nShe ziged and zaged through the space without a care in the world , laughing all the while.<br>\r\nShe eventually find a stellar system she liked and made for it.<br>\r\nIts star was a yellow dwarf surrounded by seven planets and a variety of celestial bodies of various sizes and states of development.<br>\r\nThey all looked pretty but the one that caught her eye the most was the third most planet from the star <br>\r\nShe zoomed towards it with a Sense of excitement and purpose, she had plans for this world.<br>\r\nShe screamed through the planets atmosphere before impacting somewhere on the northern hemisphere.<br>\r\nSmoke rose from her body as she stood up from the massive crater her crash landing produced, she wondered if she making it a super hero landing made her look cool .<br>\r\nShe jumped out of the crater and landed on her feet with a thunderous boom.<br>\r\nShe took a moment to gauge her surroundings.<br>\r\nShe found herself standing in  the middle of a vast rocky plane under a brownish yellow sky.<br>\r\nIt wasn't much to look at  in the moment but that could easily be changed.<br>\r\nThe question was what to do first\u2026. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You home?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dorm room was rather quiet as Yang, Weiss, and Blake returned from their day, hoping to catch their team leader and go grab dinner.  What they found instead was an empty room.  Even that would have been harmlessly excused as the girls looked around, but there was nothing.  No note indicating she had to do something, no reminder that Ruby had somewhere to be, just an empty dorm room.   Blake shrugged, going through the motions of opening a closet door to get out a fresh pair of clothes, when a gasp from Weiss interrupted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys?  Do you see this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee what?\u201d Yang asked.  \u201cIs Ruby hiding in the closet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, but the closet is definitely hiding something.  Take a look.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake and Yang nodded at the ice maiden and went by where her section of the dorm was to take a look at the closet.  What they saw inside not merely a collection of clothes, but what appeared to be a tunnel, stretching out far past their eyes could see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid...someone dig a tunnel into the closet?\u201d  Yang asked.  Blake shook her head at the suggestion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf someone did that, they would find themselves in one of the neighboring dorm rooms after only some slight digging.  The walls are reinforced to Gigant standards, but there\u2019s nothing beyond there but another closet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut this...stretches on way longer than that,\u201d Yang said.  \u201cLet me try something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking out a small rock, Yang threw it through the tunnel, hoping it would hit a door at the other end.  Half a minute of silence was soon followed by a \u201cWhoa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s \u2018whoa?\u2019\u201d Weiss asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s endless.  The rock didn\u2019t even go through all of it.  Come on.  Maybe we can find a way through.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through the tunnel, Yang beckoned the others to follow, with Weiss leaping onto Blake\u2019s shoulder and following through the closet door, down the endless tunnel.  While the closet had some lighting, the group mostly noticed endless pair\u2019s of Ruby\u2019s outfits, save the occasional unique piece of clothing.  However, after twenty minutes of walking, and not seeing anything resembling an exit, the trio began to get confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s endless,\u201d Weiss said.  \u201cMaybe it is an optical illusion.  We know Ruby doesn\u2019t have this many outfits.  She wouldn\u2019t need this many!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group looked at the floor in an attempt to see what, if anything would make them appear to be walking forward.  Nothing.  Nothing that would create a visual illusion, no smells or substances that would interfere with their senses, and the tunnel floor was...a tunnel floor.  Sitting her gigantic butt on the floor of the tunnel, Yang pondered what was in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis could go on for hours.  Maybe days.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you suggesting?\u201d Blake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m suggesting that if we just go forward without a plan, we\u2019re going to get exhausted, lost, or both.  I say we go get supplies, food, sleeping bags, and then try again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tunnel in our closet,\u201d Weiss said.  \u201cIt can\u2019t be that long, can it?\u201d  Grabbing a clump of material from the floor with her incredible strength, Weiss threw the material down the hall, only for it to fall without actually hitting anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want to travel and get hungry?  Or worse, have one of us get hungry and you\u2019re the only thing around to...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Blake said.  \u201cI think she gets the point.  \u201cBut Yang is right.  If we\u2019re going to get to the bottom of this, we need a plan.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about class?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe found a portal on campus, in our dorm room, that seems to violate laws of time and space,\u201d Blake said.  \u201cIf anything, you\u2019ll probably be a hero.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought of inadvertently discovering a scientific breakthrough, in their own dorm closet no less, was too much for Weiss to ignore.  Nodding, she agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou don\u2019t suppose Ruby got lost in there, do you?\u201d Blake asked.  Yang shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a bit more complicated than that.  But we\u2019re not going to figure it out if we just sit here.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few hours later, the girls secured the same supplies they would for extended trips into the forest, necessities like food, sleeping bags, and even a lantern.  Blake thought that the preparation was a bit much at first, but two hours into their walk, it was clear that the supplies were necessary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closet was the same proportions that it was originally in terms of width, meaning that while it fit the girls, it wasn't exactly the most spacious area to walk around in.  Each side was filled with their leader's outfits, with the occasional varying uniform.  The scenery did not go uncommented on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, if Ruby EVER complains about her clothes again, we beat her senseless,\" Yang said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed,\" Weiss replied.  Blake nodded as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, two hours became four, and even with breaks for food, water, and relief, the tunnel was proving to be a foe quite unlike any they had faced.  Weiss became concerned, looking on at a compass she had bought with her, as well as her scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, wherever we are, the compass is going nuts, and the scroll can't get any sort of signal.  Maybe we should have bought some sort of vehicle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've got us,\" Yang said.  As a general rule, their great size and incredible force meant that Gigants usually walked to most places, although there were exceptions.  The primary issue of building machines on that scale for riders kept them from being used en masse, however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but this is getting ridiculous.  This tunnel doesn't seem to have any sort of beginning or end.\"  Off to the side, Blake had her nose in a book, shrugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have bought something to keep your mind off the hike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How was I supposed to know Ruby's closet went the distance between three cities?\"  Yang's protests did little to ease the girls, causing her to sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's keep moving, the sooner we do, the sooner we find out where this ends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours had passed with nothing besides more tunnel to greet the trio as they walked down.  Blake, looking on at the clothes, began to suspect something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no pattern.  Are we actually walking, or is something here that's just making us think we're walking?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can't be it,\" Yang said.  \"Wouldn't we smell, well...what we left a few hours ago?  What about seeing food wrappers or embers from the lantern?  Hell, footprints?  The ground is all fresh.  If we were walking in place, we'd notice those things no matter how far we think we went.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't expect you to be a detective,\" Weiss said.  \"But you're not wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look, just because I've got all this brawn,\" Yang joked, flexing her arms, \"doesn't mean my head's completely empty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the good news is we're actually walking, and we're not seeing an optical illusion.  The bad news is we've been walking for several hours through a tunnel that by all laws of physics, should not be here.  Decorated by Ruby's outfits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the outfits, Blake chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Ruby apparently has a formal dress and a hazard suit?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Weiss asked, only to see what Blake was holding.  Alongside the near-endless supply of her regular outfit, she was holding two different outfits, specifically tailored to their massive team leader's scale.  Weiss couldn't help but be confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost like dresses for a doll.  This is too weird.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where's Jetpack Ruby, so we can use it to get to the end of this tunnel!  Or Ruby's all-terrain vehicle with attached laser guns?\" Yang asked.  \"The clothes aren't helping us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe further ahead?\" Blake said.</span></div></div>",

I think I found something we can use.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease say it\u2019s a motorcycle,\u201d Yang said, but from her perch on the massive blonde\u2019s shoulder, Weiss shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot quite.  It\u2019s a bit more...immature.  But considering whose clothes these are, I guess that makes sense.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat am I looking at?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss pointed to the item with her rapier, as both Yang and Blake quizzically realized what they were<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese look like roller skates for a waitress outfit,\u201d Blake said.  Indeed the four wheeled skates, two on each side, resembled those worn by waitresses.  \u201cI thought that was just in stories.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, you didn\u2019t have those car-side restaurants by where you were?\u201d Yang said.  \u2018The girls skated up to the cars with the food.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNever saw anything like that outside of shows.  And besides, skates will move us a bit faster, but how much faster?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThese aren\u2019t normal skates,\u201d Weiss said.  Observing in more detail, the two girls saw what was on each pair of them.  Proportionally small rockets.  On the side was a red button, presumably pressed to activate said rockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis looks like something that an 8 year old would come up with,\u201d Blake said, which caused Weiss to chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo wonder they\u2019re Ruby\u2019s.\u201d  After sharing a laugh with Weiss, both Gigant girls, figuring they had nothing to lose, put the skates on.  Surprisingly, they fit each girl near perfectly, a surprise given how much bigger their owner was than they were.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready Weiss?  I have no idea how fast this will go!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m gripping onto your shirt,\u201d Weiss replied, \u201cand I\u2019ve got some ice serving as a harness.  I should be alright.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, Blake, you ready?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding at Yang, the colossal cat Faunus prepared to deal with the bizarre circumstances the only way she could.  Challenging them directly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOn 3, 1, 2, 3!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth girls pressed the red buttons on their skates, but even they couldn\u2019t be prepared for how quickly the rockets propelled them forward.  None of the girls had any time for a snarky remark, the sheer speed of the skates sending them through the hallway that was the closet faster than anyone of them could respond.  After some time had passed, the three girls were flung forward by the rockets exhausting their fuel, flinging the two Gigants and their passenger to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh,\u201d Yang said, taking the skates off and getting to her feet.  \u201cI really would have preferred the motorcycle.  You guys OK?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreathing heavily, Weiss nodded.  \u201cI had no idea we would go so fast.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook at the bright side,\u201d Blake said, getting to her feet.  \u201cThey worked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA brief moment of confusion took the girls before they looked forward and saw what was in front of them.  Rather than more hallway, it was a door.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo I guess we just open it, right?\u201d Weiss asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come too far to just report it,\u201d Yang said.  \u201cLet\u2019s see what\u2019s behind Door #1, shall we?\u201d</span></div></div>",

With physics long having gone out the window, or being altered in such a way to make the tunnel feasible, the girls expected to see some sort of large room or an outdoor space Ruby had gone off to.  And to their credit, the area was clearly outdoors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s...whoa...\u201d, Weiss added from her perch on Yang\u2019s shoulder, stunned at the sight before her.  Blake appeared to be equally confused at what she saw, unable to put it into words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are we looking at here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s...outer space, Yang said.  Sure enough, beyond the door was an endless field of black, dotted by stars in the distance.  The girls could only look on at the starry expanse with wonder and confusion, asking themselves, and each other, what was out there, and what it had to do with Yang\u2019s baby sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not possible,\u201d Blake said.  \u201cWe were in a tunnel.  How did it reveal outer space?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not outer space, per se,\u201d Weiss said, going forward.  \u201cFor one thing, it looks like we can breathe, rather than being sucked through into the vacuum of an actual void.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTentatively, the girls walked through the door and found themselves able to walk, and more importantly, breathe in the expanse.  Whether it was because the atmosphere from the tunnel extended into the expanse, or the laws of space simply took a holiday along with all the other weirdness they saw, none of them could say.  This however, left the girls with a new problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve gone from one endless trek,\u201d Blake said, \u201cto another endless trek.  Where would Ruby even be in all of this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls stared uncomfortably at the endless space in front of them, pondering the question, since looking for Ruby in what could have been an entire universe would take...quite a bit of time to put it mildly.  With no idea how far the breathable air would go, and no way to start looking, the group appeared to be at an impasse.  That was, until another sight greeted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIlluminated by the stars and light from the doorway they had just entered, was a massive creature with blue and green skin, and a dorsal fin.  It was a long, thick, round creature that seemed to \u201cswim\u201d through the starry expanse, appearing in front of the girls, to their confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA space whale?\u201d Yang asked, her voice carrying a tone of disbelief.  Blake walked up to the creature, big enough to swallow dozens of Gigants, and held her hand to its head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s friendly.  I think he wants to take us somewhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou trust the big space whale?\u201d Yang asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, we should,\u201d Weiss said.  \u201cEspecially since it fits my theory.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat theory?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe tunnel, the space whale, the funny clothes.  Ruby is somehow responsible for creating all this, and say what you will about our fearless leader, she would never purposefully try to hurt us.  If she did find or make these things...somehow, they will be friendly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the creature had heard Weiss\u2019 argument and agreed, the creature opened its mouth wide enough for the girls to enter.  Blake nodded at the creature and walked inside, while Yang and Weiss followed.  Luckily, inside the creature, air was breathable and the temperature was comfortable, almost as if the being was bred specifically to transport other organic creatures across the stars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat just leaves one question,\u201d Yang said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did Ruby create all of this?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three girls pondered the answer, the \u2018space whale\u2019 took off at monumental speed, heading for its destination.</span></div></div>",

The  tension was almost palpable as the opposing parties waited for the other to make the  first move. This went on for almost ten minutes before the crimson Gigant started to get  impatient .<br>\r\n\u201c what's the matter guys ? Don't tell me you're getting cold feet.\u201d Ruby mocked, attempting to goad her adversaries into action.<br>\r\nBut they simply continued to maintain their combat stances.<br>\r\nAnother ten minutes passed with the challengers  simply before Ruby decided to take matters into her own hands.<br>\r\n\u201c If you're not gonna make a move than I guess I will!\u201d  the challengers put up their guard in response.<br>\r\nRuby pondered on how to approach this battle until a wicked idea came to her. First, she called upon her semblance to conjure a pair of dust powered combat gauntlets and made it so that they have always been her weapons of choice.<br>\r\n Second, she made it so that her understanding and control over the application of dust was second only to the most prodigious and powerful of dust users. <br>\r\nAnd third, not only did she make it so that Gigants have astronomically more powerful auras relative to their size compared to normal sized people, she made it so that her control over her own aura was very close to perfect.<br>\r\nWith her preparations complete, raised her right arm and proceeded to throw a  light punch.<br>\r\nThe resulting shock wave that was created  rivaled the mightiest of hurricanes, shearing the landscape in front of her in a cone of destruction that stretched out before her by literal miles. <br>\r\nMeanwhile,  the WBY of team RWBY and Pyrrha  were completely stunned , having narrowly avoided the blast wave only to be flung for miles by the sheer wind pressure alone!  The three  massive forms of Yang, Blake,and Pyrrha slammed into the earth like meteorites, creating minor earthquakes that could be felt throughout the region all the way to the campus. The three of them just lied in their  respective craters for a few moments, completely stunned by what just transpired. Blake was the first to get her wits back. She stood back up to her full 62 feet in height and stared down her leader with a determined edge, a fire had been lit within her.  She crouched down and entered a  running stance, never taking her eyes off of her opponent, broke off into a blind sprint. The Giant cat faunus's ludicrously powerful muscles launched her forwards  at  ridiculously fast speeds, A sonic boom erupting into being and tearing the surrounding landscape asunder. Surrounded by a cone of heat and pressure, she left behind a wake of molten stone and glass as she ran forward with her hand on the hilt of her gambol shroud, in preparation to strike down her opponent in single blow.  The instant she got within Ruby's personal bubble,  gigantic ninja drew her weapon out for a massively hypersonic strike only for it to be blocked by the scarlet juggernaut's beefy forearm, the pressure wave generated from the strike slicing the tops of a nearby mountain range clean off.  Just as Blake lost her footing,  another Blake came down from above to deliver a over head strike, having been  hidden in the chaos of Ruby's devastating first attack. Ruby however, thanks to her new Aura enhanced senses, saw this attack  coming a mile away grabbed the clones blade in between her index finger and thumb. Before the clone could  register what had happened, the Red Titaness swung her arm around with incredible force and slammed the  clone into the original Blake, the sheer force sending both  skidding across the ground at high speeds and creating a  several hundred mile long trench as they did. Their  impromptu journey would  come to a halt when they collided with a mountain with a  deafening boom, the impact compromising its structural integrity and causing it to collapse on top of them. A few moments later, Blake erupted explosively from her earthy tomb, causing millions of tons of stone and debris to be flung into the air  for hundreds of miles in all directions. The disheveled colossal cat faunus blew a strand of  hair out of her face. Clearly she would have to pull out all the stops if she was to have a chance at winning. Not even two seconds later did a hundred identical copies of the aloof huntress shimmer into existence. They gave each other a nod before charging towards the general direction of their opponent even faster than before!  Back at the ruined clearing, Ruby  marveled at her strength. Never in her wildest imaginations did she ever think she could this strong! And to think, she had actually spent the majority of her young life living in FEAR of her power. <br>\r\nWell. Better late than never she supposed.<br>\r\nIt was then that her super human ears picked up the distinct sound of an object screaming through the atmosphere at mind boggling speeds , and a whole bunch of them if the number of Sonic booms she heard were anything to go by. <br>\r\n The very atmosphere burned around them as Blake and her small army of clones descended upon the silver eyed colossus like a shower of meteorites, half them maneuvering through the air using the sheer force of their kicks to propel them.<br>\r\nThe Blake  army began to swarm around their target, each one delivering an imperceptibly fast flurry of strikes upon their who casually blocked them with her own high speed movements. Lost in the intensity of their battle, the two titans didn't notice that the sheer force and speed of their exchanges had caused a massive maelstrom to form around them, causing category 5 typhoons and F6 tornadoes to manifest across an area comparable to hundreds of miles in diameter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss woke up feeling incredibly groggy, her head pounding as though an ursa was beating upon it like a drum.  Bleary eyed, checked  her surroundings trying to  make out where she was. One thing she noticed  was that wherever she was felt like she was surrounded by something warm and soft. When  her vision cleared she saw that she was between two great fleshy looking masses. Confused, she turned her head upwards only to pause when she finally figured out where she was. She stuck in the cleavage of a Gigan woman. Specifically Pyrrha\u2018s Cleavage.  The Schnee Heiress's face turned a bright shade of red.<br>\r\nShe began to stammer a large number of apologies when an ear piercing boom followed by powerful gusts of wind assaulted her. The usually cold tempered girl's head spun wildly around for the source. She became aware of the fact that they were caught in the middle of an immensely powerful gale storm unlike anything she's ever seen.<br>\r\nFrom the poor normal sized girl's perspective it appeared as though the end of the world was upon them. She wildly spun her head around  searching for the source , anything to explain how this was happening. <br>\r\nWhen  she found it however, she stopped dead in her tracks.<br>\r\nHer open fell open and became dry and hear eyes became pinpricks as a potent combination of terror and awe overcame her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the heart of  this apocalyptic storm was the forms of two of her teammates locked in  an fierce  battle.  The Cat faunus and her hundred semblance born copies flew around their opponent at incomprehensible velocities delivering  blows that could reduce entire mountains to dust with each strike while her team's leader, as completely insane as it sounds, was simply swatting them away  as though they were nothing. All the while, the very earth and sky quaked, buckled, and twisted under the weight of their blows.<br>\r\nThis was far more than a mere bout between  huntresses. This was battle between veritable Demigods and she, a mere puny mortal little person, was caught right in the middle. <br>\r\n\u201cMy gods\u2026.\u201d  Those were the only words she was able to vocalize.<br>\r\nIt was at this moment that Weiss wondered what could have possibly  possessed her to believe that she could even keep up with the giants let alone win against them.<br>\r\nA Full minute had passed before the Fearful girl was able to get enough of her wits back to speak.<br>\r\n \u201cP-Pyrrha!  This has gotten out of hand! We have to get out of here! \u2026Pyrrha?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately  for Weiss,  her words fell on deaf ears as the Spartan girl was deep in concentration. <br>\r\nRarely has anyone goaded her competitive streak quite like the crimson juggernaut before her. So many of her opponents in the past simply didn't have what it took to excite her warrior spirit. but with this person, she felt  like she didn't have to hold anything back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo she didn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe Reached out with her polarity semblance and touched the earth, feeling out for the metallic elements  in the  ground. When she found what she was looking for she focus her energies on  moving them. <br>\r\nWhat followed was the deafening sound of millions  of tons stone  and dirt shifting and grinding against each other in an unrelenting cacophony of chaos as the ground beneath them began to visibly move and shift, earthquakes registering from  7.8 to 8.6 on the Richter scale radiated from the champion's position in discordant rhythms.<br>\r\nWeiss screamed at the vermillion haired Amazon to explain what she was doing only to be stunned into dumb silence when she saw her what she had done<br>\r\nA hunk of  earth, stone and metal comparable to the total mass of the island of patch hung high in the sky directly over the spot where Ruby chose to hold her ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Spartan\u2019s intent was obvious at this point. The Schnee scion buried herself deeper into the amazon's  bountiful cleavage, as it was the safest place to hide from the imminent disaster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mistral champion swung her arms downward, causing the rocky mass to plummet  towards the earth at dizzying speeds. <br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ruby  and the Blake clones continued their exchange.<br>\r\nAs the battle raged on, Blake's strikes hit heavier and faster with Ruby responding in kind. There blows  were so strong and fast at this point that the heat and friction that was generated from them caused self contained electrical storms to form-<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The power coursing through her was intoxicating, especially since  an hour or two ago she was a scrawny one hundred something pound weakling.<br>\r\nAt some point in her duel with Blake she Began to notice that everything became dark.<br>\r\nConfused,  the Gigant queen looked at the sky.<br>\r\nIt appeared as though an asteroid was about to come crashing down on her and Blake.<br>\r\nThis was obviously Pyrrha's handy work Ruby concluded, she gave an appreciative whistle at the sight.<br>\r\nShe decided that she should probably deal with this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry Blake but it's about time ended this little game of patty cake!\u201d <br>\r\nRuby proceeded to flex her godly muscles with enough force that once again sent Blake and her clones to be sent flying away from her at blinding speeds all at once, leaving a dazed and bewildered cat faunus to wonder what just happened.<br>\r\nIn that same moment,  The  crimsonette firmly into the ground and stared daringly up at the man made asteroid, a sardonic smile plastered on her face all the while. She pulled her arm back to ready a punch, her fist squeezed so tight that it could crush and split atoms, and swung up into the oversized dirt clod.<br>\r\nThe sheer force of the blow caused the falling land mass to instantly disintegrate and created gale force winds powerful enough to rip cites out from their foundations that launched the debris high into the upper atmosphere. <br>\r\nMeanwhile, just before Ruby's counter attack, Pyrrha was readying a powerful follow up attack.<br>\r\nThe Olympian Titaness called  upon her polarity semblance  to gather metallic matter which  she super heated through electro magnetic induction and concentrated it into a single point along with a whole mess of highly  charged particles she pulled from the atmosphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe result was a slowly growing white hot ball of super energetic matter and energy forming in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss, though she knew  that the durability semblance was, felt that  she was going to be incinerated if  she stayed in the ball's presence.<br>\r\nAnd then Ruby threw her punch.<br>\r\nThe ensuing typhoon that was produced surpassed the ones generated by Blake's assault a thousand times over. The slicing winds  buffeted  against the Spartan's hulking frame in a nigh unending onslaught but she held fast.<br>\r\nThe same couldn't be said of Weiss however. <br>\r\nThe snow white huntress held onto a thick piece of breast flesh for dear life, Terror having long since consumed her mind at this point. Her face was distorted by the winds and she felt her grip slipping, she prayed to any force that would listen to let her live through this moment. A few moments later and she could hold on no longer. She was literally thrown through  the storm like a leaf in a hurricane and was twisting in the like one too , screaming all the  while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was triumphantly  flexing her arms over her conquest  over the asteroid  when she was suddenly hit by a blindingly bright light. <br>\r\nPyrrha  had finished charging the ball which now possessed so much energy it super charged the surrounding atmosphere, creating an aurora  borealis around her towering form that could be seen for miles.<br>\r\nA confident smirk had appeared on the Amazon's face, she was more than ready to show this oversized kid exactly what she was made of. With a push and a roar of effort, she used her semblance to accelerate the energized mass into a lancing beam at speeds that rivaled even the most powerful of  particle accelerators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby in the meantime, was so mesmerized by the brilliant light show that she almost didn't notice the  energy beam moving at her in excess of 0.99999999999% the speed of light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith transcendental reaction time, she channeled the gravity dust in her gauntlets , super charged it with her aura , and generated powerful waves of gravitic energy which she used to distort the fabric of space-time and  curved the beam upwards, creating a pillar of light that pierced the Heavens and escaped into the inky black void that could be seen for thousands of miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the beam eventually dissipated, Ruby wiped sweat from her brow, relieved that she was fast enough when she did. Had that hit her she was worried that she might have been moved  from her spot.<br>\r\nSuddenly, Pyrrha appeared to deliver a earth splitting slash to the cookie loving juggernaut's  back, having seemingly materialized out of thin air. She was stopped short, her weapon had  been caught between the  folds of the Gigant queen's mighty back muscles.<br>\r\nThe scarlet huntress looked back at Pyrrha over her hulking shoulder, giving her one of the largest shit eating grins she had ever seen.<br>\r\n\u201c My turn!\u201d shouted the silver eyed warrior who than grabbed the stunned Spartan from behind and chucked her into the air.  She then channeled a bit of energy dust into her hand and  thrusted an open palm into the air to release a destructive lance of light which hit its mark square in her chest , triggering an explosion comparable to a nuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A few moments passed with nothing happening, the only  sound  being  that of the wind and the residual rumbling  caused by Pyrrha's attack.<br>\r\nRuby simply stood in her spot staring at the ruined landscape waiting for any challengers to  approach her.<br>\r\nRuby let out a booming roar of triumph that  shook the earth and Heavens and seemed to cause the very planet to tremble! <br>\r\nYes! She had won! This new body was amazing! It was beyond amazing. It was downright GODLY!!!<br>\r\nIf she knew that she would have become this strong she would have used her semblance years ago!<br>\r\nThe Gigant queen would then proceed perform a series of poses  for no other reason than because she could and felt that the situation warranted it.<br>\r\nHowever  throughout her self indulgent  congratulatory  celebration , she couldn't help but feel she that she was forgetting  something very important.<br>\r\n A massive sky piercing pillar of fire erupted into existence almost immediately after she thought that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh right. Yang. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby raised her fists and prepared to face down her \u201cBig\u201d sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang had spent the majority of this sparring match watching her teammates fight her sister from the safety of the crater she made when this whole thing started in order to ponder on her plan of attack.<br>\r\nShe may not use her head that much in general but doesn't mean she doesn't use it at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elder xiaolong sibling knew her sister too well to  try to come at her with half measures so she had think of a way to not only  catch her off guard but also break through her defenses.  She thought long and  hard on her  strategy until she remembered something vital. She had developed a technique for just such an occasion. She had learned long ago that , as a rule, Gigants have astronomically  more powerful souls and auras compared to other lifeforms and had found a way to exploit it<br>\r\nShe closed her eyes and began focusing  her aura into a single  point until it became a dense concentration and stockpiled it away. Then she waited for her Gigant soul to completely regenerate her aura and repeated the entire process. Even as the cataclysmic battle raged on outside her crater the blonde brawler continued to diligently gather aura.<br>\r\nEventually everything went quite until she heard her sister roar at the sky, probably believing that she had already won, but by then  she was done. <br>\r\nYang stood up at her full height of 69 feet ready to unleash the \u201cBig Yang\".<br>\r\nBack in the present, Ruby looked in awe at her sister, who now appeared as though her body was made of flame, and raised her arms up in excitement.<br>\r\n\u201cWow!! Since when could you do that!?\u201d said the crimson goliath with amazement in her voice.<br>\r\nThe  elder xiaolong sibling smiled with pride at her sister's reaction.<br>\r\n\u201cI came up with it myself. I call it\u2026\u2026 THE BIG YANG!\u201d the titanic bombshell accentuated that last three by pounding her fist into her palm, which had the effect of causing yet another earthquake to surge through the poor abused land.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's so cool.\u201d Ruby exclaimed with wonder.<br>\r\nShe then took on an aggressive stance, donning a cocky grin.<br>\r\n\u201cBut I'm afraid that it won't be enough.\u201d The scarlet Titaness stated in a matter-of-fact tone.<br>\r\nYang returned her sister's gesture with a grin of her own.<br>\r\n\u201c we'll see about that\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sisters stared each other down for a few seconds before  the eldest made launched her <br>\r\nAttack. <br>\r\n Yang kicked off the ground with such force that the resulting sonic boom was enough to not only peel off thousands of acres of land all the way down to  the bed rock but also instantly  converted it into white hot plasma. <br>\r\nAt the speeds she was moving, her body more resembled a beam of golden light than a person. Everything around  her was completely vaporized as she approached her target.  Milliseconds before the  Titanic Berserker threw a powerful right hook while simultaneously releasing her stores of energy.<br>\r\nRuby barely had time to raise her arms in defense before the attack landed.<br>\r\nA sound akin to thousands of nukes going off tore through the atmosphere as a 5 kilometer tall cone of heat and plasma surged across the land for tens of hundreds of miles and beyond, evaporating anything and everything in its path while liquefied earth and bed rock radiated from the point of impact.<br>\r\n A few moments before Yang's attack hit, Blake and Pyrrha had gotten up  few minutes prior and stood in awe at the spectacle before they  were engulfed in the blast wave.<br>\r\nAt the same time, Weiss, who had been flung across the landscape by the asteroid obliterating  gale storm punch, had just pulled herself out of a Weiss and weakly got to her feet. When she observed her surroundings, she didn't see amiss.<br>\r\nYou know. <br>\r\nOther than the devastated wasteland that used to be their  training grounds.<br>\r\nFor the briefest of moments, the ice queen thought that the</span></div></div>",

The Giant blonde beauty panted heavily from her effort, hoping that her last move was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the smoke cleared  however, Yang discovered, to her horror, that Ruby was not only  still standing but hadn't even budged an inch.<br>\r\nRuby meanwhile was looking down at her sister with that same cocky smirk from before.<br>\r\n\u201cis that all you got?\u201d Ruby taunted her sister. <br>\r\nIncidentally, Ruby  noticed that be she and her sister were completely stark naked.<br>\r\nIn fact, all five combatants had their clothes completely incinerated by the blast.<br>\r\nRuby felt her face flush with embarrassment but pushed the feeling down, now was not the time For that.<br>\r\nYang felt a surge of anger wash over from her \u201clittle\u201d sister's remark and wound up a second  \u201cBig Yang\", This time with a left hook.<br>\r\nRuby was ready for her this time and countered with an ice dust infused right hook of her own.<br>\r\nThe two giant women roared at each other as their fists collided.<br>\r\nYet another blast of earth shattering proportions was released as Hot and cold clashed, creating a maelstrom of ice and fire that was greater than all the others before it combined.<br>\r\nThis mixing of hot and cold in rapid succession had the side effect of  causing super cells to form from the hot and cold fronts produced by the vortex, creating monsoons which unleashed an unending deluge of torrential downpours to spread all across  the region.<br>\r\nIn the eye of the storm, the two titans were locked in their struggle of biblical proportions, their fists pressed against each other.  At the point were their fists met, massive bolts of energy snaked off and caused even more astronomical damage to the surrounding landscape, the arcing streams carving out great gouges into the earth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby saw a  chance to end this clash by grabbing the brawler\u2019s wrist where she than spun around at high speeds before chucking her skywards above the clouds! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yang shot up into the sky at blinding speeds,  she  couldn't help but feel a little  discouraged that her first attack didn't end it but she had expected something like this would happen but she wasn't  about to give  up!<br>\r\nShe may be down ( or up in this case) but she was far from being out.<br>\r\nThe Blonde beauty used her powerful  muscles to reorient herself in the air in an incredible display of  agility. <br>\r\nIn that same motion, she called upon her aura reserves and  released them, immediately stopping her ascent and began focusing her aura into her core.<br>\r\nThe sheer output of energy she emitted was enough to suspend her in midair, her body once more being engulfed in golden flames which continued to grow brighter and hotter by the second. The energy kept building and growing hotter and brighter until it appeared as though there was a second sun in the sky, banishing the rain clouds in the process. The energy had built up so much That a Corona of fire and light  had formed around the monumental pugilist that  continued to grow until it's light and searing heat could be seen for thousands of miles, complete with sun flare like tendrils of  plasma snaked off her body and carved deep molten hot gouges into the land wherever they struck.<br>\r\nYang had to keep gathering more power if her plan had any hope of working. <br>\r\nNo half measures would suffice.<br>\r\nShe began to focus the power into her fists, preparing to  unleash an unending barrage of \u201cBig Yang\" punches.<br>\r\nUnfortunately for her though, Ruby had other plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby channeled gravity dust in her hand and pointed it at the  living star that was her sister then started pouring massive amounts of aura into the dust reaction.<br>\r\nThe air and light started to ripple as the very fabric of space became distorted from the sheer volume of gravitic energy being generated and focused into a relatively small space. <br>\r\nThe distortions continued grow worse until the very light began to get swallowed up into the  point of impenetrable blackness that was the artificial black hole that spontaneously sprung into existence. <br>\r\nAs the singularity continued to grow, massive chunks of land and debris were torn from the surrounding landscape and drawn towards its gaping maw, flying around in twisting circles before being disintegrated as they made contact with its ego sphere due to spaghettification.<br>\r\nIt grew until it even began to swallow the tendrils of power that bled off the massive brawler's body, causing a fiery  accretion disc to form around it.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the fiery blonde was desperately fighting against the pull of the gravitational anomaly, but it was a losing battle. With a final earth shaking roar, she released a hellish blast of power in an attempt to push herself away  but was eventually overpowered and drawn into its depths.<br>\r\nRuby, seeing that her plan worked, moved her arm in a throwing motion and hurled the virtual black hole off into the distance, when it landed a brilliant pillar of azure and indigo light  erupted into existence, piercing  the sky with a combination of gamma radiation and hard X-rays.<br>\r\nA few minutes prior to the event, Pyrrha and Blake had to shield their eyes from the intensity of the light their mutual friend gave off. Blake wondered where her teammate was hiding all that power and why she didn't use it earlier when the match started. Meanwhile Pyrrha was over here in stunned amazement at the fiery Gigant\u2019s display and began forming plans to ask the girl for a match.<br>\r\nElsewhere on the Ruined battlefield, Weiss had broken out of a bubble of molten stone and ice she created with her semblance at the very last second before the burning death tsunami hit only to be hit by an impossibly bright light. <br>\r\nIt was HOT!  Super HOT!!<br>\r\nIt was so hot that the fencer knew that if it weren't for the effects of the durability semblance she would've instantly vaporized into nothingness by now.<br>\r\nHer nerves were completely shot and have been shot for a while now. And to top it off, she found that her clothes were completely destroyed, leaving her standing in her birthday suit. At this point all she wanted to do was go home and sleep this whole experience off like a bad dream.<br>\r\nIn the midst of being burned alive and lamenting the consequences of her poor decision, she noticed a new development began to unfold.<br>\r\n\u201coh what is it this time!\u201d  she said to herself out loud. <br>\r\nThe heiress stared at the battlefield in apprehension as the world seemed to visibly distort in front of her.<br>\r\nInstantly she recognized it as the effects of gravity dust but it was on a scale that she had never seen before.<br>\r\nEven with the durability semblance she could feel her teeth forcefully grind together from the gravity waves that slammed into her and weighed her down. The waves grew so strong that she was physically unable to move her body and was even brought to her knees. Then, just before it became too much to bare, it stopped. <br>\r\nThe frazzled girl was able to stand back up again but was not relieved. For she saw why it stopped.<br>\r\nA black hole had appeared over the ruined landscape swallowing everything  around it including the second sun<br>\r\nThat was scorching everything around  it a second ago. <br>\r\nThe young woman began to chuckle which eventually became full blown laughter.<br>\r\nThis was absurd. This whole situation was just ridiculous.<br>\r\nIt was as though she had stepped into one of those shonen animes Nora liked to rave on about sometimes or some poorly written story made by some random people on a creative writing website.<br>\r\nShe continued to laugh her head off  for a good five minutes as she was most likely overwhelmed by temporary insanity.<br>\r\nHer laughter was cut short when she heard an earth rumbling sound that she has become all too familiar with.<br>\r\nHer face twisted into a mask of horror when she saw the very earth she was standing on ripped from it's foundations and pulled into the sky towards the hungry void.  A blood curdling scream tore through her lips  as she fell into its depths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang was feeling pretty bummed out right now. She had thought she had finally become strong enough to beat her younger sister in a fight by herself but that was clearly not the case.<br>\r\n When the colossal firebrand had awoken she had found herself floating in a black featureless void. She had spent five hours trying to find a way out but came up empty each time and so with nothing to do she opted to wait it out, whatever this was. The place the sunny goliath found herself in was a space that existed past the event horizon the artificial black hole as a sort of pocket universe of seemingly endless nothingness as far as the eye could see where space and time ceased to have any meaning. Though only a few moments would have past on the outside, from the perspective of the brawler,  twenty one days would pass by where she simply floated in the black expanse thinking and waiting for something to happen.<br>\r\nEventually, her patience would be rewarded when one day, after playing twenty questions with herself for the millionth time, she saw a pinprick of light in the corner of her eye, it was difficult to tell whether it was far away or not in this place by she could swear that it looked like it was growing, as though it was getting closer. Her theory would be proven correct when the light expanded and engulfed her entire field of view. She raised her arms in an attempt to shield herself before everything went white.<br>\r\nWhen she next came to,  she found herself at the bottom of a deep hole that appeared as though it was burned through rather than dug out. <br>\r\nAs she lay on her back she concluded that she and her fellow Gigant teammates would have to take on Ruby at the same time if they were to have any chance at winning.<br>\r\nYang stood up to her full 69 foot height and dusted herself off before kicking off<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That didn't work.\u201d The Brawler stated Bluntly.<br>\r\n\u201c No kidding.\u201d The gigantic Ninja replied with  a healthy amount of snark.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that all about? It looked like you turned into a sun!\u201d Pyrrha shouted excitedly.<br>\r\nYang beamed with pride at the duelist\u2019s reaction. \u201c I call it the BIG YANG! I came up with it myself.\u201d <br>\r\n\u201cThat's incredible! You MUST tell me how you did it!\u201d Pyrrha asked enthusiastically, the flames of her warrior spirit stoked more than they ever been before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe later. Right now we have a match to win!\u201d the towering Blonde beauty raised her fist in the air as she made her declaration, her massive naked breasts bounced wildly from the action.<br>\r\n\u201c And how are we supposed to do that?\u201d Blake said almost dismissively, she pulled a random piece of charred shrubbery out of her disheveled hair and chucked it behind her. \u201cshe's shrugged off pretty much everything we've thrown at her so fat and she doesn't even look like  she's broken a sweat!\u201d Doubt at their chances of victory had become evident on her face. <br>\r\nPyrrha nodded in agreement . <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat's why we're all going to attack her at the same time!\u201d Yang declared  heroically, undeterred by the odds stacked against her. She then brought her teammates together in a huddle.<br>\r\n\u201cLook. The way I see it, our best option is for all of us to  come at her from all sides. That way she has to focus all her energy trying to keep track of us, making it easier to  catch her off balance so we can push her out of her little circle.\u201d<br>\r\nPyrrha had nodded in approval at the plan where as Blake grabbed her left arm with a look of uncertainty.<br>\r\n\u201cI don't know\u2026.\u201d<br>\r\nYang placed her hand on her feline friends shoulder.<br>\r\n\u201c Is going  to work. Trust me.\u201d She said reassuringly.<br>\r\n  The goliath black cat woman began to perk up. <br>\r\n\u201cAll right I'm in.\u201d<br>\r\nYang pumped her fist in joy.<br>\r\nPyrrha drew out her sword and shield.<br>\r\n\u201cBesides. This is the best plan we have.\u201d The Spartan chimed in.<br>\r\n\u201c if this doesn't work nothing will\u201d<br>\r\nThe other two women nodded in agreement.<br>\r\nThey gathered what was left of their gear and stormed off in the direction of the  giant red menace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was very pleased with herself. She had thwarted her sister's strongest attack and shut down her counter attacks before she could even fire them off, all without exerting any effort. <br>\r\nShe laughed a deep full belly laugh that shook the eath. She felt unstoppable! Nothing could beat her! She was the strongest one there is!<br>\r\nAs she basked in the throes of her power high, she  saw three massive figures heading towards her position.<br>\r\n\u201cso they decided to come at me all at once. Eh?\u201d  The crimson force of nature mused to herself.<br>\r\nGood.<br>\r\nRuby turned towards them with open arms as the challengers approached her to make what was most likely their final assault. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three lesser Gigants wasted no time on their attacks.<br>\r\nBlake let loose the opening  salvo in the form of one thousands clones coming at the scarlet  Titaness with a level of ferocity that would make even  the greatest of  Atlisan soldiers and the most savage of grimm cower in terror.  Her assault from when this  exercise was as nothing before the hellish bombardment the book loving woman unleashed, each individual blow delivered by  her and her clones carried a hundred times more destructive  force than that of her opening attack in it's entirety, she even infused  her weapon with lightning dust for good  measure. <br>\r\nIn response, Ruby had channeled energy dust to erect a barrier around herself.  Countless bolts of electrical arced out in all directions as the Blake army\u2019s attacks struck against it.<br>\r\nNext came Yang who flew in like a blazing comet and started wailing on Ruby's shield with a machine gun like flurry of punchs, each hit that connected created something hundred mile long fissures in the  earth that  spewed lava high into the air like volcanoes.<br>\r\nAnd finally Pyrrha, who opted to hang in the back.<br>\r\nIf one were to have looked in the sky at that moment it would appear as though the stars had come out earlier than they were supposed to, but they would be wrong.<br>\r\nThose were not stars. They were countless balls of super dense plasma arranged into a dome like pattern that acted as an inescapable kill box spanning  a thousand miles in diameter. With a look of  serene calm and focus, she willed the orbs to unleash their payload. Millions and millions of  searing hot spears  of  light lanced through the air towards the central location of the red earth shakers and  hit their mark.<br>\r\nMere seconds before the beams of death struck, Ruby had  altered the properties of her force field to make the lasers  refract away from her in all directions. This did something to the effect of producing a laser light show of  countless prismatic beams of light that the entire country was privy to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three challengers poured everything they had in their in their final assault, Ruby couldn't help but feel a sense of pride well up within her. <br>\r\nIn such a short amount time her teammates have grown to such astonishing levels. There was even a moment where she was actually afraid that they were going to pull the rug out from under her. <br>\r\nThis sparring match was some of the greatest fun she's  had in years! But she decided that she finally had her fill for the day.<br>\r\nIt was time to end this.<br>\r\nWithin the protective walls of her barrier, The silver eyed   Gigant stood up to her full 92 Imposing feet of height and opened her arms wide. Then , after channeling a potent cocktail of different dust mixtures and adding a layer of  reality warping into the mix for good measure, she gave  a playful wink towards her friends before clapping her hands together. <br>\r\nWhat followed would be written down in the history books of remnant for generations to come. <br>\r\nA massive wave of light  and energy rushed across the land  in the blink of an eye.<br>\r\nIts scale was such that the entirety of  the region they were fighting in was subsumed by an impenetrable dome of power that could be seen from orbit.<br>\r\nSo great were the forces unleashed that not only was the entire country bombarded by a seemingly unending torrent of massive earthquakes and typhoons, but actual tears and distortions in reality would start to pop up all over the planet. <br>\r\nThis brilliant display of destruction that would undoubtedly spawn several new religions, lasted for ten whole minutes before eventually subsiding into nothingness. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeeks(?) ago somewhere else. A familiar ice queen was  pacing around in circles and aimlessly firing dust bolts into the void simply because there was nothing else to do. <br>\r\nWhen she had first woken up  she had found herself marooned on a floating island, which she would recognize as the massive piece of land she was standing on before it and she were sucked into the virtual black hole, set adrift in an infinite abyss of Black emptiness alongside other huge chunks of land.<br>\r\n She had spent the first five days searching for anything resembling an exit from this inky black purgatory to no <br>\r\nAvail. Panic set in as she feared the worst, followed by  an endless tirade of rage aimed at Ruby and her fellow Gigant classmates which eventually led to the heiress falling to her knees in despair and anguish, finally ending with her  curling up into a of resignation and apathy.<br>\r\nThat was five weeks ago.<br>\r\nDuring all that time, Weiss had decided to spend it thinking about things, it was the only other thing to do here other pace around and shoot dust bolts.<br>\r\nShe pondered on all the events that lead her here.<br>\r\nAbout all the sacrifices she had to make to get to where she was, about all the struggles and hardships she had to endure, about how all of it was rendered completely nil in the presence of even the weakest and most humble of Gigants, and about the sheer absurdity of her situation.<br>\r\nHow was she even still alive for starters.<br>\r\nThe only logical explanation she could come up with was that Ruby's durability semblance somehow also maintained its target's bodily functions, which would explain how she was able to go without food or water for days on end.<br>\r\nNot that it even mattered at this point. <br>\r\nThe frigid young woman stewed in self pity for hours as has become her routine.<br>\r\nShe was stirred from her chronic malaise  when she noticed a pinprick of light in the distance.<br>\r\nAt first she had thought that she had finally gone insane until it started to get bigger at terrifying rate.<br>\r\nShe instantly raised a glyph in defense out of fear and reflex before being engulfed by the light.<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She groggily rose up from her unplanned bed to get a better look at where she was. <br>\r\nShe discovered that she had been laying in a puddle made from the long melted ice wall she created to defend herself and that she was at the bottom of a deep crevasse. She began to chain hop her way towards the top of the gap using her glyphs as platforms. <br>\r\nWhen she finally  got out, she was beholden to the familiar sight of the obliterated hellscape that was once the training grounds. <br>\r\nThe Fencer would experimentally pinch her cheeks.<br>\r\nThan she would slap herself.<br>\r\nThan she violently punched herself in the stomach with an aura enhanced fist and puke up whatever was left in her stomach.<br>\r\nShe sat there in silence for a minute.<br>\r\nThe she started to weep and produce insane laughter. She was free! SHE WAS FREE!!!!<br>\r\nshe was free from that empty Black hell!<br>\r\nA powerful sense of relief and gratitude washed over her.<br>\r\nShe also noticed, to her delight, that she didn't hear anything resembling the sound of battling Gigants.<br>\r\nWas it finally over?<br>\r\nThe Heiress's petite body racked with her hysterical laughter at the prospect.<br>\r\nShe was than suddenly and violently knocked out of her revelry by a world shakingly  loud noise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh no\u2026\u2026.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe  Fencer slowly  turned her head towards the source of the sound.<br>\r\nA massive white hot dome/wall of light and power took up her entire field of vision, stretching across the horizon and  piercing the sky. It consumed everything around it as it expanded.<br>\r\nAnd it was heading right for her.<br>\r\nWeiss fell to her knees and simply smiled in resignation.<br>\r\nThere was no point.<br>\r\nAnd then the entire world became white.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scarlet Titaness gazed down upon her work in satisfaction. The entire region she and  her opponents  were fighting in only moments prior had been reduced to  a smoldering crater of glass and molten material that stretched out in all directions as far as the eye could see, creating a vast chasm extending thirteen miles underground. <br>\r\nSpeaking of opponents. <br>\r\nThe Gigant queen extended her aura enhanced senses across the ruined plane in search of them.<br>\r\nEventually she had picked up the three distinct spiritual energy signatures of her fellow Gigants and friends in different parts of the annihilated region.<br>\r\nAll three of them were either physically embedded in the ground, encased in a mass of solidified glass, or  totally submerged in a literal lake of lava and fire.<br>\r\nThey were all stunned, bruised, and completely out of it, the only reason they are even still breathing is thanks to the power of the durability semblance. Regardless, the fact remained at they were no longer able to fight.<br>\r\nBut Ruby wasn't done yet.<br>\r\nThe world breaking teen crouched down to the ground and dug an unimaginably powerful hand into the ground and projected her durability semblance over a vast area . <br>\r\nAnd then, with one arm, she proceeded to lift a mass comparable to half the size of the entire region over her head, holding it together with her durability semblance.<br>\r\nShe then shook the entire mass as though it where a stubborn cardboard box that refused to release its contents which had the intended effect of releasing the stilled forms of her friends their prisons and causing them to enter a free fall.<br>\r\nWith a flick of her wrist,  Ruby drew the trio towards herself and caught them in the crushing embrace of her arms, held firmly against her naked mountainous bosom!<br>\r\nShe then dropped the mass back in place.<br>\r\nThe shock waves produced by the impact were enough to cause earth quakes and tidal waves to breakout across the planet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby gazed down at the three Gigant women entrapped against the surface of her mastodonian breasts and smiled at them.<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like I win!\u201d The Crimson haired girl exclaimed happily.<br>\r\nThe three groaned in great discomfort before the Fiery brawler mustered up enough of her wits to speak.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah Yeah  you won. Now could you please put us down?Being smooshed against my baby sister's boobs is really embarrassing, let alone alongside three other people.\u201d<br>\r\nRuby had the decency to blush at her sister's remark and   immediately set the three  combatants down.<br>\r\n\u201c He he sorry\u2026\u201d Ruby apologized sheepishly while rubbing  the back of her head.<br>\r\nThe three Gigant women worked out the kinks in their bruised and battered bodies and cleaned themselves off as best they could. <br>\r\nWhile the other two challengers were licking their wounds, the elder xiaolong sibling paced around in a circle with her arms folded over her substantial bare melons before growling in frustration and kicking a stray rock on the ground, inadvertently sending it to orbit.<br>\r\n\u201cRAAAGH!! DAMN IT RUBY! YOUR JUST TOO STRONG!!!\u201d<br>\r\nThe hulking bombshell shouted angrily at her sister.<br>\r\n\u201cI really thought I had you this time. But you just kept swatting away my punches like they were nothing!! LIKE  YOU ALWAYS DO!!!\u201d<br>\r\nShe then proceeded to fall on her ginormous butt and pouted like a little kid.<br>\r\nRuby just smirked at that statement. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat can I say? I'm a big girl.\u201d Ruby empathized those last words by flexing her two perfect arms.<br>\r\nYang simply grumbled in response.<br>\r\nRuby took on a more softer tone as she knelt down next to her sister.<br>\r\n\u201cHey, if it makes you feel any better there were a bunch of times during the match were I thought I was gonna lose \u201c<br>\r\nRuby stated matter-of-factly.<br>\r\nYang was not convinced. \u201cYour just saying that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby raised her hands in a defensive gesture. \u201c No really! I mean it! When you  used that \u201cBig Yang\" thing of yours I really thought I was going to be pushed out of the ring!\u201d<br>\r\nShe then gestured to the other two Gigants women.<br>\r\n\u201csame thing with you  guys as well! When Pyrrha for fired that crazy doom laser of hers or even when Blake came at me with all those clones, I really started sweating bullets.\u201d<br>\r\n The  blonde Brawler Looked up at her sister with a twinge of hopefulness in her eyes. \u201creeeaally?\u201d<br>\r\nBlake Placed her hand on her partner's bulky shoulder.<br>\r\n\u201c she's right Yang. It may not be by much, but we have definitely gotten closer to actually beating Ruby in a match and we're only going to get stronger.\u201d<br>\r\nPyrrha nodded in agreement. \u201cI'll say. You guys are among the few people I've met that can actually given me a workout! We have to  spar with each other again sometime!<br>\r\nA few moments of consideration later and the wild maned giantess  decided to  believe these words and immediately perked up.<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what you're right, we are pretty awesome. And we're only going to get better!\u201d she shouted with renewed  confidence.<br>\r\nYang  turned to look up at her sister and leader with her trademarked  daring smile restored.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd who knows? Maybe the next time we fight. I'LL be the \u201cBIG\u201d sister.<br>\r\nRuby returned her sister's grin with her own<br>\r\n\u201c Don't bet on it!\u201d<br>\r\nThe Four giant all laughed earth shaking laughs<br>\r\nThings were going to get a lot more interesting the girls in the future.<br>\r\nAs this heart to heart played out however, the girls couldn't shake this ever growing nagging sensation that something was amiss, as if they were forgetting something really important.<br>\r\n  Blake was the first to act on this feeling.\u201c Has anyone seen Weiss?\u201d <br>\r\nThe four  women looked at each other with concern.<br>\r\nOnly one thing could be said.<br>\r\n\u201cAh shit.\u201d </span></div></div>",

With her trusty rapier Myrtenaster in hand, Her first course of action  was to use ice dust in oder to make a makeshift igloo.

She reached out to touch it, and felt energy wash over her and her eyes.  And then she saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was a 65 foot tall Gigant, the same height as Jaune, with muscles big enough to lift mountains, breasts and a behind that would cause crowds of men to faint just from a slight shake, and the power to keep up with her teammates.  She no longer had to be jealous of her teammates, or anyone.  With their raw might, Team RWBY would be unstoppable, and Weiss Schnee would be considered the mightiest Huntress in the Schnee family, especially with it being primarily composed of mere little people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer smile went from ear to ear.  Her muscles danced with anticipation to show off their near limitless might.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could do anything with her new body, however, the light faded, and she was back to normal.  The same tiny, weak, Weiss that was tossed around like a leaf in the wind by her colossal teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d She yelled, although no one seemed to hear it.  \u201cIt\u2019s not fair!  I don\u2019t want revenge, I just want to be big!  Stupid thing!  Make me big!  Make me big!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears went down her eyes as she looked on at where the weird tear used to be, wondering what it was and what it showed her.  It was her deepest desire, not to be superior to her teammates, but to be an equal among them.  Sighing heavily, Weiss was ready to return to her igloo and rest before she looked on her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was clothed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore notably, she was clothed in her normal outfit, rather than anything unrecognizable.  While the warmth her clothing provided was more than welcome, she was now more confused than anything.  Heading back to shelter, she began to try and put things together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not hallucinating, otherwise this wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d Weiss said aloud, holding her dress.  \u201cBut that...thing showed me as a Gigant!  A pretty good looking one too,\u201d she said smugly, before returning to her task at hand.  \u201cBut how?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the idea of her hallucinating rejected, Weiss began to ponder the alternatives, no matter how bizarre or seemingly impossible.  This tear, distortion, or whatever it was showed a reality where she had her desire fulfilled.  But when it closed, the energy returned her to a \u201cdefault\u201d, namely what she looked like when others described her, down to the exact dimensions of her uniform.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she continued to find tears, she concluded that it could be more likely that it would edge her closer and closer from what her reality was to what her reality wanted her to be in that deep desire, a Gigant able to keep up with her friends as they grew in power and size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was all hypothetical though.  For all she knew, touching the next tear would turn her into dust, or shift reality in a way that wouldn\u2019t be to her favor, like taking away her clothes, or sending her somewhere completely isolated.  But that wasn\u2019t going to stop her.  She left the igloo and traveled, looking for another tear like the one she found.  Weiss knew that it was there, and that if she found it, she would have the body she saw in that brief flash.  Time had faded into the background as Weiss lost track of how long she was walking.  Her feet ached, her teeth chattered, and her fingers began to go slightly numb, but her mind pushed forward.  A Gigant would weather this storm effortlessly, and so would she.  She would her find her goal, the Snow Fairy would become the Frost Giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, as she walked over a hill, she came upon something.</span></div></div>",

She groaned slightly, wondering if her trek was for nothing, before reasoning that at least the town would have a place to eat and something to call Beacon and let them know where she was.  That was if there was anything left of the facility, despite every building being reinforced to handle the power of Gigants, what she had witnessed seemed so far beyond anything little people could handle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she headed into town however, she saw that there was a good amount of commotion on the road.  It looked like numerous people, scientists, soldiers, and the like all looked on at something in the middle of the road.  She wondered if there was a way to get close to it when she felt her dress and realized that she had some spare money in it.  Doing her best to avoid the crowds, she walked into a small restaurant several blocks from the commotion and ordered a large coffee and a small danish, something to recharge after the trip and give her a reason to discuss what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s your order, Miss,\u201d the waitress, a woman in her forties with brunette hair and a slight accent said.  \u201cYou with the crew over that weird thing in town?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeird thing?  Could it be one of the tears?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m a freelancer,\u201d Weiss said.  \u201cHandling assignments for Hunters between classes.  I got a call about something weird in town and was told to come over, but they didn\u2019t say what.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the science or whatnot, but they said it was some sort of dimensional tear.  All I know is that when it did show up a few of the cars next to it vanished.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the tear!  And her ticket to becoming a Gigant!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell I\u2019d better go see it before all the fun is over,\u201d Weiss said, only for the woman to shake her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t give you any ID?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then good luck getting near there!  I had to take the long way around work because of all the soldiers on patrol!  Only thing missing was one of them Gigant people.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEh, they\u2019re overrated,\u201d Weiss said as she finished the last of her coffee and paid the waitress for the meal.  Walking outside, she quickly slipped into an alleyway and leapt to a rooftop.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe waitress was correct, as there were tons of Atlas military personnel along with several people in what appeared to be hazmat suits observing the tear with instruments, but daring to not touch it.  They probably had no idea what they were dealing with, but Weiss knew.  The problem now was trying to get to the tear and touching it without being shot by the guys with guns.  On the plus side, the lack of any Gigants made this a much easier assignment than it would have been otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK Weiss,\u201d she said to no one in particular, \u201cyou can do this.  Just gotta get to the tear, and with any luck, you\u2019ll grow to Gigant size.  Just need to get to it without getting shot.  You\u2019ve got this.\u201d</span></div></div>",

Not only was she an incredibly skilled Huntress, her presence would alert her family to her involuntary hooky.  And for what?  \u2018No Winter, really, touching the space and time anomaly will make me a Gigant and infinitely more powerful than before, which I need before a training exercise sends me somewhere I won\u2019t return from?  Yeah, she\u2019s bound to believe that.  No, she still had to grab the tear and hope against hope it made her a Gigant.  The power to keep up with her friends was so close and she wasn\u2019t going to give it up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA rip in space and time, Doctor?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA scruff man with a beard nodded at the tall, for a little person woman.  \u201cYes, and not the only one we\u2019ve seen, but the one in the most public area.  Apparently 18 or so hours ago, a massive exertion of physical force near Beacon Academy resulted in this happening.  Whatever did it seemed to wipe the surrounding forest away as smooth as glass before these tears formed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat could have such power to do that?  Was there a terrorist attack?  A military action?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeacon has a fairly large population of Gigants, and yesterday, pretty much every Gigant on the planet seemed to more than double in size and muscle mass.  You know how destructive a single Gigant can be with their Aura, now more than double that and add several in the same area.  They are walking weapons of mass destruction.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s...absurd,\u201d the white haired woman said.  \u201cAnd Beacon itself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe academy and the surrounding town were built to Gigant specifications and apparently weathered the storm, although more construction is being done to repair the damage.  I swear, Gigant construction workers are making a small fortune with all the demand for their services.  You know a Gigant put my local...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTask at hand Doctor,\u201d the woman replied.  \u201cHow do we get rid of this safety?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that\u2019s the good news.  All it requires is a fairly potent charge of negative ions to counteract the presence of the tear and it should close up before doing any more damage.  Although I did want to observe its effect on the local...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe train of thought was interrupted by the sound of gunfire as soldiers began firing at a figure moving along the rooftops, using skill and glyphs to move through the hail of bullets.  Winter grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking closer, she recognized the assailant, and was visibly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo far, so good.  Weiss was quickly moving from one rooftop to another, dodging and incapacitating soldiers with her semblance as she got closer and closer to her prize.  She could feel it.  She could taste it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss!  Hold it right there!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Schnee heiress grimaced at the sight of her sister, but paid her no mind.  She continued her relentless leaps towards her prize, only to find that her sister was standing guard in front of it, sword at the ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you insane?  What are you even doing here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t explain,\u201d Weiss said.  \u201cI just need to get to that tear!\u201d</span></div></div>",

The light that was generated blinded everyone in the immediate vicinity except for Weiss who had the good sense to shield her eyes.<br>\r\nWinter let out a loud yelp as she recoiled from the flash, Completely dropping her guard along with every other soldier present.<br>\r\nIt was now or never.<br>\r\nIn a brilliant display of acrobatics, the heiress launched herself  into the air with one of her glyphs and somersaulted over every soldier and barricade directly in front of the tear.<br>\r\nWeiss took a moment to gaze at her prize.<br>\r\nThis shimmering vortex of possibilities had the potential to either grant her greatest wish or completely destroy her.<br>\r\nFor the briefest of micro seconds the ambitious young woman contemplated on whether or  not this course of action was worth it.<br>\r\nThe memory of being tossed about like a mote of dust and her time in \u201cThe Void\" screamed Yes.<br>\r\nWithout a second thought, the ice princess reached out with her hand and made contact with the anomaly.<br>\r\nThe tear seemed to ripple for a moment before releasing a powerful  burst of energy that violently pushed everything around away from it and engulf everything in a brilliant explosion of light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------00000-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss felt strange, to say the least, as though she was submerged in water though she could still breathe.  <br>\r\nA quick observation  of her surroundings revealed that she was floating in some manner of starry space.<br>\r\nA spark of panic swept through her mind at the prospect of having damned herself to be banished to another void but was dosed by a mysterious warmth.<br>\r\nIt was like she was wrapped in a comfortable  blanket that caused all of her worries to melt away.<br>\r\nShe spent a few seconds simply enjoying the feeling until a twinkle in the distance caught her attention. <br>\r\nOne of the stars in this twilight flickered and pulsed on the horizon. Becoming more and more erratic until it appeared to be wobbling. Then without warning, the point of like shot off like a bullet at incredible speeds, resembling a shooting star as it streaked across the  skyline. The star zigzagged and twirled through the air in a dazzling array of intricate patterns.<br>\r\nThe Frigid huntress stared at the display in amazement, she could look at it all day and never one get tired of it.<br>\r\nThe star would then suddenly stop,  confusing the snowy girl for a moment. <br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening now?\u201d She thought to herself in concern.<br>\r\nThen as suddenly as it had stopped,  it rocketed forward at even greater speeds than before directly towards  Weiss's position.<br>\r\nIn a panic, the icy young woman crossed her arms over her face and braced for impact.<br>\r\nTwo seconds pass ,Then another five with nothing happening.<br>\r\nConfused, the icy huntress slowly opened her eyes and dropped her guard to see what was up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA ball of intense light no bigger than a softball hung in the air in front of her. <br>\r\nThe orb irradiated a prismatic Corona of tiny hair-like tendrils from its core that seemed to dance against the darkened backdrop of this twilit plane.<br>\r\nIt was all so breathtaking. <br>\r\nRight before the she could reach out to touch it, the orb suddenly  shot forward, striking her in her torso and was seemingly  absorbed into her body .<br>\r\nA Feeling of pure ecstasy pulsed through her body as she became filled with an energy she had never known before.<br>\r\nShe felt as though power was being funneled into her very being, like her very essence was being super charged. It was so intense that she almost came right then and there.<br>\r\nJust as suddenly as it began, the surge halted and the Heiress was left panting where she stood.<br>\r\nShe felt\u2026.stronger. significantly stronger. <br>\r\nIt was more than that. She also felt like there was\u2026.MORE of her somehow.<br>\r\nAfter regaining her composure, the icy young woman took a moment to appraise herself.<br>\r\nHer clothes were stretched taunt over muscles that weren't there before. She had the build of a well seasoned  amateur body  builder, every square inch of musculature was sculpted to perfection and seemed to dance with unbridled power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The girl flexed her left arm experimentally and watched in undisguised awe as her bicep seemed to dance beneath the sleeves of her jacket.<br>\r\nA wide smile broke across the Heiress's face.<br>\r\nShe started to giggle  to herself .<br>\r\nHer  giggling eventually grew into full blown maniacal laughter as she came to realize what this place was.<br>\r\nIn that moment, every star in this space began to flicker just like the one before.<br>\r\nThese were not \u201c stars\" like she had initially thought.<br>\r\nThey were  Possibilities!<br>\r\n Weiss gazed dramatically at the skyline with a confident smirk on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome to me!\u201d the Schnee  heiress declared  with a commanding voice.<br>\r\nIn response, all the lights in this starry realm rush towards her at once, all of them slamming into her body and being assimilated by it.<br>\r\nThe sheer ecstasy she felt in that moment could not be described in mere words.<br>\r\nIt felt as though every cell in her body was being suffused with the energy of a million suns all being funneled into her at once.<br>\r\nUnending screams of pure rapturous pleasure tore out as she came ceaselessly, each climax better and more powerful than the last.<br>\r\nHer body grew brighter and brighter as seemingly boundless power flooded  into it until a massive explosion of light rushed outwards in all directions, consuming the entire space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-------00000-------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack outside  in the  square, Winter was  picking herself off the ground, having been thrown bodily through the air When the anomaly violently collapsed.<br>\r\nThe hardened woman spit up some dirt that got in her mouth.<br>\r\nWhat was that stupid little girl thinking!<br>\r\nNot only was she apparently playing hooky, an action the older schnee sibling would never expect from  the academically minded girl, But also violated the boundaries of a clearly restricted area.<br>\r\n\u201cwhen I get my hands on you\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe army woman's train of thought was interrupted when she noticed that a large shadow had been cast on the area.<br>\r\nConfused, the serious minded woman raised her head to see what was going on and was immediately floored by what she witnessed.<br>\r\nIn the middle of the square stood a truly massive  form where  there wasn't one before.<br>\r\nA Gigant. <br>\r\nAnd a female one at that, if the truly outrageous curves they  sported were any indication, they had a pair  of breasts twice as large as their head and a posterior to match which framed by very wide hips. <br>\r\nBy the military woman's best estimate, the  Gigant stood somewhere in the ballpark of 65 feet tall, most of it coming from its perfectly sculpted legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also noticed that the giant was wearing nothing but a flowery white bra and a pair of underwear of the same design. <br>\r\nWinter couldn't help but blush at the sight.<br>\r\nSo many thoughts about who this person was and where they came from buzzed through her mind at once.<br>\r\nWhen she finally got a good look at the Gigant's face, her blood ran cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss?\u201d</span></div></div>",

Even with her new body, jumping there would take quite a while, not to mention the obvious trail of destruction would make it fairly easy for Winter to catch her and chew her ear out.  She needed a ride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRide...that\u2019s it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss began to focus on her semblance, but as she did so, she felt a level of Aura beyond anything she had ever felt before.  It had gone from a water fountain to a waterfall of power, the endless wellspring of power explaining how Ruby and the others could literally reshape the planet as if it were clay.  So lost was she in the intoxicating feeling of power that she hadn\u2019t realized what she had summoned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a Nevermore, a bird of magnificent length, at one point the most terrifying of Grimm that she had ever seen, a beast that in past generations blotted the skies with its wingspan and required groups of Hunters to even bring down one.  Its sharp talons and thick hide was the stuff of legends, and the mere appearance of one was enough for towns to empty.  The few men and women who killed them in generations before had songs sung of their valor and power.  Weiss remembered how effortlessly Ruby had bought one down, the first proof that the Gigants were going to completely change power balance of the world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nevermore stood in Weiss the size of a horse.  A horse with wings, but a horse all the same, and her quickest way back to Beacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood girl,\u201d Weiss said to the summoned beast, stroking its head as if it were a mere pet.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got a journey ahead of us, and thanks to you, no one is going to miss seeing the new, bigger me.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlopping her enormous behind on the creature\u2019s firm backside, Weiss marveled as the Nevermore flapped its wings, the power causing wind gusts to form and blowing over everything in its path for miles.  It was always a power to be marveled at, but Weiss grinned.  That power was now hers to wield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s go girl!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a magnificent swing of its wings, the beast took to the skies, it and it\u2019s Gigant rider heading right for Beacon academy.  Weiss couldn\u2019t help but cheer in excitement, the power of her voice echoing throughout the skies and shredding a nearby flock of birds.  This raw power would take a lot of getting used to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDay had turned into night as Ruby and the others headed back to Beacon, unable to find Weiss.  They knew she was physically okay, Ruby\u2019s durability semblance would see to that, but the fact that the little \u201csnow fairy\u201d was missing couldn\u2019t help but rub them the wrong way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have let Weiss come with us,\u201d Ruby said, her and the others having put on new pairs of clothes to replace the ones that were atomized during their sparring session.  Pyrrha had left to go on an assignment with her own team, but reassured the leader of Team RWBY that their friend was going to be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was her choice to come with us,\u201d Blake replied with a matter-of-fact tone.  \u201cShe thought she could keep with us, she couldn\u2019t, and now she has to deal with the consequences.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Yang added, \u201cit\u2019s almost more insulting if we treated her like fine china.  We can\u2019t baby other members of the team...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe\u2019s not a baby,\u201d Ruby said, defensive of her little friend, \u201cshe\u2019s just...confused.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re worrying too much Rubes.  It\u2019ll work out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby nodded, but couldn\u2019t help but feel some guilt at what had occurred.  She thought it would be funny to make one of the team normal sized, but at this point, given the raw power her and the other Gigants now wielded, it was starting to feel just plain mean keeping Weiss small.  Maybe she should make her a Gigant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat train of thought was quickly put to one side as a massive shadow headed for Beacon, one the girls recognized easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Nevermore?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, guess the day\u2019s not done yet girls!\u201d Yang said, eager to take the creature down.  But before she could do so, she noticed that the beast was being ridden.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomeone\u2019s on it!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the creature, Ruby felt a sense of relief, a sense of confusion, and a sense of pride all at the same time.  It came out in one word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBeacon!  I\u2019m back!  And I\u2019m bigger and better than ever!\u201d Weiss said aloud to no one in particular.  She was reveling in her newfound power and couldn\u2019t wait to show the others her pet.  Finding a clearing for her Nevermore, the enormous winged Grimm set itself down, as she waited to see who would greet them.</span></div></div>",

I shou...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRuby, it\u2019s fine, really\u201d, Weiss said, her voice sincere and her tone reassuring.  \u201cI was the one who asked, and well, it looks like it worked out pretty well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUh, yeah,\u201d Blake interrupted, causing the two girls to separate.  \u201cThat\u2019s great and all, but...how?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow what?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you gain sixty feet and how many tons of muscle?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we discuss it over dinner?\u201d Weiss asked.  \u201cI could use some food, and a change of clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think any of your old outfits will fit,\u201d Yang joked, \u201cbut I guess you can borrow one of mine until we can go shopping tomorrow.  You\u2019re going to have to go barefoot though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know?\u201d Weiss said.  \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that big a deal.\u201d  The Nevermore vanished as quickly as it was summoned, leaving the four girls to discuss what had happened to their friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***************************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a brief stop in the dorm room, during which Weiss thankfully found some clothes to put on, the group went off to dinner.  Blake\u2019s questions were on the hows and why\u2019s of the whole affair, but Weiss merely responded to all of them with an \u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot sure.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, yes, but also no,\u201d Weiss said.  \u201cYou see, when we fell into the hole, the force of all your auras seemed to split the fabric of reality apart and change things in the area, it was so powerful.  I just remembered getting knocked out, and when I woke up I was thousands of miles away, with well, these\u201d she said, giggling as she held her gigantic breasts aloft.  \u201cI\u2019ve gotta get used to this new center of gravity.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn\u2019t want to reveal the existence of the tears just yet for fear that others would try to duplicate what she had done, or worse yet, undo them.  Ruby didn\u2019t seem to mind, but Weiss was unaware her transformation had merely done something she had pondered doing herself.  Blake nodded at the explanation, perfectly aware of just how much force the girls had exerted prior, but wondering if there was anything missing between the time Weiss fell asleep and the time she woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four were the only ones eating in the dining room, with most of Beacon busy in the aftermath of the cataclysmic battle earlier.  The buildings were all built to Gigant specifications, but the constant literal expansion of their student body, particularly on such a massive scale, led to classes being cancelled and construction sped up to make sure everyone had enough space.  Gigant construction crews were a constant presence on campus, with students working for crews as an easy way to make tuition money.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe I need all of this,\u201d Weiss said as she ravenously dug into the food in front of her.  \u201cI think just a tiny bit of this would have been a feast for the old me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBig girls, big muscles,\u201d Yang joked as she flexed a bicep.  \u201cGotta keep em fed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of,\u201d Blake asked, \u201cdo the staff know?  I\u2019m sure once everyone sees how tall you\u2019ve gotten, they\u2019re going to have questions.  A lot of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure we can help out with that,\u201d Ruby said.  \u201cMaybe we can come up with an explanation for her.  You saw what happened out there, for all we know, Weiss got split between space and time and came out...improved.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you like what you see,\u201d Weiss said with a joking tone, \u201cbut if you could help with the explanations, I would appreciate it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOK, then it\u2019s settled.  First thing in the morning, we go explain everything, and then we\u2019re all set!  Team RWBY is going to be unstoppable!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss cheered, an uncharacteristic action prior to her growth, but she soon covered her mouth when she realized her voice shook the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry.  I\u2019m not used to that yet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou learn,\u201d Blake said reassuringly.</span></div></div>",

She was sure of it.<br>\r\nThe team stepped forward to meet whatever awaited them head on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe office of  Beacon's enigmatic director  was quite similar to its pre reality warp counterpart with the exception of being significantly larger in order to allow room for Gigant students to enter. <br>\r\nIn it's center, stood a greatly elevated platform with a tastefully designed  \u201clittle person\" scaled desk and assortment of file cabinets , which they assumed correctly belonged to the dean, that sat snugly on top of it.<br>\r\nSitting at the desk was the eccentric man himself alongside a very P.O.ed looking Glynda Goodwitch who immediately started glaring daggers at the four giant woman the moment they entered.<br>\r\nIt was a testament to the woman's steely reputation that she was able to intimidate people multiple stories taller than her with a look.<br>\r\nWeiss regained her composure and began to speak.<br>\r\n\u201c you wanted to see  me sir?\u201d<br>\r\nOzpin was looking over school reports on some holographic laptop while nursing a cup of  his favorite brand of coffee before meeting the gigantic young woman's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c It would seem that the rumors of you somehow randomly turning into a Gigant were true after all.\u201d The man took another swig of his coffee, making sure to take his time savoring the flavor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss looked very uncomfortable with this whole situation.<br>\r\n\u201cIt would appear so sir.\u201d <br>\r\nThe frost giantess appeared to find the floor very interesting.<br>\r\n\u201cI see.\u201d <br>\r\nOzpin took one more sip of his coffee before setting down and placing his hands together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd might I inquire how such an incredible transformation came about?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe studious Girl was suddenly gripped with fear and apprehension.<br>\r\nNo one could know of her encounter with the tears.<br>\r\nIf they do they might try to turn her back to being \u201cwiddle Weiss\u201d.<br>\r\nHer thoughts flashed to the \u201cVoid\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNever again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c When we were having our sparring match, at some point near the end, my teammates auras clash and, I guess,  super charged me?\u201d the troubled girl said that last sentence with a bit of uncertainty in her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man the towering young woman a look that he could tell something was fishy.<br>\r\n\u201c Are sure that there aren't any details you've omitted\u201d  the Man had begun to say.<br>\r\n\u201c NO!\u201d Weiss shouted more forcefully than she intended resulting in the various windows and glass objects to crack slightly and rendering both Glynda and himself into disheveled states. Eccentric man frowned at the sight of his coffee cup springing a leak from the cracks that had formed and Glynda<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Snowy giantess visibly grimaced at the sight and how her friends all wore looks of concern for their  comrade.<br>\r\n\u201cI-I mean no sir\u2026\u201d she said in a far more subdued volume. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin for his part took the whole thing in stride. Without skipping a beat, the well dressed man put away his damaged mug and pulled out a new one from seemingly thin air. He took a big whiff of the magnificent life sustaining black ambrosia before taking another sips.<br>\r\n\u201c Well considering how little we have to go on in this situation, that answer's as good as any.\u201d<br>\r\nThe Headmaster then donned a serious look.<br>\r\n\u201c But be warned. We are going  to be keeping a very close eye on you for the foreseeable future.\u201d<br>\r\nHe set his mug down on the table.<br>\r\n\u201cIs that understood?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Heiress swallowed a lump that had been forming in her throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC-Crystal sir.\u201d She stuttered out quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Eccentric man\u2019s calm demeanor returned to his face and posture.<br>\r\n\u201c Then it's settled then ,for now at least. I have nothing more to say on the matter.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss and co. Excused themselves from the room, relief evident in their body language, and were about to make their leave only to be stopped in their tracks when the head master halted them.<br>\r\n\u201cupupup, I may be done on the subject of Ms schnee\u2019s bizarre metamorphosis but there is still the matter of this morning\u2019s activities.\u201d<br>\r\nOzpin then turned towards his assistant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c Glynda. If you may?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stern woman gave a curt nod before placing a truly thick stack of papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c This is a list of all the repair bills that have been incurred as a result of your \u201csparring match\u201d. She said that last part with a little bit of edge to her voice causing the four huntresses to move around uncomfortably in their spots.<br>\r\n\u201c the entire super structure of the building essentially has to be completely replaced.<br>\r\nBoth gas and water lines have to swapped out and the power grid needs to be replaced as well.<br>\r\nAnd the dormitories basically have to be built back up from scratch.\u201d<br>\r\nThe woman looked up from the papers to look the four girls directly in the eyes.<br>\r\nThe girls really didn't like where this was going.<br>\r\n\u201cAnd those were for just the school grounds. The city of vale had sent us a bill today that would give you all nightmares! Untold levels of property damage had been sustained by the city and perhaps even the entire country, if all the news Reports are accurate, and Beacon is being held accountable!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls had the decency to look ashamed. They really didn't consider the consequences of their battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was the first to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were Just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlynda raised  her hand, silencing the  Gigantic student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c I don\u2019t want to hear your reasons or your excuses. I had thought you all were better disciplined on how to control your strength but it seems I had misjudged you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe combat professor pulled out her riding crop and started pointing it at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c First you will all write a one thousand paragraph essay reflecting on your poor decisions<br>\r\n Than you will all make a public apology to the entire campus and city. And finally you will be spending all of your free time for the  foreseeable future helping repair the damages you caused and when you're not doing that you will be in your rooms studying and working on the extra homework assignments you will given.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman  swung her riding crop down with a powerful flick.<br>\r\n\u201cDo I make myself clear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all nodded in unison.<br>\r\n\u201cYes ma'am.\u201d<br>\r\nGlynda sighed and turned her back to the girls.<br>\r\n\u201cThen you are dismissed.  Be thankful that this is all your getting.<br>\r\nAfter the stunt you pulled, you all are getting off easy.\u201d<br>\r\nAs the girl's turned to leave, the hard minded professor spoke up one more time.<br>\r\n\u201cOh and please tell  Ms Nikos that these goes for her as well when she gets back from her assignment.\u201d<br>\r\nWhen the door to the office shut, the no-nonsense woman pinched the bridge of her nose and let out an exasperated sigh.<br>\r\nThis whole situation was insane.<br>\r\nShe turned toward her boss / leader.<br>\r\n\u201cYou sure know how to pickem.\u201d<br>\r\nOzpin let out a small chuckle at hearing this.<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I do don't I.\u201d he took another swig of his beloved brew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlynda stared out the cracked window at the cityscape on the horizon.<br>\r\n\u201cDo you think they will be able to make a difference against her?\u201d<br>\r\nOpzin had an unreadable expression on his face as he  stared down at his reflection  in the mug.<br>\r\n\u201cOnly time will tell.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------0000-----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in their makeshift dorm rooms , the girls were mulling over today's events.<br>\r\n\u201cWell. This sucks\" Yang said Bluntly. <br>\r\nBlake was currently working on her weapon to take her mind off things.<br>\r\n\u201c Can't say we don't deserve it though.\u201d The cat faunus responded sagely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang blew a piece of hair from her from her face.<br>\r\n\u201cYour probably right\u2026\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Blonde brawler turned to face her newly Gigantized friend.<br>\r\n\u201cSo what was that all about? You look like you were about to seriously freak out.\u201d<br>\r\nWeiss sat up from her impromptu bed as though she was startled.<br>\r\n\u201cI-I was nothing! Really! Was just worried about getting in trouble with the Headmaster that's all!\u201d<br>\r\nShe then regained some semblance of composure before continuing to speak.<br>\r\n\u201c So what should we do first on our list?\u201d Weiss asked her teammates, trying to change the subject, an action that did not go unnoticed by Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crimson haired colossus  took a second to think before answering.<br>\r\n\u201cWe should probably help  with repairs around the school before turning in.\u201d<br>\r\nThe rest of the team nodded at that suggestion and got up to begin working<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Ruby began pondering what to do next\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Exhaustion permeated throughout the muscles of all four girls as they walked off from the sit,e their shift finally ended.  The construction crews had taken addition of four Gigants volunteering and set them to work on reconstruction efforts that didn\u2019t require any sort of delicate training.  That meant lifting a lot of bricks, lifting a lot of metal, and letting the more experienced workers handle things like welding and tool use.  When their shift was done for the day, the girls walked off as the soreness permeated every single fiber of muscle.  Weiss, in particular, was dealing with a crash course in using her new size and power to help out, but the sheer workload kept her from thinking about it too heavily until she went back to the dorm to clean herself up and saw her old area of the dorm, which she could now hold in her hand like a play set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo think, I used to sleep here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re a Gigant now,\u201d Ruby said with a beaming grin.  \u201cYou\u2019re big enough to eat off this thing!  Embrace it!\u201d  She smiled at the scarlet huntress, then looked on at her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, which reminds me, I need to go get my new clothes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGetting off of campus would do us some good,\u201d Blake said.  And with that, the four headed off to the store.  The mood was fairly optimistic given the exhaustion being felt and the sight of people working to repair the damage that was laid bare by the girls and their practice session.  Saying that Ruby underestimated the sheer unmitigated might that she now possessed was a gross understatement.  Next time, she had to use her semblance to do something like contain the damage in a limited space.  As it stood now, she had made her mistake and had to live with it, not wanting to try and change the circumstances with her semblance and potentially create new problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss, for her part, seemed to take to her new scale rather quickly.  When on the way, a group of little people complimented her arms, her reaction was to flex a gigantic bicep in front of the group, before thanking them for the compliment.  She was less enthusiastic when someone from the campus asked about Weiss\u2019 old size, the frost giantess clearly uncomfortable with the subject as she gave a few little details before changing the subject.  It was something the others all noticed, but none of them pressed it further for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, the group had reached the clothing store, and Weiss was trying on a variation of the Gigant uniform with a white and silver trim, with black shorts.  Flexing as she took in the sight of her new body in the outfit, the Gigant grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good look for me, wouldn\u2019t you say?  Really shows off my body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd here I thought you\u2019d be a bit more...conservative,\u201d Yang said, but Weiss was quick to shake her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo way!  That was old, \u2018wittle Weiss\u2019!  Big Weiss has big things to show off!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, if you\u2019re comfortable,\u201d Yang said, \u201cthen you wear it.\u201d\u2028<br>\r\n\u201cThat sounds like a plan to me!\u201d  The whole while, Blake nodded, but her doubt about the situation and Weiss\u2019 actions continued to ring in her head.  It was clear that there was something missing here, or maybe the exhaustion that was only starting to subside was messing with their heads.</span></div></div>",

Every time she tried one on, she flexed, posed, and in general put it through the paces to ensure that it would compliment her enhanced figure, something the old, demure Weiss would never do without being forced to.  Soon enough, she had gathered a replacement wardrobe that would serve her for the immediate future and was on her way out of the store.  Her friends seemed to be more open with her, discussing the things to watch out for not only with shopping for clothing, but general actions with her body, most notably how to control their voices to avoid damaging the area around them.  Weiss took the advice with a keen ear and a smile, allowing the girls to explain anything they deemed important in detail.  It felt like a barrier was removed between the group, the distance caused by their different scales now gone completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group was all set to go get dinner when a call came in on a cell phone, Ruby\u2019s to be particular.  A bit surprised at this, she realized the person on the other end wasn\u2019t calling her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss?  It\u2019s for you.  It\u2019s...your sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss bit back a curse, but took the phone.  \u201cCould you give a few minutes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure.  Is there anything...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!  Just...you know, sibling stuff.  You know how it is.\u201d  With that, Weiss retreated to a corner to speak with her sister.  Her heart weighed heavy as she knew exactly why she called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That\u2019s all you have to say for yourself?  Hey?  How about \u2018I\u2019m sorry that I tried to skip out of class?  I tapped into a power that scientists can\u2019t understand and emerged 65 feet tall and covered head to toe in muscles?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook, Winter, it\u2019s fine.  I\u2019m just...bigger now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Is that so?  Then I suppose you won\u2019t mind if Atlas scientists have a look at you.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNO!\u201d Weiss yelled, the noise loud enough to shake the ground and nearby buildings.  Sighing at the unrestrained power of her voice, she repeated \u201cNo\u201d more softly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Weiss, what you did interfered with potential scientific breakthroughs and Atlas\u2019 national security.  I can try, key word, try to smooth things over, but if you don\u2019t submit to examination, you will be taken by force.  And I don\u2019t care how big you\u2019ve gotten or how much Aura you now have, Atlas WILL bring you in by any means necessary.  I can only protect you for so long.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t take this away from me,\u201d Weiss said, emotion clearly forming on her words.  \u201cIt\u2019s...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You don\u2019t want to be returned to normal?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s...it\u2019s complicated.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Maybe, but my superiors demands are simple.  You\u2019re going to get a place to meet and to have experiments run on you.  Some of those experiments may involve seeing if the process can be...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said no!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>You need to be reasonable.  You did something that you weren\u2019t supposed to do, and now you need to own up to the responsibilities of doing so.  Further instructions will be coming.  For your sake you had better not ignore them.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan you at least have them promise they won\u2019t try to undo it?  Please?\u201d  She was one step away from crying, finally having acquired the power to be equal to her friends, and only a day later, having someone threaten to take it completely away.</span></div></div>",

But I make no promises. \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss felt a sense of cautious relief pass through her at the woman's words.<br>\r\n\u201c Thank you\u2026\u2026winter. \u201c Weiss said quietly.<br>\r\nAfter that exchange, the younger Schnee sibling hanged up her scroll leaving the eldest to ponder on how to go about making this happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer scroll once again rang out, no doubt her superiors wanting to check in on her progress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe placed the device in some slot on her desk and watched as a cone of bluish light shone down from <br>\r\nthe ceiling with a series of computer monitor-like screens materializing into being shortly after.<br>\r\nOn each of the screens were the forms of various individuals in very nice clothes. One of the individuals <br>\r\nDisplayed on the screens was the familiar form of general ironwood.<br>\r\n\u201c specialist schnee. What are these reports I'm seeing about a Gigant girl suddenly appearing into existence where the tear used to be?\u201d the cybernetic man inquired his subordinate.<br>\r\n\u201c They're all true sir.\u201d Winter said without skipping a beat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIncluding the ones that say that the Gigant in question was your sister?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe army woman swallowed a lump in her throat.<br>\r\n\u201cYes sir\u2026\u201d she said quieter this time.<br>\r\nIronwood seemed put off by this <br>\r\n\u201c From what you've told me and according to all of our background checks, she was a normal sized human until this evening. How is this possible?\u201d<br>\r\nWinter  tensed up slightly, not looking forward to the conversation that was about to transpire.<br>\r\n\u201c It would seem that interacting with the anomaly has caused her to under go some kind of metamorphosis. As to why this is the case your guess is as good as mine.\u201d <br>\r\nOne of the forms projected on the screen, an elderly man and an well respected atlasian scientist, expressed great interest in this revelation .<br>\r\n\u201cFascinating.\u201d The scientist said with intrigue in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe need to bring this young woman here. Weiss was it?  If we could somehow ascertain the true nature of her transformation and its relation to the tears we could usur in a new age of scientific advancement and progress!\u201d<br>\r\nWinter spoke up.<br>\r\n\u201c About that. Is it possible to refrain from experimenting on my sister at this point in and time?\u201d<br>\r\nIron wood raised his eyebrow at this.<br>\r\n\u201cWhatever for?\u201d the cybernetic man asked.<br>\r\nWinter steeled herself for what may happen next.<br>\r\n\u201c I think something may have happened to my sister that has made her squeamish about being experimented on and so I ask that that you not try to bring her in, at least until I can convince her to see the wisdom of what we're trying to do.\u201d<br>\r\nThe scientist seemed to bristle at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c I apologize Ms. Shnee but I don't see how the emotional outbursts of a teenage girl should impede from pursuing enlightenment.\u201d The elderly man said with annoyance in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter did not skip a beat. <br>\r\n\u201c With all due respect,  other than being my sister and a <b>human being</b>, she is also a very large and powerful Gigant  who is currently in a very emotional state and most likely won't come quietly. If we try to force this she will retaliate. And considering the apparently apocalyptic events that have transpired over in vale due to a handful of Gigant girls sparring, that would be a horrible idea.\u201d<br>\r\nWinter said emphasizing that last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scientist was about to retort before the general spoke up.<br>\r\n\u201c She makes a good point. Very well , we'll refrain from trying to bring her in with force but we still need to know what's going on. What do you suggest we do?\u201d Iron wood said seeing the wisdom in the military woman's words, the scientist pouted at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe smallest hint of a smile had adorned the woman's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c I propose that instead of experimenting on her directly,  we bring her and several individuals of her choice to a self contained location where they will be  instructed to perform a series of tasks that will be scanned and measured using third party systems and instruments.\u201d<br>\r\nIronwood pondered on the merits of her suggestion but was still troubled by one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can see where you're going with this, but how are we supposed to get any substantial data if we can't test her body directly?\u201d <br>\r\nWinter felt that was a fair question but fortunately she had already come up with a solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c I thought that that we could use \u2018that' project\u201d winter said cryptically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIronwood took on a more serious tone.<br>\r\n\u201cI'm not sure if that is a wise idea. Do you think It can even get us what we want?\u201d the general said warily.<br>\r\nThe military woman remained resolute in her decision.<br>\r\n\u201cIt's the only other means we have that isn't invasive.\u201d<br>\r\nThe general was still unconvinced.<br>\r\n\u201cYou are aware of the potential consequences right?\u201d the decorated man said trying to urge caution.<br>\r\nWinter paused for a moment but she had already made up her mind.<br>\r\n\u201c Yes I am sir.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments of tense silence had passed before ironwood finally spoke.<br>\r\n\u201c Very well, I will have the project greenlit.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter breathed a sigh of relief.<br>\r\n\u201cthank you sir.\u201d <br>\r\nIronwood  smiled at his subordinate.<br>\r\n\u201cYour welcome. Now let's proceed with the rest of today's agenda.\u201d<br>\r\nAs everyone prepared their materials, winter looked out at the window in her office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\u201cyou owe me one sister.\u201d</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There were apparently some Grimm sightings that needed to be dealt with, and the team, looking for both school credit and practical experience, volunteered to go deal with the situation.  Their leader, a scraggly teen with bushy brown hair, seemed annoyed at the confusion that the staff had when they volunteered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHunters and Huntresses have been dealing with Grimm for generations!  Just because some bloated freaks are walking around campus we\u2019re supposed to be in the background?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean like that blonde haired idiot we had to work with last week?\u201d his friend, a black haired man with a thick build asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe was the worst!  Thinking that we couldn\u2019t do anything without the help of him and the big redhead!

Struggling mightily to their feet, the group ran as far away from the forming chasms as they could, desperately trying to figure out what was going on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get to town!\u201d The girl said.  \u201cThe buildings there are all built for...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLOOK!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOff in the distance, one of the mountains that overlooked the forest and Beacon academy literally exploded into dust, as if someone had set up countless tons of explosives on it.  The shock of seeing an indomitable part of nature just vanish into dust terrified the the group as they desperately sought shelter from the disasters occurring in front of them.  Their legs travelled as quickly as they could as the group looked up and saw a pitch black sky, with bolts of lightning and flashes of light shining deep in the forest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Grimm territory!\u201d the brown haired man said.  \u201cBut Grimm couldn\u2019t be doing that, right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot unless Grimm suddenly got huge boobs!  Look!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brief flashes of light revealed the towering figures battling for brief moments, Gigant girls whose muscles and height tore the ground asunder and created loud booms of power and sound that knocked away trees and animals like they didn\u2019t exist.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nowhere to run, nowhere to hide from the force of nature that was these girls.  For a brief moment, the brown haired teen saw the folly of thinking he could oppose these...demigods in any way.  He should have been glad that team JNPR\u2019s Gigants were friendly, because the force here was proof that if they wanted to take over the world, no force of little people could ever hope to stop them.  Looking up, hoping it would all go away, he realized that his team would likely not survive this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cone of light and heat surged through the atmosphere into the stars as its impact headed right for the group.  Everyone screamed but it was drowned out by the force of the energy headed for them.</span></div></div>",

And an Amazon at that, if it's ridiculously massive curves were anything to go by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n her tan skin was covered in a vast assortment of intricately designed tribal marking that told many stories about the Amazon's conquest. <br>\r\nThe giantess was possessed of truly massive yet muscles that contained unfathomable power within each one of its fibers that no normal human could even dream of approaching, her massive arms appearing able to crack the very planet in half.<br>\r\nShe sported a pair of hips that stretched passed its hulking shoulders and an equally wide ass that if the being was a normal sized person would stick out behind by Five feet and stood upon a thick pair of legs that surpassed the very trees around them!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurther up past her relatively thin waist and mighty eight pack abs, the Amazon carried a pair of breasts thrice or even four times the size of her head that were held aloft by her mighty pectorals, they were so huge that none of the smaller humans were able see past them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when the Amazon bent over slightly that the group was able to make out her face.<br>\r\nThe Giant appeared to be a young woman with silver eyes and black and red hair.<br>\r\nThe group also noted that she was wearing a set of animal skin undergarments along with a grass skirt and had a bikini made from the ribs of some massive unknown creature that she had for a top as well as a plethora of ivory jewelry on different parts of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo many questions were on the group's minds such who was this girl and what tribe she hailed from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhether the Amazon's arrival was a blessing or an omen remained to be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------000--------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

she heard the fearful cries of a group of tinies followed by the angry squeals of a what sounded like a Tor'busha, a great hog of the jungle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA Tor'busha would be perfect for breakfast!\u201d Ruby thought to herself, donning a grin.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe Amazon then proceeded to shadow the beast and the unfortunate souls it sought to devour, concealing her presence using a  spirit or \u201cRoh\" art,  a form of magic that can be harnessed by any creature bearing a soul that has had its aura awakened, usually after it has acquired its semblance.<br>\r\nA good half hour had passed when the great hog finally stopped in front of a large cliff wall,  most likely having cornered it's quarry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to it however, it was the one who was cornered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby hefted a large rock/boulder and tested its weight.<br>\r\nSatisfied, she drew her arm back and took aim.<br>\r\nJust as it was about to charge, Ruby swung arm and chucked her stone at the tor'busha with  tremendous force.<br>\r\nThe missile screamed through the air at super sonic speeds before landing a clean hit on its targets head,<br>\r\nLaunching it forwards where it skidded across the ground a good distance .<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby internally cheered at her successful hit and released  her cloak to confront her downed prey.<br>\r\nThe young Amazon knew that it would've been significantly easier and more efficient to simply remain concealed but she wanted this hunt to at least be somewhat interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she approached the fallen Tor'busha she saw it begin to stir and pick itself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a tough little bastard she'd give it that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood ran down the hog's face as it stared down the interloper before it, Rage burning in its eyes.<br>\r\nRuby simply stood there with her hands on her hips and a smug smirk on her face.<br>\r\nThe scarlet Titaness then winked at the beast, inciting its fury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mighty earth shaking squeal, the beast charged the Amazon at full force, huge trees and boulders were sent flying through the air in its wake but the scarlet Amazon simply stood there undaunted.<br>\r\nThe hog collided with the Amazon with a deafening crash, a massive explosion erupted from the point of impact that threw massive clouds of dust and debris into the air and caused a substantial earthquake to shake the entire jungle to its foundations.<br>\r\nA few minutes passed when the dust finally settled enough to make out what had happened.<br>\r\nWhere once there was lush vegetation there was now a massive crater and a trench that extended fifty meters into the ground.<br>\r\nAt the  bottom of the crater, two massive forms could  be made out.<br>\r\nThe giant girl was still standing, completely unfazed by the attack while the Tor'busha lied on the ground dazed and in pain!<br>\r\nRuby let out an earth shaking chuckle.<br>\r\nShe found the Beast\u2019s assault assuming but it was time to end this hunt.<br>\r\nRuby drew her right arm back and delivered a devastating blow to the great hogs head.<br>\r\nA massive pillar of dust and debris shot up high into the sky as a massive explosion far larger than the one the hog had produced rang out through the jungle for miles, creating a massive spider web of fissures spread throughout the surrounding landscape and producing powerful gale force winds that blew away everything from the point of impact.<br>\r\nWhen the dust eventually settled, the Amazon could be seen at the bottom of an even larger two hundred meter deep crater standing triumphantly over the Tor'busha,whose skull had clearly been caved in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter draping her prize over her shoulder, the Amazon leapt out of the crater two hundred meters into the air  and landing  directly in front  of the cliff wall where the group of normal sized people had retreated to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby looked  down at the group from her towering vantage point.<br>\r\nThose of the group who weren't knocked unconscious form the explosions  and gale force winds were either dazed or staring up at her with fear and uncertainty in their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby felt pity for the small people, the world  could be a truly harsh and unforgiving place for ones such as them.<br>\r\nThe world of remnant was a primeval and savage realm where only the hardiest and most determined of beings even stood a chance at seeing another day.<br>\r\nWhere titanic beasts, eldritch abominations, half mad necromantic sorcerer's, feral deities, and forces even greater still roamed the land wild and untamed.<br>\r\nWhere the only true laws that governed this land were the laws of steel, club, and fang and survival of the fittest.<br>\r\nAmong the titans that ruled this world were the Giant tribes, a race of Amazonian and Gargarean warriors possessed of truly monolithic stature and unthinkably potent physical and spiritual power that waged unending wars of dominance and glory against each other and anything that they deemed a threat or a worthy challenge or conquest.<br>\r\nThe Giant tribes spent most of their lives either fighting, hunting, playing, or pursuing any path they chose.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the normal sized Humans which the Giants had dubbed \u201cNogo\u201d were forced to eek out a meager existence near the bottom of the food chain, constantly having to fend off predators and invaders while hiding their settlements from Giant beasts and Giant tribesmen that might either eat or capture them for various purposes respectively.<br>\r\nAs Ruby looked down at the Nogo cowering at her feet, she pondered on what to do next\u2026. </span></div></div>",

The only options we have now are to either be slaves or some beasts chew toys or even both!\u201d<br>\r\nTempkii returned to curling up into a ball of despair.<br>\r\n\u201c We have no home to return to and no recourse from what ever this Amazon has planned for us. There is nothing left for us.\u201d<br>\r\nKulita could not believe what she was hearing!<br>\r\n\u201c So what? Your just gonna give up!? We have try SOMETHING! I refuse to be some giant's plaything!\u201d<br>\r\nTempkii said nothing.<br>\r\nKulita threw her hands up in anger and frustration.<br>\r\n\u201cFINE! Wallow in self pity if you want but I\u2019m not giving up!\u201d Kulita shouted before going back to searching for a way off the scarlet Titaness's massive Cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree hours have passed since Ruby began her trip home.<br>\r\nMany of the Nogo had worried themselves to sleep, save for a few.<br>\r\nKulita had exhausted herself trying to escape and was beginning to dose off when Their Amazon captive  suddenly stopped, throwing her forward.<br>\r\nThe Nogo woman was about to tell the giant off until  she saw that they had reached their destination.<br>\r\nRuby beamed happily at the sight.<br>\r\n\u201cHere we are. Home sweet home!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore them was a structure of dizzy proportions set in the middle of a vast man made clearing in the middle of the endless jungle.<br>\r\nA great wall made out of massive stone, entire trees, and intricately designed decorative bones and animal hides that stretched up into the sky and formed an enclosure many miles in diameter. From the perspective of the Nogo it appeared to be akin to a man made  mountain.<br>\r\nDrapped on its surface were massive tarps  that bore what could only be the tribes embroidery, a stylized serpentine winged dragon whose body is wrapped around a rose.<br>\r\nRuby made her way to the immense protective wall that surrounded what the Nogo suspected was the Amazon's village, and came upon a massive and very intimidating looking entrance that towered over the scarlet giant.<br>\r\n Two wooden gates with an archway covered in wooden stakes and a plethora of bones and skulls, both animal and humanoid alike, were built all over their surfaces. <br>\r\nIt was a rather gruesome sight and did nothing to engender confidence in the Amazon's Nogo passengers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn either side of the entrance were two giant scaled watch towers made out of carved stone and wood that were covered with vines and leaves for climbing.<br>\r\nStanding at the top of said watch towers were two Gargareans that stood as sentinels keeping watch, their eyes constantly scanning the area for any would be Invader and/or Great beast that ventured too close.<br>\r\nRuby waved at the guards as she  made her way to the gates with a big smile on her face.<br>\r\nOne of the guards perked up when he saw her approach and waved back at her.<br>\r\n\u201cHey Ruby! I see your hunt has born fruit. Tell me, did the beasts give you any trouble?\u201d the guard asked, eager to hear any stories of triumph the scarlet Amazon may possess.<br>\r\nRuby slammed her fist upon her chest.<br>\r\n\u201cIt didn't even scratch me!\u201d Ruby shouted with pride in her voice.<br>\r\nThe guard simply chuckled at her response.<br>\r\n\u201c Oh I bet.\u201d <br>\r\nThe guard move forward from where he stood in order to get a better look at the Amazon.<br>\r\n\u201cYep!\u201d Ruby Beamed up at the guard.<br>\r\nThe Amazon went to enter the village before stopping , having recalled her other prize.<br>\r\n\u201cOh! I almost forgot! I also found a group of Nogo on my hunt as well. They were running away from the Tor'busha I slayed. It must have destroyed their village so I thought that maybe we could bring them into the fold.  Ruby said pointing towards her cleavage.<br>\r\nThe guard looked at were Ruby  was pointing with his super human senses and, sure enough, he spotted a group of \u201ctinies\u201d nestled snugly in her vast cleavage.<br>\r\n\u201cWell that's a surprise! But not an unwelcomed one. Though I don't have any problems with them joining us, do remember that it's your father that has the final say on such matters\u201d<br>\r\nRuby nodded her head.<br>\r\n\u201cDon't worry I will!\u201d Ruby promised.<br>\r\nThe guard signaled to the others to open the gate.<br>\r\nTwo Gargareans pulled on a set of ropes with their Herculean strength and dragged the great entrance open.<br>\r\nA loud rumbling sound was emitted by the gates as many tons of stone and soil were pushed aside.<br>\r\nAs Ruby made her way through the gate , she turned towards the guards one more time.<br>\r\n\"See you guys at breakfast!<br>\r\nThe guards waved at her one more time before closing the gates.<br>\r\nRuby stared ahead at the village and wondered what to do first\u2026\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

In her mind's eye she saw herself as a towering behemoth lording over everything she surveyed and making everyone worship every inch of her perfectly sculpted body. She could already feel the changes starting to take affect as a pleasant warmth spread throughout her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she last altered her size she had grown from a petite five feet and three inches to a little over a whopping ten feet tall. Now though? She wasn't satisfied with that. Driven by a new found hunger for power she made herself grow even  bigger until she  doubled ,no, TRIPLED in height  becoming over an incredible thirty feet in Height!<br>\r\nNext she made her already huge muscles Breathtakingly  massive.<br>\r\nHer arms became thicker than a full grown man's entire body and then some. Her legs were like massive shapely  tree trunks that looked as though they could  crush a small group of Beowolfs between with a single twitch. Her back muscles were like a tapestry of impenetrable stone carvings that contained untold strength.  Her abs grew into an impressive cobblestone like  eight pack framed by equally impressive obliques. Her wingspan stretched wider than most people were tall, ending at boulder esque shoulders that looked (and probably could) like they can truly carry the world upon them. <br>\r\nFinally she enhanced her curves to ridiculous levels <br>\r\nBallooned to the size of bean bag chairs made firm and prevented from sagging by the twin stone slabs of muscle that were her pectorals.<br>\r\nHer hips widened to the point that they stretched out further then her shoulders by a good three feet eventually becoming what could only be described as \u201cbrood bearing\u201d hips.<br>\r\nLast but not least, her buttocks inflated to a size and with that complemented her hips , sticking out a good four feet behind her whilst being both soft  and firm from the thick layers of fat and muscle underneath.<br>\r\nDuring the entire process Ruby's entire body coursed with unbelievable pleasure, causing  her explosive orgasms the entire time! When her growth finally finished Ruby couldn't help but smirk. She was quite pleased with herself and especially her body. She likened her new form to some hybrid between depictions of a god of strength and a fertility goddess. She laughed a booming laugh, her voice carrying a rich and deep timbre  while still sounding feminine. This was amazing! Why she ever shied away from using her power was beyond her. <br>\r\nNow that she has embraced her full potential nothing will stop her from  reaching her goals!<br>\r\nIt was at this moment Ruby felt a draft. Turns out her clothes all but disintegrated into scrapes during her growth and now  she is completely in the nude(oops)<br>\r\nRuby  briefly considered just carrying on like this, after all who was going to stop her?  In the end however  she decided against it , there would be plenty of time for that later. Using her semblance she conjured up  a perfectly fitting tank top  and a pair of booty shorts, though given her sheer size they left little to the imagination. <br>\r\nRuby decided to  see what her teammates were up to, It would be fun to play with them for awhile.<br>\r\nWith a spring in her step she stomped her way back to the campus, causing small earthquakes along the way <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ruby thundered onto the campus  grounds, her foot falls leaving visible cracks in the ground. <br>\r\nShe noticed that even though there were many people who were staring at her most still went about their business as though a thirty foot tall  hulked out teen with hyper curves walking around was an everyday occurrence. She was almost insulted until she remembered she made it so that everyone's memories would be changed to her having always been this big. She considered rescinding that change  but decided not to, it might be fun to see how differently people interact with her this way , especially when you factor in how some people treated her before. <br>\r\nRuby scanned  the area looking for any sign of her teammates but could not find them. Using her semblance she was able to pinpoint her teammates exact location. It looks like they were getting some training done in the emerald forest. With almost childish glee  she took off in the direction of the forest , her curves jiggling and swaying dramatically with each step. <br>\r\nMeanwhile  the rest of team RWBY were finishing up with their training exercises. They were testing out some new moves they were experimenting with  on some of the local grimm population and were very satisfied with the results. Yang was especially proud of herself for she had acquired a new level of control over her semblance that allowed her to hit harder and faster for  longer.  Weiss was cleaning off her rapier of any leftover viscera when she addressed her teammates. \u201c shouldn't we have brought Ruby along for this?\u201d Weiss asked as she wiped off an especially stubborn piece of dirt. What  was the point of having team exercises if their leader wasn't present?<br>\r\nThe blond brawler was working out a knot in her shoulders. \u201c She said she had something to do in her room for a while\u201d said Yang. Her  shoulders gave off a satisfying crack as she rolled them. <br>\r\nBlake was  pulling out any stray twigs and leaves out of her hair when she spoke up. \u201c when I last saw her she seemed kinda down in the dumps.\u201d Blake regarded the normally peppy girl. Ruby appeared to have a miasma of melancholy around her when she saw her earlier.<br>\r\nYang had transitioned to doing leg stretches when she answered the cat faunus. \u201c Relax. We know she'd come to us if she had any problems.\u201d The blonde brawler started to do some squats. \u201c Ruby's a big girl. She can take care of herself.\u201d  Yang finished as she got a good rhythm going.<br>\r\n\u201c In more ways than one.\u201d Weiss muttered under her breath. When the Heiress first met their hyper active  team leader  she, like everyone else that day, was completely shocked to see her. The crimson haired teen towered over everyone, even the very trees themselves! She was huge in every sense of the word. Her Titanic muscles and monstrous curves demanded attention. It was almost impossible for her not to be a spectacle. She was so big that the school had to make an entire new building just her!<br>\r\nKnowing that she would be spending her entire school career with such a colossus gave her many weird and confusing feelings. <br>\r\nSuddenly, loud rumbling sound akin to a landslide could heard from a distance , going off at regular intervals and growing louder as time went on.  <br>\r\n\u201cSpeak of the devil.\u201d Weiss thought to herself. She'd  recognize that sound  anywhere. <br>\r\nThe rumbling grew louder  as the giant got closer, they could see the trees rustling and birds flying off in a panic. Eventually  the form of a truly massive girl came into view. She seemed to scan the area for a bit before spotting the group of huntresses and rushing towards them.  Small tremors  could be felt in the ground as minor earthquakes were generated from each step the giant girl took. Weiss and co almost lost their footing, cursing the girl for not measuring her steps more carefully. Eventually the giantess came to a stop in front of the  group. They really had to crane their necks up to see her and even then their sight was obstructed by the immense shelf of her breasts. The mighty teen bent downwards  into her to see her teammates past ginormous bosom , creating another small earthquake as she did.  <br>\r\nRuby had a truly large smile on her face, clearly happy to see her friends, perhaps even a little to happy Weiss thought suspiciously. <br>\r\n\u201c Hey guys! Whatcha been up to?\u201d Ruby boomed her greeting.  She was so excited to see them, especially with what she had in mind.<br>\r\n Yang beamed up her \u201c little  sister\u201c. \u201c We were just getting finished with our training and were getting ready to head back.\u201d  Yang readjusted her gauntlets.\u201d What about you? You seem to be in a better mood than you were in earlier.\u201d Yang said working with the harnesses of her beloved  ember Cecilia.<br>\r\nRuby gave her a knowing smile.  \u201c lets just say I've gained a new\u2026.. perspective.\u201d Ruby  straightened herself up slightly as enthesis.<br>\r\nYang just shrugged. \u201c Hey so long as okay I don't care.  Yang finished putting all of her equipment away  before looking up at her sister.  \u201cSo what do you want to do Rubes?\u201d Yang asked her siste.<br>\r\n\u201c I was thinking we could hang out today.\u201d Answered  Ruby.  She had all kinds of plans for the day, many of which involved a copious exercise of her power.<br>\r\n\u201c sounds good to me. Let\u2019s get going guys.\u201d  As all of  team RWBY  made to leave  Ruby  at that moment  decided to\u2026..<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

More than anything however she felt as though a great weight had been lifted from her heart. For the longest time she had lived in fear of her semblance and the practically infinite responsibility that came with it. Now though ? She found that she no longer cared.<br>\r\nThe feeling of using her power to enhance her self was simply too good to deny. Through this act she had gained a deeper understanding of the extent of her abilities had thusly decided she was above all consequences. Ruby smiled as she shook head, she was embarrassed  that she worried so much  for so many years. At that moment the young huntress paused mid step, her highly trained and supernaturally enhanced senses detecting movement from the surrounding brush. A quick peek with her powers revealed that a hoard of  grimm had surrounded her. Ruby smirked, this was a convenient excuse to test her new strength, not that she needed one.  The Beasts of darkness emerged from the foliage, ready to tear into their next victim. Unbeknownst to the monsters however, it was they who were the prey.  The grimm had circled around her in great numbers, most likely drawn here by the sound of her foot steps. For anyone else this would be a horrifying  situation to find one's self in but for Ruby this was going to be good target practice.<br>\r\nThe malevolent hoard continued  to circle around their quarry for another couple of minutes until a lone beowolf broke off from the group and when to strike at the giantess's shins only for their claws to deflect harmlessly of her unbreakable skin.<br>\r\nRuby giggled at the sight, these black monsters that have struck fear in the hearts of men for as long as anyone could remember were nothing more than harmless puppies before her boundless  might. <br>\r\nShe took a moment to flex one of her mighty arms as to taunt the beasts.<br>\r\nWhether the demons understood the nature of the act or not was completely irrelevant. The Grimm hoard entered a  frenzy and began attacking in Earnest. <br>\r\nNashing teeth and slashing struck unceasingly against the opponent's flesh to no avail, the giantess simply stood there in place staring down at their futile attempts at harming her, it was kind of cute actually. <br>\r\nShe received a sudden jolt from her rear end at that moment which startled her. <br>\r\nThe Titaness looked down over her immense shoulders down at her back to see what the big idea was.<br>\r\nOne of the Beowolves was perched upon the right cheek of her godlike derriere biting and clawing at its thick succulent flesh, tearing out pieces  of her ill fitting booty shorts in the process. <br>\r\nThe scarlet giant found the adorable and, if she was being honest with herself, kind of kinky.<br>\r\nIt then that a wicked idea came  to the behemoth.  She fell down upon her monumental behind all at once, which caused a small tremor to ripple out through the forest and knocked all the Grimm at her feet prone.<br>\r\nThen the colossus spread her legs as wide as she could and rested her weight on her hands behind her and puffed out her chest to accentuate her mountainous rack.<br>\r\nWhen the beasts regained their footing, they turned their baleful gaze back towards their prey, who was now sitting before them in a \u201cvulnerable\u201d and what they could not have possibly been able to interpret as a very provocative position.  The Gigantic girl then gave the hoard a playful wink which incited them into another frenzy that led them to charge at her head on.<br>\r\nThey swarmed all over her body attacking anything that they could get their  claws and fangs on.<br>\r\n A dozen of the \u201clittle\u201d monsters had climbed atop the giantess's great breasts and started scratching and biting at the cloth of her oversized  tank top and the soft yet  impenetrable skin beneath,  two of them even going so far as to chomp down on her areola and engorged nipples.<br>\r\nBelow the profound shelf of her rack, a second pack was viciously yet impotently slashing their razor sharp claws against her indestructible abs with many of them shattering upon contact.<br>\r\nFurther down,  even more of the destructive creatures were crawling on top of the mighty and shapely pillars of power that were her legs, a number of went to town on her thick muscular thighs, chewing on the taunt skin and muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd behind her,  many more Grimm had accompanied the first one in Ravaging her behemoth rump, crawling on top of it and wriggling and squirming in between her crack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe unending bombardment of sensations drew a series of moans and coos from the giantess's mouth.<br>\r\nSo many smaller creatures pleasuring her at once has been one of the hottest experiences she's ever been in, made even more so by the knowledge that said creatures are actively trying to kill her but are simply unable to do anything but get her off because of her sheer power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she allowed herself to a wash in the pleasure, the movement of a large creature caught her eye.<br>\r\nA huge(relatively speaking) Ursa swaggered in with a menacing gait and faced down the hulking girl in front of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments of the two simply staring each other in the eyes, one full of dark hatred while the other was filled with unabated lust,  the Grizzly shaped devil charged  forwards at break neck speeds with the intent to pouch on and rip apart it prey and slamming head first into her drenched crotch and began biting and clawing at the sensitive flesh savagely.<br>\r\nRuby\u2019s moans grew into a deafening cacophony of  earth quaking cries that shook the entire forest, the raw stimulation was becoming too much to bear.<br>\r\nThe great beast bit into the massive bulbous mound in great mouthfuls and tore of the cloth of her pants undergarments, revealing  the colossus\u2019s fat naked pussy in all of its glory.<br>\r\nThe sensations were getting maddening, the towering juggernaut of a girl was yelling constantly at this point, her body physically began to vibrate from the pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was almost  there. <br>\r\nThe  beast continued it's relentless  onslaught of the aspiring huntress\u2019s nether regions with a hellish fury backing its  blows.<br>\r\nIt was then that it noticed the glistening pink pearl hidden within the folds of her labia at the top of  her snatch.<br>\r\nWith both claws it grappled onto the bulb of supremely sensitive flesh, brought it to its gaping maw, and clamped down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when the dam broke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giant girl screamed so loud it could have shattered glass. Her eyes rolled into the back of her head as she climaxed with enough force that the jet like stream that was released was enough to rip whole trees from their foundations, carve out a huge trench in the forest, and even punch a massive hole in the side of a mountain.<br>\r\nThe  offending  Ursa was understandably annihilated in the process, it entire being was reduced to atoms that very instant.<br>\r\nRuby fell on her back panting heavily from the experience.<br>\r\nAfter basking in the after glow for a bit, the giant young woman pondered on what to do next\u2026.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

These thoughts scared her. The knowledge that she could  destroy EVERYTHING if she's not  careful, scared her deeply.

With a bashful look on her face, Ruby ask, \u201cUm, is anyone hungry?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the week went by, Ruby was still taking the pills and by the end, she gain three more inches in height, make her as tall as Blake, at 5\u20196\u201d. That wasn\u2019t the only growth either, her breast expanded a cup size, C cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout the week, Ruby was still itching in her nether region and she was also getting bother with this new feeling. Until at the end of the week, Blake ask when the rest of the team was out, \u201cHey Ruby, are you kind of getting hot and bother lately?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was taking a back from this and trying to find the right words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt ok,\u201d Blake exclaims, \u201cIt hard to hide it from me because I am a cat faunus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby nodded shyly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHave you,\u201d Blake started to say while blushing a bit, \u201cyou know, played with yourself?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRudy gave a questionable look to Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod,\u201d Blake said as she slap her forehead, \u201cI will show you and helped you this one time after we get back from Pencer\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat place?,\u201d Ruby said with a little bit of disgusting look, \u201cIt looks so weird and that why I stay away for it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt does looks weird at first,\u201d Blake explained, \u201cbut, you will learn soon why we need to go.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a somewhat quick trip, Black had to pull Ruby in the store and then Ruby was a curious kid in a toy store from there. While Ruby was looking around the shop, Blake got what they came there for and got Ruby out of there before she started to make a scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily no one back at the room yet, as Blake and Ruby went into the room. \u201cRemember Ruby,\u201d Blake said again, \u201cwhat I am about to show you, you should not tell anyone when you learn it from. Not even your sister.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, she my sister,\u201d Ruby try to argue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo buts,\u201d Blake say as Ruby let out a small giggle as she agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst she show Ruby why they went to Pencer\u2019s for. It was a 6 inch, scarlet dildo that\u2019s vibrate. Ruby got stars in her eyes and was all, \u201coooo and ahhh\u201c. Then Blake pull out her scroll and got a video of a woman that was pleasuring herself. This made Ruby\u2019s face turn bright red as Blake blush a bit also.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the video, Ruby kind of put two to two together on why Blake got the thing from Pencer\u2019s. Blake put her scroll away and ask Ruby to take off her clothes as she put a color sticker on the outside of the door. Ruby saw this and ask why and Blake responded that that is her\u2019s and Weiss and Yang code that they need some \u201calone\u201d time. As Blake turn around, she started to take off her clothes and saw that even though Ruby have no sign of pleasuring herself, she seem to trim her public hair into a small black with a bit of red triangle. Then Blake ask, \u201cseem like someone taught you a thing or two?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a questionable look, then Ruby realize, \u201cOhhh, Yang told me that it good to be clean cut down there,\u201d then she gave Blake a shhh, \u201cYang do a up and down rectangle.\u201d This made Blake blush more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Blake was done undressing, she told Ruby to keep what they were doing a secret and this is the only time she will show her. With a nod, Ruby agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake began to crested Ruby\u2019s face as she slowly turn around Ruby\u2019s back as her hand moved down to her breast and started to play with them. This made Ruby to moan slightly. As Blake was feeling Ruby\u2019s breast up with one hand, with the other, it travel down along Ruby\u2019s stomach to her clit. With the slight-ishtouch, Ruby moan louder. Once Blake thought that Ruby was almost ready for stage two, she removed her hand from Ruby\u2019s clit and wrap her tail around her so, the top could play with the clit. With the soft sensitivity of Blake\u2019s tail on her clit, Ruby moaned even louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time that Ruby was on edge, Blake stop and told Ruby to lay on her bed. She did as Blake follow her with the dildo. Blake gave it a slight kick along the shaft as she rubbed it around Ruby\u2019s body with the vibrator on making sure she was away from her nether region. As Ruby begin to moan slightly again, Blake turn off the vibrator and starts to rub it on her clit and pussy. This made Ruby moan more as she was feel sensation. By the time Blake saw that Ruby was getting moist, she turn the vibrator back on and tease Ruby some more as she moan louder and louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ruby was dripping wet, Black turn the vibrator off again, and told Ruby that the next part might hit a bit. She nodded as she was out of breathe. Blake plunge the dildo in Ruby as gently as she could and let her adjust to it before moving it in and out. When Blake did, Ruby let out an uncontrollable moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for a while until Blake decide to not warned Ruby that she was turning on the vibrator. In ecstasy, Ruby gave out the louder moan in her life as she squirted onto Blake\u2019s face as she pull out the dildo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some minutes, Ruby regain her breathe and said, \u201cThat was amazing,\u201d as she huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow,\u201d Blake started to say, \u201cyou can do it by yourself.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSad by this, Ruby nodded as her stomach started to growl. She asked Blake if she wants to join her and Blake said she will catch up in a minute because she need some \u201calone\u201d time as Ruby left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Blake join her, Ruby was started on her fifth meal tray.</span></div></div>",

Yang did not really notice, because Ruby were in a sitting position or Yang was doing her thing for the day, until it was mid-week as she saw Ruby was two inches taller than her. When she notice Ruby\u2019s height, Yang also notice that her sister\u2019s breasts were the same size as her\u2019s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby\u2019s breasts and height wasn\u2019t the only things that were growing. Throughout the week, Blake has notice that the once shorter girl was now sport an ass that was bigger, fuller, and firmer than he\u2019s would ever be. It wasn\u2019t just Ruby\u2019s ass the was growing but, also her sex drive, too. After the first two thing of Blake accidentally walking in on Ruby pleasuring herself, Blake saw that Ruby was doing it more frequently per a day as the week went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the last day of the week, Ruby was taking an unusual amount time in the team\u2019s shares bathroom in the morning. Weiss politely knock on the door a couple times until everyone else in the room were waking up. Weiss pound on the door louder and Ruby responded with, \u201cJust a minute!\u201d Weiss respond not as lady-like as one would hope, \u201cCome on, you dolt, you been in there for thirty minutes already! And I am about to piss myself if you don\u2019t come out!,\u201d as she started to whined now with her legs cross.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang moved Weiss to the side because she could tell that Weiss would actually pee herself at any moment. \u201cOk, Rubes!,\u201d Yang yelled through the door, \u201cIf you don\u2019t come out here in three seconds, I will break the door down!\u201d After a few seconds without a responds, Yang yelled, \u201cTHREE, TWO, ONE,\u201d within a half a second of saying \u201cone\u201d, Yang drive her fist into the door and broke it down in one hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time as Yang breaking the door down, Ruby reach climax and squirted all over the bathroom.  When the door was out of the way, the rest of the team came in and saw Ruby, at her 6\u20192\u201d height, slumped on the toilet with a thin lay of sweat covering her well defined, muscle body with G cups breasts and bubble butt. But, what they notice was that Ruby\u2019s nipples was as big as thumbs and her clit was 7 inches long and was thick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Yang and Blake moved Ruby\u2019s massive body onto her bed so, Weiss could use the bathroom. The three had a small meeting about Ruby\u2019s sex drive.</span></div></div>",

She told Yang and Weiss that Faunus has a little thing that not normal humans know about. That every month Faunus would go into heat and those who haven\u2019t by the last week in the month can go to a special island off the coast of Menagerie so, they can masturbate or do the deed. She just has to ask her parents, more likely her mom, to get the go ahead for Ruby.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith not much options to go around, this was the best bet as Blake called her mom on her scroll. After some time, Blake got back to Yang and Weiss and told them the news. \u201cWell,\u201d Blake say shyly, \u201cit seem like that there are a lot more Faunus this month that need to go to the island than usual. But, my mom did say she will help us and let us send Ruby to own summer house that is way closer to Beacon with 30 Faunus and hopefully this will help. And all she wants in return, is for me to deliver Ruby there so, I can visit her and she will pay for own transport that would leave Beacon in four hours.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot want to anytime, they got Ruby clean and dress and as well pack a nine day worth of clothes and somehow the enhancement pill also. As they carried Ruby\u2019s now massive frame to the transport area, she was waking up again and asked what was going on but Blake just say she will tell her when they are on the transport ship. Blake and Ruby say their goodbyes to Yang and Weiss as the ship was about to take off. On the way to the Blake\u2019s family\u2019s summer home, Blake told Ruby what was going on and hand her her bag. When Ruby open it, she saw the pills on top and quickly close it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they got to the summer home, Ruby got shown where her room will be well Blake and her mom caught up a bit before Blake went back to Beacon. Before Blake left, she told Ruby that they will come get her in nine days.</span></div></div>",

She grew to a height of 8 feet tall, her breasts swell to R cups, and her ass got so big that it would rub on a normal door frame if she went through one and it stick out a good foot and a half. And with all the soft growth, her muscle surge forward and Ruby got ripped with bulging muscles. The most amazing growth was her clit had turned into an actual penis as it grew to two feet in length and four inches around and as the \u201ctrip\u201d was coming to an end, somehow, one rest, she grew a set of testicles that were as big as grapefruits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby got more forceful with the Faunus as the days went by. By the time it was almost over, Ruby would take any Faunus or more to help her pleasure herself and if they don\u2019t want to, she would force them and only pleasure the ones that go with her willingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of it, all the Faunus were sent back first as Ruby had to Stay behind for one more night with Blake\u2019s mom, Kali, as the only one left at the summer home.</span></div></div>",

With a shy, she said out loud, \u201cThat was an exciting nine day. Kind of remind me of my youth,\u201d as she smile at the memories of when she was young. As Kali was reminiscing, she got cover by a giant shadow from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think you are plenty youthful,\u201d Ruby said with a deviant grin on her face. Kali turned around and blush at the comment from the towering, muscular, sexy young girl, as Ruby added, \u201cand sexy, too,\u201d as she lick her lips and pick up the older faunus with ease to face level and plunge her longer and wide tongue into her teammate\u2019s mother\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTry as she might, Kali knew from experience that if she struggle too much, she could not fight the long game. As Ruby use her tongue to simulate Mrs. Belladonna\u2019s mouth, she squeeze Kali in between her breast with one hand as she moved her other hand down Kali\u2019s back and around her shapely ass and tail. Once at Kali\u2019s ass, Ruby began to message the older woman buttocks with her massive, strong finger until she moved her hand to the front and plunge her middle finger into the much shorter woman pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKali try to moan but, it got muffled by Ruby\u2019s tongue and mouth as the vibration sent shivers down her spine. As Ruby got what she wanted, the old woman let out a shy, \u201cOh my. It been a well since someone did this to me and your fingers feel wonderful.\u201d \u201cYou mean finger,\u201d Ruby remarked as she loosing her grip from Kali\u2019s back as she slide down more, \u201cand it was just the tip,\u201d hearing this made Kali moan louder. This in turn made Ruby\u2019s cock come alive as Kali could feel it swelling against her leg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut, before we get to know each other better,\u201d Ruby started to say before turnaround and head back to the house, \u201chow about you make a feast for me,\u201d as she started to lick her lips, \u201cand probably get someone here so, I could get some new clothes before I leave tomorrow,\u201d Ruby said as she was walking back with Kali still on her massive finger as she feel each bump as she slide up and down. Well moan, Kali ask, \u201cWhy would you want clothes? Your body is like perfect.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to intimidate my teammates too much. And don\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t cover too much.\u201d After hearing this, Kali moan more, not just having Ruby\u2019s finger in her but, the thought what is yet to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a quick call to get the five best seamstresses in Menagerie to come to the summer home in the next four hours with plenty of red and black fabrics and leathers, Ruby slowly pull her middle finger out of Kali and her down so, she could put on an apron the Ruby order her to. Ruby enjoy the view as she watch Kali cooking as the she would also bend forward so, Ruby would had a excellent view. By the time two hours had pass, Kali was finish with the feast that was mostly seafood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnjoying feast, Ruby satisfy one form of hungry that she had and now to satisfy another. Kali told the giant girl that the seamstresses would be there within a hour as Ruby then subject a bath as she scooped the cat faunus up and carry her over her shoulder. Kali squealed when Ruby did this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in the bathroom, Ruby put Kali down as she started to draw a bath for them. While waiting for it to fill, Kali motion for Ruby to sit on a stool so, she could wash the girl massive body. Kali rinse the girl body so, it was ready to be clean. As she squirt some body wash on Ruby\u2019s back, Kali place her breasts on Ruby and rubbed the young huntress muscular back. This was exciting Ruby, as her member starting to grow again as the veins were becoming visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the cat woman was done washing Ruby\u2019s back, her cock was pulsing with life. This startled Kali because this was her first time to see a penis this huge and magnificent, not even her husband or any male can stand a chance next to this young huntress\u2019 body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bit of hesitations and some cross-eye happening, Kali started to wash Ruby\u2019s powerful legs then her bountiful breasts. Giving the size, Kali took extra care of Ruby\u2019s tits and some attention to her udder like nipples. Every times Kali would scrub Ruby\u2019s nipple, the giant girl would starts to moan. As Kali moved her hands lower to wash Ruby\u2019s cobbler stone abs, Ruby had enough and gripped the cat woman\u2019s head with a hand and the other one on her massive, veining cock and guide the head into Kali\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took no strength from Ruby to force the older cat lady\u2019s mouth to the tip of the head of her cock. The only problem was Kali refuse to open her mouth for the moment that Ruby got her head to the massive cock head. Then Ruby gave Kali an ultimatum, either she open her mouth and suck or Ruby could do it forcefully. Taking the better deal, Kali open her mouth and started to suck on the massive cock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKali bobbed her head as best as she can but, the head of the cock was just too great for Kali to take just that. Wanting more, Ruby did not give any warning and wedging more of her cock into the tiny mouth of the cat lady. Kali try to gag but, Ruby forcefully wedge her cock so much the cat lady could not breathe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few second, which felt like an eternity for Kali, Ruby loosen her grip and let the cat woman breathe. As Kali was choking, Ruby said irately, \u201cSee, I knew you could put more than the head in there if just barely.\u201d When Ruby taught Kali had enough time to catch her breath, Ruby guide her head back to her cock and the cat lady begin to suck without any help. Bobbing her head fast this time, Kali try and make this massive huntress help as she manage to pass the mark when Ruby use force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHappy by this, Ruby lifted the Kali in a circular motion so, the cat woman\u2019s pussy would be by Ruby\u2019s mouth. Before Kali knew what had happen, Ruby snaked her tongue into the pussy. Kali was moaning heavenly from this as Ruby use her talented tongue deep inside; reaching all the way to her womb. Upon realizing this, Kali\u2019s eye shot wide open as she moan, \u201cOh my god! Are you really able to my womb!,\u201d as she screamed. Hearing this Ruby gave her answer, this made Kali moan and scream loudly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ruby was done with her fun and Kali creamed in Ruby\u2019s mouth, she clean off the exhausted cat lady and rinse herself off also and spend their remaining time in the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they got done, the seamstresses were just walking up to the house. As Kali greet them, she lead the seamstresses to the task at hand. They gasp at the view of Ruby and the glory of her naked body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all the measurements were done, Ruby ask if they could make her outfit for some room to grow just in case. The seamstresses accepted this and ask Ruby in what type of clothing she wanted. When they got the details, the seamstresses started the task of, at least one, getting Ruby the desire outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKali took the lead of walking her and Ruby to the master chamber. On the way there, Kali use her tail to simulate Ruby\u2019s cock. When they reach the master chamber, Ruby lifted and threw Kali on the bed as she was ready to go. Before Kali was ready, Ruby got her on her back and \u201cplunge\u201d her massive cock in the \u201ctiny\u201d pussycat. Kali gave a high pitch scream the turn to a loud moan after a \u201cfew\u201d minutes. Ruby kept on stabbing with her meat sword into Kali; making her stomach bulged in the result. After Kali cum multiple time and Ruby cum two monstrous load, the giant girl let the cat milf rest a bit as she suckle on Ruby\u2019s breast. In moments, Ruby could feel something releasing from her breast as she looked down and saw some milk was leaking from Kali\u2019s mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the night went on, Ruby and Kali went for a couple more rounds with Kali drinking Ruby\u2019s breast milk after each and Ruby try some after their last one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the next day come, the transport ship got there by mid-afternoon. When Yang, Weiss, and Blake was walking to the house, Weiss ask, \u201cHow big do you think she got?\u201d Yang reply, \u201cProbably not much bigger.\u201d As they were reaching the front, Blake let out, \u201cOh my god.\u201d</span></div></div>",

They saw a figure outside of the Belladonna\u2019s summer home as they were coming close. Blake was the first one to see the figure and recognize who is was as she say, \u201cOh my god,\u201d as she pause for a moment to register what she was seeing, \u201cMom!?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake did not see how her mom was nine days ago as the group came closer to the house but, a voluptuous figure that couldn\u2019t be her mother but, it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the rest of team RWBY got to speaking distances from Mrs. Belladonna, Blake saw her mother wasn\u2019t the same height like always but, a good half a foot taller. That and Kali was wearing a very revealing black and gold bikini with a matching sarong around her much wider hips. As they were closing in to the seductive cat MILF, Yang said to Blake, \u201cWow, your mom is hot,\u201d this made Blake blush because this wasn\u2019t how her mom actually look like. Blake was thinking what had happened in the past nine days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKali let out, \u201cBlakey,\u201d as she go to her now shorter daughter with her arm wide open for a hug. This surprise Blake and made her froze in her spot as her mom wrap her arms around her daughter and push Blake\u2019s head into her luscious breasts. Coming to her senses, Blake struggle free but, not before she got a whiff of something that smell like milk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGee, Blake,\u201d Yang said, \u201cyour mom just wanted a hug.\u201d\u201cWell,\u201d Blake answer, \u201cmom what happen to you?\u201d \u201cNothing dear,\u201d Kali answer, \u201cRuby and I just chat last night,\u201d as the older cat faunus giggle at the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of nowhere, Weiss pipe up, \u201cFor a faunus, you actually have a very nice summer home.\u201d \u201cThanks Miss Schnee,\u201d Kali answer, \u201cwhere we from, my husband is the chief.\u201d \u201cSooooo,\u201d Yang chimes in, \u201cBlake is more of a princess than our own \u201cice\u201d princess here?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Kali giggle maturely, \u201cI guess you would be correct. If we will, come inside and I will get some drinks,\u201d she said as the group follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yang, Weiss, and Blake sat at the modest dining room table, Kali brought in four glasses of milk, \u201cSorry,\u201d the cat faunus said, \u201cthis is all I could offer or it will turn burn sooner or later,\u201d as she place the glasses on the table. Kali told them that Ruby should be changing at the moment because she was just getting out of the bath when they came. Accepting this as something normal that Ruby would do, they starts to drink their glasses of milk. \u201cWow,\u201d Weiss said, \u201cthis is by far the best milk that I ever had.\u201d \u201cThat is nice to know,\u201d Kali grinned, \u201cthe shipment for the event had been excellent so far.\u201d Blake and Yang agree with Weiss as Mrs. Belladonna pour some more for Weiss and her daughter as Yang ask for a glass of water because she wasn\u2019t really a huge milk fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of chatting, Kali told the group of girls that Ruby should be ready but, she wanted to talk will Yang some more as she told Blake where to find the blonde\u2019s sister. </span></div></div>",

I think it was easier to hide when I was smaller but, for the past couple years it been obvious that he is using alcohol as a coping mechanism for something,\u201d as she gave a frown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou poor girl,\u201d Kali said as she gave her a hug engulfing Yang\u2019s head in her heavenly bosom. After the embrace, she got up and went to a cupboard and got some cookies and sat them on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt is funny how Ruby have gotten her hands on these,\u201d Yang comment as she chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Kali remarked, \u201cit not like she haven\u2019t found my special cookies even then I let her have a couple after she help me out a little,\u201d stretching a bit when she got back in her chair and ask, \u201cMilk?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d Yang exclaimed, \u201cI can\u2019t have cookies with some milk,\u201d she said with a cheeky grin, \u201cThat is pretty much the only time I drink it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKali pour the golden huntress another glass and one for herself and they began chatting some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile they when chatting, Kali kept secret the changes that Ruby gain during her time there.

Right when the cat faunus milf collect Yang\u2019s empty glass, she said softly to herself, \u201cHopefully I gave Ruby enough time with Blake and Weiss?,\u201d as she shuffled herself towards the sink with her hip swaying back and forth as she think out loud again, \u201cProbably and at least I made her sister drink more of her milk.\u201d Getting giddy at what she did, while all of the sudden felt a massive, veiny, moist cock on her back. This made her jump as Kali looks up at the owner and gave a huge smile as she said, \u201cHow was your two teammates?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeering over her massive breasts that was leaking milk, the crimson huntress said, \u201cLike perfect sluts,\u201d while she lick her lips, \u201cThey should be waking up at any moment but, I still in need to settled this monster down.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKali turned around and wrapped, or try to wrapped, her larger motherly tits around Ruby\u2019s cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014-Back to Yang\u2014\u2014\u2014<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yang left the kitchen, she couldn\u2019t believe that Blake\u2019s mom thought that she might have some feeling for her daughter. She try to rush her way to the bathroom\u2019s changing room with her cheeks burning red but, Yang did took notice of the faunus\u2019 architecture of the house and how unique it was. Following Kali\u2019s directions, the golden huntress made it to the changing room while smelling some type of musk in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile she was sliding the changing room door open after figuring out that she did not have to push it open, a greater aroma of the same musky smell fill her nostrils. This in turns made her blush a even greater shade of red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, she went in and put her clothes in one of the many empty baskets. As she was taking off and putting her under garments in the basket, Yang notice that her nipples were hard even though it wasn\u2019t cold in the changing room and her thong was a bit moist as she could feel some pussy juice crawling down her legs. Inspecting her neither region a bit, Yang saw that her neat little golden landing strip was becoming a full bush of blond as she said to herself, \u201cI should have took to my own advice that I told Ruby to keep it nice and clean cut.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that she can\u2019t do anything about it now, Yang went to the doorway that lead to the bath portion and saw that she was the only one there. Stepping beside the huge bath that could fit ten plus people in it, she kneel down and check the water temperature. It was still nice and hot as the golden bombshell decide to rinse herself off before taking a dip.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yang walked on the stone cobble floor to the rinsing off area from the giant bath that was dug below the floor level. She has always heard stories from her dad and uncle that some cultures, mostly the faunus, would bathe this way but, Yang never expected she would have the experience this soon. Yes, she knows that her and Ruby use to share a bathtub when they were younger but, nowadays a shower seem more efficient for Yang\u2019s carpe diem attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling weird sitting on one of the four wooden stools in front of four handheld shower heads, Yang decided to stand while she clean herself off. As the blonde huntress raise the shower head above her golden locks and turn the water on, she shiver at the cool temperature it was as a contrast to the hot and steamy bathing area. Once her mane of golden hair was soak, Yang lower the shower head down along her body. When the cascade of cold water hit her chest, her already hard nipple stiffen some more, so much that they seems they could cut glass. This in turn cause her slight horny feeling, not to diminish but, to escalate to new heights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her free hand, Yang started to rub one of her luscious breasts while teasing her hot pink nipple when her hand went by it. This made her moan softly as the hand that\u2019s gripping the shower head travel south until the icy sense of cold water hit her burning hot clit which made her moan more audible, \u201cOhhh, YYYEEESSSSS!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving the running water away from her, Yang hope that no one heard that in the hallway or at least the changing room. Thinking that she still need to wash up, Yang turn off the water for the moment and set the shower head aside so, she could look at the bottle before her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree of the bottles were your basic shampoo, conditioner, and body wash but, the fourth one was something surprising, lotion. \u201cLotion?,\u201d Yang questioned as she squirt some on her hand and rub it in. To her surprise, it wasn\u2019t rubbing in like normal lotion and the texture is more slimy and thicker. \u201cIt might be some all natural stuff,\u201d she stated to herself, \u201cor at least very old,\u201d as she rinse it off and smell her hand without thinking. As she smell it, she found that the smell was something familiar but, could not put her finger on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReplacing the bottle back and grabbing the body wash in it\u2019s stead to pour some on her hand and then put it back. She began to lather herself started at the shoulders and making her way down while spending more time on her tits that were larger than most girl her age. When she got to her crotch, Yang \u201caccidentally\u201d plunge two fingers into her pussy which made her starts moaning again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that she shouldn\u2019t do it there at the time, Yang stop and and continue down her legs. As she turn on the water again, she moan from the icy sting of the water hitting her breasts. Yang got accustomed to the temperature better this time so, she wouldn\u2019t let out another moan as she rinse off the soap of the body wash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce when she was done, Yang could not hold in the urge and place the shower head directly over her pussy. Making her moan pleasurably as she move the shower head in the slightest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring Yang\u2019s fun, Blake and Weiss was walking down the hallway after they had found Ruby and she fucked them senseless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow tell me again why we got dressed again when we are going to take a bath anyway?,\u201d Weiss questioned as she waddle as she walk because her stomach was bloated from getting pumped full of Ruby\u2019s thick semen. Which is an understatement because Weiss looked like she was several months pregnant with sextuplets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause,\u201d Blake exclaimed to her bloated teammate being equally bloated, \u201cyou don\u2019t want Yang to expect that we did it with her monster of a sister. Right?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut,\u201d Weiss wined, \u201cmy dress doesn\u2019t fit at the moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m not doing much better,\u201d Blake stop walk... no waddling to make a point to Weiss, \u201cat least you don\u2019t have pants on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell,\u201d started to say but, pause for a moment to find the right words, \u201cat least I got that stick out of my ass which you all said that I had.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, other to be replace by Ruby\u2019s massive log,\u201d the cat faunus responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, ... you were hogging all of her milk,\u201d the Schee heiress try to proved her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI say,\u201d Blake rebut, \u201cyou were drinking as much as me on the dick like nipple.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey continue their bickering on their way to the changing room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time they go there, their clothes fit better, maybe tight in some places, as their stomach got to a slight bloated stated. Before walking in, they could her Yang moaning from the bath part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake hold a finger to her mouth and gave Weiss a, \u201cshhhhh,\u201d and motion to go in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing sneakily, they walk in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss ask quietly, \u201cDo you have any idea how Ruby could put her huge,\u201d she pause as she drool from her mouth and lower one also, \u201cthick cock in us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake shrugged and answer, \u201cWhose knows. Maybe the milk,\u201d she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis made Weiss started to giggle and then made Blake join in as she handed Weiss a towel to feel decent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Back in the bathing area\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yang was enjoying the water being shoot into her, she froze when she heard laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly as she can, Yang shut the water off and jumped into the bath without making it seems she rush over to the bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Weiss and Blake enter the bathing area, they heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Weiss, Blake,\u201d Yang said as she was out of breath, \u201cHow is Ruby?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe is doing fine,\u201d Blake say in her monotone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Weiss added, \u201cshe can\u2019t wait to see you. Don\u2019t worry she not that <u>big</u>,\u201d as her eye shifting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Weiss and Blake made their way to the rinse off area, Yang thought they looked a bit different. Like Weiss\u2019s breast seems a bit bigger under her towel and she was closer to Blake height. And Blake\u2019s butt, look more jiggling and wider.</span></div></div>",

By the time they were rinsing off the soap, the new sensation dissipate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling a bit awkward, Blake ask, \u201cWant time to wash your back?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss accepted Blake offer by just giving her a nod because she felt awkward as well from what had transpired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blake was washing Weiss\u2019s back, the white haired huntress notice the bottle of lotion sitting by the other three bottle and ask softly, \u201cum, Blake?

Upon further inspection, Blake notice a hidden message that the White Fang use and it said, \u201cThe cum of Ruby do wonder for the body.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPuzzled by this, Blake wonder what it could mean and told Weiss what she saw when she heard, \u201cAre you guys coming in or not?,\u201d ask Yang that was getting antsy, \u201cif not I am getting out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yang got out of the bath and walked on the stone floor, she stumbled a bit. This worry Blake as she stood up and drop the bottle of \u201clotion\u201d to go to the team\u2019s blonde bombshell. She felt that she was swaying her hip out more with each stride. When she got to her teammate, the black cat faunus help her up and notice that she was no longer shorter than her. Blake\u2019s eyes went wider when she notice she was actually a bit taller than her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily Yang was somewhat out of it from the heat of the water and did not notice the slight change. \u201cDo you need help?,\u201d Weiss ask as she turn around on the stool and was about to stand up. She was still feeling a bit bloated when she did this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo,\u201d Blake exclaimed, \u201cI will helped Yang to one of the guest room and maybe get her a drink of water.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcusing herself from the bath, Blake hobbled with an over heated Yang hanging over her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Weiss saw Blake taking Yang out of the bathing area, she pick up the bottle of \u201clotion\u201d and ponder what Blake told her before their blonde teammate interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmmm, Ruby\u2019s cum would do a body good,\u201d Weiss say to herself as she squeeze a handful out and started to rub it on her skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t lotion would come to understand as this substance was too thick and wasn\u2019t absorbing into her skin. Once she got her arm cover, Weiss decide to put some on her face. By doing so, she accidentally got some in her mouth and now truly known it was cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to her, for some reason she was enjoying the feel of cum on her skin as she dump the rest of the bottle on her and grab another and did the same. Weiss was loving the feeling of this cum lotion all over her skin as she rub it into her or try to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow she grab a third bottle and started to drink it.</span></div></div>",

Genius actually. There were plenty of huntsman and huntress out in the world of Remnant that had very little to no aura at all. One good swipe from a Grimm and they'd be done for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut with her latest concoction that limitation would be a thing of the past. Anyone with a weak aura would be able to bolster their own and be able to fight longer and heal faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe possibilities for her 'Infinity Dust' as she was calling it, were potentially limitless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh she could see it now, her success reaching the far ends of Remnant and beyond. The best part being the knowledge she succeeded on her own without her father's influence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought brought a smile to her face reserved only for her butler back home. Only Klein was allowed to see her smile like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only thing to do now was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WEISS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe loud shouting of her name fallowed by her team leaders sudden appearance caused the snow-haired girl to yelp in surprise. Which in tern caused her to throw her latest project high in the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Weiss shouted as she tried to catch the vile... only for it to fall and shatter before her very eyes. Just like that all her hard work floated away through the air vent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops.\" Ruby chuckled nervously. \"Was that important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe near murderous look Weiss turned towards her was more than enough to answer her question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I'll just... uh.\" Ruby jetted away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss shook her head in annoyance. \"That girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll that remained of her hard work and potential A+ was shattered vile of nothing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's just perfect.\" she grumbled as she began to carefully pick up the shards. \"How am I going to explain this to professor Peach?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbeknownst to her, her dust didn't completely fade away, she had inhaled enough of it.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When she and her Team located the group, they formulated a simple plan to launch a surprise attack and went with the flow afterward. It was going well in spite of some difficulties here and there, but as Weiss activated her semblance an unseen Grimm, possibly returning after scouting the area, appeared out of nowhere and attacked, catching her off guard. Just as Weiss was about to redirect her glyph in an attempt to defend herself the Grimm managed to pounce on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough her Aura would usually protect her to a degree, this time it was too low after being attacked by the other Grimm during the attack and this resulted in the Grimm on top of her to \"break\" through the Aura with a bite into her shoulder drawing blood! As Weiss screamed in pain her partner, Ruby Rose had heard her and at the moment used her semblance to get in close and sliced at the Grimm with her weapon but unintentionally let's some of the wounded Grimm's blood to infect Weiss's wounds!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pain was beyond Weiss's comprehension as she somehow unconsciously activating her semblance at random resulting in the infection to spread into her body and her screaming loudly. After dispatching the last of the group, her Team frantically tried to get her back to Beacon as quickly as possible before more Grimm would arrive once they sense their despair and Weiss in pain. As Weiss falls into unconsciousness, she could barely hear Ruby tearfully apologizing for her mistake and begged Weiss to hold on until they make it back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that Weiss is awake, she sat up in spite of the remnants of the pain as she examines her bandaged shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will happen to me now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was a question that made Weiss nervous. Her potential future as a Huntress could very well be over if she was found to be unfit due to her injury and the infection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen there was the matter of her family... would her father even allow her to succeed him despite her \"condition\", or would he strip her position as the heiress and possibly make her younger brother, Whitley his heir instead?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither were good options when Weiss wanted to be independent of her father, and the thought of Whitley becoming the head of the Schnee Dust Company made her uneasy when she looked back on how Whitley acted more like their father when it comes to the Company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss sighed as she rubbed the bandage, \"I can't think too much about any of that right now.

Soon it became a little hard for Weiss to breathe as she struggles to try to remove her dress but not before managing to remove her pendant necklace as she noticed it started to get too close to strangling her neck.

Weiss was really panicking. \u201cWhy is this happening to me!?\u201d Weiss thought to herself. Just when she thought her situation couldn't get any worse  she felt the from before grow more intense, specifically around her chest.  Weiss could only stare in disbelief as her once nigh nonexistent breasts suddenly ballooned outward from her torso faster than the rest of her body , straining her bra as they went from the size of  oranges than grape fruit Then melons.  She gawked at how large her boobs had become, they even began to surpass Yang's assets. She was  shocked out of her trance when felt the same heat surge within her again only this time it was heavily concentrated on her lower body, much to her own horror. She felt her already  shapely legs began to thicken considerably as well as  lengthen, becoming alluringly voluptuous tree trunks. At the same time she could also feel her hips begin to widen with great haste, becoming something beyond \u201cchild birthing\u201d.  Her once petite posterior thickened in pace with her hips , growing into perfectly round basketball sized globes of flesh. Weiss  was completely flabbergasted by her body\u2019s impossible transformation. This did not make any sense! People did not just grow for no reason. The only logical explanation for any of this was the grimm blood that infected her wounds but she never heard of such a thing happening before.

But the bane of her anxiety had to ruin her mood once more at lunch in the Mess Hall when Yang had to tease Ruby with a <b>horrible</b> pun about drinking milk and emphasized by groping her own breasts resulting in several boys blushing or having perverted looks on their faces!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo when the Team went to sleep for the night Weiss changed her mind and decided to finish what she had started!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd so on a Saturday morning with no one else at the Acadamy at the moment, she is once again using the empty class to resume her experiments with renewed vigor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn you, Xiao Long!

My.\" Weiss said in shock as she saw her breasts. They were definitely bigger, but not as big as Yang's yet. Weiss is currently sitting at a C-cup range, which is bigger than her earlier B-cup, and Yang has an E-cup. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My, so the potion did work.\" Weiss said with a grin as she felt her chests expand more.

I'll show that bimbo who is on top!\" Weiss exclaimed looking at D-cup breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smirk on her face, Weiss put her shirt back on and returned to her dorm room. At this point, her breasts were DD-cups and almost Yang's size and her shirt was slightly ripping. \"W-Weiss, what happened?!\" Ruby asked pointing at Weiss' huge chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Weiss asked as she looked down, \"oh! I just had a growth spurt.\" Weiss concluded. \"We haven't seen you all day, and then you come back with these. Did you get an implant?\" Yang asked. Weiss showed Yang a bunch of notes and said, \"I couldn't. I was too busy filling up notes for Dr. Oobleck's class.\" Weiss said to the belief of team RWBY despite them not checking the notes. With that note, Weiss went to bed along with team RWBY. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Weiss woke up, the team was already getting ready for classes and Weiss's boobs were the same size as Yang's. \"Hey, Yang. It looks like you got some competition!\" Ruby exclaimed pointing at Weiss as she put on a bigger bra. Yang looked furious. \"Cat got your toung?\" Blake asked. Yang gave Blake a death stare as Blake got spooked and left the room and Ruby followed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess Ruby is right.

I .\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang scoffed. \"Oh please. You gotta get rough at the gym, Weiss.

A heiress who takes pride in her appearance is someone who spends two hours straightening their hair before going to the gym, you dolt!\" Weiss snapped, clearly offended by Yang's remark. \"And I'll not have you forget it, Xiao Long!. I refuse to get it all sweaty and messy and dirty, unlike some of these...m-muscleheads!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, sure.\" Yang waved a hand noncommittally, not at all fazed by Weiss' outburst. \"Now c'mon! It's seven\u2014they're opening the doors!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, they were. The heiress only offered a token protest this time as Yang dragged her to the front of the line and then Team WY found themselves entering right through the double glass doors.

An artificial atmosphere was simply marvelous compared to that swill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reluctantly followed Yang down to the lockers, where the two huntresses stowed their clothes and bags away in a shared locker. Weiss accepted a hand-towel with a skeptical look\u2014she doubted that she'd need it, and vowed to leave immediately for a shower if she did\u2014but didn't otherwise comment. After that, she followed Yang up the stairs to the main area of the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be over there at the treadmills.\" Yang jabbed a finger toward a long line of large black machines, where one or two gym-goers were already jogging along at a moderate pace. \"You should probably start over there as well to get your heart rate going, but you can try out any of the machines first, just to give it a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm.\" Weiss scanned the line of exercise machines around her with a questioning eye. \"What's that one over there?\" she asked, pointing in the direction of a flat, black-leather bench with a barbell positioned above it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the bench pressing area,\" Yang said with a grin on her face. \"Good for tightening up your arms and burning fat around your glutes.\" Yang then slapped her tight butt with an open palm, then grinned when a light blush rose beneath Weiss's cheeks. \"Should be just what you're looking for, really. Not much of a bulk-up machine...unless you wanna have thicker arms.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tightening,\" Weiss mused. \"Hm. Maybe having stronger arms COULD be useful for battling Grimm.\" Weiss then had a blush on her face. \"Yes; I think I'll try that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool. I knew you'd come around\" Yang took a gulp of water from her bottle, then screwed the top back on and jabbed a thumb toward the treadmills. \"Like I said, you know where to find me. And the machine should have directions on it, but if you need any help with form, feel free to ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Weiss said smugly. \"But I believe I'll manage quite well on my own. It's just a silly little machine, after all. I mean, these muscleheads manage to use it regularly, and they don't seem to have any problem with it. Even YOU can use it with ease, Yang. How hard can it be for an elegant young lady such as myself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her brief monologue, Weiss approached the bench pressing equipment while Yang went to the treadmills. Weiss sat on the bench, getting ready to start lifting the heavy weight. She suddenly began blushing whilst having a smirk on her face whilst looking directly at Yang and her muscular body, and began thinking to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm...I was skeptical about it, but maybe I wouldn't mind getting a somewhat decent muscle mass. In fact, I don't think I would mind ending up being more stronger than Yang, or the rest of my team either. Even better, I wouldn't mind being the most strongest huntress-NO, the strongest living being in the entire world! I can see it now - With the face of a princess, and the body of an Adonis, I'll be even more beautiful than I already am! I'll be popular, I'll be a celebrity, I'll get adored by men, and envied by women! Nothing can come between me now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then did an evil laugh, but she didn't laugh for too long and coughed in embarrassment and slightly blushed before she lied down on the bench, tightly placed both hands on the barbell, and began lifting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while of weightlifting, Weiss grinned arrogantly, as she could feel herself becoming much stronger...but how big does she actually get?</span></div></div>",

It wasn\u2019t a notable gain\u2014two or three pounds of muscle at most\u2014but it was a change. Weiss, for the most part, failed to notice them entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she resumed her workout, though, some part of her mind registered that when she let her muscles relax, they stayed the same size as when they\u2019d been bent. She just kept lifting, the sweat on her forehead coming down less and less as her muscles grew and grew.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, the training bra across her chest had grown much tighter, her chest having swelled with muscle as much as her abs had tightened and her hips firmed. Weiss nearly moaned as she made another pull. No proper heiress would have done such a thing in public, of course, but it just felt so incredible to have that tightness stretching across what felt like her entire body. She imagined that this was what after-workout soreness felt like, but failed to realize that her workout wasn\u2019t getting harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf anything, that same corner of her mind realized as she stood up from the weightlifting machine, it was getting easier. And she was getting bigger. And she liked it. She felt...turned on by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss blushed heavily while touching and observing her muscular body, as she thought to herself \"Mmm...I don't even look half-bad. I look AMAZING!

That would've been pretty hard to explain to everyone else in class.\" Yang lightly chuckled. \"Although the look of surprise on everyone's faces might've been worth it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake simply shook her head at her partner's comment, although she couldn't deny the image of bug eyes and slack jaws amused her greatly. But at the end of the day it wouldn't be worth it after the initial shock wore off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you wanna tell me how you're dust experiment wound up exploding.\" Yang asked. After the explosion Professor Peach had told her to take Blake to the infirmary despite her insistence that she was fine and her aura tanked most of the damage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Faunus sighed before answering. \"Someone sabotaged my experiment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang's eyes flashed. \"What!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was undisturbed by her the blonde's sudden shift in eyes color, she was far too used to it by this point. Instead she merely nodded, \"I don't know who or how but they somehow managed to cause a chain reaction while I was present at my desk. The mixtures I used should've at worst caused my dust to evaporate... not explode.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet it was Cardin and his lot, this totally seems like something they'd do.\" Yang growled. Those guys were always causing trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could be.\" Blake shrugged. \"But I'm not going to jump to conclusions without proof. For we know it could've been someone else. Team CRDL aren't the only jerks at Beacon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang's eyes reverted back to their usual lavender shade but it was clear she was still annoyed. \"True. But I've still got my eyes on them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake smiled. \"Thanks. Anyway, where's Weiss and Ruby?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Peach wanted to ask Rubes some questions after class and Weiss stayed with her. They texted me while you were in they infirmary. Said they'd be waiting back at the dorms for us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Blake nodded. She just wanted to get back to her dorm and shower. The sooner she got this soot and leftover Dust off of her the better. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two continued to walk to they pair never noticed the faint glow enveloping the dirtied girl.</span></div></div>",

She was too angry. Other students made way for her as she walked through the hallways of Beacon at a brisk pace; the girl was on a warpath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe source for her frustrations was another member of the team. A certain heiress, who she got along with the least, to be specific. Blake's eyebrows were set in a heavy frown, all because of another argument with Weiss. Was this uncommon? Not really. The two of them had enough differences to create conflicts, so that wasn't the issue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, however, Blake had had enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who does she thinks she is? Just because she's got money, doesn't mean she can just do and say whatever she wants. Someone ought to teach her a lesson.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn all honesty, Blake had already forgotten what they had been arguing about, but the annoyance and anger was ever present. She wanted to make Weiss suffer, just to see that selfish Schnee squirm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the question was how she was going to accomplish this. Blake was crafty and smart, but uncertain on how to proceed. Pranks were Yang's expertise. She didn't want to ask the blonde for help though. Better to keep her revenge secret for now, lest Weiss might hear of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake decided to think of a plan. And the best way to do that, was to go to her favorite hiding spot; the academy's library. Once there, she began to brainstorm her revenge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had to be something so amazing, so cruel and devious, while specifically targeting Weiss. The girl's confidence had to go down faster than a student's attention in one of Port's classes. Yes, Blake was aware she sounded like vindictive child, but Weiss deserved this; every single Schnee did. They were far too used to getting what they wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe faunus stayed inside the library for quite some time, plotting and scheming quietly. This couldn't be an ordinary prank. No, it had to be special. Something that Weiss would hate, or envy, or...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, what did Weiss envy about others? She was the Schnee heiress; as bad as her relationship with her father was, the white-haired teen got whatever she wanted, so it couldn't be material. Something else then. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeadership of the team? They all knew Weiss wanted to be team leader. Then again, that was a thing of the past. Weiss had accepted Ruby as the leader of their team, and she tried to be an advisor of sorts instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake let out a frustrated huff. Then what did Weiss lack so much that she was jealous of others?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Breasts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cat faunus quickly snapped her mouth shut, looking around to see if anyone had heard her exclamation. When she was certain that no was there, Blake sighed in relief. Still, the answer was clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor all her pompous attitude and seemingly unlimited riches, Weiss suffered from self-doubt when it came to her boobs. And Blake could see why -- anyone could! Weiss wasn't really the most gifted when it came to her chest, being almost as flat as a board. Even Ruby, who was younger than her, had a more prominent bust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake had noticed the envious stares whenever they changed clothes in the dorms or lockers. She herself had been the victim of quite a few, which made her smirk in satisfaction, knowing that her breasts were at least two cupsizes bigger. Of course, Yang was the reigning champion. At least she had the best ass; nicely shaped, just the right amount of muscle, and thick thighs to compliment her rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, clearly the right way to get back at Weiss was by making her even more self conscious about her bust size; to increase the heiress' doubt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd how was she going to accomplish this, one might ask? Blake grinned knowingly as she left the library, heading towards professor Peach's classroom instead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBreaking in was child's play. Blake had been one of the White Fang's best infiltrators; second only to Ilia. The teacher was gone for a whole day -- a teacher's conference that Blake was aware of -- so the whole room, including its vast supplies of dust and machines, were all hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPeach was the school's expert on dust. Applications, weaving, different kinds, and so on. But what the professor probably didn't know, was that dust could also be used for a special purpose. One that only Blake was aware of; courtesy of her mom discovering this new variation, and passing it on to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake immediately got to work. She took the dust that was needed, stacked it neatly next to a special mixer, and began the process. Her mother had showed her how to create the special dust before. It took a while, but after half an hour or so, Blake was greeted by the sight of numerous vials of dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally she wouldn't even consider mixing up these products, but the situation demanded it. Blake needed Kali Belladonna's exclusive erotic dust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA silly explanation for sure, but it was accurate. There were different shades with each one having its own purpose. What they all shared, however, was the ability to expand a woman's figure, enhancing it to make them sexier. Breasts, butt, hips, etc.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake took one of the vials, grinning ferociously at the dust that would make a girl's breasts expand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss thought she was small? Oh, by the time Blake was done, the poor girl would feel pathetic. She would crave for her own growth, only to be denied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now let's get started...\" Blake chuckled deviously. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i>It kind of\u2026 tingles, I suppose.</i> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake hummed thoughtfully as she applied the dust to herself. This kind of dust was supposed to be absorbed through skin contact, so she had taken a small amount and rubbed it on her skin. There was no need to apply it directly to the area that would be affected; the dust took care of that on its own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, she did that for a second reason. While true that there was no direct contact needed, the dust would work much faster when done so. For example, this dust would make her breasts grow bigger. If she really wanted to get immediate results, then she\u2019d have to take off her bra and apply the dust on her naked boobs. But Blake had other plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted the growth to be less noticeable for now. Later on it would certainly be noticed, but revenge was a dish best served cold, wasn\u2019t it? Blake had it all planned out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dust was gone in an instant; immediately absorbed into her bloodstream and ready. Blake was satisfied with what she came for. After carefully placing the used dust and equipment away where it belonged, she sneaked out of the classroom again, but not without her own brand of dust. One by one, each vial was stored in a bag. She would need to hide the small supply somewhere. Probably a place where her teammates wouldn\u2019t start looking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake contemplated on a good hiding spot, almost reaching the dorms, when she noticed a lone figure wandering the hallway. Her amber eyes lit up as she found her solution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJaune, can I talk to you for a moment?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde knight stopped in his tracks, turning around to give her a polite wave. \u201cHey, Blake. How\u2019s it going?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m doing fine. Thank you for asking.\u201d She smiled somewhat, trying to be as friendly as possible. Knowing him, however, it would be easy to get what she wanted. \u201cI want to ask you for a small favor.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, anything to help out a friend. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake held up the bag of dust for him to see. \u201cToday I bought some special dust, but forgot that there isn\u2019t a lot of space in my room to store it away. Between Ruby\u2019s comic books, Weiss\u2019 own dust, and Yang\u2019s hair products, there really isn\u2019t any spot I could put it. Not to mention it might get mixed with Weiss\u2019 dust, or an accident could happen because of Ruby. Do you see what I\u2019m getting at?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, I think I do.\u201d Jaune chuckled and nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry; I\u2019m not that much of a doofus. Sure, I\u2019ll gladly keep an eye on it for you. And you don\u2019t need to fear Nora accidentally using it or anything. Last time she did that with Pyrrha\u2019s, she got a stern warning from Ren, so now she stays away from other people\u2019s dust supplies.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid she feel bad for taking advantage of his kindness to cover up her little plot? A little, admittedly. But Blake was too invested in this to care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGreat. I appreciate your help. I\u2019ll see you later, then?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, see you later, Blake.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as the leader of team JNPR entered his own dorm room with the bag of dust in his hands, Blake smiled a predatory grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUgh, I\u2019m so glad the day is over.\u201d Yang sighed dramatically. Her teammates rolled their eyes, watching the brawler throw herself on her bed with reckless abandon. \u201cOobleck\u2019s lessons are killing me. Either his or Port\u2019s. Seriously, one goes way too fast to understand anything of what he\u2019s saying, and the other makes you fall asleep faster than counting sheep.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss held her head up high. \u201cWell, at least someone was taking notes and could keep up. Don\u2019t come to me for any copies either; just so you know\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd there was the typical Schnee arrogance, Blake idly noticed. The faunus student tried to ignore the haughty attitude that Weiss was showing. Instead, she moved to get changed like the others. No doubt the girls would be surprised in a few seconds\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter all, the dust had worked wonders throughout the day. Subtle as it might have been, Blake knew what to look for and what to expect, and she\u2019d kept an eye on her bust the entire team; at lunch, during class and even now. Her shirt had gotten tighter, and her bra fitted a bit more snugly as well. Blake smirked in delight. Luckily her jacket helped conceal her progress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight, Blake?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sudden voice broke her out of her thoughts. \u201cHmm? Oh, sorry. I wasn\u2019t listening.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang was asking if you agreed that Oobleck needs to take it easy.\u201d Ruby clarified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, why not.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBetrayed by own partner!\u201d The petite girl\u2019s more buxom sister wailed dramatically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group calmed down after that, and began to prepare themselves for a good night\u2019s rest. However, for once it would be Blake who would shake things up a little. It was finally time to put the next phase of her plan into motion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYang, do you mind lending me one of your bras?\u201d She asked innocently, turning around with nothing on her upper body save for her normal one; a modest C-cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brawler blinked. \u201cHuh? What do you mea\u2014wow! Uh, sure thing. Let me take a look real quick.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Ruby and Weiss were now interested in what was happening, and they were equally surprised by Blake\u2019s sudden bust increase. The latter\u2019s shock and indignation was exactly what she had hoped for, though she was careful enough not to show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha-- how?\u201d Weiss\u2019 eyes were filled with jealousy as she openly gawked at Blake\u2019s boobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile not exactly larger than Yang\u2019s, her expanded tits were noticeably an entire cup size larger. Their shape was still perfectly round, but they looked fuller and had more volume. The dark bra was no longer enough to contain her breasts. Bits of titflesh poked through from underneath and at the sides. Blake took pride in how her bust was almost on par with Yang\u2019s legendary chest. Just a bit more and they would be equals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd more importantly, they\u2019d be even bigger than Weiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI suppose I went through a growth spurt.\u201d Blake shrugged idly. Her carefree manners seemed to annoy the heiress even further. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s not that uncommon. We\u2019re still growing, after all. Or at least, most of us.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Ruby winced at that last remark. Yang hissed loudly, muttering the word 'burn' almost inaudibly. But they weren\u2019t the ones whose cheeks flushed red. Blake watched victoriously as Weiss immediately went to bed, clearly not in the mood for any kind of conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh, that was cold, Blakey.\" Yang grinned, amused by the display. \"Seriously though; looks like they grew a lot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake was smug, slightly squeezing her globes together with her arms. \"Looks like it. Still, I think I'm nowhere near done.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough they were all fast asleep, except for Blake. She was too busy celebrating her victory by patting her grown tits, a pleased smirk ever present on her gorgeous face. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It took a while before Blake reapplied the special dust. While she couldn't wait for Weiss to suffer more, it would be too obvious that something was happening if she used too much all at once. So instead, the faunus girl played the long game; a few days passed by before the next dose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake locked herself up inside their shared bathroom, stripping down to her bra and then removing it as well, which left her upper body completely nude. The view that greeted her through the mirror was very pleasing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll be bigger than Yang after this. Mhm, that should be fun.\" Blake smirked; amber eyes glinting with mischief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough, her round orbs of flesh were bigger than last time, and it was hard to look past that. She palmed her right tit in her hand, enjoying how firm it felt. As expected, jolts of pleasure ran down her spine because of the physical touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was something she had not foreseen, actually. Turns out the dust made her much more sensitive. Blake didn't let this side-effect get to her, but sometimes it would be hard to focus on anything when her breasts were busy growing, rubbing her stiff nipples against her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake let out a sigh as she flicked her finger against her nipple, which was already as hard as stone. Was her body already preparing itself for the dust, like some sort of reflex? She couldn't be sure. Nevertheless, her hormones surged, pleasurable sensations tingling all over her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut once she began applying the dust, that same sensation only increased in ferocity. Blake whined softly at the sheer warmth she felt. Never before had she encountered such orgasmic pleasure; not even with Adam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime, her boobs slowly but steadily swelled larger; more volume, more everything. The faunus student moaned into her hand, muffling the sound. Blake's legs trembled as her breasts grew an entire cup size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth lasted only half a minute or so, and yet her tits were now bigger than Yang's. When all was said and done, Blake calmed herself down, knowing that her team could possibly hear her if she climaxed. How unfortunate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Blake was more than satisfied with her new size. Her mammaries were huge, dwarfing Yang's; not excessively, but a good amount nevertheless. They were probably an F-cup, or E at the very least. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now for the next step...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake quickly took a shower like she'd told her team she would, hurrying up a little as to avoid suspicion. Within minutes she was ready. However, instead of dressing up, she wrapped a modest towel around her naked figure. After all, what other way to show off the goods than to 'accidentally' forget her clothes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe towel clung tight to her athletic frame, ending at her mid-thigh while barely managing to cover up her enormous tits. A bit lower and her nipples would be exposed, just the way Blake wanted it. She chuckled as she looked down at her deep cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vengeful huntress-in-training stepped out of the bathroom, practically sauntering into the shared room, with all three other girls' eyes landing on her. They were absolutely gobsmacked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby blushed fiercely, face growing almost as red as her cloak. She was obviously uncomfortable with the amount of skin that Blake was showing. Yang on the other hand was stupefied; no words came out of her mouth, which hung open in a silly manner, and there was a good amount of envy in her lilac eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the expression that Blake savored the most was Weiss'. The poor girl seemed mortified, and couldn't tear her eyes away from the huge chest that the faunus sported. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shower is free, if any of you want to go next.\" She idly remarked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Ruby who addressed the issue at hand. \"Say Blake, you seem to be going through quite a growth spurt.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mhm? You think so?\" Blake responded perfectly by pushing out her chest, squeezing her tits together with her arms. They almost burst out of the thin towel. \"Now that you mention it; they <i>have </i>gotten bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sheesh, no kidding. Wait, are they bigger than mine?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring Yang's outburst, she looked to the side where Weiss was busy doing school work at her desk. The heiress seemed intent on showing no reaction, but it was in vain; Blake easily noticed the annoyed frown. No doubt the white-haired girl was feeling inferior to her. Good, that meant her plan was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the rest of the evening, Blake kept flaunting her massive breasts. She even compared herself with Yang at one point, and the usually confident girl was forced to concede. Blake's tits were bigger. Not buy a huge amount, but definitely enough to be noticeable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake felt satisfied with herself. Clearly her revenge had worked, and she'd gotten something out of it herself, even if the latter was not what had made her do this in the first place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, should she maybe take it another step further? Humiliating Weiss was surprisingly fun after all...</span></div></div>",

By another week, Blake\u2019s breasts was now dwarfing Professor Goodwitch\u2019s by a couple of cup sizes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blake was walking back to her team\u2019s room, with her breasts jiggling under her Beacon\u2019s uniform, after a busy day of learning, she started to think how things are changing for her since she have become the biggest breasts in Beacon. The other students use to check out her perfect booty but, now they can get the pleasure of seeing her jumbo J-cups as they are walking toward her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake giggle at the thought that she was getting more attention lately but, she do miss that her breasts were stealing attention from her booty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe notice that her partner, Yang, was spending more time at the gym. \u201cYang do have a tone figure,\u201d Blake thought and imagine what she would look like with real muscle mass. This kind of made her drool a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team leader was just her normal goofy self. As Blake\u2019s chest were growing, Ruby check her height and found out she grew an inch, making her  5\u20193\u201d. This made Blake wonder if Yang\u2019s little sister will grow some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast but not less, except for her breast size, Weiss. It seem like every time that Weiss and her are in the same room, other than for class or rest, Weiss somehow disappear faster than Blake could notice. Which made Blake a bit jealous that Weiss was on her level of sneakiest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she thought that her mother\u2019s secret dust formulas has a muscle and a height growth and shrinkage recipes. And she wanted to increase her booty also but, just need the right time to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blake heard her name being called, she snap out of her train of thought and see who was calling her. She realize it was Professor Peach and Blake hopes that she hasn\u2019t figure out it was her that took some dust to make the breast expansion dust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay I help you Professor Peach?,\u201d Blake ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d Professor Peach answer and ask, \u201cWould you be willing to check on the dust lab when I am gone for a week because of the mission I just got?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell a course,\u201d Blake stated, \u201cMay I ask why?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt seem like some dust was stolen a couple weeks ago and I need someone that is trusted and you are in my top 3,\u201d Professor Peach exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI would gladly do it for you,\u201d Blake remark, \u201cbut, may I ask for a flavor. Can I use some dusts while I am look over the lab?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNormally the answer would be no,\u201d Professor Peach starting to say, \u201cbut, I know you can be trusted as long as you write down how much you has use so, I could replace it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDeal,\u201d say Blake as she resume going back to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Blake got back to her team\u2019s room, she notice Weiss was in there studying as Blake was going to the closet so, she could take off her bra for the day and relax. As she took off her school dress shirt, she notice her bra was tight and some flesh was spilling over the fabric. \u201cMmm,\u201d she said out loud, \u201cseem like I need a bigger size,\u201d and she turn toward Weiss and saw she was gone but, hoping she heard that as she took off her bra also. Giving a nice squeeze to her K-cup breasts and a pleasurable moan, Blake thought, \u201cThis Kitties are getting big.\u201d</span></div></div>",

The day prior, she handed Blake the key to her classroom, which she called the dust lab, and a sheet of paper that has the inventory of all the dusts that are in the cabinets. Blake was told that if any dust was stolen, go straight to Professor Goodwitch and tell her. Professor Peach also noted that Goodwitch also knows that Blake was going to use some dust as long as Blake wrote down how much she took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake did a quick check on the dusts to make sure nothing was stole and luckily none was. After she was finish, Blake started to make the booty, muscle growth, and height growth and shrinkage dusts in a smaller quantity than the breast expansion dust, which she has three more vials of that Jaune is keeping an eye on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Blake was finish with all four dust formula, it was getting late and about time for bed. So she gather up twelve vials (three of each formula, other than the muscle growth which was four), clean up her mess,  lock Professor Peach\u2019s classroom, and head back to the dorms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she got back to her team\u2019s room, Blake made a detour to team JNPR to see if Jaune could do the same flavor again. As she got to team JNPR\u2019s room, she saw Jaune standing in front of the door with his head down. Trying to not be awkward, Blake ask, \u201cTeam CRDL bully you again?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJump back a bit and letting out a little high pitch scream, Jaune answer, \u201cBlake why, when did you get high,\u201d as he try not to make eye contact at the beyond busty cat faunus, \u201cWas it easy to tell?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, no it wasn\u2019t. Yes it was,\u201d Blake say in her mono tone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI do know Blake,\u201d Jaune feeling a little better, \u201cit just seem...\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Jaune could finish, Blake, out of character, grab Jaune\u2019s head and push his face into her massive cleavage. Rubbing the back of Jaune\u2019s head, Blake said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry what other people said. You are a great leader for you team.

As she walk, she had her arms cross under her killer k-cup breast while thinking what to do with the different vials in her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she got to her room, Blake came up with a plan. As much as she wants to maximize her booty, she will wait two week before doing so she can focus on the changes of her teammates. Firstly,, she will only sprinkle a little of the dust that is for each respect teammate. Second, to make it not seems obvious, Blake will sprinkle Yang every three day, Ruby every five, and Weiss every week. Third, she will start tonight and then sprinkle her teammates when they are asleep because it was hard to keep Weiss in the same room as her for more than a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Blake went in, She check her scroll to see what time it was and it said 11 p.m. \u201cPerfect,\u201d she thought, \u201cRuby could never stay up past 9:30 p.m., Weiss was one of the first one up so, she should be sleeping, and Yang would crash on her bed by the time she took her after workout shower.\u201d As she crept in the room, so she won\u2019t disturb her teammates, and went to her closet to change into her pajamas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe first change out of her school skirt and black panties and in to a black thong, which most nights she will wear one, and her black sleeping skirt. Next, she took off her school dress shirt and took the vials of dust out of her cleavage sneakily and place it on a shelf in her closet. Now the main event, she slowly peeled off her massive bra and releasing her two pale orbs from it\u2019s prison. Blake\u2019s breasts jiggle for a moment which made her moan as she started to knead them for a minute so, in case Weiss woke up when Blake came in, she could enjoy the show. Blake stopped when her pink, thumb size nipples became hard. She put on her newly acquired black yukata top because her old one could only covered her breasts now and leave her tone stomach, with a hint of a six pack forming, open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she had her pajamas on, she put the vials in her cleavage again and hopped into bed quietly and wait a hour, just to be sure that everyone is sleeping. She starting to read a book while<br>\r\nwaiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs a hour has past, Blake jumped down from her bed as quietly as she hopped up there she decided to sprinkle Yang with the muscle growth dust first. She sprinkled a eighth of the vial on the blonde bombshell as Blake thought, \u201cToo bad I can get you to ingest some of this so it can work instantly and I can watch your muscle swell up,\u201d as she was getting moist thinking about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was Weiss, because her bed was also on ground level. Blake sprinkle the height shrinkage dust on the team\u2019s ice queen, a bit less than muscle growth dust for Yang, this made Weiss stirred as she said  in a sleepy voice, \u201cIt not fair. It not fair that my breast have grown and I have to wear a train....,\u201d as she turn to her side  and did not wake up. Blake wipe her brow and thinks god that Weiss did not wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow for the team leader, who\u2019s bed was above Weiss\u2019s. Blake gingerly rise herself on part of weiss\u2019s bed and saw Ruby sleeping with Zwei like a stuffed animal. As Blake thought the sleeping dog was kind of cute like this. She got the height growth dust open and start to sprinkle some on Ruby but, than...</span></div></div>",

When the person hit one hundred, the counting noise was enough to wake her up. With a yawn and stretching her arm away from her body, Blake finally put the person to the voice as Yang said, \u201cSorry if I woke you but, for some reason this morning, I have a good amount of energy to burn off plus Ruby is in the shower so, I decided to do some push-ups.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile climbing down from her bed, Blake answer, \u201cThat\u2019s ok,\u201d with another yawn, \u201cI actually don\u2019t really like waking up any later than seven anyway or it just feel like I am off a bit and trying to catch up.\u201d It seems like the height growth dust did not affect her too much because the height difference between her and Yang was hardly noticeable as she started to see if Yang looks different for the muscle growth dust. It looks likeYang\u2019s body was a bit more define with muscle but, it could be from the one hundred push-ups she did. Blake look around the room a bit and saw Weiss was still asleep which was unusual for her to sleep in but, not impossible because it was a free day today. As Blake was still looking at the sleeping Weiss, Yang said, \u201cI know it weird right,\u201d with a chuckle, \u201cto see Weiss still in bed while our adorable team leader is up and at em on a day we don\u2019t have to go to class. Maybe she had a cartoon she really wanted to watch,\u201d as Yang shrugged her slightly bulkier shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the bathroom door open up and Rudy came out in some casual clothes on. As she came closer to Yang and Blake, she let out a squeal and this I turn made Zwei started to bark. Blake notice why Ruby was squealing and that is because Rudy was as tall as Blake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all the noise, Weiss woke up and said in a irritable voice, \u201cWhy are you being so loud, you dolt,\u201d as she move out of bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWeiss, Weiss, Weiss,\u201d as Ruby close the distance between them in a second, \u201cI grew again!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, yeah but an inch is nothing to be that proud of,\u201d as she raise to her feet.

I grew two inches and now I as tall as Blake,\u201d Ruby said as she hold up a peace sign with her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she said that, Blake thought she heard Weiss \u201cgulp\u201d a bit and thought this revenge is getting sweeter and sweeter.</span></div></div>",

When watching Professor Peach\u2019s classroom, she did not see any of the dust was \u201cstolen\u201d other than what she used at the beginning of the week. Blake also saw that Jaune use some of the muscle growth dust that she gave him because his hoodie looks a bit more tighter on him than normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTalking about muscle growth, Blake gave Yang two more doses through the week. She saw that every morning after she secretly give it to Yang, the blond bombshell would do some type of exercise to burn some of the energy off. To Blake, it seem the the dust also increase a person endurance as well but, only in the slightest. The main feast for Blake was Yang was actually getting some muscle on her normal fit and toned body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seem like Blake only got enough to height growth dust on her to give her another inch in height to make her 5\u20197\u201d but, with Ruby she kind of grew like a weed. By the end of the week, Ruby was now 5\u20198\u201d, the same as Yang. In a way, it was probably a good idea on her part to hold off on the height growth dust until the end of the week and might even give her a much smaller dose next time. It was funny for Blake to watch her once shorter team lead, now taller than her and being energetic and helpful to use her new height for good or at least to boost her ego a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow on to the target that was the reason why was using her mother\u2019s dust formula in the first place. To most, Weiss was normally 5\u20193\u201d in heels but, out of them she was actually 5\u20193/4\u201d. Blake only knew this because within the first couple weeks at Beacon, Ruby came up with a group bonding experience and got everything ones\u2019 height and marked them on the door frame. Weiss was a little more trickier to get because she was always wearing heel until, one day that she made the mistake and was by where Ruby mark everyone\u2019s height and use her semblance to quickly mark Weiss\u2019s height with a baby blue color pencil. And now, Weiss look like she was now under that mark by a little at 5\u2019 even. This was what Blake was asking for, to shrink Weiss a little bit by a little bit so, she wouldn\u2019t notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Blake was reading one of her favorite book, she was thinking how much has change for Ruby and how little for Weiss while waiting to give them their next dose.</span></div></div>",

The hard part is to see if Jaune would cooperate in giving them back or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day before Blake decided to get her dusts from Jaune, she use some more of the booty dust on her already magnificent round butt and some breast expansion dust she got before the night of Weiss\u2019s potty run so, she could boost Yang\u2019s muscle tits to more than just muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sensation was indescribable to Blake, like five of Blake\u2019s greatest orgasms in a row. With her knees still shaking, Blake knows she could alway have a better body. Pouring herself a glass of milk, Blake a dash of height growth dust and three dusts of muscle growth dust into it. She knew that mixing those two dust works better when drank but, for the best results, milk was recommended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout a second thought, Blake chugged the glass and the effect work instantly. She gain another two inches to make her 5\u201910\u201d. As she was flexing her bicep, Blake saw her once firm but, small muscle grew to hard, baseball size. Blake knew she probably be a bit bigger the next day but, it would be worth it to get her dusts back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake got some time to use before her breast and ass reach their final size. So, she decide to pleasure herself first before flaunting her ASSets to the whole school. Who knows, she could make Weiss feel a lot smaller than her now 4\u20198 body.</span></div></div>",

As Blake was flaunting her stuff through the hallway with eyes all on her, she spotted Weiss in the library trying to reach a book. Couldn\u2019t pass a chance like this again, Blake sneakily got behind Weiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce there Blake reach hand out over the snow fairy while her ever growing breast rest on the top of her head. \u201cRuby,\u201d Weiss remarked, \u201chow many time have I have to tell you,\u201d the white haired girl was saying until she felt the weight of two massive objects on her head, \u201cto not reach over me,\u201d Weis gulp as she turn around and looked up to see she was under someone\u2019s breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that anyway to treat someone who is trying to help you, Weiss,\u201d Blake said as she put more weight on Weiss\u2019s head, \u201cI just saw you struggling to reach this book,\u201d as she step back a bit to saw Weiss the book in her hand, \u201cbut, now I think you should get it from here,\u201d as the cat faunus slide the book into her deep cleavage which made her moan faintly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt not like I needed that book,\u201d Weiss snared <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally now,\u201d Blake answer back while squeezing her arm underneath her breasts and peering over them to look at the snow fairy, \u201cI thought you needed it because you were trying to get it for like five minutes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that Blake was right and she had been there for a good ten minutes but, didn\u2019t want to tell her that. So, she swallow her pride and reach for the book that was much lower now that it was in the cleavage of the cat faunus. As she slide the book out, Blake made her moan more noticeable as she squeeze them harder as Weiss was pulling the book out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSee,\u201d Blake exclaims, \u201call you had to do is to give up your pride and appreciate what other could do for you. And who knows, maybe you starts to grow too,\u201d Blake said as she was walking away making her booty jiggle with each sway of her hips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the next day roll around, Blake headed to the school main gym to see if she could find Jaune, in nothing more than a black workout bra and shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking in the gym, she was greeting by the noise of clanging metal and grunts. Looking around, Blake saw Ruby, 6\u20193\u201d body, running on the treadmill while Yang was bench pressing what looks like a lot of weights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Blake went by Yang as she was finish up. \u201cWoah, pussycat,\u201d Yang said while trying to regain her breathe, \u201cdid not think you be coming here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhile you know, a girl have to stay fit somehow,\u201d Blake answer as she flex her bicep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMan, did not think you were that strong,\u201d Yang comment, \u201cdo you need a workout buddy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. Just going to do some light stuff today. Oh, by the way, have you seen Jaune?,\u201d Blake asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you want that jerk?,\u201d Yang ask, \u201cHe use to be such a sweet and innocent guy but, now a major asshole.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh nothing,\u201d Blake answer, \u201cI just let him barrow something some time back and just wanted it back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGotcha,\u201d Yang reply, \u201cif you need any help, I am actually stronger than him,\u201d while cracking her knuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat ok,\u201d Blake chuckle, \u201cI think I could persuade him,\u201d while walking away to find Jaune.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some time but, Blake finally found he by the mirror with a group of female students by him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, ladies,\u201d Blake said as she got close the the muscle bound Jaune, \u201cI need to talk to this cutie for the moment.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the crowd disappeared, Jaune pipe up in a deep tone, \u201cWhat can I do for the school\u2019s most beautiful and busty student,\u201d as he making sure Blake saw his crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, nothing really,\u201d Blake said while tracing her finger along Jaune\u2019s chest and abs, \u201cI just need my stuff back and I would do anything to get it back,\u201d she said in a seductive voice as she said the last part slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go back to my room and we can talked about it,\u201d Jaune suggested while giving Blake\u2019s booty a smack and then started to rubbed it.

She remembers Blake wearing a short skirt last afternoon when reading her book while sitting on the bed.  Yang perfect view up her skirt when doing her afternoon sit ups on the floor.  It looked when so sexy with her kitty cat panties, god what she would give to lick that pussy.  After thinking that her clit went from 2 inches to 4.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang thought about how Whice bent over to pick a book she dropped and she got a perfect view up her skirt, and she had quite the cute little butt.

Yang's 4 incher is now a 6 incher, and has grown some acorn-sized balls below her clit-dick, soon to be just dick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then there was her half-sister Ruby, she knew it was wrong but damn she CUTE!  Total moe waifu!!  Ruby has been drinking her milk to help her grow, but all those cookies has been making her butt and thighs grow.  Good thinking about how those soft pillow butt jiggle when she got dress in her pj made her--<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ACK!\" Yang's train of thought went blank has she came and some weird gooey substance landed in her mouth has she orgasm-ed.

Glue or is there a fleshy colored string tied around your waist?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, maybe you should reach around my ass and cope a feel to be sure,\" Yang said laughing and moaning little to Blake's unwitting hand job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake could feel Yang's penis throb in her hand and heat radiate off of it.  \"It feels almost like a real penis,\" Blake said feeling a little warm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because it is a real penis, maybe you should check to see if it taste's like one too,\" Yang said smirking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake blushed and Yang's suggestion, but decided to play her game and lowered her mouth on Yang's penis.  It certainly smelled like a real penis, remembering how it compared to Adam's penis.  Blake gave it an experimental lick causing Yang's body to twitch.  \"Oh wow, your tongue is rough just like a cat's too,\" Yang moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang had to be faking it thought Blake, there is no way she felt that.  Blake started kissing the head of Yang's penis.  \"Yes, please kiss my beautiful cock to make it better because of your rough tongue.\"  Said Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright that was it,\" thought Blake as she plunged onto Yang's penis, taking the first 3 inches.  Yang's toes curl, feeling happy about her first ever blow job from her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Blake don't stop!\" Yang grabbed the back of Blake's head and shoved her down to the hilt, with her chin resting on Yang's balls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This can't be real!\" Blake thought, \"There's no way she could have grown a penis, it's not possible!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll make sure you feel good too,\" Yang said has she kept Blake's head pinned down on her cock with one hand, while reaching over Blake's ass, digging her other hand through Blake's PJ's bottoms and fingering her vagina.  Yang could feel Blake's vagina getting wet, the male pheromones from Yang's penis, must be affecting her.  Yang wrapped her legs around Blake's head and started rocking her hips back and forth.  Blake could do nothing to fight, and wasn't she if she wanted it to.  Blake's hands reached under her belly and started rubbing her pussy while trying to match her speed with Yang's thrusts.  Yang's hand left Blake's pussy and switched to having two hands shoving Blake's head back and forth on her cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang's sausage tasted so good in Blake's, but was it getting... bigger?  Yang's cock was getting harder and bigger and could feel herself cumming real soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm cumming!!!\" Yang half-whispered and blew her load down Blake's throat.  Blake gagged with amount of cum entering her mouth and stomach.  After a full min, Yang stopped and her cock softened and her balls deflated.  Yang released Blake from her cock, and glared at Yang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang, what the *burrrp* hell!,\" Blake yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shhhh, not so loud Weiss and Ruby are sleeping,\" Yang said giggling a little at Blake's cute burp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you done?\" Blake said aghast of what she just done.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really, that burp was kind of hot and made me horny again,\" Yang said looking proudly at her semi-hard shaft as it grew from 7... 8... 9... 10... inches of cock!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang, did your penis get... bigger?\" Blake said looking at the 10 inch monster between Yang's legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, don't ask me how, but I'm think ready to again, wanna try anal before it gets too big?\" Yang said obviously feeling proud about hir new bigger size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious.

My package will be a perfect match for my tig o'l bitties!\" Yang said undeterred by her new endowment at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, Yang it's too early for me to deal with your crap, and I really have to take a crap too.  So...\"  Blake shoved Yang out the bathroom door and locked the door behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang turned away from the door and looked toward the sleeping beauties in front of her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm in the mood for at least one more fuck, but who should I pick...\"</span></div></div>",

So this time Yang thought shi should make that more literal.  Weiss has been taking sleeping pills to help her fall asleep, Yang wonders how strong those pills are.  Yang tip toes hir way to Weiss's bed and gently pulls back the covers revealing Weiss sleeping body.  Yang lifts up Wiess's nighty revealing Weiss's blue and white striped panties.  Yang feel's hir cock throb looking at those sexy panties on her cute little butt.  Yang climbs into Weiss's bed and pulls down her panties exposing her pussy and asshole, \"Good thing Weiss is laying on her front,\" Yang thought because shi wanted to try anal before hir cock gets too big.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning forward Yang lines hir cock head to Weiss's butt crack, leans forward and spreads her butt cheeks open, but not before coping a feel.  Weiss may have a petite figure, she doesn't have boobs like hirself, or an ass like Blake, or thighs like hir sister Ruby but she does have soft skin and it feels nice between Yang's fingers.  Yang hopes the inside is just as good as the outside.  Yang inserts hir swollen dick head into Weiss's asshole, causing Weiss's body to jolt but not wake up.  Already two inches and Weiss clenches her butt cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neptune please push it in deeper,\" Weiss moans in her sleep.  Yang all too happily obliges and shoves her cock half way inside.  Yang bites her bottom lip, \"so this is anal sex, I like it,\" Yang thought.  Shoves another two more inches before pulling back and pushing back in.  The bed rocks as Weiss moans into her pillow, \"Neptune your so big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nothing I still got 3 more inches of cock meat left to go,\" Yang said with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dirty boy keep going,\" Weiss moaned still sleeping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang decides to pick up the pace trying to shove as much or hir cock in as possible.  Pushing hir cock deeper inside with each thrust until eventually hir balls tap her soft butt.  Weiss's insides feel so good with the was she's clenching and she's so close to cumming.  Weiss clenches the bed sheets and says, \"Neptune are you getting bigger?\"  Yang's was indeed getting bigger and so was Yang's churning balls.  Yang's cock went from ten inches to 12 inches of fuck meat.  Yang could feel hir cock getting bigger and Weiss insides getting.  The combination of growth and tightness was enough to put Yang over the edge and cum inside.  Yang came for over 30 seconds until shi went dry and hir cock softened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemoving hir penis shi admired 8 inch flaccid cock.  Even flaccid hir cock was bigger than most men and gave hir cock and affectionate rub, feeling proud hir monster cock as it leaks cum on Weiss's sheets until suddenly...</span></div></div>",

Isn't that something men are suppose to have?  I mean I've never seen one, so I don't know what one looks like.\"  Ruby said confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep it is something men are supposed to have and grew one almost an hour ago.\"  Yang said with a mischievous smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!  But how, I mean why did this happen?\"  Ruby sat up in her bed and climbed down to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck if I know-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang were not suppose to use the \"F\" word!\"  Ruby interrupted, \"and why are you in Weiss's bed, and why are her panties down, and... what's that white stuff on Weiss's butt?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's called cum, it's what boy's make when they have sex,\" Yang said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were having sex with Weiss!\" Ruby gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, she was a great lay I almost regret not plowing her pussy.\"  Yang said with pride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait if you weren't, than which hole, eww gross!  Yang people poop from there what were you thinking?!  Ruby was disgusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not that gross, besides Weiss's butt hole was very clean, see no poop what so ever,\" Yang grabbed hir cock and showed it to hir little sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby leaned her head forward and couldn't really see any poop. \"And Weiss agreed to have sex with you have after your grew a... a penis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang shrugged, \"Yep... hey Ruby do you want to learn more about man penis?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well have ever wanted to know what one felt like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang I'm not going to touch your... your penis.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on please, we touched each others breasts before when going bra shopping,\" Yang pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's different, I don't feel comfortable touching my sister's er, penis, which I can't believe she has a penis.  It'd be like asking me to touch your pussy.  I think.\"  Ruby said flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wouldn't be the first time we touched each other there,\" Yang smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was one time, when we were really little and we didn't know any better,\" Ruby's face turned red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on please I really want you feel my penis, I'm really curious when compared to a pussy, please trust your big sister,\" Yang said almost begging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ugh fine, but only because your my big sister,\" Ruby finally gave in and lowered her hand to Yang's flaccid cock.  With hesitation she reached and grabbed for it.  \"Eww, gross it's all slimy and wet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be the leftover cum,\" Yang said happily.  \"Ruby can you do me a favor and check to see if my pussy is still there?  I need you to grab my balls and look, please, please little sis.\"  Yang begged and pleaded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine,\" Ruby moved her other hand and almost fondled Yang's balls, causing cock to twitch and Yang to suppress a moan, Ruby lifted tennis ball sized balls and tried to feel around for Yang's pussy and found it.  Having Ruby rub both hir male and female sent a jolt of pleasure through her body and Yang nearly bonked hir head on the bed above when shi felt Ruby's middle finger penetrate her pussy.  \"Okay Yang you still have a pussy.  Can I stop... feeling around?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait I need to be sure.  Can you feel around a little longer?\"  Yang begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\"  Ruby continued to rub both Yang's cock and pussy.  Giving an unwitting hand job and fingering at the same time.  Ruby's fingers grazed around feeling Yang's pussy lips and eventually found Yang's clitoris which is rock hard.  And speaking of rock hard, Yang's cock in Ruby's other hand started to get hard again, growing from 8 in to 10 in.  Yang's cock felt so warm in Ruby's hand and the musk of her sister's penis was starting to make her crotch moist.  Ruby's face was bright red, \"Yang can I please stop now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby tried to remove her hands from her sisters crotch, but Yang's hands reached out grabbed both her arms to stop her and kept Ruby's hands firmly on her crotch.  \"Please Ruby just a little bit longer,\" Yang said huskily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang's cock continued to grow in Ruby's hand until it reached a full foot at max hardness.  \"Yang your penis is so big, how big is it?\" Ruby said flushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is and I'd say it's about a foot long, and please don't stop rubbing\" Yang said feeling hot and bothered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow\" Ruby said astonished about Yang's size.</span></div></div>",

Don't you want feel your big sis lips?\"  Yang leaned closer and Ruby closed her eyes.  And they kissed.  Ruby moaned into the kiss as Yang put her tongue inside of Ruby's mouth.  Yang withdrew kiss and said, \"I want you feel how \"big\" your \"big\" sister is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" replied Ruby and went back to kissing her sister.  Yang's hands traveled down Ruby's back and reached for Ruby's ass.  Shi caressed it a few times, getting a feel of how big it is, not as big as Blake's but still nice.  Shi reached hir thumb inside of Ruby's waistband and pulled down Ruby's PJ bottoms.  Yang's hands went back up Ruby's legs and caressed Ruby's inner thighs.  Yang put one hand behind Ruby's ass and the other under Ruby's panties and inserted two fingers inside Ruby's wet cunny.  Yang broke from Ruby's kiss and lowered hir head towards Ruby's panties.  Shi lowers Ruby's panties and inserts hir tongue inside hir sister's pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Yang!\" Ruby moaned as she forced her sister's head further into her pussy.  Ruby stepped out of her panties and PJ bottoms and made their way to Blake's bed.  Ruby sat on Blake's bed while Yang continue to eat her pussy.  Ruby moans as clenches her thighs around Yang's hand with her legs crisscross behind Yang's back.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang stopped and said, \"Okay I think your wet enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!  Keep going,\" Ruby moaned.  So Yang kept going for a few more mins until Ruby was close to climaxing and stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!  Yang I was so close!\"  Ruby moaned and complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry sis, but we're going to climax together,\" Yang got up and pushed Ruby flat on Blake's bed.  Yang crawled on top of Ruby's body and aligned hir cock with Ruby's wet pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby was have second thoughts looking at Yang's big fat cock, \"Yang I don't think it's going to fit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry sis, vaginas are known to stretch, it will fit,\" Yang said having difficulty trying to contain herself.  Yang's purple cock head rubbed against Ruby's vagina opening and inserted inside.  Yang had to be very careful not to bunk hir head on the bunkbed above hir head as she pounds hir sister's pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck Yang your so big,\" Ruby moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your not suppose to say the \"F\" word,\" Yang teased.  \"But say it again.  Say how big my cock is, please.\"  Yang felt pride in her size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang you're fucking huge and going to tear up my insides,\" Ruby wailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I should hope so,\" Yang said beaming with pride as shoves half hir cock inside of Ruby's snatch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang you're too BIG it won't go in any further,\" Ruby complained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense,\" Yang said as shi shoves hir cock back out 2inches and back in 3inches.  Yang kept pounding hir cock more and inside, on inch or half inch at a time.  When shi reached 9 inches Yang leaned forward and slide her hands under Ruby's shirt and played with her boobs.  At ten inches Yang started kiss Ruby on the lips again, tears were rolling down Ruby's face.  Eventually Yang bottomed out and hir balls slapped below Ruby's crotch.  Ruby moaned, the pain soon turned into pleasure as she was stuffed with a foot of cock inside her.  Ruby could feel herself getting close again and moaned Yang mouth and wrestled with her sister's tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang broke the kiss and said, \"Whose body do yo belong too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Ruby was too young and innocent to understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whose pussy do you belong too,\" Yang squeezed Ruby's left breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Moooaaaan!  It's you!  My body and pussy belongs to you and your big cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right and who-ooooh, Yang felt Ruby's insides get tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang?  Are you getting bigger?\"  Ruby asked as Yang's cock has grown from 12 inches to 13 inches.  Yang continued to pound Ruby's pussy as feeling hir cock getting bigger and BIGGER.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I'm getting so close,\" Yang said as both hir cock and balls continued to grow bigger as shi reached 14 inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too,\" Ruby said feeling and seeing a huge bulge below her stomach.  Yang felt hir balls inflate more and as they reached the size of apples and hir cock stopping at 15 inches in length an 2.8 inches in width.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby bear my child!\" Yang shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm... I'm CUMMING!!!\" Ruby and Yang came together.  Yang's balls burst flooding Ruby's insides with hir cum.  She came for about 3 mins before she stopped.  Ruby looked a 3 months pregnant.  Ruby and Yang were both panting sweating and Yang laid on top of hir sister body clutching hir sister's hand.  After about 30 mins Yang finally removed hir now bigger cock and got off hir sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby yawned, \"Yang what if I get pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would that be so bad?\" Yang said smugly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably,\" Blake said as she entered the room unnoticed by both Ruby and Yang.  Yang jumped little and turned around to face Blake while hir 10 inch flaccid cock swung back and fourth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlake face flushed red looking at the 10 inch monster dangling between Yang's legs.  \"Yang, did your cock get bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's sure did.  Do you like what you see?\" Yang said cheekily as shi swayed hir hips back and fourth as hir cock wiggled side to side.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlack started drooling and wiped the drool from her lips, \"maybe.\"  Blake shook the cobwebs from her head and told Yang that tomorrow they'll take Yang to the school nurse and Yang will have to apologize to Weiss for raping her.  Sense Blake's bed now smell like cum, and it's all Yang's fault, Yang and Blake will swap beds.  Ruby climbs into her bed and they all go to sleep.</span></div></div>",

What was it implying in the note? and Who was doing this? While the buxom blonde pandered about the case she decided to bring it back to her dorm.She lay on her bed watching videos on the dustnet because Ruby was off on a trip with Weiss and Blake was in her home,Also known as the fort of books she read and studied,so the temptation to open the case was so much more due to the boredom.After staring at the case for 5 minutes she decided to open it and take a peak.She found 2 small glass tubes with a yellow liquid,A label on it saying \u201cExperimental Enhancement  Dust\u201d and it had a instruction manual.#Step 1:poor dust into water #Step 2:Drink the water #Step 3:wait 30-40 mins #Step4:Enjoy the enhancements of your best parts.As Yang sit there reading this the only thing she could wonder was what did it enhance anyway,She said \u201cScrew it I\u2019m bored and hell maybe it\u2019ll make my fighting skills better\u201d.She got a glass of water,Put the mixture of dust in the water,then waited 5 minutes and than drank the concentrated solution.After watching Dustnet videos for 30 minutes and nothing had happened Yang said \u201cWell that was a waste,now all I have is a bad taste in my mouth and I\u2019m still bor-\u201c Suddenly Yang felt a tightness in her chest and she looked down to see her breasts swelling and growing like dough in a oven.She was in shock until she grew 3 cup sizes bigger she had always enjoyed her breasts and loved showing them off or boasting about them at any opportunity.she noticed that her bra as oh so tight due to the 5 cup bigger chest she started to feel her new bussom and had a realization that they were growing more sensitive with there size increase.She couldn\u2019t Stop copping a feel of her breasts her yellow bra had snapped allowing her breasts to flop up in the air and allowing them to not be restricted by the tiny bra.the blonde started to play with her nipples and an explosion of ecstasy came over her,the now mammoth sized blonde had played with her nipples allowing her nipples to drip the steamy white liquids inside her breasts.She started to play with her nipples with her left hand and feeling and patting her breasts with the right enjoying the feelings of ecstasy and the sound of the sloshing in her breasts.At this point she also got the feeling from the almost given out t-shirt restricting and covering only the middle of her bean bag sized breasts when the shirt completely ripped apart.She came to the realization that the rapid growth had stopped and the blonde was desperate for more she needed it when the realization that there was a second vial.She looked over to the vial with a desperate look.She drank straight from the vial regardless of the instructions and her breasts swelled at a even greater rate in 2 minutes she grew to the size that could fit a beowolf in each breast.At this point the only thing Xiao long could care about was getting bigger.She was so sensitive that a gust of wind made her feel lost in ecstasy and a warmth.As they grew she couldn\u2019t help but scream out \u201cBigger,BIGGER!!!! *Pant* I need BIGGGER!!!!! *Moan*\u201d Her screams of pleasure and the sloshing of her ever expanding breasts were all that could be heard Yang\u2019s Whale sized chest was taking up all the room except an inch from the door.The walls cracking creaking and everything consumed by the flesh of her chest.<br>\r\nThen the door knob starting to be played with and it hit the doorframe sized nipple as the door was opened and a stream of milk came pouring from the nipple enough came out to fill a pool,not that it was much different since the breasts were constantly spewing gallons of milk every few seconds. The person coming into the room pushed the door open and Blake walked in as much as possible with the few inches of space available in the 95% breast flesh room <br>\r\nYang realized she came In and went back to moaning and panting, Blake didn\u2019t know why but she saw the fountain of milk coming from Yang\u2019s nipples and couldn\u2019t help but want to drink it she had no clue why this felling was coming over her...</span></div></div>",

With the right combination of good genetics, a healthy life style and some DAMN good luck Yang is growing up to be one of the most beautiful women on the planet. Speaking of growing...<br>\r\n\"Come on..ngh..just a little more..*click* Got It!!\" Yang said in triumph as 5 minutes of struggle to put on her bra finally payed off..for about 5 seconds before it burst and went flying across the room.<br>\r\n\"..Damn it not again..\" she huffed in annoyance as this was a common occurrence. So much so that Yang wondered(not for the first time) why she even bothered wearing a bra. Yang had many things about herself she was very proud of. Her gorgeous face with amethyst eyes, her flawless skin with a slight tan, her perfect muscle tone from a lifetime of martial arts training, her thick flowing mane of pure golden hair(touch her hair without her permission and you DIE) just to name a few. But the one thing she hated(if only slightly) about herself was her perfectly round, very soft and HUGE breasts...that just seemed to not know when to stop Growing!!<br>\r\n\"That was a $70 P cup bra you just ruined girls.\" she scolded her breasts as if they were misbehaving children. She glared at them for a minute before sighing\"I love you girls but seriously there is no point in getting so big.\" she said in a more caring voice as she lifted them up. She then looked to her full body mirror for a better look and she noticed that her side boobs were hiding most of her arms and her hands were completely buried under her massive mammaries.<br>\r\n\"It feels like their getting bigger by the day now.\" she said to herself in slight worry.<br>\r\n\"And maybe I'm being paranoid, but sometimes I think I can see and feel them growing.\" she said as she rubs them together and letting out a soft moan.<br>\r\n\"And their getting more sensitive.\" she said softly\"Just how much bigger are they going to get?\" Now isn't that the Million dollar question.<br>\r\nFor almost as long as she can remember Yang has always had the biggest breasts around. She started wearing bra's when she was 10, she had a DD-cup when she was 12 and she passed the legendary 100cm milestone when she was 14. One of the main reasons she trains so hard in martial arts now in days(besides the fact she loves to fight) is to give her the strength, hand eye coordination and balance just to walk straight. But the most important thing to note here is that Yang just turned 16. Which meant that she still had a few more years of growing to do.<br>\r\nThat bra she try to put on earlier was a birthday gift from her dad last week. At the time it fit perfectly, but now was just another on a LONG list of bra's she destroyed.<br>\r\nYang sigh\"Oh well..another day another bra.\"(she is probably the only woman on remnant that can say that unironically) she then looked at her clock to see that it was almost time to head out on her own birthday celebration with a very special someone. <br>\r\nSo with much enthusiasm she put on her best shoes, pants, most loose(but tight on her) tank top and leather jacket to get ready. As she went out the the door to ride on her motorcycle her little sister Ruby cried out\"Say hi to..\"</span></div></div>",

Now you may be wondering \"Jaune Arc!?!? How did that loser score Yang Xiao-Freaking-Long?!\" Well for one thing they had known each other since kindergarten. When they first met Jaune was getting pick on by some Second Graders in a sand box on the school playground. Enraged at the scene and rather eager to put her dad's training to good use Yang charged at bullies and proceeded to pumble one of them in to the ground, but was quickly blindsided and overwhelmed the by other two. Just as they were about to do to her what they did to Jaune if not worse the bullies found their eyes burning as Jaune threw clumps of sand into their faces. This gave Yang the chance to break free and continue her assault.<br>\r\nSeeing as their favorite victim finally found the courage to stand up to them and now had this crazy girl to protect him the bullies decided to flee and never bother Jaune again.\"That's right you punks run!! And if you try this crap again I'll shove my fists up your asses and use you as hand puppets!!\" Yang shouted at them.(quite the mouth on her for 6 year old huh) She then looked to Jaune who had a black eye and dirt all over his face. Yang gave him wide bright grin that showed one of her front teeth was missing.<br>\r\n\"Thanks for your help back there. Even though I totally could have taken them myself you really helped.\" she said with confidence. Jaune just looked at the ground rubbing his arm rather timidly.<br>\r\n\"Not really. You're the one who fought them off. I didn't really do much..\" he said quietly. Yang puffed her cheeks in a pout before walking up to him and bopping him on the head.<br>\r\n\"Oww..why did yo-\" \"Hey you're a man aren't you?\" Yang interrupted. Jaune blinked in confusion.\"Yes?\" <br>\r\n\"Then take pride in yourself!\" she stated boldly\"You just helped a pretty girl kick some ass and stood up to guys almost twice as big as you. I'd say that's something to be proud of. Don't you?\" she finished with her bright grin returning. All Jaune could do was stare at her in awe as her words touched his heart and in that moment the sun was at just right angle to make her hair shine so much it seemed to glow.<br>\r\n\"Yeah..a pretty girl..\" he said completely enchanted.\"Hm?\" Yang tilted her head slightly confused. Jaune snapped out of his trance\"I-I-I mean you're very pretty and.. I-I-I mean I'm proud of yo-me-I-I m-mean-\" Jaune was saved from further embarrassment as Yang put a finger on his lips\"Don't worry I know what you meant.\" she gave him knowing smile and wink. She then removed her finger from his lips and left her hand out for a handshake\"My name is Yang Xaio Long. What's yours?\" Jaune took her hand and gave it a firm shake saying\"Jaune. Jaune Arc.\" And they had been best friends ever since. Yang was always encouraging Jaune to try new things and be more confident in himself. She even started to teach him what she knew about martial arts so he could defend himself when she wasn't around. While Jaune was always there to make sure Yang didn't get into too much trouble and cheer her up whenever she was having a bad day. Plus he was one of the few people who found her puns funny(only slightly). For the longest time Jaune had a huge crush on Yang and she knew about it(he was terrible at hiding it). And while Yang really liked him too she didn't like him in \"that\" way..until one day.<br>\r\nYang(age 13) was sparing with a new member of the Dojo at school with Jaune watching from the sidelines cheering her on as always. Now normally she would dominating the match as she was one of the best fighters in the Dojo, years of training with her dad more then paying off. But that wasn't the case this time as one this new girl Cinder Fall was just as good as her if not better. And two her breasts had been going through another growth spurt(her cup size was almost F) so she was a little off balance. A fact that Cinder noticed and was more than happy to take advantage of. Cinder poked and prodded at Yang's temper calling her\"a fat cow\" or \"slut\" make her angrier and more off balance then before until Yang reached her breaking point and charge with a wild haymaker leaving her wide open for Cinder to sweep kick Yang causing her to fall face first onto the mat and slid across it a couple of inches causing the top of her gi open up. Yang pick herself up to have another go at the bitch when \"Oh my! Miss Xaio Long how indecent of you.\" Cinder said in fake surprise as she pointed at Yang's open top. Yang looked down to see that her breasts were bare for all to see.\"Ahh!!\" she exclaimed as she frantically covered herself. \"Are they too much for you? Or can just not help but exposing yourself to everyone you slut?\" Cinder gave a cruel chuckle at Yang's embarrassment before out of nowhere a fist filled with righteous fury slammed into her face causing her to fly across the room. Yang looked up to see that the fist belonged to her best friend Jaune Arc as he looked at Cinder with eyes full of wrath.\"The only slut I see here is you!! Insult Yang again and I'll gut you like a fish and use you entrails as a fucking jump rope!!\" he roared at the bitch as she pick herself off the floor wiping the blood from her lip.(damn Jaune has got a mouth on him now too)<br>\r\n\"Enough!!\" shouted the Sensei of the Dojo Glynda Goodwitch \"Everyone pack up your gear and leave early for the day. Miss Fall your behavior is most unbecoming of a martial artist.\" she addressed her new student with much disappointment \"If you do not show proper respect to your fellow students then will have to discipline you. Am I clear?\" Cinder gave a half hearted \" ..yes sensei.. \" before heading off to the changing room. Glynda shook her head and Yang as she was back on her feet.<br>\r\n\" Miss Xaio Long do try to keep your anger in check. If used properly anger can be your best weapon, but if not it becomes your enemies best weapon.\" Taking her sensei's words of wisdom to heart Yang gave her slight bow in respect. Glynda then looked to Jaune as he regained his composure \"And Mr. Arc\" he stood at attention with a worried look on his as felt that he was in trouble, but his fear was unfounded as Glynda gave him a smirk and said \"Nice right hook.\" before heading out herself.<br>\r\nJaune breathed a sigh of relief as turned to face Yang \"Are you al-\" he was interrupted by Yang giving him a heartfelt kiss. After a few seconds Yang broke the kiss and said with pride\" Seeing you punch that bitch in the face was the hottest thing I had ever seen!\" Jaune gave her a confident smirk and said \"What can I say? I had a good teacher.\" Yang had a smirk of her own \"Damn right you did.\" And they had been happily dating ever since.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yang was happily reminiscing about how she and Jaune got together as she pulled up to Jaune's house to pick him up. She couldn't wait for this date not just because she loved spending time with her boyfriend, but because she had something very special planned for them both at the end. She honked her horn to let Jaune know she was here and ready to go. Jaune stepped out not a minute later dressed for a night on the town with a warm smile for his girlfriend.<br>\r\n\"Hey there sunshine.\" Jaune said as he pulled Yang in for a heartfelt hug. <br>\r\n\"Hey yourself lover-boy.\" Yang responded with a passionate kiss which Jaune happily returned. The kiss lasted until they both needed to breath again and after a minute of catching their breath and being lost in each others eyes Yang then gave her lover a coy smirk.<br>\r\n\"Don't forget to say hi to the girls.\" she said playfully as she looked down on her enormous bosom that smushed against Jaune's chest even though they stood almost a foot from each other. Jaune had a smirk of his own as he leaned forward until his face was buried into her vast cleavage. Her breasts were almost twice as big as his head so Yang almost lost sight of him as rubbed face deep in her ever growing treasures. Jaune blew a raspberry into her cleavage causing Yang to burst out laughing.<br>\r\n\"You asshole!!\" she exclaimed in laughter and giving him a playful shove. Jaune simply smirked at her with smug satisfaction then went back to basking his glorious privilege of being the only man who can stare and touch his girlfriends breasts anytime and anywhere. He the noticed something interesting.<br>\r\n\"Busted another bra honey?\" he said casually.<br>\r\n\"Yep.\" she sigh \"And I really like that bra. I was hoping that it would last longer.\" she pouted.<br>\r\n\"Damn. And it only lasted a week too. I think that's a new record.\" he said thoughtfully.(it's amazing how they can talk about Yang breasts getting bigger like they're talking about the weather huh) <br>\r\n\"Six days actually.\" she corrected him. Jaune blinked in surprise.<br>\r\n\"Really? huh\" he took it in stride. But his comment caused Yang's worries from earlier to resurface. Ever since her breasts started growing she had been keeping a close eye on the rate of her growth. And she noticed that as the years went by the speed in which she went through new bra's had been increasing. And Jaune was right, the last bra she had(O-cup) only lasted 18 days. Which meant that her growth spurts were getting stronger and more frequent.<br>\r\n{If these things don't stop growing sooner or later I'm literally going to be a walking pair of boobs! And Jaune would never marry or have kids with me then!} that thought terrified her. Yang loved Jaune with all her heart. Her dream was to marry him and have a family with him..a big one..bigger then his actually.(including him that's 8 kids by the way) So she summoned all her courage and willpower to ask him the question that she had been meaning to ask him for a while now.<br>\r\n\"Hey Jaune..you love me right..?\" she asked timidly. Hearing her soft voice and seeing her uncharacteristically shy demeanor Jaune grew very worried.<br>\r\n\"Of course I do sunshine.\" he answered sincerely cupping her cheek with tender care. Yang sigh in bliss as she leaned into his warm palm.<br>\r\n\"Why would you think otherwise?\" he asked with much concern.<br>\r\n His reassurance and gentle touch helped calm her nerves. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath to help her finish baring her soul.<br>\r\n\"It's..it's my breasts.\"<br>\r\nJaune tilted his head in confusion. \"What about them?\" Yang gave her dense boyfriend a flat look.<br>\r\n\"Jaune..\" she said in the most unamused voice ever. It took a minute before it dawned on him.<br>\r\n\"Ooohhh! So their getting bigger again.\" he shrugged \"So what? They get bigger all the time.\" he said like it was the most obvious thing in the world. <br>\r\nYang let out a slight chuckle and shook her head in disbelief at what her idiot of a boyfriend just said.<br>\r\n\"Jaune did you even hear what you just said?\" she asked desperate to get through his thick skull.<br>\r\n\"I'm 16 and I have quite possibly have the biggest breasts on the planet. I know I play it up like it's no big deal and while it IS pretty awesome the reality is that if these things get any bigger then I'm not going to be able to live a real life with you!\" tears started to pour down her eyes as she continued to vent all her pent up feelings.\"I won't be able to leave the house. I won't be able to get a job besides being a stripper or hooters. I probably won't even be able to have kids because my breasts would squish my belly!\" she was getting hysterical as her fears started to overwhelm her. \"People will laugh a you for being with a circus freak like me!! And-\" her panic was stopped by Jaune gently but firmly cupping both of her cheeks and kissing her. Giving her some time to calm down Jaune broke the kiss, wiped away her tears with his thumbs and stared straight into her eyes with a look of pure love and devotion.<br>\r\n\"Now you listen to me Yang Xaio Long.\" Jaune said in a calm but powerful voice that caused Yang's heart to hammer in her rib cage and her knees to weaken.<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter how big your breasts are or how big there going to get. It doesn't matter what other people say or think about us. It doesn't matter what life throws at us. I Love You. I love you with every fiber of my being. I want to marry you someday. I want to have an army of kids with you. I want to spend every moment (good and bad) of my life with you. And nothing will EVER change that.\" he meant every word.<br>\r\nNew tears poured from Yang's eyes as the love of her life finished his heartfelt speech.<br>\r\n\"Really? Even if they grow bigger then my body you will still be with me?\" she asked already knowing his answer but wanted to hear it anyway. He nodded firmly.<br>\r\n\"Even then.\"<br>\r\n\"Bigger than Remnant?\" \"Even then.\"<br>\r\n\"Bigger than the universe?\" \"Even then.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh Jaune..\" <br>\r\nThey then shared another kiss, deeper and full of more love and passion then all that came before as it felt like their very souls were now linked. After what seemed like eternity they broke the kiss to breath in some very needed air. Jaune then raised an eyebrow in amusement.<br>\r\n\"Bigger then your body, Remnant or the universe?\" he asked eager to know were she got such a silly(but hot) idea from. Yang blushed and gave a sheepish laugh and smile scratching the back of her head. <br>\r\n\"I may have had a few nightmares about that actually happening hehehe.\" Jaune had a naughty smirk on his face as he playfully groped her breasts causing her to moan in surprise.<br>\r\n\"Nightmare? That sounds like a dream come true to me.\" Yang punched him in the ribs playfully in retaliation.<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up you ass!\" they shared a laugh for a minute before Yang hopped back onto her bike.\"Now get on lover-boy we've got a date to get to.\" Jaune happily obeyed. <br>\r\nThe young lovebirds then spent the rest of the day doing just about everything a couple can do on a date. Lunch at a nice restaurant, played games at the arcade, watched a movie, singing and dancing at karaoke the whole nine yards. They had the time of their lives until finally a few hours after sunset the lovers found themselves in a room at a love hotel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>We now find our young lovebirds on a huge heart shaped bed in the room they had rented for the weekend. Jaune was laying on his back smiling at the breathtaking sight before him. Yang saddled his hips in the cowboy position ready to finally become one with her true love. Ever since they had started dating they had only done foreplay, making out and the occasional blowjob. They were originally going to save themselves for their wedding night, but after baring their souls to each other and the wonderful date they figured \"Why wait?\" Yang took hold of Jaune's 10 inch long and 3 inch thick cock and was about slide it into her soaking wet pussy when her lover asked in a gentle voice \"Yang are you sure you're ready for this?\" Yang simply smiled. His concern was touching but unnecessary.<br>\r\n\"I have never been more ready for anything in my life.\" she said sincerely as a coy smirk went across her face and she lifted her heavy breasts giving them a sexy jiggle. \"I think the real question is..can you handle this much woman?\" Jaune rose to the challenge by firmly grasping her enormous bosom with a smirk of his own.<br>\r\n\"You better believe it sunshine.\" he stated boldly as his hands sank deep into her soft naughty pillows. Yang let out moans of pleasure as he continued to knead her breasts like a professional chef with two huge balls of dough. Even with after all these years of dating Yang and seeing her growth first hand their sheer size never seized to amaze him.<br>\r\n\"I meant what I said earlier you know.\" he said wanting to ease any fear his love had left \"It doesn't matter if you never stop growing. I'll never stop loving you.\"<br>\r\nMore tears of joy threatened to leave her eyes as looked down at her soulmate with a smile warmer then the sun.\"I know.\" and with that Yang gently lowered herself until she felt the tip of his cock enter her. \"AH!! Oh God!\" she gritted her teeth as she lowered herself further until her pussy was filled up to her womb with Jaune's cock.<br>\r\n\"AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!\" she screamed in pain and pleasure as a little blood leaked out from her virginity being taken. She breathed heavily as she gently rubbed her belly\" *pant pant* It's so big..*pant*..It's piercing my womb..\" the tears she was holding back flowed down her cheeks causing Jaune to worry if she was in too much pain.<br>\r\n\"Yang are yo-\" he was interrupted by Yang softly kissing him. When the kiss ended all Jaune could see on her face was pure happiness.<br>\r\n\"We are finally one Jaune.\" she said with a voice full of bliss. For a few minutes they laid together sharing the moment of their union wanting to remember this moment forever. Then Yang's smile morphed into a smirk \"Now then lover-boy..give it to me. Don't. Hold. Back.\" He didn't.<br>\r\nFor 13 hours they made love in every way they could before exhaustion finally caught up with them. Little do they know, but as the lovers laid together in wistful bliss Yang's breasts slowly but surely started getting even bigger. With all the hormones released from the hours of mind blowing sex and the \"nutrients\" Yang ingested was causing all sorts of chain reactions in her body that seem to be perfectly designed to make her breasts as big as possible. Every hour another centimeter was added to her bust, you could almost hear them growing. Yang felt them grow as she slept it was just like in her nightmares only this time it was real. And yet she wasn't scared.<br>\r\nBecause this time Jaune was also there in her dreams. Even as her breasts seemed to grow on forever he was right there beside her just like he promised. <br>\r\nSo as Yang woke up the next morning to see her magnificent mammaries now reaching S-cup levels she had no fear because her love was right there beside her looking at her like she was a goddess. <br>\r\n\"It looks like the girls grew overnight\" she said in sultry voice.\"You know I think I have a theory as to why they keep growing.\"<br>\r\n\"Besides puberty?\" Janue said with a playful smirk. Yang giggled before softly punching him on the shoulder.<br>\r\n\"Quiet you and just listen.\" Jaune raised his hand in surrender \"Alright alright.\" Yang thought for a second as to how to explain her rather crazy theory \"It's you Jaune.\"<br>\r\n\"...Huh?\"(Jaune.exe has stop working)<br>\r\n\"Well to be more specific it's my love for you.\" she elaborated. Jaune just scratched his head in utter puzzlement \"You lost me.\"<br>\r\n\"Okay so here's the thing. You know that I've been keeping track of how much they been growing right?\" she asked Jaune nodded. \"So when they first started I was flat like everyone else and then BAM! I had boobs.\" Jaune chuckled \"What?\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry it's just hard to remember that you were ever flat hehehe.\" Yang was not amused \"Shutting up.\"(wise choice)<br>\r\n\"Anyway..that was my first and strongest growth spurt since that was when puberty kicked in. But when reached I 100cm they started to slow down even stop for a while. But then we got really lovey dovey, you started to touch them all the time and then they grew like crazy again. You see were I'm going with this?\"<br>\r\n\"Iii..guess?\" was all he could say.<br>\r\n\"I have also heard rumors that when a woman's in love, like REALLY in love and her breasts are touched by the man she loves they grow.\" She then cupped her breast and started bouncing them \"And considering I've gone up a few cup sizes after we did a WHOOOLE LOT of loving last night I'd say that is most definitely true in my case.\" This reminded Jaune that they didn't use any protection.<br>\r\n\"Yang I-\" she put a finger to his lips \"Ssshh I know.\" Yang had a warm knowing smile of her face as she rubbed her (for now) flat belly affectionately \"You will take responsibility. You will marry me so our baby won't be born out of wedlock. You will work every god given hour to take care of me and our baby. I know. And I love you so much for it.\"<br>\r\nJaune was amazed that she seemed to read his mind before shaking his head with a chuckle.\"You know me so well. And I love you more for it my sunshine.\"<br>\r\nThe lovebirds then had a big breakfast and called their families to tell them the news of them having a baby and getting married soon. Normally such big news at such a young age would raise a lot of concern but they were actually very supportive and happy for them. Jaune's family and Yang's dad knew that their love was pure and that they would take care other no matter what. Ruby was especially happy that she was going to be an auntie.(they could hear her squeals of joy from here)<br>\r\nSo with all that out the way Yang then looked to her future hubby with a very hungry stare. \"All of this baby talk reminds me of something important.\" Jaune had a pretty good idea of were this was going and was loving it.\"Oh yeah? What?\" he teased. Yang rubbed her belly again in slow suggestive circles with both hands with a smug grin \"Weelll..now that I have your baby growing inside me that means..\" her hands then cupped her breast and gently squeezed them as lifted them up give them both a tender kiss \"That these babies going to be making LOTS of warm milk.\" she said in a very sultry voice and a teasing wink. Jaune's boner shot up so fast that when it slapped his abs it hurt a little and looked even bigger and thicker then before. Something Yang noticed as she continued to toy with her bosom \"Mmm..you like that don't you daddy..the thought of my evergrowing boobies swelling up with milk like a cow..mmm..moo..\"she was getting so lost in the fantasy that she didn't notice that was actually happening. When her body found out it was pregnant her specialized anatomy designed for none stop growth kicked into high gear. Her breast started to heat up as her mammary glands expanded to make room for the flood of milk that was coming.\"AHH!! I could store whole gallons in these bad girls!! More then enough to feed an army of kids like you wanted!! OH GOD YEESS!!!\" All Jaune could do was stare in awe as his fiance desperately squeezed and pulled on her nipples as if she trying to make milk come out. The pressure and pleasure built up in Yang's breasts until finally.<br>\r\n\"MMMMMOOOOOO!!!!!\" she screamed in nirvana as small jets of milk shot out of her nipples onto Jaune's face. Her legs gave up on her and fell back on to the bed breathing heavy. Jaune sat there stunned at what just happened. He absentmindedly licked some of the on his lips \"Delicious..\" he whispered to himself.<br>\r\n\"Glad you like it.\" Yang said breathlessly as she sat back to look at her love with heart shaped pupils in her eyes \"That pretty much confirms it..I'm your baby mama!\" she said in delight as she opened up her legs spread eagle \"Now come here daddy..mama needs some more loving!\"<br>\r\nOh so it's loving she wants huh..well then Jaune was more then to oblige \"YES MA'AM!!\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The blonde bombshell huffed as a thin trail of sweat rolled down her forehead, her muscles coiled with the exertion, tensing as she the bar was lifted until reaching her neck, only to be lowered down once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the physically strongest member of Team RWBY, Yang was no stranger to working out, but lately she felt her progress was not what she hoped for, as in several fights she had found herself in a pitch and required of her Semblance to take rescue her. Yang remembered her father's, and the teacher's, multiple instructions on not rellying on their Semblance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, with that in mind, Yang prepared her a new workout rutine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAura made muscle mass meaningless with its ability to strengthen the body's endurance and power, but its capacity to do so was proportional to the user's own physical fitness. IE; Someone with stronger muscles could increase their strength through Aura with greater efficency than someone with a less fit body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo sum it up; If she made her muscles bigger then she would kick and even greater ammount of ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang couldn't help but grin mid rep, imagening biceps worthy of her fighting style, and maybe her overall body being much more muscular too. Why not? She already had a pretty nice abdominal definition, might as well go for the whole set. After all, she didn't think muscles on a lady weren't unattractive, in fact, watching those motivational posters with those fitness girls sporting those big muscles was kinda sexy. There was an allure to having that strength<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGood thing Beacon had top of the line training equipment; Weights enhanced with gravity dust that could increase their weight on a vocal command, endurance machines which could adapt to the user's progress, that sort of thing<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing the rep, Yang set the bar back on its rack and let out a long breath. Her yellow workout t-shirt, with the words 'I Burn' written with big black letters, clung tightly to her sweating form, her black workout shorts hugged her nicely defined glutes, showing off her long shapely legs. She walked foward to one of the big mirrors on the wall, her long yellow hair helf up in a high ponytail swaying behind her as she walked, and took a good look at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing her left hand on her hip and lifting her right arm, Yang flexed her bicep and watched as a small mound rose beneath the sleeve, the definition noticeable and the size showing a good gain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang for her part...</span></div></div>",

Normally serene as a landscape painting, a small section of the forest shook &amp; rattled across the vista, leaves flying, trees falling, ruining the serene, static image.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>RATATATATATATAT</b></i>\" In the center of the forest's action, the barrel of Gianduja rotated, expelling high-velocity Dust bullets that exploded on impact against the trunks of the forest trees, causing them to fall to pieces, a black phantom darting from each wooden corpse as it fell to tatters. Coco rotated in place at a steady pace, matching the Geist as it tried to flee, firing into whatever it tried to possess until it was left with no options to run. Tree by tree burst at the combination of Coco's Semblance &amp; her bullets, sending a haze of wooden dust &amp; dirt particles everywhere, creating a coffee-colored fog of war befitting of her team name; the Geist would eventually have nowhere to go, and her gun would impact against its bony mask, sending the Grimm to the great beyond - mission complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"We're done with the stragglers. Have you finished the Geist yet, Coco?\"</i> The thoughts of her teammate, Fox, rang in Coco's mind - a telepathy channel used to keep the team together, even when separated, constantly updating one another on their Grimm quarry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Not yet,\"</i> she replied, <i>\"Little sucker's really moving around fast. Start coming towards the cloud of dust, guys, one of you might be able to get it on its next round.\"</i> The Geist kept making circles around Coco, trying to move from tree to tree for some form of a body to strike back, but the fashionista wasn't having it, she put all of her Hype into each &amp; every round to turn the mighty oaks to mere woodchips upon immediate impact - she was almost toying with it in a sense. \"Ah, ah, ah,\" she mocked, \"Those suits are <i>far</i> out of your value, stud.\" Coco was having fun messing with the Geist on some level, taking joy in blowing up the wilderness, but it had to come to an end at some point, else her professors would be mad at her for defacing one of Remnant's most beautiful forests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Geist couldn't agree more, this had to end. It changed its trajectory, coming in closer towards Coco, risking the bullet hailstorm - it darted towards a couple mid-sized rocks, ones that could do some damage if possessed, but failed to dash quickly enough as it exploded into a gray mist of particles. The Geist wasn't deterred, it dashed towards more stones, closer and closer to Coco, which she quickly destroyed with her gun. The visibility was getting poor at this point, Coco could barely see through the haze as is with her sunglasses, it didn't help the cloud was getting larger &amp; closer to her the more she fired. <i>\"What's it doing? Is it trying to make a tornado or something to possess? I can't see with this- wait a second...\"</i> Coco slowed her firing rate for a moment, taking a moment to think - a wry smile formed on her lips as she figured out the Geist's gambit. She slowly released her finger from the trigger and begun to back up, letting her gun change back to its basic purse form, feigning huffing in a panic - if her intuition was right, the Geist would be coming for her any moment now. As if on cue, a bright yellow light came from behind Coco's field of view - the Geist charged at her with its claws, ready to slice her in two...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Geist felt the weight of Gianduja's purse format press directly into its mask, cracking it in multiple places. The phantasm shrieked in pain and fumbled against the dirt floor, its body dissipating into a black mist. Coco swung her purse over her shoulder and chuckled - those meditation &amp; sensory exercises Yatsuhashi &amp; Fox taught her really paid off. Coco backed up towards where the Geist disappeared, her upper body feeling sore from all the twisting &amp; arm-movement to chase the Geist; she moved her back against a soft, tall forest mushroom, one strange oddity of nature in Forever Fall, and leaned back into it, letting the coziness soothe her muscles. <i>\"The Geist is down.\"</i> Coco shot out through Fox's channel. <i>\"Mission complete.\"</i> Coco sunk to the ground and sat down, she was really going to need a hot bath &amp; nap when she got back to Beacon; CFVY's team leader was quite thankful for the therapeutic shifting the mushroom was doing on her back, almost like a massage chair...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, why's this moving so much?\" Coco tilted her head upwards, and from behind the hem of her shades, she came eye-to-eye with a few surviving sections of the Geist's mask, eye glowing gold in rage. Coco tried to dart upwards, but in an act of revenge, the Geist shook, spraying an orange pollen around its new body, making a new cloud of particles where the old one just began to disperse. Coco coughed in a panic, swinging Gianduja around as she backed up - her eyes teared up and she couldn't see through the stinging sensation, the Geist could've been primed to attack for all she knew. Indeed, it was - a root of the mushroom tore from the ground, and was primed to strike Coco across the face...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coco!\" a female voice with a heavy accent cried from above. The Geist tried to turn and react, but was powerless as a brown-haired girl with rabbit ears fell from the sky, splitting the mushroom &amp; mask in half with a translucent scythe. The Geist let out one final, pathetic cry as the bunny-girl swung the scythe around, spinning on her toes in a kneeling position - the Grimm's black mist &amp; orange pollen dissipated, and as the sky cleared, so did the girl's weapon, disappearing into shining particles of Dust. The girl, the rabbit Faunus Velvet, leapt to her feet and ran towards her team leader, wrapping her arms around the beret-wearing girl for support. \"Coco! Are you okay?! What was that orange stuff it shot?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, V.\" Coco coughed out, \"It was just mushroom spores, it stings a bit, but it's nothing that the medical room at Beacon can't deal with.\" As Coco spoke, she continued to cough and clear her throat mid-sentence, rubbing her eyes with her free hand to clear the tears. Coco was putting on a brave front, but Velvet was still concerned for her leader - she looked at the remains of the mushroom the Geist once possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno,\" she replied, \"I've never seen a mushroom that large before, let alone that shape or color. It might be poisonous for all we know...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine, Velvet, really.\" Coco tried to stand up straight, but found herself fidgeting a little bit, rubbing her hands across her upper body, a chilly sensation pulsing through her muscles. Despite the internal struggle, Coco continued to proclaim she was fine, standing erect and fixing her sunglasses on her face. \"Let's just get in contact with Fox &amp; Yatsu, I want to get home before whatever that was sets into my clothes...\" Velvet looked down her team leader one more time, feeling a little concerned as she watched Coco keep rubbing her hands against her shoulders, like something was a matter with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Fox? Yatsu? It's Velvet, I've retrieved Coco. The Geist is dead, and all other Grimm should be exterminated here for now.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Is Coco alright?\"</i> Fox's voice rang back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"She says she is, but she was exposed to these spores from a strange mushroom the Geist possessed. We need to get her back to Beacon immediately.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Got it. Head north to the forest clearing, we'll rendezvous there while Yatsu &amp; I hail a helicopter.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Roger.\"</i> With the communication line ceased, Velvet got under Coco's left arm and wrapped it around her neck, carrying Coco against her back as the fashionable young woman shuddered. \"Come on now, Coco, let's get you back in bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"T-Thanks, V. But slow down a bit, I have a headache, and- ack!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ack?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my boots, something's up with them. Damn, I thought these things would've at least lasted me until the end of my time here. I'll have to go get a new pair made...\" Coco shivered as if she was chilly, or her body was fighting off some sort of infection, but to the leader of Team CFVY, Coco was blissfully unaware of the reaction the frenzied spores were having on her body...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Velvet was so sick of Cardin Winchester. He was nothing more than a bully and an oppressor. She just so happen to have the misfortune of being his favorite target. Well... Maybe not his favorite, he did seem to enjoy giving that Jaune boy a hard time. But that was beside the point, he was just an all around jerk that got off on making everyone else miserable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason he had singled her out however, was due to her status as a faunus. Because she was born with rabbit ears on her head, he had taken it upon himself to be as much of an ass as possible. She'd done nothing to him, she'd never even exchanged a simple greeting with him. Yet he still felt the need to remind her that he was someone she should watch out for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet wasn't a mean girl, in fact most people who knew her well enough could tell she didn't have a single mean bone in her body. Even when her teammates had offered to rough up the ignorant boy, she talked them down. Her leader Coco wasn't happy, but in the end she and the rest of team CVFY could only respect Velvet's decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, even the kindest of people can only be pushed so far. Cardin had taken her kindness for weakness, a mistake most people are taught not to make. Because Velvet didn't fight back, the leader of team CRDL thought he could do whatever he pleased to her without any repercussions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWrong!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to him, he had finally managed to due the near impossible. Make. Velvet. Angry! He had managed to achieve this great feat during lunch when he had committed the greatest sin against her. He'd upgraded from simple taunts and name calling to physical assault. Cardin Winchester made the biggest mistake of his short life when he grabbed her ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven when she begged him to stop, he only laughed in her face. He pulled and pulled until he managed to make her cry in front o the whole cafeteria. It didn't matter to him that he hurt and embarrassed her. It only served to make him feel superior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat's when Velvet knew she finally had enough! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin needed to be taught a lesson. The teachers clearly weren't going to give it to him! So it was all down to her to teach him a lesson he'd never forget. For the first time in her life, Velvet was going to entertain the idea of an eye for an eye. She was going to get even. She was going to make Cardin understand what it felt like to be small... Literally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took weeks of planning, but she finally had everything she needed to get her revenge. Unfortunately for the rest of team CFVY, they weren't invited to the party. That extended to the rest of team CRDL as well. It would be just her and her long time oppressor. Velvet lost track of how long she spent shadowing Cardin. Learning his patterns and mannerism. At this point she felt like she knew her bully better than her own teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat didn't matter though, today was the day she'd brake Cardin Winchester. Everything was set up smoothly. First she'd lure Cardin away, deep into the Emerald Forest where no cameras would see them, and no scroll signal could reach the academy. Next she'd bust out her secret weapon. She did feel guilty about stealing it from the Schnee girl, but what she didn't know wouldn't hurt her. Then... The fun would begin. All Velvet had to do was wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about an hour of waiting a familiar voice came calling through the Emerald Forest. \"Hello!? Nikos!? You out here!? I got your text!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet couldn't help but giggle from behind her hiding spot. As if the 'invincible girl' would ever be interested in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin heard the rustling of a nearby bush and smirked. \"Hey babe! That you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was showtime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of being greeted by the idol of Beacon Academy, he was greeted by the rabbit of Vale. \"What are you doing here flopsy?\" he asked in annoyance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet merely smiled. \"Who? Me? I called you here. Did you really think you were coming here to see Pyrrha? You're not her type.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin growled in anger, he'd been duped. He quickly regained his composure however and gave the brunette a cocky grin. \"So you called me out here? All by yourself? No teammates? That wasn't very smart.\" Yes he came unarmed like the text said, but he didn't need a mace to put this animal in her place. \"I guess I'm gonna have to teach you another lesson, flopsy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to his surprise, the rabbit didn't look worried or scared at all. In fact she was unnervingly calm. Velvet simply shook her head and stared back at her school bully who had yet grasp the severity of his situation. \"You know I'm a year ahead of you correct. That makes me your upperclassmen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your point?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As an upperclassmen it's my duty to look out for underclassmen. So now I'm going to educate you. I'm going to learn you a lesson in respect.\" Velvet declared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin simply cracked his knuckles. \"I've heard enough out of you. Now it's go time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I couldn't agree more.\" Velvet then pulled a vial of pitch black dust from behind her back. \"Now I'll educate you.\" Velvet smashed the dust vial on the ground beneath her and Cardin could only look on in confusion as one of his favorite puppies to kick was engulfed by the dark mist. All he could hear was the sound of Velvets frantic coughs and soon broke out in hysterical laughter. He didn't need to do a damn thing. The stupid animal would defeat herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis laughter soon halted when another sound reached his ear. The sound if something tearing. It was then he noticed the coughing ceased and instead the tearing sound continued on. Just what was happening in that mist?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin quickly wished he didn't know. Deep inside the mist Velvet had managed to stop coughing but it still felt as if her lungs were on fire. Honestly her whole body felt as if it was heating up. Then she felt a tingling sensation deep within her gut. The first thing she felt was the tightness of her school uniform on her body. She could feel the very fabric holding it together being strained to the limit as her body began to expand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fabric began to tear in all sorts of places and she could feel her shoes instantly give out as they were torn asunder. Her uniform tore completely now, leaving her as bare as the day she entered the world. Thankfully she thought to not wear any underwear in preparation for today. She could soon see over the black mist as everything around her seemed to move farther and farther away. She just kept climbing and climbing until the trees could barely reach her knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin stood wide-eyed, mouth agape at the sight. That puny little rabbit faunus just underwent one hell of a growth spurt. When she finally did stop growing, Cardin for the first time in his life felt a sense of real fear around the rabbit faunus. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. I didn't think I'd get this big.\" Velvet said in awe of her new size. She could see over every tree and almost over the mountains. As she looked around marveling at the view, a small little 'bug' came into her field of vision. That bug was none other the whimpering form of Cardin Winchester who had fallen flat on his backside. That was when she remembered what she was here for. \"So tell me!\" her voice boomed. \"How does it feel to be so small?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin couldn't answer, he was far to scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now then! Let the lesson begin.\"</span></div></div>",

One minute flopsy was miniscule and the next she'd grown into a giant. It was too much for his tiny mind to handle. His fight or flight instincts took over and flight seemed to win out. Cardin scrambled to his feet and began to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeacon! All he had to do was make it back to school and he'd be home free. The teachers could deal with this monster. That was the plan. Too bad no plan survives first contact with the enemy. Cardin didn't get very far before a giant bare foot cut off his escape route. He slammed into it hard and was sent sprawling to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going somewhere?\" Velvet asked with barely hidden amusement. She couldn't believe how easy it was to stop her bully dead in his tracks. She didn't really have to do anything except take a step forward. Seeing him fall back the way he did gave her a warm feeling in her chest. Was this how Cardin felt when he messed with her?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe downed leader of team CRDL quick shook off the cobwebs and got to hi feet again. He looked up a the giant foot which to him seemed as big as a bullhead. Fear tore through him as he tried to make a break for it yet again. Velvet saw this and cut off his escape for the second time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time that day, Cardin was sent crashing to the ground by giving Velvet's foot a face high five. Instead of getting right back up, Cardin propped himself up on his elbows and watched as the giant rabbit faunus giggled as his expense. A part of him felt angry, but the more rational part of his mind felt terrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet saw her pray wasn't attempting to escape again and took this as her que to move things along. She knelt down to her 'bug' of a bully and asked him with hard eyes, \"Are you going to try and escape again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took everything he had not to piss his pants. \"N-no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good!\" Velvet smiled. \"If you did I would've caught you, you know. You wouldn't want that because at your size you look mighty tasty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin blanched when he heard that. He didn't want to become some rabbit's dinner. \"P-please don't eat me! I'm sorry, okay?! I am so, so sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's really sweet and mature of you to apologize, Cardin. It's just a shame I don't forgive you.\" Velvet answered. She really didn't either. He could apologize from now until she graduated from the academy and she still wouldn't accept his apology. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin felt his heart sink. \"Please just let me go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you let me go when you pulled my ears at the cafeteria or when I tried to walk away when you hurled slurs my way?\" Velvet said with righteous anger boiling to the surface. \"No you didn't! You treat others how you want to be treated and it's high time I taught you your actions have consequences!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet took a seat in front of Cardin. A simple action for her that caused a miniature earthquake for him. His eyes soon went wide when the giantess extended her foot towards him. Was she going to crush him flat?! The smaller boy began to whimper but stopped when he soon realized that wasn't the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ever since you arrived here in Beacon Academy you've gone out of your way to target me and make me feel lessor. Well it's my turn to feel superior and for you to feel lessor. You, Cardin Winchester, are going to massage my feet. Today you are not a huntsman in training or even a human being. Today you are a 'toy' and nothing more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin's mind could barely process what was happening now. Velvet just told him he was a toy and he was to massage her feet. What?! She couldn't be serious, right? He looked at the massive foot and toes presented before him and winced. She'd flatten him. He needed to get away, but all his attempts so far have been futile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what I-if I refuse?\" he dared to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have a choice!\" Velvet said firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now bow and get to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

This seemed to appease the giant rabbit faunus and she eagerly awaited for her bully to service her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orange-haired could feel his fear and nervousness rise to an all time high as he cautiously made his way closer to Velvet's giant digits. They were slightly taller than he was and the sight truly put into perspective how small he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please do hurry up Cardin, you wouldn't want me to get bored.\" Velvet lightly threatened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin got the message loud and clear. The giant toes of the vengeful huntress in training began to scrunch, signaling him to get a move on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader of team CRDL did just that and carefully put hand to Velvet's big toe. Surprisingly enough her skin was silky smooth and ridiculously soft. The only thing that ruined the rather bizarre moment was the smell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet's foot had the distinct stench of sweat and coconut lotion. If she were still her old 5'6\" self then the smell wouldn't have even been noticeable. But at her new stature then odor merely grew in strength.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin hated it, but chose not to comment out of fear of being punished. Honestly, being in rabbit's presence now reminded him of the time he and his team got on professor Goodwitch's bad side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to make situation any worse, the average sized teen got to work massage the toe. Again, the skin was surprisingly soft against his own. That coconut lotion stuff must be something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet on her part hummed in amusement. She could just barely feel Cardin's tiny hands against her toe. She was far too big for him to really do anything, but it was the dominance she held over him that mattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is pathetic.\" Velvet teased with mock annoyance. \"I can barely feel your hands again my skin. Press harder before I decide to just crush you outright.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reaction was instantaneous as her fellow academy student began to press harder. Surprisingly enough she actually began to feel it. Perhaps he just need a good threat to make him work harder? Why he hadn't earlier baffled her. Her did have muscles after all. Her was literally built like a brick-shithouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile down below Cardin was massaging like his life depended on it. In a way it kind of did. He'd never given a massage before, let alone to girl the side of a small mountain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to press harder, squeeze harder. If she didn't feel him working hard then she'd know he was half-assing the job. And that meant nothing good for him. How could he have let himself be reduced to a mere foot servant? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis father would be so disappointed in him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faster.\" Velvet ordered. She was actually starting to enjoy this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine.\" Cardin seethed under his breath and worked his hands fasters. Thank goodness he had enough speed to go along with his strength. It's what made him a good Beacon candidate. He never once thought that speed and strength would be used to massage a vengeful giant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began working his way around the toe and in between the big and second. As he did the smell grew stronger. It made him want to gag. It reminded him of the time Dove tried to cook for the team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good god! Doesn't she know how to wash her foot!\" Cardin said without thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh... oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard that, Cardin!\" Velvet growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCardin's eyes widened as he looked up to meet the angry giant's glare. Those chocolate brown eyes burned like an inferno that threatened to swallow him whole. How on earth had she... oh, right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn rabbit ears.\" he whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVelvet was practically snarling now.  This kind of disrespect would not stand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Any of you seen Cardin around?\" Russel asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" Dove answered as he flipped through his scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said something, but I was only half listening.\" Sky admitted. They might've been friends but he wasn't Cardin's keeper. \"What? He owe you money or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah. He just left this morning and didn't say where he was headed off to.\" Russel explained. It was strange, Cardin always told them where he was headed off too, and sometimes he even invited them to tag along. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it. That is wired.\" Dove said as he looked away from his scroll. Currently the group of three where just lounging around in the school's courtyard. Normally they'd be in town or ribbing a few of the other students, but without their leader they just seemed a bit lost.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you tried calling him?\" Sky asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, but it went tight to voice mail.\" Russel replied. The other two were starting to look a little worried now. \"Maybe we should try to look for him. Just to make sure he's okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Dove agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ditto.\" said Sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then!\" Russel called. \"Since Cardin's leader and I'm his partner that makes me the second in command, and right now our first order of business is to go find him and make sure everything's all good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSky rolled his eyes. \"So where do we start oh fearless leader?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have... no idea.\" Russel deflated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could ask around to see if anyone's seen him?\" Dove contributed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussel's eyes lit up. \"That works.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just one problem. Half the school hates us.\" Sky reminded. \"There's no way they'd help us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussel sighed. Sky had a point, they weren't the most popular considering their titles as bullies. \"Well, we could always just search the campus from top to bottom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll take forever.\" Dove whined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we gotta do something!\" Russel argued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh! You're our leader right now, you decide.\" Sky groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRussel pinched the bridge of his nose. What to do? what to do?</span></div></div>",

It was raw and ugly, almost as if a rabid beast was lying in wait to pounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you guys feel that?\" Russel asked nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it kind of feels like someone's giving us the evil eye.\" Dove gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No shit?\" Sky said with an obvious hint of fear in his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe killing intent around them began to get thinker and hang even heavier. Who or whatever was watching them wanted to skin and fillet them alive, no question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do you think's watching us?\" Dove questioned, his eyes wavering all around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't think it's a Grimm do you?\" Russel answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't be. We're in Beacon behind walls and trained Huntsmen.\" Sky replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNone of this made any sense. Where on Remnant was this killing intent coming from and who or what was aiming it at them. They hadn't managed to piss off anyone that bad, had they? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on que... \"HEY!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of three jumped as they all swiftly turned their heads to see an enraged looking girl they'd become all too familiar with since coming to Beacon. They couldn't see her eyes because of the shades, but they knew they were burning with white hot furry. The same furry that was carried by the two other males flanking her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's team CVFY.\" Russel stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for pointing that out captain obvious?\" Sky said sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDove merely sighed. \"Figures. If there was anyone here who hated our guts more than anyone else it's them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Where's the rabbit though.\"</i> Dove thought. \"Can we help you--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut the crap!\" The girl in shades growled. \"I'm only gonna ask this once and you better give me an answer! Where's Velvet!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEh?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other member's of team CVFY began to crack their knuckles. This wasn't looking good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-we don't know.\" Russel answered honestly, though this apparently was the wrong answer as he found himself being brought down to team CVFY's leader's level by his collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSky and Dove tried to intervene but found themselves locked in a stalemate by the other two... what were their names again, Fox and Yatsuhashi? Yeah that sounded about right. And the angry fashionista was Coco. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I'm stupid!?\" Coco snapped, gaining the attention of a few students passing by. It was no secret the two teams had a distain for each other and now it looked like things were finally about to blow up. \"Velvet wouldn't just up and vanish! Something's up and want you three clowns to fess up... and while we're at it, where's your ringleader? Where's Cardin?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowed was growing larger, things were really getting out of hand. Dove and Sky could make out the low murmurings, some wanting an inevitable brawl to break out and leave them in heap of all their past deeds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We really don't know.\" Dove tried. \"We haven't seen your friend and we haven't seen Cardin either. He's missing too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you expect us to believe you don't know where your leader went?\" Yatsu responded with a large frown. \"Your team doesn't have the best reputation, especially when it comes to the faunus.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, so spill!\" Coco threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSky groaned in annoyance. \"For the last time woman we don't know! We tried calling him but he wouldn't pick up! Russ saw him leave this morning and he's been gone ever since!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true.\" Russel confirmed, not wanting things to break down any further. \"We were about to go looking for him before you showed up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCoco tightened her grip on the first year. She couldn't tell if they were lying or not, but the fact that their leader was Cardin and that they went out of their way to bully her partner and everyone else did them no favors. Not to mention their little argument was drawing a crowd. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just listen to us will ya, we're telling the truth.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Throughout his brief stint in Beacon Academy he'd never seen a long corridor like this before. It was dimly lit and looked to be quite ancient in design. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a type of vault.\" Pyrrha frowned, not bother to slow down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been here before?\" Jaune asked. She didn't answer, she merely turned her head away. \"Why would the school need to... hide?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blonde came to a stop as he and the others reached the end of the corridor. In front of them was a small room with machinery that honestly looked like it came straight out of one of his comic books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" he said in confusion. \"Who--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jaune?\" Pyrrha called, her tone indicating worry. While was left baffled, she and the headmaster still had a job to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pyrrha, get to the pod.\" Ozpin ordered. He needed to make the power transfer now before all hope was lost. The enemy was here, above ground attacking his school, he had to make sure they didn't claim what they came here for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a reluctant nod, Pyrrha headed for the closed pod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOzpin then turned his attention back to the blonde leader of team JNPR. \"Mr. Arc, if you'd like to help, you can stand guard here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young leader was still confused but this wasn't the time for questions. He would stand guard and protect his teammate from whatever was to come. This he swore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we do now?\" Pyrrha asked as she watched the headmaster quickly type in a set of codes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man sighed. \"Now? We do nothing.\" he finished typing, and the pod began to open. \"You, Ms. Nikos, have a choice to make.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe redhead listened the older man's words and thought long and hard about the life changing choice presented in front of her. If she went through with this then her life would change forever. The life she had envisioned for herself before coming to Beacon would forever be shattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked towards the awaiting pod, it's cold steel and blue glowing welcoming her. Then she turned back towards her leader and teammate that stood guard faithfully for her. She wiped her eyes before any tears could fall. She knew what she had to do. She steeled her resolve and accepted the pod's cold embrace. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid back and let the door seal shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that the room shook. Clearly the battle above was intensifying. Ozpin needed to speed the process along before it was too late. He began to type faster before addressing his waiting student, \"Are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked him square in the eyes, and nodded. It was now or never.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... I need to hear you say it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Pyrrha replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Ms. Nikos.\" he typed in a few more codes and another pod rose to life, inside a young woman who appeared to be gravely injured. She emitted a bright golden glow that flowed through her pod and up into the wires above. The golden light continued to move until it reached it's intended destination... Pyrrha's own pod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe process had finally begun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foreign light began to surround the mistral champion and she let out a pained cry from the sudden invasion. Ozpin watched on with a sad expression while Jaune was a lot more vocal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pyrrha!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keep your eyes focused, Mr. Arc.\" Ozpin said without taking his off his student. Quickly Jaune turned back to the corridor and what he saw made his eyes widen. A women in red notching an arrow straight towards the other pod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We got trouble!\" Jaune yelled, gaining the headmaster's attention. He too saw what was coming but was unfortunately not quick enough to stop what was coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arrow flew towards the injured woman's pod... but before it could even reach it's target, Jaune raised his shield and blocked the incoming projectile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red woman clicked her tongue. Beacon's own resident weakling actually managed to blocked her shot. \"How annoying.\" she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen to the surprise of all, the lights went out, the room bathed in a faint glow of golden light. Everyone turned towards the pods and watched as the injured woman's glow flickered out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Pyrrha's pod was the only one glowing...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

So far, other than either trying to sneak around or taking out some random Grimm that were wandering near the area it was a fairly quiet mission. At the moment Nora was checking another area by herself while humming a tune along the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she arrived at a very open room filled with different slightly dust covered computers and some exposed wires. Overall it was surprisingly intact as Nora wandered around the area before randomly flipped a switch not realizing that there was some power left causing the room to light up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd in the center of the room was a podium with a massive machine that honestly looked like a giant ray gun with multiple wires and pipes connected into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora then walked up to the podium and looked at the machine in wonder, \"What the heck is that thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she stares at the \"Ray Gun\" a portion of the ceiling gave way and managed to hit some controls that connected to the machine causing some steam and other sounds to emit from it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Nora could react, the machine paints a small red laser light into her chest momentarily confusing her before it suddenly lets out an electric beam hitting her in the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNormally, due to Nora's Semblance, she could've easily absorbed the electric energy and use it to enhance her strength. But this time though, the machine somehow caused Nora to shake uncontrollably as the energy coursed into her body before the old machine overloaded and explodes causing Nora to be thrown onto her back and lose her weapon, Magnhild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDazed, Nora slowly sat back up while not noticing her body was covered in electrical arcs from the beam. Unknown to her though, the machine had made an unexpected change to her Semblance where instead of enhancing her strength, it instead spread throughout her body causing Nora to gain an increase to her height initially but also absorb her now malfunctioning Scroll's energy giving Nora another two more inches resulting in her height going from originally 5'1\" to now 5'3\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time she opened her eyes, the arcs had disappeared and only tiny remnant lights from the beam fell from her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oooh! Sparkly!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLess than a few seconds later, the rest of her concerned Team burst into the room after hearing the explosion and immediately bombarded Nora with questions before she simply waved them off and answered to reassure them, \"Relax~! It was just some electric beam thingy. My Semblance can absorb an electric current and make me stronger so it's nothing it can't handle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs J(N)PR glance at what remained of the machine and back at her, they all collectively sighed before Jaune said, \"...Alright, we get it but try to be more careful the next time we go out on a mission. Okay, Nora?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNora simply grinned as she gives a mock salute, \"Aye aye fearless leader!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of her Team chuckled (a small smile and shaking his head in Ren's case) while Nora retrieved her weapon before Pyrrha commented that it looked like the room they are in was the only one left, meaning that they had likely finished exploring everything in the abandoned complex and that they should return to Beacon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone agreed but before they left the room Ren thought he noticed something was off about Nora, \"Nora?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ren?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure if I'm wrong but, do you... look different?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat question caused Jaune and Pyrrha to examine their orange hair team member as she checks herself and...</span></div></div>",

Roman has just called her in to tell her about a dust-based-weapon auction they were scoping out. This auction would be taking place at a very fancy and upper-class estate, and they needed a way inside to stake the place out. And that\u2019s where Neo, and more specifically her semblance, came in. Roman had tasked her with using her illusion-based semblance to alter her appearance so she could get inside this estate during one of their wealthy get togethers, so she could get information on the place. Neo had considered her options, and having no idea who was attending this party to assume their identity, she figured her best approach would be to attempt to get in using other methods. As Roman had told her, the usual bodyguard was a guy, so Neo decided upon using the art of seduction. However, being mute herself, Neo has to rely on body language, something that could be easily accomplished using her semblance. She got up and stood in front of the slightly cracked mirrior. She needed to be irresistible. </span></div></div>",

Neo looked around and took in the beautiful landscape; the area was certainly gorgeous, but most likely built off corrupt money, if Neo had to guess. As Neo got closer to the estate, she noticed the first of many road bumps in this operation; the bodyguard was different.

But when the package arrived, and Weiss took out a small vial of dust, Ruby playfully snatched it up. Weiss tried to catch her, but Ruby was always one step ahead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm serious, that dust vial is incredibly expensive! Not to mention crucial for my project.\"<br>\r\n\"Wait what?!\" Blake was startled out of her book when she learned their young leader was carrying something deadly. \"Ruby, give it back to Weiss right now!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh relax, kitten,\" Yang said, eating a bag of popcorn on Blake's top bunk, \"Ruby's just having fun! Plus, it's a pretty good show.\" Yang laughed and pointed at Weiss' tripping over a chair. \"See!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA knock on the door caught the red girl's attention, giving Weiss a chance to tackle her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Jaune and Pyrrah walked in, their first view was Weiss flopping on Ruby as the bumblebees watched.<br>\r\n\"Uh... hi.\" Jaune said, very confused, \"we'll just come back another time. Just wanted to offer all of us walking together to the Vytal festival, but you look busy so another time maybe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Blake, isn't it ironic how you're not the one CAT fighting right now?\" Blake slapped the grin off of Yang's cocky face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was desperate at this point to take back the dust Ruby refused to let go of. This dust was the key to fufilling her lifelong dreams, and Ruby wasn't going to ruin it. Weiss opened her mouth, and brought her teeth down into Ruby's arm.<br>\r\n\"Ow ow ow ow, no biting! No fair!\" Ruby's arm jerked upward from the pain and let go of the vial. The whole of Team RWBY watched as it crashed and broke, the dust filling the whole room. Weiss was wide mouthed as one of the only vials of that dust in existance was coughed up and sneezed out by the whole team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby! Look what you did! You broke it!\" Weiss was furious.<br>\r\n\"Me!? You're the one who bit me!\"<br>\r\n\"Well maybe if you hadn't stolen my special dust formula I wouldn't have NEEDED to bite you!<br>\r\n\"Yeah? Well-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys!\" Blake interrupted their fight with a stern tone, \"Weiss, what was the dust we all just breathed in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The dust? Oh it was just specially modified crop growth dust.\" Weiss said calmly, letting herself rest up before her next tyrade at Ruby. <br>\r\n\"Why did you need farmer's dust?\" Yang asked, patting some off of her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss blushed at the question. \"Um...\" Weiss was always jealous of everyone always being taller than her, even her child-like leader, so she commisioned a modification on a growth dust to work on people. But Weiss didn't want a few extra inches, she wanted so much more, she wanted to tower over everyone. But she was too embarrased to admit it. So she lied. \"I was going to start growing, uh, cherries?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will it hurt us?\" Ruby asked, picking up the broken glass off the floor.\"<br>\r\n\"Not as much as I'll hurt you, dolt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys, guys, calm down. Let's just blow off steam at the Vytal festival,\" Yang said, keeping the peace for once, \"We can meet up with JNPR there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine. But I'm still mad at you.\" Weiss poked her finger into Ruby's chest, emphasising her point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all grabbed their things and left, Ruby trying to stay as far from Weiss as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was sad to see one of her vials break, but was relieved to see no one injesting it directly, assuming just breathing it in wouldn't do much at all.<br>\r\nShe was wrong, and she'll find out soon enough that the growth dust is in all of their systems. But when will it all kick in?</div></span></div></div>",

She was still upset with Ruby for breaking her growth dust and new it was going to be a pain to secure some more but at least nothing happened with the current supply. Maybe it wasn't meant to work on people at all and this was just a waste of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked ahead at her team and felt something was...odd...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang had begun to move her shoulders around a bit as though she felt some kind of discomfort, Blake was tugging at her neck wear trying to be nonchalant about it but was clearly feeling it was a bit tight, and Ruby kept pulling on her skirt as if it had ridden up. Weiss shook her head and believed she was just imagining it, fueled by her desire for growth, until she herself felt a bit tight in the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Weiss? You okay?\" Yang turned around to see if she was still following the group and noticed a hint of horror in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I'm fine. Just thinking about how mad I am.\" This was only half true but it got the group to roll their eyes and keep walking. Weiss was concerned that the dust HAD worked and really hoped that this was the extent of what would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the girls arrived at the Festival, Weiss estimated that each girl had grown an inch and a half and filled out their uniforms a little more than what they could hold as Yang asked Ruby to help her with something in the restroom, the latter followed her whilst holding down her dress forcefully, while Blake seemed to have torn the collar at this point to not drive herself mad clawing at it. Meanwhile, Weiss herself felt her breasts pressing against the fabric of her dress trying to escape.<br>\r\nNone of them seemed to have noticed anything was weird as far as she could tell. Maybe her team really was that dense.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nAs Ruby and Yang entered the restroom the blonde furiously began pulling off her jacket and shirt, startling her sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yang, what are you doing?!\" She looked around the empty room for peeping toms and the like, not that Yang cared at the moment as she was in a lot of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just help your sister with her Bra. I dunno what happened, it must have tightened or something cause they are squeezing my babies way way to hard.\" Ignoring the weirdness of what she said, Ruby carefully undid the bra and-<br>\r\n<i>crack</i><br>\r\nApparently there was a lot under pressure. The Bra, as it was unhooked, flung itself at high speeds towards the mirror breaking it. Yang's \"Babies\" fell out and and hung there. While she felt much better, both sisters were staring at the broken glass and projectile bra that had broken it with a mixture of emotions.<br>\r\n\"I didn't realize I had gotten so big...\" Yang hefted a breast in each hand, the soft flesh spilling over her fingers.<br>\r\nIn the silence, there was another noise, though this was more of a ripping and tearing sound, as Ruby's leggings began to fail. The soft curves of her legs had begun to strain against the fabric before her thighs snapped the tops. After the moment passed, each girl looked at each other extremely confused.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Then it began...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuby felt her body tremble as the sound of her clothes straining and tearing began again with a vengeance. Her legs began to stretch up and up, her thighs filling out more and more. Her chest forced its way out of her top, shooting buttons into the mirror with a similar crack to Yang's bra. Each of her breasts began to form out, bigger and softer with each passing second. By the time her head hit the ceiling, she was already sporting a set of G-Cups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Yang watched in horror, a similar sensation filled her body as she began to grow out of her clothes. Her breasts began to swell past Ruby's new assets into J-Cups, her hips began to break free from the confines of her pants as she grew bigger and bigger. The two growing girls were taking up nearly all the space and their growth didn't seem to be stopping anytime soon...<br>\r\n---<br>\r\nOutside, Weiss began to notice Blake started to breathe funny. With each breath, she seemed to swell up and up and up. Her breasts began to tear open her shirt as she herself seemed to rise up into the air. People began to take notice as this girl started to literally GROW right in front of them. After a second, her breasts exploded out, revealing two very perky DD-Cups. But it didn't stop there. Soon they were E, F, G-Cups. She was rising up above the Festival Stands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Weiss watched this, she didn't quite realize her body was doing the same until she felt her necklace pop from the pressure. Her own cleavage had expanded out and was filling out to F-Cups. She felt a mix of embarrassment that she was exposed, jealousy that Blake was still bigger than her, and fear that this was now going to get out of hand. As her clothes began to shred more and more she heard a noise from the restroom. The sound of bricks starting to crumble as a 13-Foot Ruby followed by a 15-Foot Yang burst out of the roof. The two began looking around as the rose higher and higher, Weiss keeping pace but still behind by about a foot. Eventually the team stopped growing at around 25-Feet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYang's Milk-Tanks were now the size of literal Milk-Tanks.<br>\r\nRuby had gained a nice, firm butt with killer thighs that could crush a man.<br>\r\nBlake wound up with an hour-glass body with not too much on either end to out-do the other, but enough to turn heads from both interested parties.<br>\r\nWeiss found herself with a New set of Breasts that filled out her frame nicely and long legs to die for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone who wasn't petrified in fear or taking risque photos were running for their lives. As the girls looked around, the RBY of team RWBY realized that Weiss' Dust must have done this and Weiss realizes she might be in trouble...however...</span></div></div>",

Her hands flew directly to her crotch as she fell to her knees, her sheer  mass causing the ground to shake as a result. Weiss was panting heavily. Her hands were like a blur as she aggressively rubbed her snatch up and down as though she were cleaning a rather stubborn stain.<br>\r\n\u201cW-what's happening to me!?\u201d the young  heiress thought to herself, a burst of fear surfacing from the sea of lust currently assaulting her mind. Weiss  channeled her considerable will power as she went to face her teammates. \u201c S-something's wrong I-I need your-\u201c Weiss\u2019s plea for help died on her lips as she saw that her teammates were in the same predicament as her own.   Yang was kneading her titanic breasts  with both hands as milk explosively gushed out ( much to  Weiss's shock) getting really into it as she did. Blake meanwhile was groping her humongous derriere with a  look on her face that suggested that she was totally lost  in bliss and wasn't home right now. Lastly, Ruby was lying on her back savagely teasing her clit with one hand and tweaking her nipple with the other. Weiss was at a loss. Why was this happening!? The dust wasn't meant to do this. But then again it wasn't meant  to be taken all at once like they did earlier. As Weiss watched her teammates pleasure themselves she couldn't help but feel even more hot and bothered then before.  Weiss clenched her eyes as she felt her pussy throb  with        unbearable need. She redoubled her efforts in getting herself off. With Her right hand she gave her lady parts a thorough rub down, even getting at her own clitoris in order to increase the intensity of the sensation, and with her left hand  she violently groped her own very substantial boobs. The cold tempered girl kept this up for what felt like forever until she began to feel a knot build up in her core, signifying that she was very close to  release. The white haired girl promptly increased the  pace of her ministrations in anticipation of sweet release. Faster and faster she went,  her panting becoming louder as she did, even inserting her fingers into her  soaking  vagina to bring her closer to the breaking point(she was almost there!). Eventually  she could take no more and with one final thrust she threw her head back and screamed /moaned to the Heavens, her pussy gushed great loads of girl-cum as it spasmed around her fingers. Kneeling in a puddle of her own fluids and coming down the high of the best orgasm of her life, she realized, to her annoyance, that she was still unbelievably horny and that all her masturbation did was dull the sensation slightly.  That being said she was able to think somewhat clearly again and decided to count her blessings. Weiss stood back up from where she knelt and went to check on her teammates again only to be shocked  once again by what she saw. Her friends  were plucking fleeing festival goers from the ground like ripe fruit and using them as sex toys. Ruby had torn the clothes of one hapless man clean off and, while holding him with one hand, shoved his penis into her hungry pussy while simultaneously eating out some random brunette that she  grabbed with her free hand. Meanwhile Blake had snatched a few passersby herself and, after tearing  off their clothes, shoved a few of them up her gigantic ass, making sure that one of the men she captured had his cock shoved deep into her anus. The towering cat faunus then grabbed both cheeks  and proceeded to rub them together in a most sensuous manner. Finally, Yang had seen fit to place her unwitting lovers/captives in her  mammoth cleavage and gave them perhaps the best full-body boob Job in the entire history of Remnant.<br>\r\nAll the while Weiss was having a breakdown. Things have clearly spiraled out of control and she had to stop this debacle before  the situation gets even worse! Before she could come up with  any solutions however she felt the need return in full force. Weiss grunted from the sensations bombarding her all at once. She could feel the lust return stronger then before! The frigid swords woman was practically gasping at this point. It was getting harder to  think of anything other than sex. In the midst of her crisis the heiress caught movement in the corner of her eye and turned to look. A few onlookers too scared, foolish, or horny to run had gathered around her, anticipating her next. The girl caught herself drooling at the sight of the people observing her with such rapt attention. a hunger had taken hold of her demanding that she  greedily take what she desires from people. Weiss could feel her self control slipping further and further away by the minute. She wanted <b>SOOOO</b> badly to ravage these people but she also knew that this was wrong and had to find a way to stop it.! But what was she to do?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Thankfully Ruby noticed this and offer to lend Weiss a hand stating that the two should work out together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How exactly?\" Weiss asked still a bit puzzled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Ruby paused as she scanned the area around the two of them.</span></div></div>",

A brave, strong, disciplined, sophisticated woman. She had slipped away from the bonds of their father, and managed to forge her own path with the Atlesian military, regardless of their father's wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter was all Weiss wanted to be, so whenever Winter had free time the heiress would take every opportunity to spend it with her. That included training, her sister was responsible for building the foundations of what would become her fighting style, teaching her in the craft of their family's hereditary semblance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss loved her sister dearly, ever thankful for all she had done for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare stop now you daintly little girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...That is not to say that sometimes her sister didn't make it easy sometimes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heiress watched as the ground grew close and furthered away, only to grow close once again. Breathing with effort as she pushed her arms up and down. Weiss sincerely hated physical training, but she knew it was vital for any Huntsman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss was sure Winter was currently channeling all that experience from the training she recieved at the military academy at Atlas. The same type drill Sergeants subjugated the students to. Winter watched her with a heavy critical gaze, donning a military white coat, arms crossed behind her back, as Weiss continued with the pushups.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heiress was currently wearing not her usual white dress, but white yoga pants along with a white sports braw, her body sweat until there was a small puddle under her face, her arms were starting to protest in agony. She had lost count how many she had done so far, well, she did not count at all to begin with. Winter had not set a required number of pushups, she had just ordered her to do them until she said it was enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Winter finally decided to be merciful. \"That's enough, take five\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss collapsed on the ground, gasping for breath. To merely remain still for a moment was a blessing after this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter harrumphed in disappointment. \"Your physical fitness leaves much to be desired, Weiss\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe heiress managed to find the strength to sit down. \"I'm not a physical fighter like Yang... I'm built for agility and casting\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Both which means nothing if your body can't handle the pressure of combat\" Her sister repriminded. \"You need to build up your stamina and body strength, develop those paltry muscles of yours\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss didn't dare roll her eyes, but she definitely wanted too. \"I'm not sure I want muscles\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whether you want them or not is irrelevant. You need to be in better shape\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think I'm the type to build that type of body anyway\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter's eyes narrowed, making Weiss wince, thinking she had said something wrong. \"Not the type huh? Then by that logic neither should I be\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Weiss' eyes, Winter began removing the upper parts of her attire. Her younger sister could see a black sports bra as she unbotted the coat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt soom came off, leaving Weiss gawking.</span></div></div>",

But at the sight of her sister's body there was only one word that came to mind (one that Yang herself would use no doubt)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter was <i>ripped</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her military coat off, and left in a simple black sports bra that hung tight around her chest, along with strentched yoga pants, Winter's oustandingly developed body was in full display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer forarms were corded and thick, leading the way to bulging inches of unflexed biceps and protounding triceps. Her deltoids were large balls of flesh split into the different muscle groups in a noticeable way. Her torso managed to blend perfectly a curved womanly figure while possessing a wide musculature, Six abdominal muscles of amazing definition, and several visible muscle groups around them, protected her stomach like a steadfast shield. Where her abdomen ended and her upper body started, her lats flared somewhat with her arms relaxed at the side, her prodigious chest (something which Weiss has always been secretely jealous of) was supported by two thick pecturals, corded muscles with shredded definition in the middle.Though her legs remained hidden, the yoga pants did little to conceal their size. Wide thighs and diamond carved calves filled out the fabric and pushed it to its limits, her rear standing out nicely due to the iron-like glutes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWinter took a deep breath, and brought her fists closed to her hips. Her lats spreading as her chest heaved, her abs tightening as she flexed her upper body. Her biceps bulged a few inches foward, the skin tightened to show off greater definition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss simply had her breath stolen. She had never imagined her sister could look like... this. There was no sense of grotesque at her figure, no manliness about it. Winter blended feminity and raw strength, granting her still an air of elegance and authority about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I adquired this body through my own efforts, do you consider still consider the task of building up yours impossible?\" She asked and without waiting for an answer continued. \"Or is it that you see a woman with this physique to be an embarrasment? Foolish notions of society, my body has nothing to do with appereances, I honed my muscles to serve me better on the field\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-No no it's nothing like that!\" Weiss vehemently denied, though secretely she had been worried about appereances, something she didn't dare confess to her sister. \"I'm just... surprised. You look so... so strong\" Those were the only words that came to mind, she didn't know what to say. Compliment her sister on her figure? Say how amazing she looked like that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss could admit that, yes, her sister looked <i>incredible</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A strong body for a strong mind. Here\" To the heiress' surprise, her elder sister grabbed a hold of her hand and placed it on her abdominals. \"Feel this\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-Winter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're sisters, there's nothing to be ashamed of. Do you feel how hard my abs are?\" Winter let Weiss press her hand on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her fingertips hesitantly touched the bags of muscles, growing more and more bold as they fulley reached out to feel, yes, Weiss felt how amazingly hard they felt underneath her sister's flawless skin. It felt... good. She blushed in embarresment, and something else she couldn't fully describe. But touching Winter's muscles felt... intriguing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now feel this\" Winter bent to the side and her up her bicep, flexing it with all her strength, forcing the muscle to rise and tighten. Her skin showed flawless definition as Weiss saw a few veins rising along the length, continuing forth all the way to her forarms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeiss slowly reached foward with both her hands this time, feeling the mound of flesh of the bicep while her other hand cupped the tricept, her palms tenderly running over the hard flesh. The sheer strenght in that muscle, the hardness, the... the beauty. Yes, Weiss realized as the heat gathered in her cheeks and she let out a nearly silent but shaky breath, Winter was beautiful. Her amazonian body was making her feel things she had not experienced before, perhaps things one should not feel for a sibling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moved her lips to utter one simple question, a desire that was steadily building up strength inside of her that she just needed to satiate.</span></div></div>",
