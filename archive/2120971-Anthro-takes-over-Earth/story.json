You were on the street when it happened a few days ago and slowly well over a hundred people grouped together under a street vendor cart for shelter. No one has any clothes. No one has any technology or tools, just bare naked people huddling together under the only shelter avialable. The first threat to come is the pigeons. A massive light blue aircraft sized bird swoops down and takes a lady in it's beak and swallows her like it would any bug or bread crumb. The massive bird then hops forward to a guy trying to hide behind a candy wrapper and he too is snatched up and swallowed alive by the massive pigeon. Then the pigeon flies away spooked by what comes next... Six giants wearing light gray uniforms come down the street with weapons at the ready, but nothing to shoot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leader has the head of a wolf and massive leather boots indicating that his feet look too big for his body. He waves for the others to check buildings. Three of them wear helmets and their faces cannot be seen, but the SHAPE of their head is elongated... Not human in shape at all. The second in command is definitely a female with HUGE breasts as big as her head and a furry animal face. It's not a familiar animal face though, but a dark brown fur covers her cheeks and she is wearing magnification goggles scanning around. She focuses in on you and the dozens of people hiding under the cart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems to have worked flawlessly sir, I am picking up heat signatures there... It's the enemy. They've been reduced to a perfect scale. They won't be a problem,\" the female furry reports to her leader. The wolf comes forward and takes a look for himself and scans under the cart at all of you bug sized people and grins. IF a wolf could grin. You just see fangs. \"Signal to the ship that the plan was a success,\" He waved to the female. She began talking on her wrist band radio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, what do we do with the natives?\" the female asked. The wolf stood to his full height looking very proud of this triumph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have to do anything, let the vermin live in fear in the dark corners. We know how they treat our kind! Like... like... Animals! We shall return the favor,\" he sneers and starts to walk back the way they came. Off in the distance, a small van sized shuttle had landed with the soldiers inside. The others gathered to join their leader heading back to the shuttle. The massive unidentified female anthro looks down at all of you again and takes a small platic cup from her belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do you do?</span></div></div>",

Once Vixie was sure they'd gotten everyone, she clambered up the base of the bush, nestling in a crook between two twigs, enduring the massive raindrops that threatened to drown anyone, or knock down any who got hit by them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the rains were over, the tribe took account of who survived, and Vixie noted that her grandmother hadn't made it, and most of her sisters and cousins did.  But life was cheap at this size, and fertile females were a prime commodity, so the tribe decided to cut their losses and move closer to the hall of the gods, seeing as the goddess didn't bring rain so regularly the closer to the structure they got.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot even offering lip service to the dead, the miniscule tribe grabbed their spears (thorns) and began their trek to the new tunneling grounds.  Vixie looking up at the goddess as she removed her massive vegetables from the ground, tearing up the area they had called home for the last four months, ripping the earth asunder as though it were nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==================<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Jane Lapine was enjoying her gardening, but noticed something off about the soil, it appeared to have been tunneled by something.  Too big for worms, too small for any burrowing mammal except....humans!  She looked around quickly and eagerly, she'd only read about the former owners of Ert, such a strange name the humans gave this world, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite looking extremely hard and thoroughly, all she found were some dead humans, \"Awww.  They must've drowned...\" She may agree that humans were not particularly intelligent, or clean, but some human keepers did discover that humans evacuated their tunnels whenever they felt threatened, those that didn't, often died.  And no matter how filthy or a pest it was, Jane hated to see an innocent animal die so lonely, not to mention, she did find them to be fascinating to watch and learn about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!  I have an idea!\"  And she ran back inside to pick up her phone and make a call.</span></div></div>",

The ground was soft and it was relatively free of other, bigger animals, which was a must for her tribe to survive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The ground here looks like it has clay in it.\"  She heard a cousin say somewhere in the caravan.  \"That means we could build a burrow that is waterproof, and the goddess doesn't seem to bother this land.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVixie helped to get the younger ones situated while the adults began scraping and digging away st the clay filled dirt.  Looking around for her sister, she saw her helping to dig out an entrance while one of the men from another tribe that had joined some weeks ago was mounting her.  Deciding to talk to her sister, she headed over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Vera.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**pant**pant** \"Hey Vixie.  How's it gooooing?\"  Vera and the man didn't stop their rutting, modesty and concepts of privacy died out years ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVixie started digging the tunnel entrance further down, gently lifting her rear into the air, she needed a good rut, and new tribesmates were needed.  \"Alright.\"  She felt someone's legs getting into position behind her, and she gently bent her torso a bit lower, \"Pity about grandmother, ri-i-i-ight?\"  The last word came out stuttered as the man rutting her was a bit forceful on his thrusts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera bobbed her head side to side, starting a tunnel branching off from the entrance they were digging, \"Eh, only the youngest really listened to her stories anymore.  They were just too obvious about being made up.  Aaaah, aaaahhh, AAAAHH\"  The male rutting Vera had finished by now, and stumbled away, Vixie noting that her man seemed to be taking forever to wrap up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but she still helped teach us stuff.  Like how to hide, or find foooooOOOOOOODDD!\"  Nevermind then, Vixie smiled back at the tanned man behind her, wiggling her rear in the air again toward him a second he left, inviting him to return later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVera nodded as Vixie came over and the two began to work in tandem with the other tribes mates in connecting the new tunnels, surface guides helped the diggers to line up properly.  \"Be that as it may, how do you explain the goddess?  How do you predict the behavior of the divine?  Perhaps the goddess decided that it was simply time for her to die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVixie said nothing.  She knew better than to question the divinity of the goddess, who else among them could tear the earth apart, shake the ground just by walking, or decide when to bring rain and death?  But for some reason, she just couldn't help but feel like there was more got their goddess than the stories and beliefs told.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==================<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'll be 38 sqol ma'am.\"  A hedgehog man said as he unloaded several boxes to Ms. Jane Lapine, looking at the labels, he saw that there were human keepin supplies in each.  But whatever, not his problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go!\"  Jane said as she handed over the money, \"I hope this doesn't take too long to setup...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe delivery man shrugged his shoulders, \"Just follow the instructions, everything will work out, otherwise your warranty is void.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJane nodded, watching as he got into his van and drove away, \"Alright, time to get setup!\"</span></div></div>",

But the change occurred to all of them simultaneously. It didn't matter if it was day or night where you lived... Suddenly the sky lit up with a bright green flash. And then the world was eerily silent. In a single instant everyone in the world seemed to have disappeared. Piles of empty clothing laid about the streets and in homes, the owners of said clothes seemingly gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly what remains of humanity emerged... They hadn't quite disappeared... But unless one looked carefully they might as well have. Tiny almost invisible specks emerged from the empty pile of clothes. The bright green flash that had enveloped the world had shrunk every human in existence down to an insignificant little speck. The average height of an adult human was now 1/10th an inch... Or about 2.5 millimeters. This left the human race roughly the same size as fleas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long before the cause of the shrinking appeared. Animals that  could walk on two legs and spoke soon appeared. They came to Earth in giant ships and quickly took over. They moved into the now seemingly abandoned human homes and started their own lives. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiny and naked the humans were helpless to fight back. They weren't big enough to use tools. They weren't even big enough to use tools! The humans could have been wiped out in an instant if the animals wished. In that respect their new size was something of a small mercy. Humans were so small they were beneath the notice of many of the animals. This allowed them to survive living on the fringe of the animal society scavenging what they could for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the civilized animals... Some saw humans as inconsequential... Others saw them as pests. Some saw them as curiosities... And others yet might consider them possible pets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe world is a tough place to be now. Not only must the flea sized humans deal with the giant animals... But a world that is massive where now even the smallest animals represent huge threats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the people to live in this world is you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are...</span></div></div>",

Then there was a bright green flash and you were suddenly lost in your own clothing. It took a few minutes to register what had happened. At first you thought your clothes had been stolen and you must have just been wrapped up in some kind of giant sack. However as you crawled for safety the truth soon became apparent. Your clothes piled as large as the pyramids of Egypt behind you were a bit of a clue. You had somehow shrunk! Now no bigger than a flea you stood on the sidewalk with no idea what you were to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sidewalk itself was now treacherous domain. Small cracks within it were now seemingly bottomless ravines. You had only walked about five minutes from your workplace but now you were an eternity away from anywhere safe. Surrounded by cracks in the sidewalk you seemed to be stuck with no hope of escape. You considered maybe climbing over clothes... It would take forever but at least the threads would give you ample handholds and you'd no longer be stuck on the sidewalk. You weren't sure where you'd go from there but it seemed better than anything else. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou started your climb... When suddenly the entire Earth began to shake. You reached the top of your clothes piles and you were able to see part of what was happening. Strange metal items were falling from the sky. They were spherical... And each one might as well have been the size of the moon in comparison to you. If any of them landed anywhere near you there would be no outrunning it. You would simply be gone. You could do nothing but watch helplessly as they came down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see where one of the spheres landed. A slot opened up on it and what could best be described as an animal walking on its hind legs emerged from it. It looked like a wolf. It began to stride in your direction not taking any sight of you. Massive brown paws worked their way towards you... You realized that the wolf may not even notice you. You had no idea if they were responsible or not... Being shrunk and humanoid animals from space were a bit more than you could handle... But you did know it would be really bad if that wolf stepped on you. He wouldn't step on the pile of clothes right? That was the safest place to be right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr... Maybe not. Maybe you should run for it. Or maybe you should try to get the wolf's attention. Regardless of if it was related to your shrinking or not you couldn't do much on your own right now!</span></div></div>",

You looked around for your clothes in confusion as this happened... You were more worried about getting in trouble if a teacher saw you naked than anything else as you hadn't quite realized what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrawling around you eventually found your way out from the 'blanket.' You emerged into a world of enormous blades of grass that reached upward like skyscrapers. You couldn't see beyond the grass to see the school or anything else. You slowly turned around and saw the fabric you had been stuck underneath. It was your own shirt you had been wearing just moments ago! It was like a giant mountain of clothing now though! You couldn't wear that anymore. You looked down at yourself feeling somewhat self conscious there... But the feeling passed as you marveled as the giant world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had no idea what had happened or how you had gotten so small...

The doe who now lives in your home has redish and white fur, brown hair, and green eyes. She is wearing a yellow shirt and blue shorts. The horse has brown fur, long blond hair that is tied in a ponytail (no pun indeed) and blue eyes. She wears a blue and yellow sleeveless top, white jeans tied by a black belt with a gold buckle, a shiny gold necklace, and a pair of sky blue high heels. The wolf has gray and white fur, black hair and eyes. She wears a red hoodie with big white letters that spelled \"Super\", blue jeans, and a pair of white sneakers. The cat has orange fur with stripes, black bobcut styled hair, and hazel eyes. She wears a purple midriff-baring tube top, black shorts, and a pair of brown boots. The squirrel has brown and white fur, red hair with a green headband, and gray eyes behind her glasses. She wears a red and yellow striped shirt, a brown skirt, and a pair of black flats (the exact same ones that almost stepped on you!). The goat has golden fur, brunette hair tied into pigtails by a pair of green ribbons, and blue eyes. She wears a orange, midriff-baring shirt with a sun on it, blue denim skirt that is tied up in a brown belt with a black buckle and a pair of brown cowgirl styled boots. And finally, the peacock has blue feathers, long straight black hair, black eyes that were painted in blueish eye shadows, and a small red bindi on her forehead, almost giving her a Hindu look. She wears a white dress with puffy sleeves and is tied by a belt in the same color the horse has but instead of a gold buckle it has a gray one instead. She also wears a pair of golden high heeled sandals. You look at of these six giantesses and surprised that not only they look human but act like them too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to see a enormous window above you which was slightly opened. You could just go outside and escape but unfortunately it seemed to be impossible right now. You sat there and decided to give up when suddenly you heard a noise coming from outside. You looked back to the window to see what looked like a.......tiny aircraft? It's true, it was in fact little aircraft about your size coming through the open window. You watch as it landed on the window's edge and stood there for a while. Could there be other tiny people such as yourself?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a periscope pops out of the craft and pointed right towards the giant anthros. You don't even know what's going on, should go and check it out?</span></div></div>",

Kinda think of it, he and the other guy don't look like they were from some elite rescue squad or something. In reality, they look like a bunch of normal-looking people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do the explanation!\" said the guy in front of you. \"It all started like this:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEver since those anthros came here and shrunk us all, everyone is been forced to go through hard times. In situations like this, alot of people are already freaking out, but not us! You see, we brave folks have always love the feelings of adventure and being a few millimeters tall just makes it more exciting. As you can see, we just found one of those aircaft that also got shrunk and we decided to use it to find a place to seek some adventure and that's where we found this place. This house has seven giant anthros just waiting for us to play on them while they're aren't looking. Surprisingly, looks like  someone else already got here first which it's you of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo apparently these aren't rescuers, there just bunch of guys just seeking for adventure, but hey at least you're safe for now. The guy then takes out a strange collar out of his pocket and said \"This here is a device that makes the wearer walk on walls, cellings, and heck even the anthros themselves. The government have created these for the survivers in hopes they can climb giant objects much more quicker and don't worry, they did plenty of testing first before they can release these. I heard people even used these to live on the giant anthros, it's weird really but it can happen. We thought we could use them for some good ol body exploration, don't you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the device and thought that maybe it could be useful for surviving this situation especially for going back to your little shelter right now, but you wonder how will you ask these high-spirited travelers if you obtain one. \"Say after you recover your injures, care to join us?\" asked the man \"We could even give you a spare collar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gotta admit, you kinda wanted that collar since it does make things a whole lot easier but it seem you have to join up with their little game and you are not the type of person to possibly risk your own life for something dangerous like this. However at the bright side, you could go with these crazy seekers and find an even safer place to live, hopefully where no anthros can find you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThinking for a few seconds, you got your answer:</span></div></div>",

You still remember the first week when the anthros shrunk the humans, many aircraft would either try to find survivors or try to fight the anthros, all ending the same way, either the anthros thought they were annoying gnats or never even notice as they go around their daily life, unaware of crashing into the aircrafts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking across the couch, it felt like a comfy desert that would go on for miles that you would have to cross to make it the edge before trying to climb down to the carpet forest below. Otherwise, the only option is to just wait on the couch, but that also mean risking the giantesses coming to the couch and sitting down, most likely crushing you in the progress.

Ohh Pleasepleaseplease!!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut of course, dear. Anything for my little princess. Go to the airlock and get ready to put your hand out.\u201d The doting father changed course slightly and entered a star system with nine planets. He grinned and settled his ship near a pair of worlds, fired a purple beam at the small grey one \u201cSweetie? A little bonus present for you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gloved hand reached out, a pair of fingers daintily pinched the small cratered grey ball and brought it in. She smiled at it and set it gently on the floor by her feet \u201cThank you Daddy!\u201d she called \u201cBut now can I get the real pretty blue and green one??\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFiring now, sweetheart.\u201d The father announced, tolerantly. Again the purple ray hit its target, then his ship began moving \u201cIt should be floating along in about ten seconds.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn Earth\u2019s night side, the half of humanity who could witness it saw a purple haze surround the Moon and then, seemingly, the ancient companion seemed to slowly move away. Then the entire human race was engulfed in a purple light for several seconds. Once it faded, a simply ginormous spaceship seemed to pull up alongside the planet. First the sleek nose, then just mile after uncounted mile of vast metal wall. Just before the lights went out Someone in Alaska commented \u201cThat looks like a giant hand.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlmost, Daddy, just a liiiiiiiiittttle bit mooooore! Almost there!!!\u201d the girl\u2019s hand extended out the portal, as she reached for her new plaything. She bumped the blue-green ball with one gloved finger, then felt it roll into her palm. \u201cIt\u2019s perfect Daddy! Just about the size of an apple!!\u201d She closed her fingers around her prize, brought it into the ship, and smiled down at it admiringly, like what she was\u2026.a kid with a new toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch of Humanity couldn\u2019t see anything of the sky due to either monstrous fingers surrounding the planet, or the unbelievably gargantuan hand Earth was sitting in.

However, humans are still alive somehow, but each second is a constant struggle, from giant bugs, the now massive weather disaster like a simple rain, to the now titan size anthro threatening to end their existence without knowing. You are one of these humans and must survive somehow. Will you survive? Who knows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules: humans must be miniscule, no bigger than 1/2 of an inch, they can be smaller if you want.
