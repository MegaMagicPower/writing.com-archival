Those that noticed him kept walking, unless they wished to know more about a wolf's mouth than they wanted to otherwise know. Around the wolf's neck was a collar, and an object dangled from it. The object was made of copper and bronze, with a sliver of silver for the shine, and gold for the color, meaning it was worthless, financially, but it was important to those that had it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the end of the street, a rookie guard watched the wolf. They wanted to cry out, but the wolf looked right at them, and any thought of calling out vanished. The wolf came right up to them, tilted their head slightly, and stepped into the shadows behind them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, a slightly gruff voice called out. \"You do have a spare pair of trousers and a shirt in your pack. I need them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard gulped, as they carefully took their pack off, and set it on the ground. They watched as a hairy arm grabbed it, and dragged it back. They heard the pack being open, and things being took out. A while later, the pack was set next to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You may turn around now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard carefully turned, and found themself looking at their Commander, who now looked human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you smoke?\" the Commander asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard gulped. \"No Sir.\" Their voice sounded off somewhat. \"Father always told me it was a filthy habit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Commander chuckled. \"And he was right; messes with your sense of smell. Maybe an average human's nose is not as good as a werewolf's, but it can pick up things like smoke, dung, food, cologne, and of course, perfume.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard gulped at this last bit. \"Perfume? I don't smell any.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Commander looked right at the guard. \"You haven't worn it in the last three days, you cut your hair right about then, and your socks smell like you've been missing the can in the Privy. You're a woman pretending to be a man, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard hung their head. \"Yes, Sir.\" Their voice sounded like it was defeated. \"I was told you didn't hire <i>human</i> women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Commander chuckled. \"Whoever told you that pile of hogwash is full of horse apples. I hire anyone whom I think will get the job done. I know you signed up as John Smith, but what's your real name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sally Butcher,\" the woman said. \"Father said that he wanted me to marry a rich man, but I didn't want that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear you there,\" the Commander said. \"Rich people are never fun. Personally, I hate mingling with them, but given my position, it's inevitable that I have to lower myself to their level.\" He looked at her. \"Sally, I don't care what your family story is. I don't care about your race, or your species, or your status before you became a guard. All I care about is that you are a Guard, right here, right now. Understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard smiled, and nodded. \"Yes Sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" the Commander said. \"When your shift is over, I expect you get things straightened with the Quartermaster; we already have ten John Smiths, and having one of them really being a Sally Butcher would be a relief to him on Pay Day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Mind turning around; I don't want my guards to see their Commander strip naked in front of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally turned, and she watched as first a shirt, and then the trousers landed on her pack. Then she watched as a wolf emerged from the shadows. The wolf looked at her, and she swore she saw it wink at her, before resuming walking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga Blackfur Copperfindersson remained in his wolf form as he patrolled the streets. Occasionally he saw a guard, who gave him some sort of sign of recognition, and sometimes he saw a thief, who would carefully pull their hands from someone else's pocket, and pretend that nothing was going on. Things were going good so far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, the real question was where to go next....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Rutabaga gave himself a silent chuckle, as he decided to head home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPadding down an area filled with homes of the Wealthy and Nobility, most homes had, basically, a Private Guard, who would do what the homeowner told them to do, although most had learned why it was a bad idea to interfere in City Guard business, and Rutabaga's rank as, as much as he hated to say it, a Knight, and a Baron, tended to open doors that the feet of trolls and golems would otherwise break down. After all, being polite to a Noble was cheap, whereas doors cost money, and kept the carpet from getting dirty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, Rutabaga came to a home which had a rather nice yard, and garden, not to mention a small forest, filled with plenty of game for him to hunt, although it needed fresh stock every so often. There was no gate on the pathway, although there was a \"Beware of Dog\" sign, which he always chuckled at, when he was human. He walked up to the door, and stopped before it. He sniffed, and caught a scent around the doggy-door. With a silent laugh, he went through the door, and shifted into his human form. He walked over to the robe rack, took one off, and quickly turned around, tossed the robe at the black figure that had tried to sneak up on him, and shoved them up against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold still,\" he said, forcing his fingers into the figure's mouth. He soon pulled out a vial, and looked at it. He looked at the person. \"This isn't the usual stuff you guys carry when you try to kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's aniseed oil,\" the figure said, in a young woman's voice. \"I came here for a test, to see if I could get close enough to do the deed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This would have stuffed my nose up for a week. Dry run, or Guild exam?\" Rutabaga asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guild exam,\" the figure said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga chuckled. He then carefully removed the cloth that hid all but the person's eyes and mouth, revealing a rather lovely face. \"Well, you'd put a smile on someone as they died.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person chuckled nervously. \"I say it's a curse. No one takes me seriously.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can understand that,\" Rutabaga said, as he carefully started to disarm, and in the process, disrobe, the woman. \"That being said, you do know the guild rules are that, if you fail, you have to suffer the penalty; you failed to hit me with this, so, I get to punish you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think that you could do it another time?\" the woman asked. \"I'm going to get married next month, and I've been saving myself for my husband-to-be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga chuckled. \"I'd love to, but as you know, I have a reputation to uphold.\" He lifted her hand, and looked at her ring. \"Who is the husband-to-be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Greasy Bum, son of Lord Wet Bum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unfortunate family name, but a very good family, with plenty of money, and they donate to the hospital,\" said Rutabaga. He looked at the woman. \"You look familiar; any relation to Ripper Blood?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman grinned. \"That's my uncle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember him; he had some rather unique knives,\" said Rutabaga. \"Smashed his nose and broke his left leg. That means that you're the daughter of Cyan Blood; she tried to poison me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Cyan Tanner now,\" the woman said \"I'm Slippery Tanner, soon to be Slippery Bum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga chuckled. \"It's a small world; your mother and uncle both tried to kill me, and here you are coming after me for a Guild test. Now, I'm sure your mother told you what I did to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this time, Slippery was disrobed, and, more embarrassingly, mostly disarmed. \"Yes,\" Slippery said. \"And I did prepare for that possibility; I have some Zonkiers in my robe.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga grinned. \"Nice try, but we'll use mine; I don't feel like scratching myself in Public too much, like what happened a few years back.\" He opened a drawer, and pulled out a small packet. \"Always useful at preventing unwanted pregnancies.\" He then removed her hairpin, causing her hair to fall to her shoulders. Pressing a button, he saw a hypodermic needle come out of the end of the hairpin. \"Good way to keep me from moving.\" He tossed it to the floor, along with her other weapons, and clothes. \"Now, there is a question I have to ask you.....\"</span></div></div>",

After all, the touch of cold metal has been proven to instantly halt a man's sex drive. There are plenty of Ladies of Negotiable Affection, and seamstresses, and others, who swear by them, and never leave home without their Slimmer Blades.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like some sort of advertisement,\" said Slippery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga looked at the very narrow blade. \"Actually, it's written on the blade itself. See the very small print?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow! They really etch that in all of these blades?\" Slippery asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Every one I've bought anyways,\" said Rutabaga. \"I issue them to my female guards, and I recommend that they take classes from Madam Sally She's A Big One Rose, which reminds me - I'd best get one for Butcher, and have her take those classes.\" He looked at Slippery. \"I don't have any personal experience myself, but I'm told they're very comfortable, and no one else even knows that they are even there, until they find out the hard way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that most Unlicensed Thieves don't bother an Assassin,\" said Slippery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not talking about those guys,\" said Rutabaga. \"There's always that someone who sees a pretty woman, and decides to force himself on her; especially if you decide to not be wearing black on that day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a point there,\" said Slippery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Rutabaga. \"Now, would you mind getting dressed; I'm going to help you celebrate your birthday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed her the blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlippery looked at the blade, and looked at him. \"Celebrate my birthday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't take you out for failing an exam, but I can take you out for your birthday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlippery looked at the blade again. \"Um, I don't know how to wear this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga smiled. \"I guess I'll show you.\" He pressed his body against hers, accepted the blade, lowered his hand, and placed it by the inside of her legs. \"First things first; handle goes up, and the tip points down.\" He then gave her a slow, and gentle, kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, Slippery finished wrapping the cloth around her face. \"You're right; I can hardly feel it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga chuckled. \"Removing it is just as simple too; there's always a reason a Lady of Negotiable Affection has their client wait a bit before they commence to business, that being one of them. Plus, it helps to get them ready for the next part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlippery chuckled nervously. \"I can imagine how.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga grinned. \"So, have you ever eaten at a dwarf restaurant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I can't say that I have,\" said Slippery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know of a place that serves some very excellent rat; grilled, roasted, poached, broiled, or burnt in a fire and covered in ketchup.\" He then close his eyes and smiled. \"Of course, none of their cooking comes close to father's Rat and Crow Stew:  A minimum of one rat, a minimum of one crow, followed by as much garlic, onions, leeks, carrots, and potatoes as you want, plus whatever spices you wish to add. He always added curry to his, along with a pinch of salt and pepper.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see you have some fond memories of him,\" said Slippery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only time I've ever seriously seen him upset was at my nineteenth birthday party; someone had delivered a cake, a very large one might I add, and since it was for me, I decided to have the first slice. Thing was, it was one of those pop-out cakes, and out jumped a woman dressed in black, and armed with two swords. Problem for her was this; I thought that she was part of the party, and was a Lady of Negotiable Affection that my parents had hired to pretend to be an Assassin coming to claim my virginity. She soon found herself without any clothes, or weapons, and I was enjoying her. Needless to say, she was quite embarrassed at having not only been foiled by her mark, but of the fact that the mark decided to have sex with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Lady Two-Swords Too Sharp Blades told me about that,\" said Slippery. \"And every time after that, any time a female assassin went after you, you had sex with them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saves me the expense of hiring a Lady of Negotiable Affection,\" said Rutabaga. \"That being said, I've never heard any real complaints from them, aside from being disarmed so thoroughly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I've heard,\" said Slippery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only real issue was the fact that me and her made a bit of a mess when we rolled into the cake, when I was trying to take her ninth knife out of her hands. She had thirty-seven of them strapped all over her body,\" said Rutabaga. \"The Head Assassin had to laugh when she made her report to him over her failure; made refunding Lord Wonsin of his fee less painful. Of course, Lord Wonsin soon found out that mother didn't like someone targeting her son, all because I arrested his for being too rough with an off-duty Lady of Negotiable Affection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard about that to,\" said Slippery. \"I've also heard other things about you as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure most of them are slightly exaggerated,\" Rutabaga said, as he finished putting his own clothes on. He looked it over. He looked like most any other guard, save the collar around his neck, which had  a badge that was rather plain, if shiny. \"I'm glad I can wear this plain, and usable, outfit, as opposed to my Formal Outfit; I wish someone would set that horrible thing on fire.\" He grabbed the only thing of finery that set him apart from the other guards, a red cape with gold embroidering. Other officers might wear red capes, but none had the gold thread, and he was all right with just that detail. After all, the cape helped keep the rain off when need be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at Slippery. \"I see you're dressed. Let's go.\"</span></div></div>",

Are you alright?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh! Just great!

It was a safe enough statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two figures looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's going to be trouble,\" the one said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Especially if whomever it was wasn't a member of the Assassins Guild,\" said the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" the person asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must be new to the area; are you affiliated with either the Assassins' Guild or the Thieves Guild?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trying to get registered with them, but it's taking a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say that the Head Assassin's wife has a thing for the Commander of the Guard; he's the only one to ever survive her cooking, and enjoyed it,\" the one Thief said. \"If you aren't an Assassin when you try to kill him, or don't hire an Assassin to do the job, you get a Contract placed on your head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep,\" the other Thief said. \"By now every Assassin has heard the call, and is off to collect the Contract.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the female Assassins will end up getting something else as well from the Commander,\" the first Thief said, nudging the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second Thief chuckled. \"I hear that; in fact, he'll be busy with one tonight - I was over by that area, and he caught a young one who is to die for, and - oh boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She that good looking?\" the first Thief asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, and she was naked, as was he, and he was showing her how to wear a Slimmer Blade - needed to visit a Lady of Negotiable Affection to take care of something after that,\" the second Thief said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first Thief raised an eyebrow. \"Good show?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, mainly he kissed her, but she was a young one, with all of her teeth, and no previous injuries from failures,\" the second Thief said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first Thief nodded. \"I suppose that would make sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, where did that other guy go?\" the second Thief asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first Thief turned, and saw that the mysterious person had left. \"Must of had important business.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, let's hope that the Guards and Assassins catch that non-Assassin assassin,\" the second Thief said. \"The streets aren't safe to rob folks on when those sorts of people are about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I forgot to ask exactly whom he was trying to affiliate himself with,\" the first Thief said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think he was an Unlicensed thief, or a non-Assassin assassin?\" the second Thief asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best to let others know.\" The first Thief pulled out a whistle, and blew on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure kept running, and eventually decided he was too obvious on the rooftops, and climbed down the ladder on the side of a home, and dropped into an alley, and started to walk, when he noticed someone at the other end of the alley. \"Could you step aside?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could, but I won't,\" the person said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why won't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person chuckled. \"One, you tried to kill me. Two, you shot one of my guards, and you would have killed him if it wasn't for the fact that he's a zombie. Three, you are obviously not affiliated with the Assassins, who have the decency to try to do the job while I'm home to avoid harming the wrong people, which the Assassins frown upon. Fourth, I had to take my clothes off to pursue you in my wolf form, and unless you have a spare outfit, I don't want to be naked in Public - they might end up laughing at me. Of course, they'd laugh harder at you. Fifth, there's five Assassins waiting for you; unless you come with me, or another Guard, you will find yourself very dead, and it will be Legal. Of course, you're still going to hang; if Slim had been Human, you would have killed him, and you can't just get away with that sort of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure tried to scale the wall of the home, when he dropped once more, dodging a crossbow bolt that was now embedded where his head had been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you; either you come with me and my Guards, or the Assassins kill you,\" the Commander said. \"They don't like competition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, the would-be killer was being escorted by some Guards, and Rutabaga was wearing his uniform. \"Thanks for the assist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" said Slippery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're good with the crossbow, and you made just enough noise to make him know something was wrong, forcing him to drop, just before you pulled the trigger,\" said Rutabaga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's not like it's 12:07 yet,\" said Slippery. \"A test is one thing, but an actual killing, well, there might be issues.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see about putting in a good word with the Head Assassin, so that things are made official,\" said Rutabaga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Slippery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, let's go celebrate your birthday,\" said Rutabaga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me; just how good is dwarf cooking?\" Slippery asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga chuckled. \"I'll be honest; it helps if you were raised on it to truly appreciate it. Now, come on.\"</span></div></div>",

Most hire special rat catchers to catch their supply, but these guys raise theirs on a farm, and feed their rats some really good food, which affects the flavor. Of course, the taste doesn't compare to a wild rat from the fields and such; very little fat on those, if any, but your average person isn't going to want to eat it. That's why they come up with these fancy names like <i>Le Rat Recouvert de Saveur de Citron et D'ail</i>, which means <i>The Rat Covered in Lemon and Garlic Flavoring</i> - give something a foreign sounding name, and folks will pay money to eat it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like that one place that serves boiled boot leather, yet everyone there speaks like they're from Florance, even though they are really from around here?\" Slippery asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga grinned. \"They know how to make some really good boiled boot leather.

I doubt it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know that the Assassins' Guild has a large library, and lots of diagrams of those they've killed over the years, and this has included a number of Royalty - Kings, Queens, Princes, Princesses, to say nothing about Bastards and Illegitimates. You share certain features with a number of the later ones, as does your father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga grinned. \"It is well-known that the Royals had a habit of convincing women, and men, into their beds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds familiar.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, while it is well-know that more than a few maids and serving wenches ended up carrying some Prince's illegitimate issue, some of which ended up taking the crown, what isn't well-known is that those women also had their own husbands that they had children with as well,\" said Rutabaga. \"Maybe the reason I share some of the Royal features is because while I'm related to the Royal bloodline, but I'm really of the legitimate issue that the servant in question had with their lawful husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose that's one way of putting it,\" said Slippery. \"Still, you could still be of the Royal bloodline.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga grinned. \"Given that there has been a number of Illegitimates and Bastards, lots of people could be of Royal blood, like the guy outside shoveling horse dung.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlippery glanced out the window. \"Possible, but it would be a ridiculous story - from Dung Shoveler to King.\" She looked at Rutabaga. \"Finding out that the Commander of the Guards was secretly the King, now that would be a story.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you ever asked why, if I really was the King, did I never ask for the throne?\" Rutabaga asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never thought about that,\" said Slippery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's very simple; it would be too confining,\" said Rutabaga. \"As a Guard, I come and go as I please, I don't need to seek out a wife, although mother wishes that I find one, I'm not expected to have children, although mother wants grandkids, and no one bothers me, unless they have to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Slippery. \"By the way....\"</span></div></div>",

On the other hand, if they have a doggy door, they tend to have a dog, who might not like seeing someone else using their door.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlippery gave a faint chuckle. \"Could say the same about werewolves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most are somewhat territorial,\" said Rutabaga. \"Same with vampires. In the areas that they rule, bandits have to make deals in order to operate; forty percent of the loot goes to the local Count or Baron, roads must be maintained, travelers are not to be harmed, and they are to go after bandits that don't follow the rules. In short, they collect tolls, maintain the roads, and act as local law enforcement. After all, they don't want to incur the wrath of a werewolf or vampire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and it seems that it would be ill-advised to incur yours,\" said Slippery. \"I heard about Lord Sorid; one of your guards was in a relationship with his daughter, and thus Lord Sorid had placed a Contract on him, or rather was in the process of doing so, when you showed up, and offered double the price that Lord Sorid had placed on your guard, for a Contract on Lord Sorid, which caused Lord Sorid to rethink his offer, and thus backed away from it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like my guards getting killed,\" said Rutabaga.</span></div></div>",

In a Sex Competition, it would rank in the upper half of the low score end. There was nothing fantastic, or poetry inspiring about it. No one would paint a work of art around it. That being said, it wasn't terrible, it wasn't disgusting, it wasn't painful, and, aside from having to <i>thoroughly</i> disarm the Assassin once again, including her new Slimmer Blade, the encounter could be, basically, taking word for word, and scene for scene, from the book <i>Et Libri De News: Quam Ad Sexum Habent - Pro Tironibus</i>, which all couples were advised to read before their first time having sex with each other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn short, it was very basic sex - once disarming Slippery of her weaponry, and disrobing her, and himself, Rutabaga put on a Zonkier, which was a well-known Preventative, and was less painful than an encounter with a Slimmer Blade, especially once he removed her Slimmer Blade, which Slippery admitted to being very comfortable. He then took her to his bed and, well, let's just say that the sounds of clinking chains were not needed. Granted, Rutabaga took Slippery's virginity that night, but, true to his word, he didn't ruin her for all men - especially her husband-to-be. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, when Slippery later made her report, she did say that her experience was pleasant, that Rutabaga had been very gentle with her, and that, despite failing to incapacitate Rutabaga during the test, bared him no ill-will, and hoped to see him on less Official Business, and hoped to work with him at some point in the future. This, plus the fact that she aided in the capture of a non-Assassin assassin spoke volumes to the Head Assassin, and thus Slippery was given a Copper Blade, and was now an Official Assassin.

A while later, she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga smiled. \"So, that was Cyan's daughter - beautiful, yet deadly, well, maybe in time.\" He laid his head down, and closed his eyes to go to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Besides, it was just an exam.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case, that's part of why I've been asked to talk to you,\" said Lisa. \"Eventually someone is going to hire us to do the deed, and unlike Assassins, who specialize in killing humans and things that die easily, we know how to kill werewolves and the like. Then there's the fact that easily a third of your guards are not humans, and most fit the criteria for targets we take jobs for.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga stared at Lisa. \"I'm very protective of my guards; anyone who tries to hire an Assassin to kill them gets a Doubled-Fee placed upon their head - usually makes them think twice about going through with the hiring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and the fact that the Head Assassin's wife has a thing for you makes things tricky as well, although Head Slayer is talking to Head Assassin about the Automatic Contract placed one those who don't hire Assassins to do the job,\" said Lisa. \"After all, I don't want to kill you, only to find a black crossbow bolt piercing my skull soon afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Smart,\" said Rutabaga. \"So, the Slayers are trying to have an affiliation with the Assassins, or at least an understanding, in the event you guys get hired to kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pretty much,\" said Lisa. \"Head Slayer asked me to inform you about it, so that the next time you see me, it won't be to have a friendly chat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga smiled. \"Nice to know.\" He opened up a drawer, and placed a Zonkier packet on the bed stand. \"In that case, tell Head Slayer that if he accepts contracts on me, one of three things will happen - either I'll get killed, which is unlikely, or his male slayers will get their arms or legs broken, or his female slayers will find themselves in my bed, with me on, and in, them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked at the Zonkier packet, and looked at Rutabaga. \"You'll do the same to us as you do to Assassins?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just doing a job,\" said Rutabaga. \"Can't arrest you for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, I'll go tell Head Slayer.\" Lisa reached for her crossbow, only to find it being knocked away, and for herself to be pinned up against the wall, with a blade at her throat.

It was a slightly feral scent, as if it came from an untamed beast. Then, she felt something else, and glanced down, just in time to see her knife belt drop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do realize I have more than just a few-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when she felt Rutabaga's hand under the back of her shirt, and heard the thud of her sword hitting the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really are that thorough,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga grinned, and lifted something up to her eyes. It was a Slimmer Blade. Specifically, <i>her</i> Slimmer Blade, which was coated in silver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very thorough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, Lisa was placing her knife belt back on. \"That was rather memorable. I just hope father doesn't try something foolish, same with my fiance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell them that I only did to you the same as I do to a lot of women that try to kill me,\" said Rutabaga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa grinned. \"I'll keep that in mind.\" She then left the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, for some actual sleep.\"</span></div></div>",

Couldn't sit for a week.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, besides young Mages, who else do you think it is?\" Rutabaga asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rival Thieves, probably,\" said Head Thief. \"Foreigners, Wannabe-recruits that couldn't pass the mustard, one of the illegal gangs we've dealt with over the years, or maybe someone on the inside who wants my place.

Could even just be some kids doing it for kicks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said Rutabaga as he got out a sheet of paper, and wrote the information down. \"I'll assign some people to look into it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Head Thief. \"Also, please, keep this discrete. It would be embarrassing if folks found out that someone has been out-thieving us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" said Rutabaga. \"This will remain between you, me, and the twenty others listening in right at this moment, unless they want to piss me off!\" He looked at the door, where the sounds of scurrying away were heard. He looked out the window, and saw more than a few shutters close, and plenty of birds flying away, carrying gnomes and other small folk. He also saw more than a few beggars shuffling away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" said Head Thief. \"Although Archmage threatened to turn the ones listening to our conversation into frogs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga grinned. \"That was his mother's favorite tactic of dealing with troublemakers, or so he claims.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for the help,\" said Head Thief. \"Oh, by the way....\"</span></div></div>",

He then walked to his treasury, got a bag of money, and spilled the coins onto the table. He was feeling generous. He'd had a good time with the Seamstress. The occasional fling and toss of a female Assassin was one thing, but a good Seamstress knew just how to treat a man. Of course, he wished that there was a werewolf in the Guild, for that would give them more options with certain <i>clientele</i> who had more than one form, although there was Seamstresses of the other races, or those who didn't mind having sex with those of other races who didn't mind having sex with those of other races. It was just that, while most women had no issue giving him what he needed as a man, there wasn't that many who catered to his needs as a wolf. In fact, the phrase \"Doggy-Style\" took on a different meaning when one of the people having sex had the ability to shift from <i>Homo sapien</i> to <i>Canis lupus</i> in the blink of an eye. That being said, the Seamstress Rutabaga had been with was one who, to be honest, was very <i>accommodating</i> to such people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga then walked to the door, and checked the locks. While things might have been arranged, he still didn't want to make things too easy, especially since the theft that would be occurring later <i>wasn't</i> the Legally Sanctioned one. He then took his clothes off, tossed them into the clothes pile, and shifted into his wolf form. He then found a darkened corner to lay down in, and to take a nap in until the time was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, a scent forced itself into his nose. It was the sort of scent that caused dogs to follow in to its source. Most Mages and the like were smart enough to pet the dog, or whatever, that came up to sniff them, or give them something to eat, but to those who didn't react nicely, well, the experience wasn't pleasant.

He carefully padded out to the dinning room, where he saw something filling a sack. He blinked, as he looked. If he'd been human, he would have seen nothing, but as a wolf, he could smell the scent of magic. It was hard to describe to those who never smelt it, but once you smelt it, you could never forget it. He couldn't see who was taking the money, but he could see the air shimmer, and move around, as if there was a being of air standing there. It was an illusion, that much he knew. It wasn't a good one, but it fooled the average eye at any rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe padded up to the figure, and whined. The figure turned, and he felt them look at him. Then the figure began to scratch his ears affectionately. Rutabaga leaned into them, as any dog would want to do. Whomever this woman was, she was good, and was smart enough to give pets enough affection to make them not bother her as she stole from their masters. Too bad for her, he wasn't a dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up, and made sure that the badge on his collar was visible to the light. A gasp came from the thief. He could smell fear coming from her. She ran, and he pursued. It wasn't very far. It wasn't even five paces, and with him on her back, the thief wasn't moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, Rutabaga shifted into his human form, and took her outfit off, removing the magic that had hid her from human eyes. He grinned at what he saw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want?\" the woman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you to return what you stole,\" said Rutabaga. \"It's not yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I?\" the woman asked. \"It was to be stolen by the guild anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I already paid my fee,\" said Rutabaga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked at him. \"So, this was just a trap?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga nodded. \"The Guild is waiting for me to bring you out. I'm sure you know what they do to unlicensed thieves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They wouldn't let me join their stupid Guild,\" the woman said. \"Them and their stupid rules.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think if you ask nicely, and offer to show them where their gold is, they might be willing to let you join,\" said Rutabaga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They won't,\" said the woman. \"I tried before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Rutabaga asked. \"I know who your father is, just by your scent. I think he'd be very happy for you to join in the family tradition.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be the problem,\" the woman said. \"He doesn't know that I'm his daughter, and I don't want any favors from him either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your father is-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't say it out loud,\" the woman said. \"If his people are out there, I want no favors from them either. I want to join on my own merits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Rutabaga. \"I've been there. You're afraid that you'd be placed in locations where your talents would be wasted because no one would want to upset your father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" the woman said. \"I'd have to reveal who my father is, as well as who my mother is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And just who is your mother?\" Rutabaga asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mother is....\"</span></div></div>",

He's done a lot of things that are highly illegal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sadly, we haven't had any real proof of them, until now,\" said Captain Rutabaga. \"Still, even the word of a former maid should count for something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"An elderly former maid's word doesn't matter much to the likes of him, and those are the sorts that will be on the jury,\" said Dragon Herald. \"Even if you could charge him for the rape, it has been over forty years, and her memory might not be so good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, at least he'll be forced to give compensation, to pay for the upbringing of their shared daughter,\" said Commander Rutabaga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only because the relationship will now be a Public Record,\" said the Dragon Herald. \"You'd be surprised at how many refuse to acknowledge their issues, many of which don't know that they are technically offspring of those with nobility in them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga looked at the drake. \"I hope that you're not referring to my family with that comment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Dragon Herald glanced at him, before looking back into the fog. \"Call me curious, have you yet to decide on a significant other to spend the rest of your life with, instead of these dalliances with female Assassins?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga chuckled as he looked back into the fog. \"Do you have someone in mind? I know full well that there is no danger of the family line dying out, not with most of my siblings either being married, or at least involved with someone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Royal bloodline aside, you are the Commander of the Guards, and a Baron, both of which count as minor nobility,\" said the Dragon Herald. \"You also have plenty of money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those aren't everything,\" said Rutabaga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That being said, I do have a list of noble families that have fallen on harder times with daughters that have yet to marry that would like to be wealthy again,\" the Dragon Herald said. \"I also have a list of wealthy common-born families that would like a title that have eligible daughters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do these respective families happen to have sons that are also of eligible age?\" Rutabaga asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know that your tastes ran <i>that</i> way,\" said the drake. \"That being said, the answer to that is yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then match the sons of penniless nobles with the daughters of wealthy commoners, and the daughters of the penniless nobles with the sons of wealthy commoners, and they will be happier that way, or at least more satisfied,\" said Rutabaga. \"I have no interest in getting married at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take your advice into consideration,\" said the Dragon Herald. \"Still, I do know of-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like for me to have a Contract placed on you?\" Rutabaga asked. \"I'm sure that the Assassins and Monster Slayers could give me a good price for someone to mount your head on their wall. I'm sure that you qualify to be placed on a List.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" said the Dragon Herald. \"Ah, looks like someone is coming.\"</span></div></div>",

Granted, the Tyrant was in position to take the Guild over, but he decided running the city would be more fun. Besides, the Head Assassin can't be Tyrant - Conflict of Interest - lots of people want the Tyrant dead, so that they can have the spot for themselves, and thus Head Assassin would have some difficulty placing a hit on himself, which is why he'll never take on the position.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand,\" said Vanguard. \"It's just that Assassins never take the cloths off of their faces, and I've never seen the Tyrant himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga grinned. \"Taking the cloth off of an Assassin's face means that they failed at the job, although taking their weapons off is an even worse position for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would know this very well,\" said Vanguard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga chuckled. \"Got one just a little while ago - a young woman out on an Exam.

I could use it to eat a very spicy dish, However, let's test this thing for real. the Fiery Dragon is notorious for their Scorcher Challenge. If this Glutton Charm is able to stand up to the Scorcher Challenge not only can I get a free meal, but a prize of 10,000 gold.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard walks up to the counter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello sir. What would you like to order?\" a serving wench asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to take on the Scorcher Challenge,\" Vanguard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wench's eyes widen. \"Are you sure about that sir?

Such a feat is almost impossible for an ordinary man,\" the wench said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll have to see about that,\" Vanguard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe serving wench sighs. \"If you insist sir, but be warned. Many have failed at completing the Scorcher Challenge. If you fail to complete the Scorcher Challenge you will have to pay 1000 gold.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe serving wench guided Vanguard to a large table. After Vanguard took his seat he slipped on the Glutton Charm. Within a matter of seconds a few chefs brought out the spiciest dishes that Vanguard saw. The whole spread was probably somewhere between 5-10 pounds altogether.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have fifteen minutes to eat everything on the table. If you complete the challenge in fifteen minutes your meal is free and you will receive 10,000 gold as a prize. Do you understand?\" the wench asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I do,\" Vanguard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the wench could tip over the hour glass Vanguard began chowing down. Vanguard consumed his food like he hadn't eaten in days. Thirteen minutes later Vanguard finished the Scorcher Challenge. The crowd around the table were surprised that someone other than the Tyrant was able to complete the Scorcher Challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations sir. As promised your meal is free and you get 10,000 gold,\" the wench said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe owner of the Fiery Dragon hands Vanguard his gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations sir. If there's men like you who could take down my spiciest dishes I may have to think of a new challenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If the day comes I'll be ready,\" Vanguard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard test his chestful of 10,000 gold and proceeds to exit the Fiery Dragon. Before he got to the door he was stopped by a woman wearing a red cape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on a moment, sir. Is that a magical charm around your neck? To the common people they won't know the difference between a necklace and a magic charm. Using magic items to win competitions is kind of shallow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I recently got this charm for saving a caravan mistress. I was just testing to see how it works,\" Vanguard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman puts to fingers on her chin in contemplation. \"By the look of things you have very little exposure to magic. Some people can get addicted to the stuff if it's not used in moderation. That charm you have won't cause magical weight gain, but the food you consume while wearing it can. And to make matters worse the weight gain is all natural. But who am I to judge. I recently moved to this city, but it's obvious that this Tyrant person is a dragon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard blinks in confusion. \"How do you know that the Tyrant is a dragon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just say I've traveled to a lot of places. Your town has all the hallmarks of being taken over by a dragon. See you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman walks out of the Fiery Dragon leaving Vanguard confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Who was that woman? It's probably not worth over thinking.

Still, Vanguard didn't feel very cheerful, especially when he heard the Commander yell out for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe managed to make it to the Commander's office, where he saw the Commander looking at a sheet of paper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hear you bested the Fiery Dragon's Scorcher Challenge,\" said Rutabaga. \"I'm guessing that it has something to do with the charm you were given yesterday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard took the charm out, and placed it on the desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga picked it up, and looked at it. \"So, this thing let you beat that challenge, and thus you are 10,000 gold richer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm going to need some of it to replace my toilet, and take care of some needed repairs around my home,\" said Vanguard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, which is why I suggest that you donate most of your prize money to the Widows and Orphans Fund we have set up,\" said Rutabaga. \"The Head Thief of the Thieves' Guild said that, since you won ten thousand in gold, you owe them a fee for Protection, and they want a thousand in gold. I told them that since you won the gold while on duty, said gold belongs to the Guard, and we've already paid our fee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard sighed. \"So, I don't even get to enjoy the money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll get to keep four thousand in gold, enough for your repairs, buy some nice clothes, and some fun,\" said Rutabaga. \"Also, if Head Plumber tries to rip you off, do tell him that we know about his son's late night activities, and the Thieves' Guild would be interested in locating the fella who has been Illegally Breaking and Entering, for the purposes of messing with folks' plumbing, which is why the Plumber's Guild has been getting quite a lot of business. Granted, the Thieves' Guild could care less about the plumbing issues, but they don't like people breaking into places without a licence; the last fella they caught doing that ended up taking a job as a Royal Eunuch, which isn't really a job, as the Tyrant doesn't have a Harem of scantly clad women.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of the Tyrant, someone told me that they believed that the Tyrant was a dragon,\" said Vanguard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga barked out a laugh. \"The Tyrant, a dragon! Good one!\" He then calmed down. \"The Tyrant is far worse than that; he's a Human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" Vanguard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That being said, the dragon clans will be coming here to bestow the title of Honorary Dragon upon him, which will give him high enough standing to talk to the Head Dragons, without the necessity of him talking to a lesser-ranked dragon first, just to work out some petty trade deal over coal, let alone something more important, like traveling through the Burning Lands to get spices,\" said Rutabaga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Vanguard. \"And I take it that we'll be stepping up on security measures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, the Thieves' Guild, the Assassins' Guild, the Magics' Guild, and the Guard will all be working together on this one,\" said Rutabaga. \"We want no mistakes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Vanguard. He looked at the charm. \"Do you want me to leave that here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I recommend that you do, but I won't make you,\" said Rutabaga. \"Of course, in light of this meeting, it is recommended to partner up with someone from one of the other groups. Your choices are Assassin Tetra Odon Tides, Thief Snatchem Grabum, and Mage Toooldforthis Taugh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what do they do?\" Vanguard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tetra specializes in poison, especially when it's added to food, but she's good with knives as well,\" said Vanguard. \"Thirty kills, and only one failure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard looked at Rutabaga. \"I'm going to guess that the one failure was you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga grinned. \"Word of caution; make sure to search her hair when she lets it down - she carries a second hairpin, which has a needle laced with tetrodotoxin, which makes it really difficult to breath. Of course, dwarf cooking helps out with one there - dwarves make food out of anything, including poisonous fish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Vanguard. \"And the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Snatchem specializes in stealth, and can rob you blind before you even know he's in the room,\" said Rutabaga. \"He has stolen a hundred thousand gold worth of money, valuables, and items, plus Lord Thoroughbred's Prized Racing Stallion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's one fast horse,\" said Vanguard. \"I hear he's not allowed to race anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, because he was such a sure thing to win, folks started placing bets on who would come in Second,\" said Rutabaga. \"Now, as for Toooldforthis, he recently graduated from his classes, and is now a full-fledged wizard. Very smart, very skilled, thirty years old, but he looks like he's seventy due to a classmate's prank that went wrong, plus all the other issues that comes with being that old, but has stopped a few demons from wrecking the Guild whenever someone messes up a spell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This guy looks seventy, but is actually thirty?\" Vanguard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The prankster had it worse,\" said Rutabaga. \"His entire lifeforce, including everything he knew, was added to Toooldforthis's. Magic isn't kind to those who fail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" said Vanguard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Consider it a warning, if you use that charm,\" said Rutabaga. \"Now, let me know your pick, so that I can tell their respective Masters.\"</span></div></div>",

Don't worry about Tetra Odon Tides or Snatchem. I'll be partnering up with Lady Tides and our newest guard will be keeping her eye on Snatchem,\" Rutabaga said.

I'm your partner for this mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard takes a double take of Toooldforthis. Before him he saw a bearded elderly man leaning on what looks like a magical staff. Toooldforthis was wearing a blue cloak and had a few potions on hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you, Toooldforthis,\" Vanguard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Likewise Vanguard. Did you know that on the way to the Burning Lands there's a special place called Wishing Forest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wishing Forest?\" Vanguard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Wishing Forest. It is said that the forest contain powerful magic. Hopefully while we're there I can use this magic to return to my youthful self once more. It isn't easy being a thirty year old with the body of an old man. Every day my bones ache and I have a terrible coughing fit. I usually got to take potions to deal with those hassles. Once I'm young again I can ditch these potions,\" Toooldforthis said referring to the potions on the inside of his cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. So you volunteered for this mission in order to restore your youth. That's understandable. I just have to pack a few things and then I'll meet up with you in town square.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.

Next thing he knew, he'd fallen off, for at least the third time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked up to see the Commander looking down at him, and grinning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you, lean forward when we go uphill, and lean backward when we go down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was,\" said Vanguard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga got off his horse, and carefully helped Vanguard back on his. \"Yes, and then the ground straightened out, but you were still leaning, and thus were off-balance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was some chuckling, and Vanguard looked, to see Snatchem riding a very expensive horse. \"What do you know about horse-riding, Thief?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnatchem grinned. \"Enough to steal them. And enough not to fall off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you steal that one?\" Rutabaga asked, as he got on his own horse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnatchem gave his horse an affectionate pat by its shoulder. \"Previous owner didn't take very good care of him, and forgot to pay his Protection Fees. The horse more than covered said fees. Of course, when Head Thief saw just how badly treated this horse had been, he threatened to go the Horse Guild, and you know how they are about folks who mistreat their animals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I remember the one from last year,\" said Rutabaga. \"Guy was dragged by his own horse, and suffered several broken bones. His left arm is still messed up, despite the Healers' best efforts, to say nothing about how his fingers were stepped on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very protective,\" said the figure riding behind the rest of the group. \"They want horses, and other animals to have their own rights.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard looked at the man; there was a lot about him that he didn't like. He felt like drawing his sword and running him through, but the man gave him a look that gave him second thoughts. Even the cloth-covered assassin Tetra didn't bother him as much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Might prove useful,\" said Rutabaga. \"Take animals away from bad owners, and give them to good owners.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man grinned. \"Good one, Commander.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does he have to come with us?\" Vanguard asked, quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dragons won't meet us otherwise,\" said Rutabaga. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard watched, as the Commander nudged his horse a bit, causing it to move faster, and thus get alongside the new guard. Vanguard didn't know much about her, other than she'd joined earlier during the week, and, prior to last night, had gone by the name of John Smith, although it seemed her real name was Sally Butcher. She had short hair, and was small chested, plus somewhat slim, meaning some would have taken her for a teenage boy, but a werewolf's nose wasn't fooled easily, and after a private talk with the Commander, Sally had gone to the Quartermaster, and told him the truth, which was a relief for the old man - there was already ten John Smiths on the force, and finding out that one of them was really Sally Butcher made things easier for Pay Day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard sighed, and looked at Toooldforthis, and saw that the mage had a wistful look on his face, as the old-looking man looked at the female guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She'd never look at me,\" the mage muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Vanguard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToooldforthis looked at him. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were looking at her,\" said Vanguard. \"What do you mean she wouldn't look at you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I look like her grandfather, that's why,\" said the mage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't stop certain older men from marrying younger women,\" said the figure behind them. \"I've met up with plenty of people who have taken on wives that are half their age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but in those cases, the husbands are twice as old as their wives,\" the mage said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I've heard of your condition,\" the figure said. \"Head Mage has told me about it - you look seventy because the one who pranked you was forty years old, and everything that was his, was added to you - age, knowledge, memories - makes one wonder what would happen if the spell was undone - would you really be thirty years old, or would you be two separate people?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mage looked forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard looked back at the figure. \"Just why are you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure grinned. \"The dragon's wish to speak to me; can't do that if I'm the city, now can I, Mr. Vanguard Fisher Green?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard looked forward. He hadn't told anyone about his middle name. He saw that the Commander had drifted back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you like chatting with the Tyrant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard looked back, and saw the Tyrant grin right at him. It was unsettling. \"I'd hate to seriously anger him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd advise against it,\" said Rutabaga. \"He might not look it, but he has personally killed thirty-seven Unlicensed Killers, who have tried to assassinate him - eight in one attempt, and that's not counting the Licensed Assassins, who got their arms or legs broke, as it doesn't pay to kill old classmates or fellow alumni who are just doing their job, to say nothing about the fifty-one kills he made as a Licensed Assassin, including the previous ruler, who had it coming.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did he do?\" Vanguard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga looked at him. \"Let's just say that he was a little too fond of children, even for most crime bosses' tastes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why didn't you do the deed?\" Vanguard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga grinned. \"I did warn him to change his ways, or else no guards would be there to protect him during an attempt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard looked back at the Tyrant, and then at Rutabaga. \"You hired him to do the job, or told the guards to let him through?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga looked at him, in fake shock. \"Do you know what trouble that would bring? The Commander hiring an Assassin to kill the Tyrant? Such scandal!\" Then he grinned. \"No, but it seems that there was a riot going on between the trolls and the dwarves, and the Guard had to go in and break it up. During which time, the old Tyrant was Assassinated. No connection between the riot and the Assassination was ever found, even when said theory was investigated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a fact that you are connected to figures in both the dwarf and troll communities; you could have set things up, meaning that he could have used the riot to his own means,\" said Vanguard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possible, but that would require me knowing that there was a plot to assassinate the old Tyrant in advance,\" said Rutabaga. \"Then again, lots of female Assassins have ended up in my bed, and it's possible someone dropped a few hints, which I might have used to my advantage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, you benefited from the assassination,\" said Vanguard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga grinned. \"Everyone did. Still, I'm surprised he took the position himself, not that I'm complaining too much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, why didn't you take on the job?\" Vanguard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you've heard the rumor about my supposed Royal ancestry,\" said Rutabaga. \"Folks would have pointed to it as the reason. That being said, I'd rather avoid running the city, and remain a guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Vanguard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dust cloud up ahead,\" said Tetra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see who it is,\" the Tyrant said.</span></div></div>",

So there's a fairy who lurks the forest granting people's wishes. Sorry to be a downer, but don't wishes go awry or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If granted by a djinn then yes. Wishes granted by the Wishing Fairy always come true, yet there aren't any recorded details on drawbacks though,\" Toooldforthis replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's find this Wishing Fairy. I have to see her in order to believe that she is who you say she is,\" Vanguard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard and Toooldforthis continue their patrol.

I am here to grant you two your wishes. Be warned though. You only get one wish per person and the wishes cannot be reversed. Also I can't give you fame or fortune, but I can provide gifts that will aid in those endeavors,\" the Wishing Fairy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how would this work? Do we just tell you our wish or something?\" Vanguard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not how the wishes I grant work,\" the Wishing Fairy said. The Wishing Fairy uses her magic to summon a chalice. \"All you have to do is take a sip from this chalice and the your greatest desire shall come to pass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's all it takes then I'll just help myself,\" Toooldforthis said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wishing Fairy hands Toooldforthis the chalice. Toooldforthis takes a sip and hands it back to the Wishing Fairy. At first nothing happens. Then all of a sudden Toooldforthis starts to physically grown younger until he looks his actual age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the gods! It works! Not only do I look my age, but I feel more powerful too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard stood in awe as the now young looking Toooldforthis did a flip in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's one wish granted. It's your turn,\" The Wishing Fairy said as she handed Vanguard the chalice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard slowly takes the chalice and takes a sip. At first nothing happens. Then Vanguard bends over in pain. Toooldforthis watches as Vanguard grows three feet taller. As Vanguard grew taller his clothes ripped to shreds. After Vanguard stopped growing in height his muscles swelled to herculean proportions. Finally, Vanguard started putting on flab on top of his muscles until he was 500 lbs. fatter. After the wish was finished Vanguard stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard was in shock over his transformation. Not only was he 9' 6\", but he was stronger and fatter as well. Vanguard didn't even feel fatigued as he flexed his meaty arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is impossible. How could I be extremely strong and extremely fat and feel invigorated?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had the desire to be the strongest and biggest man in your city. The chalice just simply brought your wish to the surface. I have to go. Farewell and may fate bring you blessings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Wishing Fairy disappears in a puff of smoke. Vanguard and Toooldforthis look at each other. Toooldforthis uses his magic to give Vanguard new clothes to fit his new body. They then resume their patrol. After their patrol they return to camp.

He looked and saw a woman wearing the outfit of a witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mavius Greycat?\" Toooldforthis asked. \"How is this possible? Wasn't everything that was you supposed to have been added to me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You weren't the only one to have a wish; yours was for me to have my body back, mine was for you to have your age restored,\" the woman said. \"We both got what we wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Toooldforthis rushed up to Mavius, grabbed her in a hug, and kissed her. \"I've missed you for so long; I always wished that there was a way to bring you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about that prank in class,\" Mavius said. \"I just wanted to mess with you, not turn you into an old man for real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the one who turned you into an old man?\" Vanguard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToooldforthis looked up at him, and chuckled. \"Well, what do you expect for a husband-and-wife to do if they don't pull the occasional joke on each other?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's always sex,\" said the Tyrant. \"Less trouble with that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not when you're in class,\" said Mavius. \"Teachers complain.\" She then kissed her husband again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard looked at Mavius, and looked at Toooldforthis. \"Um, she's older than you, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToooldforthis grinned. \"I always preferred older women; more experience.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga chuckled at this. \"Good one.\" He walked up to Vanguard, and looked at him. \"I see you put on a growth spurt, and a bit of weight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard chuckled nervously. \"Yes, sir. I'm going to be the biggest, and strongest man in the Guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga grabbed Vanguard by the shirt, and brought the big man's head down to the werewolf's level. \"Don't let that muscle and fat all rush to your head; strength is nothing next to having the sense to know when, and how, to use it. A dwarf with an ax can still hack your legs off, and I wager that trolls and golems could still take you in a wrestling match, for they know how to use their strength. As for me, my jaws are still strong enough to crush your skull. So, don't get any funny ideas about trying to take the whole Guard on in a fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't thinking of anything like what you might have been thinking I was thinking,\" said Vanguard. \"I have nothing but the utmost respect for you, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga grinned, his teeth showing, some of them more pointed than normal. \"I'll keep that in mind, when I write my evaluation on you; talk to me the next time you decide to drink some sort of magical concoction, or use some sort of magical charm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard grinned nervously. \"Yes, sir!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga let go of him. \"I hope your body can walk at a horse's pace in the morning; you're too big to ride yours, and Mavius will be in need of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand sir,\" said Vanguard. \"I'm sorry for disappointing you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just don't make me lose my respect for you,\" said Rutabaga. \"You've been on the guard for a few years, so you've earned some leeway; if I caught Sally pulling the stunts you've pulled in the last few days, I'd strip her of her uniform, and toss her out of the Guard!\" He looked at Sally, before looking back at Vanguard. \"You must lead by example; act without discipline for yourself, and they too will not have discipline.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard gulped at this. \"I'll keep that in mind, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next time, inform me, so that I can at the very least give you some advice,\" said Rutabaga. \"After all, the next concoction you drink might actually be poison, and that might kill you if you are not prepared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, sir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Rutabaga. \"You and me will take first watch. I think Toooldforthis and Mavius want to get reacquainted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard looked, and saw as the mage and the witch went into a tent that was very different from the plainer tent it had once been. \"I guess that would make sense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Rutabaga. \"Then, you can get some sleep, and Tetra will stand watch with me. Sally, Snatchem, you two get the last watch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And that leaves me to have a good night's sleep,\" said the Tyrant, as he got into his tent, as the others went to their own tents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga looked at Vanguard. \"Do you think you can use your sword?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard looked at his weapon, and chuckled nervously. \"That is something Toooldforthis forgot to fix for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga chuckled. \"There's always clubs; trolls and the like use them, especially since it isn't too practical to make swords in their size. Cheaper to make as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\"</span></div></div>",

Vanguard and Rutabaga sat by the campfire as they watched for any invaders who would wish to assassinate them or rob them of their possessions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanguard, it sure is peaceful tonight. We normally don't get many nights like these in Big Fat Pig City,\" Rutabaga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true. I just hope I can put my newfound size and girth to good use. I wasn't expecting the Wishing Fairy's magic to be as potent as it was. Initially I was skeptical of her existence and intentions when Toooldforthis mentioned her. I was afraid that the wish would of went wrong,\" Vanguard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let me get this straight. You only drank whatever that fairy was offering after Toooldforthis did? You really need to learn to control your curiosity. There's an expression that says that curiosity killed the cat,\" Rutabaga replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do sir. It's just that I have no idea of how powerful magic can be. When it comes to anything magical I have next to no experience on how to deal with it,\" Vanguard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't surprise me. When I found you, you were an orphaned beggar stealing scraps from animals. A word of advice, the next time we go on missions like these make sure you visit the Library before hand. Size and strength can only get you so far. Having knowledge helps you in any situation,\" Rutabaga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard nods his head. \"I see. I'll have to do that. Yet when I get home I may have to enter a few eating contests and wrestling tournaments in order to renovate my place for a person of my size\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you plan on rebuilding your home yourself? I know that the Builders' Guild offers a huge discount for anyone that can build their own home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the plan. I built my first house. It shouldn't be that much of an issue,\" Vanguard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga rolls his eyes. \"Just don't let your ego cloud your judgement. Last last person who thought they were so great almost got their head chopped off by a Minotaur.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep that in mind. Yet I might have to take up hunting and fishing to bring in enough food to feed myself,\" Vanguard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about it. We'll figure it out when we get their. Yet I don't think Big Fat Pig City has a Hunting and Wildlife Guild. Yet if you plan on starting a guild you'll need to be proficient at what you do and gather people who are interested in Hunting and Wildlife,\" Rutabaga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard looks at his boss in confusion. \"I wasn't even considering on becoming a Guildmaster. I still got to figure out how I'm going to use my size efficiently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga chuckles. \"I'm sure you'll learn quickly. There are a few towns leading to the Swamp of Peril. Also you'll learn as we continue this mission. You'll have plenty of chances to learn how to use your new size.\"</span></div></div>",

We'll take the women as well!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not going to-\" started Vanguard, until he was interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got a better offer,\" the Tyrant called out. \"Take me as a hostage, and you can ransom me for a lot of money from Big Fat Pig City, or give me to my enemies for a lot of money! My request is that you don't harm those who are only here for protection.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voice laughed. \"Very well! We'll spare your protection if you come to us!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tyrant walked into the woods, in the direction of the voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard tried to say something, only for Rutabaga to step on his foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get ready,\" the werewolf said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Vanguard could ask, he heard a loud crack, along with a scream of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My arm!

Get him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Snap!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My leg!\" called out another voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we help him?\" Vanguard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can take care of himself,\" said Rutabaga. \"And turn around right now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard turned, and saw that a group of bandits had emerged from the forest, and were rushing to attack. He reached for his sword, only to realize it didn't fit his hand anymore. He was about to call out to Toooldfor this, when he saw that the mage and his wife were busy in a magic duel with ten others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't distract them!\" came Rutabaga's voice. \"Catch!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard turned just in time to catch a central post from one of the tents. \"How do I use this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga stabbed an outlaw in the chest with his sword. \"Bash them over the head! Very simple!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need a new sword!\" said Vanguard, as he swung the post.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll talk to someone about it!\" Rutabaga tore the throat out of another with his hand. \"Sally! You alright!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's fine!\" came the voice of the cloth covered Tetra. \"She might even live if she can get over the idea of killing someone, and actually kill them before they kill her!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go help Sally,\" said Rutabaga. \"I have this section covered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard turned, and was about to go to Sally, when a sharp pain in his leg caused him to stumble. He looked at his leg, and saw the crossbow bolt. He looked up, and saw the owner having already reloaded his crossbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't miss a big target like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a hand grabbed the bandit from behind, and Vanguard saw a blade burst from the man's chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could say the same about you,\" the other person said, as they shoved the body away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard looked, and saw that his rescuer was....</span></div></div>",

I'm close friends with the king of Valaburg. Since we are going in the same direction for now I'll travel with your group,\" Veronica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like our party is just getting bigger by the minute.

He was keen on trying to flirt with me,\" Veronica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not the first noblewoman he's tried that with. Most who refused his advances rarely lived to tell the tale. Yet most of those noblewomen were trained assassins hired to kill him, but that's beside the point,\" Rutabaga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something I must discuss with you, but I need to do it privately. It has to do with my kingdom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. Follow me to my tent. Oh and Vanguard, don't do anything foolish like licking a magic mushroom or talking to magical cats. Your lack of knowledge on all things magical nearly got you killed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir,\"  Vanguard replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n With that Vanguard returned to camp and kept watch until the next shift.</span></div></div>",

Gunter always mentions her in a conversation. He describes her as the best knight in the Valaburgian army.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica and Rutabaga sniffed the air. Rutabaga rises from his chair to see who could be standing outside his tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Vanguard?\" Rutabaga asked as he open the entryway to his tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Commander, you're not going to believe this, but a man fell out of the sky. He claims to have amnesia and to have come from a different realm. I questioned him thoroughly to verify he was telling the truth. I need to verify if he's no threat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you brought him here so I can confirm whether he's a danger or not. We'll by the smell of things he doesn't appear to be armed. Send him in. I have a few questions I want to ask him myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard directs the young man he was talking about inside Rutabaga's tent before heading back to his own. The young man had black hair and blue eyes. He was pretty muscular and was dressed in simple garments apparently created via magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings sir.  the giant said you wanted to verify my story?\" the young man asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right,\" Rutabaga replied.</span></div></div>",

Since Rutabaga was with Princess Veronica and the mystery man all guards were required to stand guard by the campfire according to the default protocols.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanguard, do you know what the commander will do about the man that fell from the sky?\" Sally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard shrugged his broad shoulders. \"Knowing Rutabaga he'll most likely enlist him into the guard. Yet what gets me is that the man emerged from a crater ten minutes or so away from camp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Vanguard and Sally stood by the campfire at attention Tetra and Snatchem emerged from the woods. They then took a seat by the campfire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you guys find anything new where that man fell?\" Vanguard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing except a bunch of glowing leaves. I used a pair of magical gloves and an enchanted jar to gather them. I figure the mage and witch should be able to determine if those are the wishing leaves the dragons want the Tyrant to get,\" Snatchem said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe night was remained peaceful despite the few surprises Vanguard and company have encountered. Vanguard still couldn't believe there was a city full of people of his new size and stature. Being as big as he is most people would think that Vanguard was a giant or an ogre, but many educated people know that giants are 20 feet in height or taller and ogres have green skin and are two feet taller than Valaburgians. Before Vanguard could wonder any further a piercing roar could be heard in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What now?\" Tetra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That my dear is a Varigrand. They are huge beasts that roam Bowlworld. It is said that Ogres and humans native to Valaburg use them as mounts. They resemble huge quadraped bears, but they have horns that are similar to a ram,\" Tooolfordis said as he and his wife emerged from their tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did it find our camp?\" Vanguard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, we summoned it. We thought we do you a favor by giving you a new mount. We also enlarged your sword and made some armor via magic,\" Toolfordis's wife replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You what?\" Rutabaga yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you guys crazy!\" Veronica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a snap of his fingers Toolfordis uses his magic to hand Vanguard his sword and put him in his new armor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll need these to stop the Varigrand. We'll help you, but you have to catch the beast and mount it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Vanguard could ask the mage the Varigrand stomps into the camp and roars.</span></div></div>",

Something for our size-challenged friend to ride.\" He looked at Vanguard. \"Well, what are you waiting for; go tame and ride it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Easy for you to say,\" said Vanguard. \"You're not the one that's expected to tame it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tyrant raised an eyebrow. \"Are you saying that I couldn't do it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't say that,\" said Vanguard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It still sounded like a challenge to me,\" said the Tyrant. \"In that case, here's a wager; the one who does not tame, and ride, the Varigrand will be the other's servant for the rest of the trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We already work for you,\" said Vanguard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As in you help me get dressed, get my bed ready, and that sort of stuff,\" the Tyrant. \"Likewise, I'll do the same for you if you win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard grinned. \"You're on!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga chuckled. \"Have fun.\" He walked over to the fire, and sat down, motioning to the rest to do the same. \"Anything ready to eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got some dried meat and vegetables,\" said Tetra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Rutabaga. \"I hope you didn't doctor it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There isn't a contract on you, that I know of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" Rutabaga accepted the food, and took a bite. \"Now, to watch the fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard charged the Varigrand, only for the creature to toss him away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tyrant chuckled. \"Is that the best you have?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard looked at him, and rushed the creature again, and this time, decided to try and jump on its back. However, he was tossed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll have to do better than that,\" the Tyrant said, as he started picking some flowers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard charged again. Again, he got tossed. He looked at the Tyrant. \"What about you? All I'm going is wearing it down, only for you to just get on it, right!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A healthy Varigrand can fight an opponent for three days, without stopping for food or drink, or even to use the bathroom,\" said the Tyrant. \"You must fight smarter, not harder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see how you manage,\" Vanguard said, as he stood up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\" The Tyrant walked up to the Varigrand, and held out the flowers. The creature looked at him, looked at the flowers, looked at him again. looked at the flowers, ate the flowers, and let out a breath. The Tyrant patted the creature's nose, and scratched its forehead. He then climbed up its side, and got on its back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Walk.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature walked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature stopped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tyrant looked at Vanguard. \"I believe we had a bet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard chuckled nervously. \"Tell me you weren't serious about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tyrant grinned, as he jumped from the creature. \"Only if you don't make foolish choices,\" said the Tyrant. He then patted the creature, and it laid down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, how did you manage to get that creature to not harm you?\" Vanguard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By convincing it that I wasn't trying to harm it,\" said the Tyrant. \"A gift of flowers helps. You have to wait until it decides to let you on, and make sure to get off when it doesn't want you on anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've done this before, right?\" Vanguard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tyrant chuckled. \"This was my first time. But, I've done a lot of research on the creatures around here, in the off-chance we stumbled across one. Always treat creatures with kindness; they'll be less likely to kill you if something makes them upset.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well spoken,\" Rutabaga said, as he came over. \"If nothing else, it's a healthy-looking creature, and I'm sure the Valaburg humans, and ogres, will respect the Tyrant for being able to tame, and ride, one of them; only the greatest of their warriors manage the feat.\" He grinned as he looked at the Tyrant. \"Flowers tames the beast?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fancy a ride?\" the Tyrant asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga looked at the creature. \"Another time perhaps.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me?\" Vanguard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga grinned. \"You'd better get some flowers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, something caused the Commander to become still. \"Someone is watching us.\"</span></div></div>",

I'm the world's best licensed monster hunter. And who may you be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am the Tyrant of Big Fat Pig City and this is my hired escort.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're Tyson Rexius. I am Princess Veronica of Everwood. I thought you would be closer to the size of an average human though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyson started to chuckle. \"Five years ago that would have been the case. I since moved to Valaburg as you can tell by my size. I see the esteemed Rutabaga Blackfur is with you. I guess the girl and the men must be his guards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. The girl is Sally Butcher, the big guy is Vanguard Green who recently grew to his current size thanks to some Wishing Fairy and the other young man you mentioned I have no idea who he is. He can't even remember his own name,\" Rutabaga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? Amnesiacs are an oddity in Bowlworld. Also people wishing themselves to be Valaburgian sized is rare to. I'll you what. Let's say I know where to find a Varigrand from here for your friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's the catch ?\" Vanguard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you can mount a wild Varigrand who dwells just outside this forest I'll drop any theft charges that I would file against your party. Thievery is looked down upon in Valaburg. Anyone accused of thievery is subject to pay a fine or face imprisonment,\" Tyson said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He'll do it. I had no idea that your beautiful Varigrand was yours. I'm sure if he succeeds you can overlook his foolishness. Vanguard thought your Varigrand was a wild Varigrand,\" the Tyrant said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard rolled his eyes at the Tyrant. He was beginning to understand why people hated him. He's nothing but a jerk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great to hear. We'll find the wild Varigrand in the morning,\" Tyson said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess that wager we made is void,\" Vanguard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not quite. The Varigrand might have been Tyson's, but you still have to tame a wild Varigrand before I do. In other words, the challenge is still on. Hope you don't mind being my servant?\" The Tyrant said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tyrant heads back inside of his tent to get some sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vanguard, you want some advice about about Varigrands?\" Tyson asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, anything to avoid being humiliated by the Tyrant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTyson whispers into Vanguard's ear so only Vanguard would know the advice that Tyson was telling him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that so? And you're saying you know this from experience? That should definitely help.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.

Gunter and the Tyrant agreed on a new trade agreement that would benefit both Big Fat Pig City and Valaburg. Lord Gunter had also offered to treat the Tyrant and his escort as guests. It will be two weeks before Vanguard and his party can safely collect the mud they need from the Swamp of Peril. As soon as the meeting had ended Gunter asked Captain Cinderella Bloback to train Vanguard after hearing about his predicament, Vanguard and the others were currently at the royal training grounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That Vanguard is a quick learner. Most of the immigrants we vet struggle under the required training regimen. After a few days she may have him train with the troops. The training that the Valaburgian army undergoes is much harsher than this,\" Lord Gunter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the Guard I train my guards to be the best that they can be. Vanguard's been in the guard for thirteen years.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Sally asked. \"He would have been a boy no older than twelve or thirteen.

It's been two years as a matter of fact. I plan on proposing at tomorrow's royal ball,\" Gunter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Congratulations. I'm sure she'll make a fine queen,\" the Tyrant said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She sure will. Hey Rutabaga, have you been thinking about getting married, yet?\" Gunter asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't plan on it soon. I rather enjoy the company of a Lady of Negotiable Affection or a female Assassin. Besides if I did marry anyone they would have to meet my tastes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tastes? That's nice coming from a pervert who preys upon women,\" the Empress said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you still here? Go back to Shinara already,\" The Tyrant growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darling, I'm here for the annual Valaburgian Ball. Also I made a peace offering with Valaburg. In order for our nations to maintain peace we agreed upon having Ambassadors to broker trade agreements. Sir Marcus O'Flare will make Shinara proud,\" the Empress said as she pointed at a large hulking man training alongside Vanguard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. Within a year or two Sir Marcus will fit right in after the immigration process,\" A Valaburgian woman said as she observed the two men training under Captain Cinderella Bloback.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks like my sister has taken a liking to Vanguard. She's a hard woman to impress. Yet if Vanguard weds her he won't have to go through the normal vetting process since he's already Valaburgian sized,\" Gunter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not true brother. He may be cute, but I am not into him. If you don't mind I have to head back to the Monster Hunting Guild. Guildmnaster Tyson wants me to teach some of our new recruits.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGunter's sister leaves the Training grounds. Rutabaga and the others look on as the Valaburgian princess leaves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be awhile before Megaira returns. She's a member of at least three different guilds. In the meantime, we relax. The royal spa should be good after all that travelling. Also the attendants do love to pleasure guests.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Works for me. Hopefully they're as good as the Ladies of Negotiable Affection. They give the best messages while patching up torn clothes,\" Rutabaga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't be let down Commander Rutabga.

Obviously, they want you dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's hope there isn't too much silver-coating on the bolt, or some aniseed oil to block their scent.\" Rutabaga sniffed the bolt, carefully.</span></div></div>",

He was also drinking a glass of lemonade to quench his thirst.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you were still training,\" Gunter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was. It's just that I completed all of the exercises that Captain Bloback gave me three times. She said that she wants me to train with the troops tomorrow. She said that the exercises weren't challenging enough for me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that explains why Marcus is still training, but back to more urgent matters. How will we buy time if this slayer is trying to kill dear Rutabaga?\" The Empress asked. \"If they find out our plan then Rutabaga is as good as dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just remembered a trick that spies use to evade capture. It's called a magical duplicate. To make a magical duplicate we need a lock of hair or a drop of blood. After the incantation is cast an exact replica of the person is created,\" Simon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a pretty clever plan. The only issue is that Rutabaga runs the risk of getting addicted to the growth tonic. Once someone is Valaburgian size the tonic doesn't do anything, however it causes werewolves to grow faster and potentially larger. We literally have to restrict werewolves from downing entire bottles of growth tonic. Yet we may not have a choice,\" Gunter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's better than having no plan. Yet I wasn't planning on this,\" Rutabaga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga pulls out a dagger and cuts off a lock of his hair. \"This plan better work kid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It should. According to my memories I've employed this technique many times before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga hands Simon the lock of hair. Simon chants the incantation. Within a minute the lock of hair was consumed by light. Once the light faded the magical duplicate of Rutabaga was successfully made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, he looks exactly like Rutabaga,\" Sally gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because I am Rutabaga, Butcher,\" the duplicate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He even has my personality.

Once there I need you to make sure that he drinks as much growth tonic as possible and eats as much as possible. Don't forget to pleasure him and work him to the bone as well,\" Gunter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you wish milord,\" a female Valaburgian werewolf said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelilah then leads the real Rutabaga to Gunter's hidden chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that settled nobody is allowed to see the real Rutabaga Copperfindersson until his growth to Valaburgian size is finished.\"</span></div></div>",

Funny thing is, sometimes they come back later, for another go, which more-often than not, is less than a halfhearted attempt to kill me, and more of a desire to have sex with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems to happen with every werewolf I know, including me,\" said Delilah. \"Every male that I sleep with tends to come back for another go. Makes me glad that Simmins Zonk invented his Zonkiers to prevent unwanted pregnancies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The guy did have twenty kids,\" said Rutabaga. \"He probably didn't want to have yet another one, from yet <i>another</i> woman, in addition to the other seven women trying to get money out of him, to say nothing about how his wife threatened to castrate him if he got another woman pregnant with one of his kids.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" said Delilah. \"So, which parent is the werewolf?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be my mother,\" said Rutabaga. \"She and father have a very good sex life. Got seven siblings. Of course, some are cursed differently - my youngest brother Spinach is permanently stuck in his wolf form, although he works for a shepherd herding sheep, and has never lost a lamb. Then there's Lettuce, who is mostly stuck as a wolf, except during the week of the full moon, when she becomes a very hairy woman. Beet is a hairy man who becomes a wolf. Broccoli is a wolf who turns into a woman. Rhubarb is a hairy woman who becomes a less-hairy woman. Then there's Kale, who goes from a hairy man to a fur-less dog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fur-less?\" Delilah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He works as a servant/Seeing-Eye dog for a little old blind lady, who has a wool sweater for him to wear when she wants to go out,\" said Rutabaga. \"Finally, you have Parsnip - and she's just a regular human. Then, there's me - I can go from human to wolf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like you and your siblings run the full spectrum,\" said Delilah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More or less,\" said Rutabaga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyways, here's the potion,\" Delilah said, as she pointed at a table, which was also laden with a lot of food. \"Of course, you might want to take your clothes off; they won't be able to fit afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga walked up to the table, and looked at the potion. \"Tell me there's a Reverse Potion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is,\" said Delilah. \"Useful for in case a werewolf grows too much, or to punish certain criminals, who find themselves brought down to Normal levels.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if a Normal drank a Reverse Potion?\" Rutabaga asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depending on how much, might lose a few inches of height, or they might shrink down to only a few inches tall,\" said Delilah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Useful to know,\" said Rutabaga, as he took his clothes off. \"Of course, given how the food out there was just dinky stuff on toothpicks, might as well eat first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know the feeling,\" said Delilah. \"Why is it at diplomatic meetings food has to be things that are barely worth calling a bite?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga chuckled, and picked up a slice of ham, and ate it. \"This is good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cooks have their pride after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga felt Delilah's eyes on him. \"Like what you see?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Guntar did say that I was to pleasure you,\" said Delilah. \"Tell me; have you ever done it in your wolf form, with another werewolf who was also in their wolf form?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga grinned. \"It <i>has</i> been a while since I've done that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelilah smiled. \"I'll see to it that my size isn't much of an obstacle for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be appreciated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelilah took her clothes off, and shifted into her wolf form, as did Rutabaga. Rutabaga was a good-sized wolf, as far as Common Average Wolves were concerned, and was actually larger than the usual Common Average Wolf, standing three and a half feet at the shoulder, and five feet from base of neck to base of tail, but he was but a puppy when compared to Delilah, who was six feet at the shoulder, and fifteen feet from base of neck to base of tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe laid on the floor, raised her rear slightly, shifted her tail, and looked at Rutabaga expectantly. Rutabaga grinned as only a wolf would, as he mounted her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, Rutabaga stood up, and walked to the table. \"Tell me you're on the pill, or some such thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am,\" said Delilah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to know,\" said Rutabaga. \"I mean, I didn't want to get you pregnant or anything like that. I mean, that's how mother got pregnant with me; she and father had a moment of pure lust, and well, nine months later 'It's a boy! Congratulations!' and all that stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what happened between your mother and father?\" Delilah asked. \"How did they get together?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, father was a Sergeant in the Guard, and was basically cleaning out the lockers of guards who were, shall we say, less than Honest - I mean, he didn't mind it if you had a few issues, but he really didn't like those who abused their power and harmed others for fun - shortly after he joined, he got into an argument with then-Sergeant Orlando 'Hatchet' Scalpel, who was threatening non-Guild affiliated store owners for 'Protection Fees', so that 'Nothing terrible would happen to their stores', if you get my drift - Sergeant Scalpel insulted my father over his upbringing, and my father gave him what he'd been asking for, a really hard headbutting, which is part of how dwarves settle their disputes with each other - the one still standing is considered the winner of the dispute. Father was still standing, meaning he was the winner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was he brought up on charges?\" Delilah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems that when asked about their respective bruises, Sergeant Scalpel claimed he tripped and fell down the stairs, while father claimed that he walked into a door-frame, which, given how tall he is, would have been plausible,\" said Rutabaga. \"In any case, Sergeant Scalpel soon got transferred to another city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And your mother?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she was new to the town, needed a job, and the then City Leader had been getting some pressure from some more influential non-humans that, unless non-humans were included into the Guard, they'd take certain matters into their own hands in regards to groups of humans going around terrorizing non-humans, and I'm not talking about Slayers doing a job, and given that one of these non-humans, a fire-breathing dragon, was holding the then-City leader's son, who had been caught vandalizing one of their stalls, the City Leader agreed, and passed an act that required the Guard to hire at least ten non-humans,\" said Rutabaga. \"Like I said, mother needed a job, heard about the opening, and signed up. Commander Stoneface decided it was a Two-For-One deal, as he'd been getting pressure from the Seamstresses and other women to hire a female guard, so that they'd have someone to talk to about certain things they didn't like to talk to men about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, politics is the reason?\" Delilah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That, and they had a patrol together, which resulted in a Hostage situation, which resulted in them sharing a bed together,\" said Rutabaga. \"That's the basic story at any rate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds better than my parents,\" said Delilah. \"Arranged Mating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother's told me about those, and wants no part with them, and told me not to get involved with those,\" said Rutabaga. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at the Potion. \"So, I drink this, and I grow?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's how it works,\" said Delilah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in that case......\"</span></div></div>",

As Vanguard ate a group of Valaburgian women gathered around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pardon me good sir, but are you the man known as Vanguard Fisher Green?\" A Valaburgian duchess asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am milady. What can I help you with?\" Vanguard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe duchess and her lady friends giggle. \"So you're the man from Big Fat Pig City who wished to grow to Valaburgian size. I've seen you train with the army. Someone as new as you to our land you have impressed us with your talented swordplay. Thank you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Carolina Eve Viltrune. Don't mention it. Say would you care for a dance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard looks around the ballroom before answering Carolina. \"I've never danced before. In fact, we don'ts have balls in Big Fat Pig City and I don't know how to dance. We have festivals and feasts, but that's about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well in that case we can start by observing how these folks dance and then dance at the far end of the ballroom and practice. Come along Sir Green.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard follows Carolina Eve Viltrune as she leads he to the dance floor to observe how the other guests are dancing. Speaking of which the Tyrant and Empress of Shinara were currently dancing with each other as a way to make sure they didn't try to kill each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once you leave you will not tell anyone about the Rutabagas. Do that and your life is forfeit,\" the Tyrant said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't, but to ensure that it doesn't slip my mind I need you to make me a promise,\" the Empress said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tyrant tosses the Empress into the air and catches her as he continues dancing with her. \"What kind of promise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tyrant and the Empress continue to dance as the musicians get ready to perform the next song. \"Well, from what my scouts told me the Dragon King has asked to meet with you so you can become an honorary dragon. Did you know that in order to become an honorary dragon you'll have to be turned into a dragon?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure that's why, but what are you getting at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To ensure that I don't reveal that there are now two Rutabagas I propose that you marry me within a year.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why should I marry you? I hate your guts and you definitely hate mine.\" the Tyrant said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't I may forget and tell the first Fool I find. You know Fools love to gossip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but if you break your end of the bargain before then you will surely die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the Rutabaga duplicate and Veronica were searching for the slayer in case they had decided to make another attempt during the ball.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know this sort of reminds me of the festivals we have in Big Fat Pig City. Yet I never been to a Valaburgian ball before. After spending two days in Valaburg I see that they know how to get their soldiers into top shape,\" the Rutabaga duplicate said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While Valaburgians are always known to be immensely fat and strong they value a hard day's work. Also Valaburgians tend to grow in a manner that gives them a low center of gravity if I remember correctly,\" Veronica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So when the real me emerges from the hidden chamber he'll have the body shape and size like any other Valaburgian?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica nods her head. \"I have no doubt about...\" Veronica sniffs the air. \"Do you smell that Rutabaga?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rutabaga duplicate begins sniffing the air as well. \"I do and it isn't good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica and the other Rutabaga track the scent to just outside the courtyard.

The Berluvian also had a crossbow and several daggers on her person.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings Rutabaga, you probably know why I'm here don't you?\" the Berluvian woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're here to kill me. Who would of thought that another werewolf would try to kill me. Why don't don't you cut the crap and tell me why you are hunting your own kind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple. I was paid handsomely by the Assassin and Monster Hunter guilds to kill you. Oh and by the way I know that you swapped places with your double. If you were your double I would have smelled that magic coming off of you,\" The Berluvian werewolf bounty hunter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're a bounty hunter. My father describes people like you as shameless sellswords. My father always said that werewolves who resort to such a practice are no better than humans,\" Veronica said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Lord Fauna Flora Crestshield's daughter. Who is the werewolf king to lecture me on how I should live? He may be one of the few wolves in the world that can transform into an anthropomorphic werewolf at will, but he means nothing to me. I live only for myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you to insult the king of werewolves? You should show some respect,\" Rutabaga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Bellona Wolfblade. Four nights from now Rutabaga we'll have our little duel. Enjoy your ball while you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBellona pulls out a smoke bomb and uses it to ensure her escape. When the smoke clears Only Rutabaga and Veronica remain. Vanguard and the other guards arrive outside after hearing the commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Commander is it true that you swapped places with your duplicate?\" Vanguard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga sighed and shook his head. \"I guess you all heard that. Apparently this Berluvian werewolf has a better sense of smell than I do. I have to say that she might be more experienced than myself at hunting. She nearly killed me the other day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What gets me is why would the Assassin and Monster Hunter Guilds hire a bounty hunter?\" Sally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My guess is that the people saw this as a chance to take over the city while we were out of town. There have been rumblings that the people were getting tired of Tyrants running the city. For all I know they could have installed a king or queen that they elected. The thing is my siblings don't know that they're rumored to have royal blood supposedly. Besides my biological grandmother abandoned my father on the doorstep of a Dwarf couple or that's what Grandma Leaf told us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do?\" Simon asked. \"If the people had taken over your city in a single day how should we proceed? That werewolf bounty hunter already knows your magical duplicate is growing to Valaburgian size.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga contemplates the situation.</span></div></div>",

Besides I now have my own identity now,\" Gordon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we Valaburgians do have wonderful sex lives. If you migrate here you'll be able to enjoy the other things we offer in Valaburg. I could even give you a job,\" Gunter said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take it.

Work my way through the ranks and possibly add more muscle and fat to my frame overtime.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like that within a few days you developed your own preferences and still retain the memories of the original.

Like my smaller twin I'm against using magic. I only used the potion to grown to this size because we had no idea that a werewolf bounty hunter tried killing us before Simon brought me to life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good to hear. Yet the whole shared memories thing with your original counterpart is a bit strange,\" Delilah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it.

I plan on moving to Valaburg soon. If I recollect every sentient monster, like werewolves, are required to do this,\" Gordon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. I'll get Guildmaster Tyson. As Guildmaster he handles all paperwork and stuff like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaira walks into the far room of the guild. A minute later Tyson emerges from the back office.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rutabaga? Is that you? You look great. Most Valaburgian werewolves envy wolves of your size,\" Tyson Rexius said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGordon briefly chuckled. \"Actually I'm his magical duplicate. The real Rutabaga is still his regular size. The name's Gordon Howlmoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the gods! Astounding! So you still have your original's memories and more. Either way a wolf of your size is a sight to behold in Valaburg. I just need you to read this form and sign. Then Megaira will take this to the king for approval Sir Howlmoon,\" Tyson said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGordon quickly fills out the form and hands it to Tyson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks friend. Rarely do we vet a werewolf this quickly through the immigration process, but exceptions have been made in the past. You should definitely stop by tomorrow. You may be surprised that we have a few sentient monsters like yourself who are members of this guild. I believe Delilah's brother is a member too,\" Tyson said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well that's different. Guilds normally don't allow monsters to become members. Is this common here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's pretty common in other towns. Sometimes we go hunting with the guild in Everwood. For a city full of werewolves they actually have the same guilds you find in any town,\" Tyson said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGordon bids Tyson farewell and starts heading back to the castle with Delilah.</span></div></div>",

Especially a werewolf like you,\" Rutabaga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? That's not what the new guildmasters told me. They promised me a legal license if I kill you and bring back your body to Big Fat Pig City.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Looks like the nobles have already replaced the guildmasters of the Assassins and Monster Hunter guilds.

I cannot allow this!\" A woman yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga and Bellona turn their gaze to see an oracle dressed in a white robe. Her blond hair blew in the night breeze as she walked closer to the two werewolves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This isn't how it is supposed to go! There are larger threats ahead than mere bounties!\" the oracle shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out of the way or I'll run you through with my sword!\" Bellona said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oracle nods her head in defiance. \"I cannot do that. You have to listen to me. A great evil has awoken!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabga shoves the oracle out of the way as he parries Bellona's sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't safe here.

By the gods! Can someone convince this oracle that her life is in danger if she tries to stop Rutabaga and that slayer.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oracle began walking towards the two dueling werewolves.

There's a tournament coming up that Lord Gunter is hosting,\" the Empress said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why should I stop what I'm doing for an arrogant Empress like you. In fact, I'm sure I was hired to hunt you down and bring you into Big Fat Pig City by Lady Ruby Cloverday,\" Bellona said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ruby Cloverday? She's the guildmistress of the Seamtress guild. What does she want with the Empress?\" Rutabga asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't know don't care. When I strolled into town she was presented as the ruling leader of Big Fat Pig City. She offered a bounty on the Tyrant and the Empress of Shinara.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if I made you a counter offer. I can pay you more than any pompous Seamstress or guildmaster from that shell of a city. I can even hire you as my own personal Guard,\" the Empress said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBellona withdrew her sword. \"How much are you talking about? It better be good or I'll slay this mutt right here and now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who gives you the right to call me a mutt? You're a sellout for a full blooded werewolf,\" Rutabga growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silence! I will give you 20,000 gold for your first year of service. Any pay raises are negotiable based on your performance,\" the Empress said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Deal, As long as I get to show this mutt who's the better werewolf. If he thinks he can match my skills I'll prove him wrong in a contest of strengh by entering the tournament,\" Bellona said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBellona walked inside the castle with the Empress. Rutabga started clenching his fists as he was overcome with anger. The oracle was about to approach Rutabaga until Vanguard grabbed her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't do that. Don't you see that Commander Rutabaga is angry right now and that the moon is full. One thing I learned is to never approach him when he's this angry, especially on a full moon. He's more likely to bark and snarl at you if your an average citizen, but if your an assassin or a thief or try to attack him he will rip you to shreds. Five years ago I saw him tear three unlicensed thieves to ribbons,\" Vanguard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga howled as he transformed into a werewolf. After he transformed he took off towards the plains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh dear. I can't tell the Hero of Destiny my vision if he's not going to listen at the moment. Please forgive me if I have been rude, but what I have to say is of utter importance,\" the oracle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oracle followed Vanguard inside the castle.</span></div></div>",

There was worse things than running. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, Rutabaga found a tree, and got under it. He laid down, and looked up at the sky. He saw the moon. He hated this time of the month - once the moon rose, every werewolf or wereman, and other werecreatures, had to shift into their other form, regardless of the rest of the month, when the Change was at Will. For the next three days, it would be like this, until the moon wasn't full. It was annoying. On the plus side, he wouldn't be the only one that changed. He chuckled at the thought of the Empress finding out that her new bodyguard was a real Bitch!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Seamstress Guildmaster! Specifically, the ones who made clothes, and not the Ladies of Negotiable Affection. Why, he'd personally saved several of her members during a fire, and then there was all the other things. There were a few other things as well - the woman had to be a puppet ruler, for she was, admittedly, popular with a number of others. But, as for her ruling by herself, it didn't make sense. Someone had to be pulling the strings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, he heard a sound, and saw Tetra in the darkness. The Assassin walked up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's something wrong about this,\" she said. \"You don't just replace a Head Assassin with someone you pick.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga looked at her, and cocked an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He can't talk to you when he's in his wolf form, unless you too are a werewolf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair looked, and saw the Tyrant, who walked up to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He also doesn't understand how a Head Assassin gets the post.\" He carefully took out a knife, and stabbed it into the tree. He looked at Rutabaga. \"See what I mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Head Assassin has to groom his successor, to make sure he or she can do the job. Then, if the Assassin is ready, he or she has to kill his or her predecessor, otherwise, they will be killed themselves, and the Head Assassin has to find another,\" the Tyrant said. \"Thing is, the others must support the successor, or else the successor will not be Head Assassin for long. This False Head Assassin won't last long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As for the new Head Slayer, he or she will have to gain respect not only from the other Slayers, but from the Monsters in the city,\" the Tyrant said. \"That, my friend, is not easy, and that's in the best of situations. As it is, I doubt the Seamstress Guildmistress is really in charge - I know her too well. Someone is controlling her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who do you think it is?\" Vanguard asked, as he appeared with the others, including Gordon, who was a large wolf, easily seven and a half feet at the shoulder, and twenty feet from base of the neck to the base of the tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a few ideas,\" said the Tyrant. \"Still, I wish they followed the rules - they were supposed to send me a nice letter saying that they were leading a rebellion against me for whatever grievances they have against me - I mean, how am I supposed to change things if I don't know why they hate me if they don't tell me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what should we do?\" Sally asked. \"I mean, I'm worried about my family, my father, my mother, and the rest of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tyrant chuckled. \"It's simple......\"</span></div></div>",

Thankfully I was saved by a werewolf who had the ability to assume an anthropomorphic form,\" the oracle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said Lord Fauna Flora Crestshield is one of the few werewolves who could assume an anthropomorphic form. I just happen to be one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga and form turn to see Bellona Wolfblade in her anthropomorphic form. They begin growling and snarling at her.

Our marriage is purely political.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Empress runs towards the castle in order to hide her embarrassment. Rutabaga and Gordon begin barking and howling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want me to teach you two how to change into an anthropomorphic werewolf. I don't know. Mutts haven't been successful in this transformation. A majority of them just shift back into their human forms,\" Bellona said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga and Gordon respond by snarling and barking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll teach you if either of you can beat in the tournament. Do we have a deal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga and Gordon howl in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Damn. This is the only drawback to having an anthropomorphic form. You can talk to people and to feral werewolves at the same time. All I have to do is beat both of them in the tournament.</i></span></div></div>",

Plenty of fighters had shown up - guards from various cities trying to make some money, and get a better paying offer, mercenaries trying to make a name for themselves, slayers trying to prove their worth, knights trying to climb up the ranks, and even a few Assassins had entered - all to have some fun, meet up with old friends, settle scores, prove themselves, and of course, make some money. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the early fights were random, for the Royal Tournament had yet to start. Two fighters would enter a circular area that measured ten paces in any direction from the middle, where they had to shake hands, or whatever, and the rules were explained: no lethal blows, no killing, no leaving the area, and the one who was knocked out, run out, shoved out, chickened out, or just gave up, was the loser, and the other person was the winner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga entered one such circle, and saw his opponent, who wore some rather highly decorated armor. It was painted black, with flames and lightning bolts painted on it. He had a plum of horsehair sticking out of his helmet. Spikes rose from his shoulders, elbows, and knees. His cape billowed behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga looked at his own; his armor was plain, and the only thing that made him stand out from any other guard was his red cape that had some gold thread stitched into it. He preferred it that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then looked at his opponent's sword - it was one of those really wavy ones, which might prove useful in some areas, and could do some serious damage, if one wasn't wearing armor. He looked at his own - straight, edge on both sides, and was really good at cutting things. He would have to be careful not to harm his opponent too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am Sir Kerzon of Mogoz!\" his opponent called out. \"Vassal to Lord Kerchek! Protector of his lands! Slayer of his enemies! Savior of his daughter! Not to mention her husband-to-be. Those who face me, Die! Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rutabaga Copperfindersson, Commander of the Big Fat Pig City Guard,\" said Rutabaga, calmly. \"My job is to protect the city and the people. Many are the criminals I've captured. My guards do their job with few incidents. Those who try to harm them, face me. Assassins that try to kill me, end up sleeping with me. My enemies would rather flee than face me, but I always capture them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKerzon paused at this, and whispered, \"Do you really sleep with the Assassins that try to kill you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga pointed over at Tetra, and grinned. \"That one tried to poison me. Thing is, I'm immune, or at least resistant, to a number of toxins that legal Assassins tend to use, along with some other types. I'll tell you the details after the fight, win or lose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is she good?\" Kerzon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only if you don't eat her cooking,\" said Rutabaga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll keep that in mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two shook hands, and stepped away from each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said the Bout Judge. \"Here are the rules, which I'm sure you've heard before. The outcome has no baring on your stance in the Royal Tournament!\"</span></div></div>",

Rutabaga blocked the blow easily, and counter-attacked, only for his own strike to be blocked, fairly easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga looked at his foe again, and saw his foe looking at him. Kerzon had a face-guard on his helmet, which prevented Rutabaga from seeing the fighter's face clearly, but those eyes were a giveaway. The werewolf grinned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a Slithrenz, are you not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKerzon chuckled. \"I told you I came from Mogoz. We are known for being reptilian.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a few of your race in my Guard - very good fighters, and even I have a tough time keeping up with them in a practice bout,\" said Rutabaga. \"The lack of a tail threw me off for a bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Kerzon. \"My mother was full human, and my father was half human, meaning that I had too much human blood to have a tail. Still, at least I don't need to get special armor to cover myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the spikes, very practical, for dealing with Serpintines that try to wrap themselves around you - might hurt them more than they would you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and you are a werewolf,\" said Kerzon. \"Saw you turn into a wolf the other day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga grinned. \"In that case, let's stop holding back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fight started in earnest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Vanguard was with the Tyrant, who was speaking to Lord Kerchek, who was a naga. Vanguard had seen nagas before - one worked during the day shift, watching the prisoners - but the way Lord Kerchek lounged on a covered bench made it look like he could strike at any moment, and Vanguard briefly wondered if he could stop the naga from being able to sink his fangs into the Tyrant. Then, he looked at the Tyrant, and saw the former Assassin playing with the handle of a slim dagger, the kind that was designed to pierce armor, and scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me,\" the Tyrant said. \"You have spies within Big Fat Pig City, do you not?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Kerchek sipped on some wine. \"I might have a few, just as you have a few in Mogoz.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course,\" the Tyrant said. \"Always useful to know if you're planning a visit, or if something important is going on that I might be able to help you out with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Kerchek grinned. \"Same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tyrant popped a grape into his mouth. \"Tell me, what have they told you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Kerchek speared a piece of raw meat with his nails. \"Seems you have been overthrown, or so my sources claim.\" He tossed it into his mouth, and gulped it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tyrant sighed in annoyance. \"They could have done it properly, while I was still there. I mean, here I am, out in the countryside, where I could raise an army to fight in my name to help me regain my city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Lord Kerchek. \"If I had planned to take your city over, I'd be sure to constrict you, and swallow you before your subjects, so that they'd know the price of resistance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard gulped at this. \"You don't normally practice that method of execution, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Kerchek looked at Vanguard. \"It's usually reserved for enemy leaders. Others we chop the heads off, or hang. After all, eating someone is very personal. Besides, there's the human subjects to consider - don't want them to think that every criminal is going to be eaten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tyrant looked at the match. \"Your Kerzon is doing well against my Rutabaga. Future son-in-law, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Lord Kerchek. \"He'll make a good successor in time. Have you picked yours?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They'd have to kill me first,\" said the Tyrant. \"That's not likely to happen any time soon. Well now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the bout, Kerzon and Rutabaga had gotten too close to use their swords, and were grappling with each other - the helmets had been knocked off, and both were biting the other, or trying to, spending more time butting heads. Kerzon finally sunk his fangs into Rutabaga, but the werewolf had changed his own teeth, and had managed to bite Kerzon's neck. Now it was a matter of time. That was when Rutabaga started punching Kerzon with a free hand, just as Kerzon did the same to him. Then, they started rolling, twisting and turning, this way and that way. Finally, with a shove, they managed to push themselves away from each other. Both lay, panting, and exhausted from their wounds. They looked at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had enough?\" Rutabaga asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had enough if you've had enough,\" said Kerzon. \"You'll pass out before I do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga grinned. \"Maybe, but I have enough strength to stand, and you don't.\" The werewolf stood, painfully. He hobbled, until he stood over Kerzon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do?\" Kerzon asked. \"You have nothing left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga grinned. \"True. But you'll have more issues with me on top you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKerzon's eyes widened, just as Rutabaga's legs gave out, causing the werewolf to collapse onto the reptilian, knocking the wind out of him. If he'd been fresh, he could have easily tossed the werewolf off, but exhausted like he was, he couldn't do a thing. The Bout Judge started counting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKerzon tried to struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga grinned, his own weight and position being his only real advantages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Three!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKerzon tried to shove, but his arms were too tired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"FIVE! The winner, by Pinning, is Rutabaga Copperfindersson of Big Fat Pig City!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe crowd cheered as some Valaburgians came in to pick up the two immobile combatants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you fought well,\" Kerzon gasped out, as Rutabaga was lifted from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga chuckled. \"You as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair were then taken to the healers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was unexpected,\" said Lord Kerchek. \"I've never seen him beaten.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was a close fight,\" said the Tyrant. \"Could have just as easily been Rutabaga that was beaten, and I've never seen that before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's more that my spies have told me,\" said Lord Kerchek. \"Seems that demons might be behind your overthrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tyrant grinned. \"They could have been polite, and done it while I was there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLord Kerchek agreed. \"Yes, it was rude of them to take your city over while you were out here on a diplomatic mission, especially since you can now recruit an army to help you take your city back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you be interested in helping out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe naga nodded. \"Of course.\"</span></div></div>",

There's a Guild for it - Tyrant Ousters Guild - I meet with their leading members to discuss reasons as to why folks want to overthrow me - there might be a tax someone doesn't like, someone they like got arrested, or maybe my dog made a mess in their yard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it that last one is at me,\" said Rutabaga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You did order one of your trolls to grab something to bust Lord Scoona's front doors down,\" the Tyrant said. \"Said something was a pine tree from Lord Sallin's yard, and said pine tree took out the fence dividing his yard from that of Lord Vunar's, not to mention Lady Trurnp's carriage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She should have stayed home with her husband,\" Rutabaga muttered. \"And I had good reason to bust down Lord Scoona's doors - he ran over a poor woman as she was crossing the street, all because he thought that he could get away with murder. He laughed at me and my men when we asked him to come with us politely, and slammed the door in our faces.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before or after he insulted your mother?\" the Tyrant asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't matter really about that little detail,\" said Rutabaga. \"At least my mother wasn't there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, she would have killed him for calling her, what was it, a wet stinking bitch fit only for mutts and mongrels to have sex with?\" The Tyrant asked, in a knowing manner. \"Your father would have grabbed an ax to chop the doors down if he heard that being said about her, and then cut the guy's legs off, and he's in his, what, mid sixties?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father believes in being fit,\" said Rutabaga. \"He says he isn't just going to sit around in his old age, and plans to work on the family mine for as long as he can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He really cares for the Copperfindersson clan,\" the Tyrant said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They took him in, and raised him as their own; fed him, clothed him, taught him right from wrong, and shale from slate,\" said Rutabaga. \"That love is a more valuable treasure than a dragon's horde. As far as he's concerned, he's a dwarf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six-foot six-inches, as opposed to under five foot, but a dwarf nonetheless,\" said the Tyrant as he got something out of his clothes. \"In any case, here's the real reason why.\" He handed the object to Rutabaga. It was a scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga unrolled it, and looked at it. He then looked at the Tyrant. \"You actually gave your over-throwers advice on who to run what Guild? Is this some sort of trap? My one brother's name is listed as a possible replacement if I got killed! So is my one sister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that a problem?\" the Tyrant asked. \"You told me that they could do the job as well as you. Same with the other names. They could lead their respective Guilds, and, very importantly, not try to take over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga looked again. \"But the people who overthrew you would pick others, who wouldn't be able to lead the Guilds effectively, which could lead to a Counter-Revolt, and you'd use this as a means to slip back into power as a 'Leader-in-Exile Returning Home as a Hero' sort-of thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly,\" the Tyrant said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are Evil,\" said Rutabaga. \"No mistake about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tyrant grinned. \"I thought that the black outfit made it obvious, to say nothing about the Obviously Evil Goatee, among other things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be glad I'm not after the job of replacing you,\" said Rutabaga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, because then you'd have to deal with more people you don't like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we're just going to stay here?\" Vanguard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For now,\" the Tyrant said.</span></div></div>",

I thought I was dead when the oracle and Jane pulled me to safety. It was a terrible sight to behold. Ruby Cloverday has been possessed by a demoness. The first thing she did was throw our family in prison. I tried to free them, but I was outnumbered by cultists,\" Wolfgang said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cultists? Are they the ones that summoned the demons?\" Rutabaga asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe oracle sighed as she began to answer Rutabaga. \"The cultists showed up shortly after the demon infestation. Since Big Fat Pig City had been without a proper ruler for so long it was bound to happen. As an oracle it is my duty to protect the future king.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Rutabaga and Wolfgang raise an eyebrow. \"There's no way I'm going to be king,\" Rutabaga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Hero of Destiny never becomes king according to my visions. Your brother is the future king. Once the Tyrant marries the Empress he'll have to install a lord to rule Big Fat Pig City on his behalf. That's how Shinaran political marriages work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me as king? I've been pondering it over, but I thought that would never happen since I figured the Tyrant would place his firstborn in as the new Tyrant,\" Wolfgang replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually Wolfgang you would be my first choice. If I had kids they would try to kill me in my sleep. Besides you would still have to answer to me since Big Fat Pig City would be a part of the Shinara Empire,\" the Tyrant said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, since you're here I'll assign you to the first shift.

Rutabaga and Gordon seem to be desperate as you had pointed out,\" Delilah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. Whenever Rutabaga gets extremely stressed his better judgement is usually impaired. One time he nearly ripped several men apart because our youngest sister kept returning home late. It wasn't until that she announced that she had been starting a new guild called the Adventurers Guild that Rutabaga calmed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this the same sister who is a normal human?\" Delilah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the one. Thank goodness that she and her guild went on an expedition before the demons invaded. She's currently exploring the Mystical Plains with our uncle in Everwood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeliah scratched her chin. \"Don't most of the rogues in Everwood try to turn humans and other non-werewolves into werewolves?\" Deliah asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolfgang nodded his head. \"That's what she wants, I'm sure our uncle can talk some common sense into her. Thing is I'm the only one of my siblings who's one hundred percent werewolf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDelilah arched her eyebrows. \"Really? Well, you don't exactly give off the typical mutt odor and you did say you could smell pheromones, but any wolf with enough experience can do that. The only way to tell if you're a full blooded werewolf is if you turn someone else into a werewolf.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About that. I discovered this about a year ago. A year ago I bit two guards who were quarreling. I bit them to prevent them from killing each other. It was until the next night that I realized that they were acting strange. Once the full moon rose they underwent their first werewolf transformation,\" Wolfgang said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet Rutabaga was furious,\" Delilah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was. He actually witnessed the transformation with me. I told him that I had no idea. So for now on I'm not allowed to bite anyone in my werewolf form unless it's an execution,\" Wolfgang said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That explains why Vanguard and Simon are the only male humans in the Guard. Gordon did mention that most of the humans in the Guard got killed and were afflicted with a curse that turned them into monsters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's about right. I believe one of the John Smiths in the guard was transformed into an orc after he started dating a female orc. The only way to tell which John Smith is which is by their species. The other John Smiths are a djinn and a werewolf respectively,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did one of the John Smiths become a djinn?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was tricked by a female djinn into wishing himself into a djinn. Now whenever we need his services outside of his guard duties we rub his lamp. However, only Rutabaga and myself are allowed to use his lamp,\" Wolfgang said as he pulled out a golden genie's lamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Yet Rutabaga and and Gordon are probably going to expect you to start growing to Valaburgian size. The way they have been acting they probably won't listen to reason,\" Delilah said as she pulled out a growth potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolfgang sighed. \"Can we hold off until I can share my plan with Rutabaga? He needs to think this through. Sure three Valaburgian sized guards can crush a small army, but these are demon we are dealing with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large thud could be heard from down the hall. A massive Valaburgian man walked down the hallway. He was about Gordon's height, but twice his weight. Judging by how well the man wore his girth Wolfgang assumed that a large percentage of that bulk was muscle despite looking fatter than the average Valaburgian werewolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sister? Is this the werewolf from the prophecy? The werewolf who will crush the armies of hell with his mighty girth?\"</span></div></div>",

That sounds like a Valkyrie name to me - they're our Mortal enemies!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga shrugged his shoulders. \"To me, a Guard is a Guard - all else is moot. Racial, Political and Religious History is discussed in the locker room, but it is left once the uniform is on - dwarves patrol with trolls, werewolves with vampires, and atheists with devouts, to say nothing about nobles patrolling with peasants. To be fair, the pair did used to argue over certain things, until a certain incident involving a new cult at the time that decided the best way to communicate with their god was to sacrifice babies to it - seems Lucifier and Heavuns both took massive offence at this practice, and, while in the process of trying to arrest the culprits responsible for actually practicing this, utterly destroyed the cult. After that shared experience, they didn't argue as often, or so my father has told me, because other than which priest they want to bless their child, or which temple to worship at, they don't complain too much, although I think the religion in the household is sort of a mixture of both of theirs, but, like I said, to me a Guard is a Guard, although if we've never had that race join the force, they are advised to tell us non-lethal ways in which to bring them down, just in case they go overboard in a situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you think that you can take me on?\" the demon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga grinned. \"Of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well,\" the demon said. He looked at the ring. \"So, just what are the rules to these fights?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can't kill each other, and the injuries better be heal-able for the healers,\" said Rutabaga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything else goes though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weapons, potions, spells, shapeshifting, tricks, unarmed, and of course, simply tossing the other out, or making them quit or give up, or knocking them out, are all allowed,\" said Rutabaga. \"Of course, folks like to be entertained, so be sure to put on a show.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.\" The demon entered the Ring, as did Rutabaga. The Demon looked at the crowd. \"So, you like to be entertained! Very well!\" Suddenly, smoke began to billow, and darken, and expand, covering the whole ring, as the demon started to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga couldn't see a thing, and all he smelled was sulfur and brimstone. All he heard was the demon's laugh, which became deeper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the smoke dissipated, and Rutabaga looked at the Demon. The demon was the same shape and proportions as before, but now, he was twenty feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THINK YOU CAN STILL BEAT ME NOW?\" the demon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga looked at him, and grinned. \"Yep!\"</span></div></div>",

I found him while inspecting the castle. He had somehow shapeshifted into an orc when I spotted him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you sprayed him with some sage extract. Our shared experience with shapeshifters has taught us that sage has a calming effect on them,\" Rutabaga replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. Tomorrow is the last day of the tournament. The Valaburgian army has to prepare for another demon invaison. Besides that one of us has to defeat that Berluvian werewolf tomorrow. Being able to turn into an anthropomorphic wolf would grant us an advantage against those demons,\" Gordon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean like this?\" Wolfgang said as he transformed into an anthropomorphic werewolf. \"I spent the last few months practicing with Jane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So that's why you were asking Jane for a favor. Yet you probably got lucky on the first try. Out of all of us you're the only one who's a full blooded werewolf,\" Gordon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I only found out when I bit one of the John Smiths. I didn't know that he would become a werewolf after I bit him. Also, I kind of struggled with the whole anthropomorphic transformation. It's easier to go from human to anthropomorphic werewolf than feral werewolf to anthropomorphic. Anyway, let's enjoy the night and keep an eye out. Anything can happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.

Somestimes those healed through this ritual have gained godly powers, experienced a transformation, or both. If your friend transforms the gods do minimal transformations to avoid changing the species of those that are healed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why's that?\" Vanguard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The gods don't like to do drastic changes to mortals. They feel that it conflicts with their interests. That's why they allow mortals to willing change their species,\" the shaman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can agree with that. That's why we have freewill. Unlike mortals the gods know the potential and desires of mortals,\" Gordon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shaman began her ritual by chanting an ancient incantation. As she was chanting a beam of light strikes the lake causing it to glow white. Gordon lowered Rutabaga into the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter five minutes, the curse lifts in the form of smoke before vanishing. Rutabaga then leapt out of the lake.

Beside the golem a summoner dressed in purple robes. She was smiling psychotically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My beloved Tyrant! I will finally make you mine even if I have to kill you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You again. How much longer are you going to keep this up Darlina?\" The Tyrant asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear Tyrant, everytime you reject me I will only get legal jobs to kill you. I am a certified Assassin. Hopefully my new tricks are to your liking,\" Darlina said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga sighed and shook his head. \"For an Assassin who can summon henchmen you sure need to control them better. That wraith assassin of yours could of killed the whole city.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarlina's eyes glowed as she began chanting her spell. The Diamond Golem began to grow in size until it was 50 feet tall. Rutabaga and the others dodged the golem's attack as it tried to stomp them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kill them so I can resurrect them later and do it all again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard tried to use his shapeshifting powers, but he winds up turning into a mouse since he didn't have control over his powers. Unfortunately for Vanguard the diamond golem was about to crush him. As Vanguard was going to get crushed Rutabaga rushed in and changed into his Juggernaut form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Rutabaga and everyone else's surprise the diamond Golem's leg shattered upon striking Rutabaga's back. Rutabaga picked up Vanguard and put him near a tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A life or death situation is not the time to practice shapeshifting. Once you can control your powers you can try it. Just stay safe while we take care of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga and the others take down Darlina's diamond golem. Rutabaga then reverted back to his original form and approached a stunned Darlina.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How were you able to change into such a sexy form? I know that you're a werewolf, but when did you get Garnosh's Juggernaut Blessing?\" Darlina asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just recently, yet I prefer this form though. My Juggernaut form is more of an emergency failsafe. There's no use of maintaining my larger form, though I could find other uses for it,\" Rutabaga said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarlina teleported before Rutabaga could grab her. As she left she said, \"I'll be back my darling Tyrant and once I come back I'll make you mine!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Darlina left Vanguard walked towards the group. He had just managed to shapeshift back to normal. \"That was embarrassing. I was hoping to turn into a dragon or into a diamond golem. The only thing I learned from this is that your Juggernaut form is indestructible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That may be true, but I don't want to rely on it too much. It's easy to misuse a gift like this. Sure it's tempting to remain in my Juggernaut form, but it could be a hindrance when trying to do the job,\" Rutabaga replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if you're king. I know that won't take and the prophecy dictates that Wolfgang's supposed to become king, but the people want you as king,\" the Tyrant said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really need to chill,\" Gordon said. \"I never thought you would get this anxious, but this is a new low even for you. Let's go guys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga and the others left the lake. The Tyrant tried to keep his cool despite knowing that Big Fat Pig City had been overrun by demons.</span></div></div>",

One had to be a dwarf to understand what it meant, or have been raised by them. He looked over at Vivian, who was looking out the bars in the window. \"You thinking about them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What mother wouldn't be thinking about her children?\" Vivian asked. \"I just hope they're not getting into any trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trouble runs away from them,\" said Turnip, as he set his book down, with a heavy thud. \"It used to try to run away from us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you can take these demons on?\" Vivian asked, as she walked over to her husband. She looked him over - the human was over sixty years old, with a long white beard, the type that was the style in middle-aged dwarves, to say nothing about his hair. She then looked at a reflection of herself - she didn't look a day over forty. \"I mean, realistically speaking, you should leave the fighting up to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what would my mother say if I let my wife do all the fighting?\" Turnip asked. \"She'd cut her beard in shame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian chuckled. \"Alright. When the time comes, I'll let you take two, and I'll take the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to know we have the division of labor settled.\" Turnip was about to pick his poetry book back up when the door opened, and a high-ranking demon stepped in. \"Oh look dear. We have a guest, and we don't have anything for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe demon looked at Turnip. \"Explain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explain what?\" Turnip asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are the people out there are acting like we aren't in charge, and going about like they do when the Tyrant is here?\" the demon asked. \"I am the Queen's adviser, and I need to know this to plot our next course of action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's because this city has a long history of being conquered, and thus the people here have adapted the perfect strategy to deal with it,\" said Turnip as he picked his book up, and turned to the stone page he'd been reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what is this strategy?\" the adviser asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To go about it as if it's business as usual,\" said Vivian. \"Until the invader leaves, or becomes part of the city themselves, like everyone else. Then, it's business as usual. Who knows, you might get an important part in a guild, or a temple, or a business if you're good enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, the demon growled, and walked out of the room, and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was fun,\" Turnip said, as he laid down on the bed he'd been sitting on. \"Wouldn't mind having some more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian chuckled as she looked her husband over. \"You sure about that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not dead yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVivian grinned as she got onto the bed, and kissed her husband. \"Let's make sure that I don't give you a heart-attack then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the door, the demon guard heard a <i>Grinky! Grinky! Grinky!</i> type sound. However, he knew enough not to look - they might try to use it as a trap, or something to attack a curious guard. More than one guard had been killed in such traps in other times and places. Also, even if it wasn't a trap, it would be very rude to watch.</span></div></div>",

An image was on the wall, a street from Big Fat Pig City. There was a large demon looking at an old man, who had been chained, as well as a middle-aged-looking woman, who was also chained. In front of them was a black-clothed body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" the demon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's obvious,\" the old man said. \"Crossbow bolt to the head, a black one to be specific.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see that,\" the demon said, grabbing the old man. \"What does it mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It means that he was Assassinated, with a Capital A,\" said the old man. \"The note even states the reason - 'Killed for being a threat to the city.' It's completely legal. No arrests can be made.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguared watched the scene, and realized who the old man was, Turnip, the Commander's father. That meant that the woman had to be Vivian, his mother. He looked at his Commander, and saw him watching. He then looked back at the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to know who had my agent killed!\" the demon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Someone very powerful, obviously,\" said Turnip. \"The Guard doesn't investigate Legal Assassinations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me who would want my agent dead, or I'll burn the entire city to the ground!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Rightful King would,\" said Turnip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Royal Line is dead,\" the demon said. \"I would know. I saw the last one die myself!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurnip grinned. \"There's always Illegitimates and Bastards, to say nothing about the Legitimate children that servants and maids have. There's always another.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would you know this?\" the demon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For I <i>am</i> the Rightful King, and I want you out of my city!\" Turnip reared his head back, and thrust it forward, colliding with the demon's skull with a loud crack! \"Steal them blind! Stab them in the back! Kick them in the nuts! Sue them until they cry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when it happened. Guards came out from hiding. Assassins and Thieves spang from rooftops, alongside of Monster Slayers and Magic-users hurled fireballs. Other people also pulled weapons, or things that could be used as weapons, and charged into the fray.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard looked at Rutabaga once more, as the scene played out. \"Do they stand a chance?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would be a Million-to-One chance,\" said the Tyrant. \"Those Demons will need all the luck they can get, going up against old Turnip, and his wife.\"</span></div></div>",

Problem was, an Orc's definition of \"Good Time\" seemed to equate to, in most other peoples' languages \"A Bar Brawl\".

If they punch you, you punch them back, unless you want to be taken for a coward. Of course, if you can show them that you lost your hand in a fight, or were already nursing an injury, they'll punch their own selves for you. That's because once they punch you, they are honor-bound to accept a punch from you, unless you wish to insult them by not punching them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, they think that you're a coward if you don't punch them, and they consider it an insult as well?\" Sally asked. \"I don't get it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to get it,\" said Rutabaga. \"You just have to know what's expected.

He'd all but had been expecting the knights and guards to be wearing white shining armor, but instead they were wearing black, and malevolent looking armor. Surprisingly enough, he found himself in control of himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" he asked. \"Am I in the right place?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, an evil-looking wizard appeared in front of Vanguard. \"You are, Vanguard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard looked at him. \"Toooldforthis?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wizard nodded. \"The Commander figured out how to bypass the spell, all but instantly. Seems that Fairy Tale Spells don't work on those who are in a partial shift between two different forms in - you can't have a Noble King and a Savage Wolf in the same place at the same time, you understand, and he's stuck in this halfway state of man and wolf, and it's not like he's in a normal werewolf form where he's a mixture, but is stuck trying to become one or the other. The shock of seeing him like that is enough to shake off certain aspects of the spell for others.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, why are you dressed like that?\" Vanguard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm supposed to be his Good Magician,\" said Toooldforthis. \"Instead, I'm his Evil Wizard. You must twist your role in order to have any control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are the others?\" Vanguard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's put it this way, the Tyrant is in the role of the Warlord, but it seems he's been in this sort of thing before, and has changed himself into a Noble Rebel Bandit Chieftain type-of role,\" said Toooldforthis. \"Terta and Snatchem are his second-in-commands, but the Tyrant has worked to make them, and the rest, noble outlaws. As for Sally, she's stuck playing the role of the Royal Princess, and the Tyrant is supposed to abduct her and that sort of stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about me?\" Vanguard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're supposed to be the hero, who is to rescue the Princess from the Warlord, and marry her,\" said Toooldforthis. \"Obviously, we can't let that come to pass.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what am I supposed to do?\" Vanguard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be an evil asshole for one,\" said Toooldforthis, \"We haven't been able to shock Sally out of the spell yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, like I asked, what do I do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToooldforthis looked at him. \"You're going to have to rape her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanguard looked at him in shock. \"You can't be serious. I can't do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It isn't a matter of choice,\" said Toooldforthis. \"She's supposed to fall in love with you, and we can't have that! Besides, the Tyrant's role is that he's supposed to try doing that to her anyways, before you rescue her from him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, she's just a kid, practically.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to be trapped in this place or not?\" Toooldforthis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then you will either rape her, or be abusive towards her at any rate,\" said Toooldforthis. \"You must twist your role, and be the Villain, while the Tyrant becomes the Hero.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, in order for her to be free, I have to do it?\" Vanguard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You need to be abusive at any rate,\" said Toooldforthis. \"You need to place her in a state of shock to free her from the spell. She's the Key Character to the story; shock her, and the spell will be broken for everyone, not just us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like the idea,\" said Vanguard. \"I mean, she only joined the Guards this week, and we barely know each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apologize after we're free,\" said Toooldforthis. \"Otherwise we're stuck here for the rest of our lives.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do I have to do this now?\" Vanguard asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToooldforthis sighed. \"Well, about that detail....\"</span></div></div>",

Would you luck to play a game at my club?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe womam was known as Jessica Fortunata, an infamous compulsive gambler who's known to bet every once of gold she owns in any type of game. The fact is she became exceedingly wealthy due to her gambling. There are also rumors that all who owe her debt have no choice but to work for her until they paid her back every gold coin they owed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarge and Rutabaga didn't take too kindly to gambling. A good number of guards often get caught in a gambling trap and have even sold their souls in extreme cases. Also, they considered Jessica to be the most crooked among Big Fat Pig City's wealthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not today,\" Sarge Ryliner said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica furrowed her brows and puckered her lips. She then applied lip balm to her lips. \"Oh come on! Don't you want to meet my new waiter? He's a darling young dragon who gambled away all of his first paycheck from the guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga let out a low growl. \"What! I recruited Tarvonarch two weeks ago! We'll play your game as long as you let my guard go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir! You can't be serious? Fortunata is known to occaissionally cheat. She'll just wind up cheating and the whole guard would become her servants,\" Ryliner said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As interesting as that sounds I'm only interested in playing with you. So what are you waiting for. Let's risk everything like no tomorrow!\"</span></div></div>",

The club was run by those who either owe debt to Jessica or work there on their own volition. However, only members of the Thieves guild are allowed to run and host the games. As such Jessica can continue her questionable ventures and make a profit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside Rutabaga and Jessica started playing right away. Ryliner watched as each played ended in a draw. Of course Rutabaga and Jessica bluffed from time to time, but that was allowed since it's a legal move in any card game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll was going well until the performers stopped singing and a sudden silence filled the room. Then shouts began to erupt from across the club. All eyes turned toward the Fate or Liberation table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, punk! What kind of trick are you trying to pull!\" The muscular host shouted as he pulled a classy elf by the collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You call me a punk? You've been cheating the whole time. So what's wrong with stealing from a thief?\" The elf asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica and Rutabaga stop their game as the situation spirals into chaos . They walk over towards the unfolding chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What seems to be the issue here?\" Jessica asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I caught this elf cheating. He was using rigged dice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica puts two fingers on her chin. \"Do you have a thieving license? If you do I can let this slide. If not I'll have to inform the Head Thief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf scoffs and begins cackling. \"A license to cheat? That's rich. It's just a game to make money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a blink on an eye the Head Thief appears. Head Thief Hooler was infamous for his ability to infiltrate places without being noticed. Given that he's an anthropomorphic owl he has an advantage over most species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show your license to the leprechaun. If you don't have one then Bartholomew has the right to break your fingers,\" Hooler said referring to the host of Fate or Liberation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf began laughing even harder until Bartholomew pickpocketed him and grab both his hands. \"You don't have a license, bub.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe elf screams in pain as Bartholomew crushes his fingers with his bare hands. Sarge gasps at the brutality and display of strength. He's seen various methods for breaking people's fingers, but rarely has he seen someone use their bare hands to do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few moments later the elf was stripped down to his skivies. Everyone looked on as the elf tried to run only to be apprehended by Sarge Ryliner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do you think you're going? You're going to jail,\" Sarge said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica sighed. \"I guess our game will have to resume another day. Oh and don't worry about your dragon guard. The Tyrant already paid the debt earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga looked at the Leprechaun and rolled his eyes. \"Let me guess, this happened during our game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right. But now you owe the Tyrant a favor. I believe he wants to speak to Sarge Ryliner. I'm pretty sure it's due to a need for a new guild or something. Until next time.\"</span></div></div>",

There's a lot of people out there who wish to see non-humans dead, or worse. Here, however, they are free to live their lives in relative peace and harmony.\" He stopped, picked up a snack from a dwarf vendor, and tried it. \"Excellent rat.

Here, they live in relative harmony. The Kincs with the Shinz, the dwarves with trolls, and even the lion with the sheep, after the sheep has made sure that the lion has already eaten of course.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there a point to this?\" Ryliner asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They come here because we are a peace-loving city, which has no standing military that can be used for aggressive purposes,\" the Tyrant said. \"Some say that a military is needed for defense, but I see no need for one, as it might tempt my future successors to engage in aggressive maneuvers to take other peoples' lands, as opposed to the accepted practice of lying, deceiving, and other non-violent methods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand, sir,\" said Ryliner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That being said,\" the Tyrant said. \"My decision is this....</span></div></div>",

In a way he was getting what he wanted, but he figured that the Tyrant could change his mind later if a new guild or club rises to prominence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree to your terms sir,\" Ryliner replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm glad we agree. Before you can start a guild you must meet a few requirements. You must have a minimum of four people in your guild. All costs to starting a new guild is 500 gold coins. Last, but not least you have to find a patron. The patron may be a member of your guild or someone outside your guild.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyliner nodded in agreement. The funding wouldn't be a problem. He can also easily gather four people too. The toughest thing was finding a patron. Sure some guilds are lucky since their patrons are members of their guilds or extremely wealthy. Ryliner has even heard scenarios where gods or goddesses would become patrons for a guild. Yet again Big Fat Pig City is considered as neutral territory for all the gods of Bowlworld.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have 30 days to meet these conditions. See you later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Tyrant then proceeded to play a game of cards with the head thief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you have it. I believe someone should of found a healer for the guildmistress of the Seamtress guild,\" Rutabaga said. \"Good luck with the new guild.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga then walked out of the Golden Shamrock. As soon as Rutabaga left Bartholomew approached Ryliner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you plan on starting a new guild. Count me in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyliner was surprised. He didn't expect someone working for Jessica Fortunata to be quick to join the guild.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, so what can you do besides thieving that would benefit the Limited Defense Guild?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For starters I'm a demigod. I've done countless jobs over the years. Also, I'm a licensed Assassin. I can legally snuff out any threats,\" Bartholomew said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. So you're a jack of all trades. That will be very useful. Yet why haven't you taken jobs to go after the Commander? It's just that you don't come off as an Assassin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBartholomew laughed. \"Assassinating werewolves isn't my thing. Also killing freeloaders is beneath me. Yet he does have some regallity about him though. Yet his brother is the one who's most likely going to become king if fables are to believed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Rutabaga's hobbies do give that impression. Yet we need to find two more members and a patron though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you boys need a member for your guild, eh. I got nothing better to do and I'm interested in learning a trade anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyliner turns around and sees a faerie dressed as a huntswoman. \"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe faerie smirks and curtsies before Sarge Ryliner. \"I am Deliana Cressflune. I grew up foraging for my folks and hunting all sorts of critters. Yet what's a nature faerie to do when she can only use her magic to survive?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might come in handy. The more talent the better the Limited Defense Guild can be,\" Ryliner said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ryliner continued speaking with his new guild members an anthropomorphic tiger approached them. The tiger was immensely fat and wore a silver and black outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starting a guild. You need a patron, right. I can find you a patron for a fee,\" the tiger said as he gave Ryliner a pamphlet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyliner looked at the tiger in frustration. \"You're Alexio Crassroar. You swindle new guilds out of their money so you could stuff your face. Thanks, but no thanks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Ryliner was about to leave...</span></div></div>",

I'd pay him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tiger reluctantly parted ways with his money. He didn't say a word, but his eyes said plenty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice doing business with you,\" the gnome said, as he removed the ax. \"Remember to pay the toll from now on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlexio walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, thanks,\" said Ryliner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me Bigjim,\" said the gnome. \"And don't you mistake me for Littlejim - he's my brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" said Ryliner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're twins,\" Bigjim said. \"Mother always wanted to have a son named Jim; she got two of them.

Johnathan Rich, among other names, was what one would call a con artist, who was the sort that could turn an old pale nag into a young black filly, and sell it for more than what it was really worth. He could sell the same bridge, thrice, within the hour, to three different people. He could convince bank tellers to give him money, for a blank sheet of paper. He was clever. Then, he came to Big Fat Pig City, and attempted to ply his trade. He was successful, at first. Then, he got caught. Luckily for him, it was by one of the City Guard, who merely arrested him for fraud, and not the Thieves Guild, who would have broken his arms and legs, before hanging him. As it was, Johnathan Rich had found himself with a rope around his neck, for his crimes which totaled over a hundred thousand in fraud, and there was a good crowd there to watch Justice Being Done. Johnathan tried to claim that there were worse people out there, who deserved to be hung instead of him. The hangman claimed that while this was true, they were not wearing the rope around their neck, put the hood over his head, and pulled the lever, and thus, Johnathan was executed.... or so it seemed. Within the hour, Wiggins found himself before the Tyrant, and the Commander. The Tyrant informed Wiggins that there were indeed people worse than him who deserved to be hung, and, unless he wished to be on the wrong end of a rope, for real this time, it would be in his best interests to locate these people, so that justice could be done. Coincidentally, there was a slot open for the division that investigated such crime, and that Commander Rutabaga was interested in taking on Wiggins Wet as a guard, although Wiggins didn't know how the Tyrant had found out about his real name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWilliam Scarlet O'Hara - a member of the Highwayman's Guild from the mountainous area of VunderVuld, William was part of the group that collected the tolls on the roads, as well as fixed them, and went after those who illegally robbed travelers, and who didn't give a fair share to the vampire and werewolf lords of the area, and thus would send these non-guildsmen to the lords and ladies of the land for punishment, which consisted of loud screaming, especially when they found out that they <i>wouldn't</i> be drained of blood, or torn to pieces, but would be instead forced to do hard labor mucking out the livestock pens, among other things. However, William grew tired of the mountains, and wished to see the city. He was given a good recommendation by both the Highwayman Guild, and the Vampire Lord, as well as a Werewolf Lady, and thus, William joined the Big Fat Pig City Guard.</span></div></div>",

He continued to scream as the rope tightened around his neck. \"It's only a dream! It has to be a dream! It's got to-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a pounding, and suddenly, the scaffolding vanished, as his eyes opened, and his bed and blankets appeared before them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to his bedroom opened, and Wiggins found himself looking at a lovely-looking woman. Well, she would have been a lovely looking woman, save for those glasses, that mangy-looking hair, that flat chest, and the fact that she lack a certain hourglass-like shape. Of course, she was lovely if the last thing you just saw was a rope around your neck! But, the worst thing of it all was this - she was a stinking werewolf! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiggins had been blessed with a forgettable face - more than once his mother had to come back to the school because she had picked up a different child, instead of him. He could blend in a crowd, even if he was right in front of it. His victims could barely remember his features - between twenty and forty years of age, normal nose, light brown-blond hair, brown-green eyes, average height - just average, really. But a werewolf, that was different - each person had a smell to them. You could be in a crowd of a thousand people, and they'd still pick you out, so long as they had your scent!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiggins looked at the bitch - he could rightly call her one - and said, \"Mind leaving me alone?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depends,\" she said. She began to search the room. \"I smelled fear coming from this room, and I heard you scream.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiggins groaned. \"It was just a nightmare, dog-breath.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToo late! he remembered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was on him quickly, her jaws on his neck, having shifted into that middle form that some werewolves could hold onto, without going from man to wolf, or wolf to man, all the way. Just a little bit of pressure, that was all it would take, and he wouldn't need to worry about rope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright!\" he gasped out. \"I won't say it again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe growled, and let go of him. \"I'm getting tired of doing that. One of these days, Wiggins Wet, I won't hold back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the Commander would be upset if you did that,\" Wiggins said, rubbing the area her teeth had been at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Given that you are Legally Dead, at least as Johnathan Rich, I don't think he'd complain too much,\" the werewolf said. \"Besides, you know my name - Maria Whitefoot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiggins looked down at her paw-like feet - they were black. However, it was a bad time for him to point this fact out, so he kept his mouth shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, let me guess,\" said Maria. \"Was it the one about the rope around your neck? Or was it the one where I crushed your skull with my feet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rope around my neck,\" said Wiggins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once you've been hung, it can be hard to forget the feeling of the rope around your neck,\" said Maria, as she shifted back into her human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's also pretty hard to forget the time you caught me when I tried to escape from this mess,\" said Wiggins. \"There I was, enjoying a nice rest, as Jerry Stodgins, when you broke into that inn, dragged me from my bed, tossed me out the window, and decided to step on my head, shoving my face into a pile of horse apples!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria looked at him, her eyes colder than ice. \"You shouldn't have tried to do a runner. You should have just accepted the job, or, better yet, have been honest to begin with!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiggins looked right back. However, he had to look away. He knew <i>exactly</i> what she was. The Official Story was that Maria was his secretary as he investigated accounts of those with suspicious money habits. The True Story, at least to those who could recognize a werewolf-in-human-form, was that she was his bodyguard. However, the Real Story was this - she was his Executioner if he stepped out of line - well, she hadn't said this, but during the trip back to the city, she bought an old troublesome billy goat from a farmer, for a good price, and then, when they were a ways away from everyone else, he watched her kill it, and then eat it. She didn't need to tell him anything else about the reason she was with him. She was always there, never far from his side. Granted, it made things easy when he had to bring a Plus One, and needed to deal with those who employed muscle, not to mention that time in the alley when someone tried kill him, but he knew that she was the one keeping him on a leash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiggins then looked over at a timepiece he had, and decided that it was time to.....</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So, a female Human Guard - let's start with some options:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally Butcher: 18 years old, but is slim enough, and flat-chested enough to pass as a slightly short, and narrow man, and thus had signed up as John Smith - however, she was easily found out by Rutabaga, as you can't fool a werewolf's nose. Needless to say, the Quartermaster was filled with relief, as there was yet another ten John Smiths on the force, and finding out that one was really Sally Butcher made things easier on Pay Day. Coming from a family of Butchers, hence the family name, her father wanted her to marry a wealthy husband, but she wanted none of that. New to the job, Sally has her work cut out for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona Nightshade: 27 years old. Fiona was once an Assassin, that's with a Capital A, who was skilled with poisons, and other toxins, plus other weapons. She was soon given a contract - Rutabaga Copperfindersson. Things did not turn out according to plan, in a number of ways. While she knew what the penalty for failure tended to be where the werewolf was concerned, it seems that someone else had hired a non-Assassin assassin to try to kill the Commander. Needless to say, the Assassins' Guild doesn't approve of such things, and thus, Fiona went after the non-Assassin assassin, and, while she managed to kill him, she was fatally wounded, and would have died had Rutabaga not located her, and taken her to a good Healer. When she recovered enough to go after the werewolf, she found herself in a predicament that prevented her from killing the one that had saved her life, and thus, dropped her weapon, and allowed the werewolf to punish her - of course, he took it relatively easy on her, as she was still recovering from her injuries. While she still does the occasional Contract Job, Fiona soon joined the Guard, partially in gratitude, and partially to keep an eye on the Commander for the Assassins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLora Slasher: 30 years old. Lora is a Monster Slayer, a job similar to being an Assassin, but for targeting Non-Humans instead. That being said, there's plenty of risks to the job. After all, bring down a renegade dragon, and folks consider you a Hero - kill an Innocent dragon however, who was obeying the law, and you won't be able to get out of town fast enough before the dragon's family gets their Justifiable Revenge, and burns you to ashes. Of course, despite being a Monster Slayer, Lora has plenty of Non-Human friends, and the occasional tryst with them. That being said, while being a Slayer can be highly rewarding, it isn't often she gets a Contract, and thus took to being a Guard to pay the bills. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYokin Onaka - 25 years old. A foreigner from a foreign land called Eastrimland (in the Big Fat Pig language), Yokin had been captured and sold into Slavery, and was to be sold as a Sex Slave, along with a number of other foreign women from all over, and a number of men who were to be used for Labor. Slight problem - seems that Slavery is Illegal in the Big Fat Pig City area, and the Slave Trader was forced to give up his goods, or be executed for certain crimes, like Tax Evasion, and Failure to Pay Workers, and Kidnapping People for Forced Labor, Kidnapping People for Forced Sex, and, most importantly, kicking a dog, a dog that was wearing a City Guard badge, a dog that was really a werewolf, a werewolf who turned out to be Rutabaga Copperfinderson, who was just out for a walk and it's really a bad idea to kick a Guard that's just out for a walk, as he might arrest you for Assaulting a Guard! Needless to say, while the other slaves were found places to stay at, in areas where folks spoke and understood them, until they could either go back home or found a place to stay on at, Yokin was so foreign, there was no one who understood her, so Rutabaga let her stay at the Station, where it turns out that Yokin was a really good cook, and given that good cooks were in short supply, Rutabaga hired her on. Eventually, Yokin learned the language, and asked to become a Guard, where it was discovered she was a natural with unarmed combat, enough to the point that even the most muscular and well-armed thugs tend to surrender upon seeing her - if they are smart. Those that aren't smart, soon learn to surrender.</span></div></div>",

Good news was, he hadn't fired her, and had told her in no uncertain terms that he'd had no issue with her being a woman, so long as she did the job. Of course, she was informed to notify the Quartermaster of her real identity, which would be a relief to him as there was already ten John Smiths on the payroll, and it would make things easier to know that one was really a Sally Butcher. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then started to walk down the street that was part of her patrol route. It was an eight hour shift, from ten at night until six in the morning. Also, it was her first night on the job, and she hadn't much training with her weapon, a truncheon, a club that she was only allowed to use against a criminal's arms or legs, or tail, in order to disable them. She also had a knife, but that was only for cutting rope, or meat. She did have a metal breastplate, and backplate, and a helmet that, in addition to help protect against head wounds, also helped to keep the sun and rain out of her eyes, not to mention leather greaves and the like to protect her legs, however, her first defense, after foiling whatever crime she had disrupted, hopefully allowing the victim time to run away, was to run away herself. She didn't like that idea, but as the instructor pointed out, she and the other new recruits didn't know the first thing about street fighting, unless they were raised on the streets, and the important thing was to get to a place where help could easily be found, like the local taverns frequented by other City Guards, Licensed Thieves, Official Assassins, Legal Monster Slayers, Powerful Mages, and others who might make a would-be attacker decide to back off. It was one thing to attack a lone Guard, but it was suicide to attack twenty people trying to enjoy a drink. The only other things she had on her were her rations, and a bell, which she was to ring if there was an emergency, or if someone was trying to kill her. The idea was that is someone heard it, they'd come to investigate, giving a would-be attacker an additional twenty people to have to deal with. In in practice, this would give Sally a number of allies to help her out, in reality though, being confronted by over a dozen Guards usually caused criminals to run away themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when Sally heard the rumble. She groaned. Her first night on patrol, and it was going to rain. Luckily, among the outfit she wore was a hooded cloak. It was brown in color, and decent protection against the elements. She put her pack down, got it out, and put it on just as the drops started to fall. She put her pack back on, and resumed walking.</span></div></div>",

He hunted this guy down, and tore him apart, force-feeding him parts of his own body. It was probably a relief when he <i>did</i> die, but they had to cart his body out to the Hangman, for besides his head, that was all that was left attached, and even his eyes and tongue has been removed and forced down the guy's throat. Left the ears alone though, so that the Commander could say the guard's name, just as the Hangman pulled the lever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's that protective?\" Sally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At worst, most muggers are just going to strip you of your gear, and maybe break a few bones, before knocking you out, or after they knock you out,\" said Gareth. \"As for killing you, or raping you, most know better than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you doing out here?\" Sally asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGareth chuckled. \"Simple really.....\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fiona Nightshade sat in the tree. She was watching her target. It was a werewolf, Rutabaga Blackfur Copperfindersson, Commander of the Guard. She looked at her knives - they were silver coated, and tipped with poison. The werewolf would be dead by her blades, if everything went according to plan. If things didn't go according to plan, she was in the perfect position to escape. That being said, Rutabaga was known for his ability to not only avoid being assassinated, but for capturing those who tried to do the deed - Non-Assassin assassins were sent to the Station, male Assassins got a limb broke, and female Assassins, well, it was a good thing they wore black, even to their own weddings. The stories were told by those who tried to do the deed, only to end up doing the <i>nasty</i>. There were stories about how <i>big</i> he was. There were stories about him doing it <i>doggy-style</i>. There were stories involving <i>chains</i>. There were so many stories, but there was one thing they had in common: he was <i>good</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then noticed someone enter the yard. She watched as they climbed another tree that had a view of Rutabaga. She saw as they got out a crossbow, and took aim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guild papers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other looked at her. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are your Guild papers?\" In her hand, she was carefully tossing a knife up and catching it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know where those are!\" The figure turned, and fired the crossbow, pinning Fiona to the tree, causing her to drop her knife. \"Now, be a good Assassin, and die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona looked at the bolt that had pierced her. It was a fatal shot, but not yet immediate. She knew what she had to do, as she watched the Non-Assassin killer reload their crossbow. She took out another knife, and threw it, hitting them in the throat. The killer looked at her, glared, and did a real amateur move - they pulled out the knife. That was when things went wrong for them, as the blood came out. They tried to stop it, but couldn't. They almost fell, but managed to grab the tree limb, but the blood made things too slippery. They fell out of the tree, and Fiona heard the snapping of bones. She watched the killer gurgle their last gurgle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed, or rather, she would have, but that would have killed her. She couldn't scream. Couldn't yell for help. Couldn't do anything, if she wanted to live. She glanced at the window, and saw that Rutabaga was no longer there. If nothing else, she had kept her target from getting killed by a Non-Assassin Assassin, which meant she'd get a copper blade, and possible a gold blade, postmortem of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, she heard something, and glanced down, where she saw Rutabaga. He looked at the body, and then he looked up at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I owe you for this,\" the werewolf said. He then climbed the tree she was in. He looked at the bolt, and then he looked at her. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guild honor,\" Fiona said, quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga nodded. \"I understand. Hold still.\" He slid a hand behind her back, and she heard the shaft break. \"I'll take you to a Healer, a good one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe carried her out of the tree, and down the street. He took her to the Healers, grabbing one of them. \"I want your best healer for arrow wounds. This Assassin is bleeding to death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Healer ran off, to get one who knew what they were doing, as Rutabaga set Fiona on one of the cots, and stood by her. Soon enough, the one Healer came with another. They looked at Rutabaga, and looked that the Assassin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll do our best, but no promises.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get to work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree weeks later, Fiona stood before the Head Assassin. There was a hint on concern in the senior Assassin's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you are up for this Contract?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My injuries are fully healed, and I was released from the Healers' care.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only because you unnerved them.\" The Head Assassin looked at the Contract. They looked at her. \"Are you sure you can do this? This Target saved your life. Are you sure you can kill him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My feelings do not enter into this,\" said Fiona. \"Either I'll kill him or he'll stop me, but my emotions will not betray me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, I'm reluctantly giving you the Contract. Now, put away your knife.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Fiona was sitting in a chair, because standing was starting to tire her. Another week, she'd be fine, but for now, she needed to rest. The door opened, and Rutabaga came in. He stood before the robe rack, and took his uniform off, very slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you waiting for?\" the werewolf asked. \"I owe you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Fiona groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I owe you a throw,\" said Rutabaga. \"Given that you killed someone who was trying to kill me, I owe you the chance to try and kill me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't move?\" Fiona asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have my word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wasn't planning on doing it like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in no condition to move,\" said Rutabaga. \"You'd only get one chance. Succeed, and you'll be the Assassin who managed to kill me. Fail, and you'll be just another woman who ends up in my bed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Fiona said, as she drew her knife. \"Just don't tell anyone about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Depending on the outcome, I won't be able to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona steadied her arm, carefully aimed the knife, drew her hand back to throw, but, just as she started the throw, pain shot up her side, and her arm, affecting her aim. Instead of pinning the werewolf in the back, the knife hit the wall, just beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the blade. \"Silver-coated, and laced with poison. Very nice.\" He turned around, and looked at her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was gasping in pain, and holding her arm and side. She looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head. \"Like I said, you were in no condition to move.\" He walked up to her. \"Still, I will say this, I will take it easy on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona groaned. \"Nice to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll also put you in chains.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona looked at him. \"Why?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because you're a fighter; if it wasn't for this, you'd of drawn another blade, and kept trying, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona glanced at her other hand, and saw that it was near an empty sheath she'd tried to remove another knife from. She looked at Rutabaga, and saw that the werewolf was grinning. In his hand was the knife she'd been going for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said; you're a fighter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then helped her to her feet, and walked her to his room. There he disrobed and disarmed her, removing her clothes and her weapons, being careful around her injury. There was one small consolation; he didn't remove the cloth from around her face. He then chained her to the bed, finished removing his clothes, and picked up a Zonkier packet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one thing the stories were right about - he was <i>good</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few weeks later, she was standing before the Head Assassin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a very important job for you,\" they said. \"I want you to join the Guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're giving me another chance to kill the Commander?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. However, my wife seems to like him, because he likes her cooking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir, your wife is skilled for her lethal cooking talents,\" said Fiona. \"Even you won't eat her cooking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, but he's had seconds of her rainbow frog soup, and thirds, and fourths,\" the Head Assassin said. \"Maybe even fifths.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's her most deadly concoction,\" said Fiona. \"You'd need the antidote right then and there, just to make it through the night, just from one bite.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and that's why you are needed to keep an eye on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Be careful.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yokin Onaka felt the chain jerk her forward, like it had for several weeks, if not months. She didn't know why she'd been captured when she'd gone to the market by these men, but she knew one thing - the looks they gave her were far from friendly. She'd been traded at least a dozen times, if not more, and by now, she could no longer understand what her captor's spoke. The plants were different as well. It was very different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne night, the ones transporting her, and over a dozen others, stopped a distance away from a city. She tried to listen to her captors, and once again wished she could understand them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she could, here's what she would have heard:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Big Fat Pig City,\" the one said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd best be careful around here,\" the other said. \"The Tyrant who rules here has made Slavery illegal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\" the first one asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Slaves don't pay taxes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe one laughed. \"Now that's a stupid reason to do that sort of thing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYokin sighed as the strange words were spoken. She was in a strange land, with strange people. She wished that she was home, with her family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when she noticed the dog. It came up to her, and brushed against her leg. She smiled, and petted it. She noticed that it had an object around its neck - some sign of ownership. She looked around. Maybe the dog's owner would be nearby. Maybe he'd help. Maybe -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! There's some dumb dog getting friendly with the goods,\" one of the men said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dog looked at the man, and growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll teach you to growl at me!\" The man came up and kicked the dog. \"Now get going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYokin screamed, and grabbed the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get this crazy woman off of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree others pulled Yokin off of the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to teach you a lesson you'll never forget!\" The man grabbed a whip and was about to strike her when the lash stopped, and the man was jerked back, and was caught by a shadowy figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure held their hand around the man's throat, and growled. It was the same growl that came from the dog. The man was tossed onto the others, and the figure stepped into the light. It was a man with a collar around his neck, the same one Yokin had seen before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kidnapping, enslavement, assault, assault of a Guard, and failure to pay taxes,\" the man said. He snapped his fingers, and several armed and armored figures appeared. \"Seems that you have a visit to our city's dungeon in your future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, we have money,\" one of the men said, pulling out a pouch. \"How about we give you that, and let us go?\" He tossed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange man picked up the pouch, opened it up, and poured the contents onto the ground. \"Bribing me gets you nowhere. Now it's a visit to the Hangman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen, we are just businessmen,\" said one of the slavers. \"Just let us go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange man looked at Yokin. \"Release them, and I'll think about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe slavers moved quickly, releasing the slaves, including Yokin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strange man looked at a large guard. \"Shackle the slavers, take them to the dungeon, and take their captives to the Healers, and make sure they're taken care of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Commander Rutabaga.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYokin watch the faces of the slavers become pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you'd let us go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I'd think about it,\" said Rutabaga. \"Anger me, and I'll see that you do visit the Hangman instead of doing a few years of honest labor, after which I'll let you go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later, Yokin was at the Healers, where people were taking care of her and the others. Rutabaga was dressed like the other guards, save for his cape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYokin grabbed him. ^Thank you for saving this worthless one, Lord.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga chuckled. \"I wish I knew what you said, but I'll assume it was 'Thanks' so I'll say You're Welcome.\" However, when he tried to walk away, Yokin held onto him. Rutabaga chuckled. \"Alright. I'll stay with you.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next few days flew by, and were rather pleasant for Yokin. Granted, she was at what was called a Guard Station, but the people there treated her friendly, even if she didn't understand what they said. Then there was her cooking; she had merely made some soup when almost all of the humans, and more than a few non-humans, offered their bowls to her, in the universal language of those hungry for good cooking. She was surprised at this - she hadn't even used all that many seasonings. Even the place's regular cook had offered their bowl to her, with that sort of embarrassed grin that stated that they wished that their own cooking was better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the one called Rutabaga came in. There was much gesturing and talking, and while Yokin didn't understand the language, she did understand that they were talking about her. Rutabaga grabbed a bowl, and placed it in front of her. She looked at him. There was some sort of test here, as she made him the same soup she had made the others. He tried the soup. There was a look in his eyes. He looked at the cook, and nodded. Yokin saw the grin on the cook's face. The cook then and got some garments that were similar to their's, and gave them to her. Yokin looked at Rutabaga. Rutabaga pointed at her, and then the garments, and then back at her. This was also another universal language; the garments were hers, and if said garments were any indication, they also meant that she was being given the job of being a cook.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^But, I'm not worthy of such a position,^ she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll assume that you are somewhat shocked by the offer,\" said Rutabaga. He then got out some coins. \"This is the pay you get.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYokin looked at the coins. She wasn't sure what they were worth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when a human-sized black dragon came in. \"Is that Chizon Soup I smell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga looked at them. \"Guard Otakuk, nice to see you today. How's the wing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon chuckled nervously. \"Healing nicely. Can't fly yet, but I am good enough to do a regular foot patrol, according to my family's healer, although mother wishes that I stayed home longer, until the membrane was fully healed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mothers are always like that.\" Rutabaga picked up the soup. \"You know what this is?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chizon Soup,\" said Otakuk. \"The servants make it out of beef and pork, usually the worst cuts for the most part, and then they add in a number of different seasonings and spices, which makes it taste really good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga chuckled. \"The worst cuts of meat? Sounds like some skilled cooks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtakuk chuckled nervously. \"Well, in my parents' and grandparents' homeland, servants and lesser classes don't get to eat the good cuts, and thus have to make up for it. Granted, once they moved here, their servants started to get to eat better stuff, but, well, old traditions and habits take a while to change. And it seems she's doing one of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, Yokin had prostrated herself, kneeling onto the floor, her eyes shut in fear of a Royal Dragon looking at her, when she wasn't properly dressed. ^Forgive me Your Highness. I was captured and taken from my home. These noble barbarians saved me from captivity, and brought me to this place.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga looked at Otakuk, whose face became extra nervous. \"Do you know what she's saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She thinks I'm a prince, which would be true enough, I guess, but she <i>really</i> shouldn't be doing that,\" said Otakuk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" said Rutabaga. \"You're On-Duty, which means that you're not a prince of any sort, until you're Off-Duty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's more complicated than that,\" said Otakuk. \"My family was part of a war against the Ruler of Eastrimland, and their side lost, and were forced to flee, along with their supporters, least they get executed for treason. In fact, she could lose her head for presenting herself like that to me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you speak her language?\" Rutabaga asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of have to at home,\" said Otakuk. \"Grandfather will not allow Bigfatpigian to be spoken there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case, explain the situation to her, and tell her she is not to bow to you, at least while the two of you are here, or On-Duty,\" said Rutabaga. \"I'll leave what you do Off-Duty to your own devices.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Commander.\" Otakuk saluted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Also, if she wants to, she can go to your neighborhood,\" said Rutabaga. \"It should help her adjust to the city, being near those who share similar customs as hers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Commander.\" Otakuk placed his hand on Yokin. ^Please, get up. The Commander dislikes such displays.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^But the laws say-^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^That you must not look upon those of the Royal Scales, I know,^ said Otakuk. ^But the laws also state that those who bow to those who have been Decreed Dead will be executed.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYokin opened her eyes in shock. She then looked up at the black dragon. She looked at him, carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtakuk sighed. ^The mark isn't placed where it would be readily visible, save when I'm flying, not that the people here know what it means.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYokin stood up, carefully. ^So, what now?^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtakuk looked at the bowl of soup. ^Seems you've been made a cook here. That means you'll want some fresh things.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYokin looked at where she had gotten the seasonings from. There wasn't much to begin with, and there was almost none now. ^Were these yours?^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtakuk nodded. ^For when I wanted to spice my own stuff up. There's a place that sells them in my neighborhood, if you want to come.^</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Yokin looked back at Otakuk. ^I guess I'd best go with you. I don't know my way around here, and no one else understands what I am saying.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtakuk put a careful hand on her. ^You'll do fine here. Everyone treats everyone else equally - everyone insults everyone else, and everyone tries to rob everyone, and everyone throws rubbish at everyone.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYokin blinked. ^People throw rubbish at you?^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtakuk grinned. ^No one likes to see a guard, unless they need one.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^Why do you work as a guard if people are going to do that?^ Yokin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtakuk chuckled. ^Because, despite the rubbish I have to clean off my armor on a daily basis, it's a very safe job - no one does anything too serious to a guard, beyond robbing and assaulting them, unless they wish to make an enemy of every other guard, especially the Commander. And that reminds me-^ He looked at the Commander, who had an impatient look on his face. \"She's agreed to go with me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Rutabaga as he put his hand in a pocket. \"Then she'll need this.\" He took out a metal object, and gave it to Yokin. \"Tell her that makes her an Acting-Guard while she's out there, and all the powers that entails, which is of course none, save in an emergency, and she has to obey the orders of an actual Guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtakuk explained this to Yokin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^So, what good does that do for me?^ Yokin asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n^Not much, but like I said, no one does much to a guard unless they want every other guard after them,^ said Otakuk. ^Basically, you could be walking down the streets, and someone could drag you into an alley, get you knocked out, rob you, strip you of your clothes and such, and leave you laying there, but you won't get murdered or raped, unless said person has a serious death wish.^ He looked nervously at Rutabaga before looking back at Yokin. ^The last time a guard was raped and murdered, the Commander hunted the person down, and tore their arms and legs off, among other things. When they hung them, all that was left of the person was a torso, which had a head, which only had a pair of ears.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYokin looked at the Commander. ^He's <i>that</i> protective?^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtakuk nodded. ^The guard was a rookie, with no real significant meaning to him except for one thing - they were a guard. He hunted that person down and did a lot of terrible things to them, because of what they did to that guard. Granted, there were a few other things that could be factored into it, like the previous murders and rapes the person committed, but if it wasn't for what they did to that guard, he might still be out there, doing who knows what to who knows who.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^I see,^ said Yokin. ^Alright.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a while, the two were in Eastrimland Town, which did remind Yokin a lot of home, aside from the fact that most of the dragons around Otakuk's age were in their human-sized form, instead of their much larger true size, and the humans her age were't afraid to look them in the eye. Back home, no human dared to look at a dragon without permission. Also, most spoke the barbarian language, at least towards those their age. Older ones however, the language was that of home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^It's a lot like the Capital's Main Section,^ she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^My grandfather, Tozun Shuto, was the younger brother to the Emperor, Okozo Tukon, unless he has journeyed to the Ancestors by now,^ said Otakuk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^Your grandfather is Tozun Shuto?^ Yokin asked. ^I heard he was executed for leading a coup against the Emperor. Of course, no one talks about him.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^I wouldn't be surprised if he did try to overthrow his brother, but he always said that he wished to pass reforms to make things easier for humans, and to open up trade with the other lands,^ said Otakuk. ^Of course, the movement didn't work, and he was forced to flee, along with the rest of the family, and those that supported him, especially after the Imperial Scribe showed up at my parents' place and marked me as Dead, and I had only just been born at the time. Grandfather was <i>not</i> happy about that. Eventually he lead his followers here. Supposedly there was talk about hiring mercenaries to take the Empire over, but then grandfather found out just how expensive it would be, and decided that they'd be better off staying here where no one cared where they'd came from. They built a community, which eventually got walled-in with the rest of the city, just like every other encampment that sets up habitation around the place. Now, most people our age think of themselves as Big Fat Pig City Citizens, and could care less about some place they'd never been to.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^You mean, you don't want the Imperial Throne that is your birthright?^ Yokin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^The Commander should be the King of this city, but he refuses to wear the crown, or so rumors tend to claim,^ said Otakuk. ^If he can refuse to wear a crown, why should I care for some golden chair? It's probably not very comfortable to sit on.^</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Soon enough, Yokin and Otakuk made it to a spice stall. There was an older-looking woman working there. She looked at them with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^Ah, Otakuk, so nice to see you walking around,^ she said. ^Your injury all healed up?^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^For the most part,^ said Otakuk. ^I can't fly just yet, but I can do a regular foot patrol.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^I've been trying to get my daughter to make you something for saving her son from that fire, but she has been busy with things,^ the woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtakuk chuckled. ^Just doing my duty as a guard.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^Yes, but it was my grandson that you saved,^ the woman said. ^Although I wish he'd show more respect for his elders.^ She looked at them. ^Anything you looking for?^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^My associate here was just made a cook at the Guard Station I work for, and the Commander asked me to escort her around the area,^ said Otakuk. ^Since we need some spices, I thought that I'd bring her here.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^I see,^ the woman said. She looked at Yokin. ^See anything you like?^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^I do,^ said Yokin. She then rattled off over a dozen spices, and quantities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman looked at her. ^Were you from the capital?^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYokin looked down at the ground. ^I was an assistant cook at the palace. I was in the market place, when some men abducted me, and sold me into slavery.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^There, there, as these BigFatPigians say, you are, mostly, safe here,^ the woman said. ^Most people don't bother those such as us, unless you have a lot of money, or valuable goods. But, pay the Thieves' Guild their fee, and one doesn't have to worry about any unlicensed thieves stealing either money or goods, and I doubt that any Assassin would dare to dirty their blades on the likes of us, as we don't make enough money to hire a means to defend ourselves, nor could we defend ourselves in an attempt in any case.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYokin looked at Otakuk. ^Thieves' Guild? Assassins?^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^Perfectly legal,^ said Otakuk. ^Licensed Thieves can steal a certain amount of money or valuable goods, and after that, no one else can rob you, unless they wish to get punished by the Guild. As for the Assassins, if you can protect yourself, or hire the means to do so, they can kill you if hired to do so, but it costs a lot of money and they have to pin a receipt to the body. Of course, if the person is someone like me, the Assassins tend to sub-contract out to the Monster Slayers' Guild, and even they have to follow certain rules.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^How does all that work?^ Yokin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^One doesn't have to worry about their home or business being broken into, murderers tend to get snuffed out by the Assassins, and renegade monsters tend to get their heads mounted on a Slayer's wall,^ said Otakuk. ^Like I said, this city is fairly safe for people to live in.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey then picked up the spices, and Otakuk paid for them. Otakuk then led Yokin to a small outdoor eatery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^This is nice,^ Yokin said, as they waited for their meal. ^I've never had the time, or money to eat at a place like this.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^Never?^ Otakuk asked. ^Most here do come to a place like this, at least once a week.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^We never had time off at the Palace,^ said Yokin. ^That and the grandson of the Emperor, Prince Ochun Sziton <i>always </i>wanted <i>me</i> to serve him his meals.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtakuk chuckled. ^Did he not trust anyone else to not spill his meals?^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^Actually, there was another reason.^ Yokin lowered her eyes. ^He wanted me. No one refuses the Royal Scales of what they want.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtakuk looked at her. ^Did he rape you?^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYokin looked up. There was fear, worry, sorrow, and shame in her eyes. ^No one says no to the Royal Scales.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtakuk closed his eyes, breathed deep, and opened them again. ^He will <i>never</i> touch you again. One shouldn't force themselves upon another, and get away with it. Ochun will have to fight me, and every other guard, to even get close to you.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^You'd take on the grandson of the Emperor?^ Yokin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^Commander Rutabaga would take on the Gods themselves to keep his guards safe,^ said Otakuk. ^To him, titles are just fancy words that mean nothing, unless one can back them up, and you'd have to be willing to take him on.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^Prince Ochun is the Head General of the Empire's Army,^ said Yokin. ^No one has ever beaten him in combat.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^I doubt he'd come here with the entire army, even if he found out that you resided here,^ said Otakuk. ^We would have word of such a force moving this way, and would have already gotten a hold of everyone else, and dealt with them in typical Big Fat Pig City fashion.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^And that is?^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^Rob them of everything they have, get the deeds to their homes, and sell them lousy T-shirts that state that they came here, and all they got was the shirt.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYokin looked at Otakuk. ^That wouldn't stop Ochun.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtakuk smiled. ^He'd still have to face the Commander.^</span></div></div>",

I was on patrol nearby when I smelled the smoke, so I came to check it out. Then, I heard the screams. That was when I saw the children. The bottom floors were on fire, and there was no way out for them, save one. Well, I climbed up the wall, and I pulled them through a window when something else caught my eye, just as the flames reached that room - a barrel of blasting powder. I had just enough time to cover the children with my one wing when the flames reached the barrel. I lost my grip as the barrel exploded, and fell three stories. I broke a couple of ribs, and my wing was badly burned, but the children were alright.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^You saved the grandson of a stall owner?^ Yokin asked. ^I doubt any of the Royal Scales would do such a thing back home.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^This is Big Fat Pig City,^ said Otakuk. ^They don't care about that sort of stuff, or at least, that's what the Commander says.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^You talk a lot about him,^ said Yokin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^Even those that hate him have to give him some respect,^ said Otakuk. ^He's good at the job, although he does have his hobbies that might cause you some concern.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^What kinds of hobbies?^ Yokin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^Mainly that any female Assassin that has failed to kill him, has ended up having sex with him,^ said Otakuk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYokin looked at him. ^Seriously?^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^He won't kill a licensed Assassin, which is what normally happens to those who have failed Assassinations,^ said Otakuk. ^But, he does break the arms of male Assassins, and as for female ones, well, it's a good thing they wear black to everything, including their own weddings.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^Why does he do that?^ Yokin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^It seems to have started with a large cake on his eighteenth birthday that a female Assassin popped out of,^ said Otakuk. ^Seems he'd been expecting a Seamstress instead.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^He was expecting someone who sewed clothes?^ Yokin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^Um, Paid Temporary Lover would be the right job title, but Seamstress seems more polite,^ said Otakuk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYokin's eyes widened at this. ^He has sex with women who try to kill him?^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^Basically,^ said Otakuk. ^Could be worse - they could have been killed instead.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, they ended up at the station, where Otakuk set the groceries down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n^I hope you enjoy your time here,^ said Otakuk. ^I wouldn't mind getting to know you better.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^I guess that would be alright,^ said Yokin. ^You're nothing like your cousin.^<br>\r\n<br>\r\n^I doubt he'll bother you here,^ said Otakuk.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Skelly the Skeleton - Was once a great fighter, until the day he tried to kill a Necromancer, in order to avenge their tribe. The Necromancer managed to curse him with their dying breath, a curse that stripped the fighter of his flesh and organs, although not his morality. The curse keeps him alive, but prevents him for enjoying \"Life's Simple Pleasures\" of food, drink, sleep, the scent of flowers and, rather annoyingly, sex. On the plus side, he can't feel heat, cold, pain, get poisoned, drown, breath in noxious gasses and has no problems putting himself back together when disassembled, for one reason or another. As a result of his curse, Skelly had spent over a hundred years wandering the countryside, even forgetting his real name due to how long it had been since someone had used it. One day, he found himself in Big Fat Pig City, when he ended up foiling an unlicensed theft, among other things, which brought him to the attention of Rutabaga, who was in his wolf form at the time, and had been chasing the unlicensed thief. Impressed at how the skeleton had handled himself, Rutabaga gave the person a job, especially since the attacks the thief tried to use on him, like the good old Stab-The-Kidneys Trick, failed to do more than just stab air. As such, Skelly serves as a Combat Instructor, especially since the traditional Wooden Dummy used for teaching new recruits isn't capable of attacking them, thus forcing them to fight something that isn't easily predictable. He also happens the be one of the first people sent in to see how bad a riot is going - things are usually safe if he doesn't have to search for something, like his head. Also, it is useful to have a skeleton around during those rare times that Rutabaga wants a bone to chew on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlim the Zombie - Something of a revolutionary-wannabe, who was always chanting the \"For The People\" slogan, until a bunch of arrows ended up in his chest, killing him. However, despite this set back, his revolutionary spirit was too strong for him to stay dead, and he became a political advocate for Undead Rights, although this amounted to painting graffiti on walls and such, even forming a group, who met mainly to keep Slim out of serious trouble. After a situation where an Undead person's rights were, supposedly, violated, Slim was hired to act as a mediator - ironically enough, the complaints actually increased, against Slim, who claims it was because the Undead don't understand policing, when in actuality Slim had been trying to recruit more people into his group with rather annoying pamphlets that he always stuffs inside someone's coffin. Overall though, he is a good guard, although he hates it when he gets used as Arrow Fodder, especially when it's in a spot where it shows!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Skelly looked at the reflection off of his polished helmet. He sighed. A hundred and twenty-seven years he'd been dead, but not dead enough. If he was dead, maybe he'd be someplace better - feasting with his tribe, engaging in battles, perhaps taking on other afterlifes he'd heard about, like that one where Heroes got over a hundred lovers, or maybe he'd have been reincarnated as someone else, but at least he would have been able to remember his name. The Necromancer had cursed him like that. Folks had avoided him, meaning he'd been unable to even introduce himself. He'd been called a monster, and worse. Places closed their gates to the likes of him - even other undead were more welcome than him. After a hundred years of walking the world, he had forgotten his own name, due to being unable to even say it to even an enemy. No one hired him for any reason. He'd had no purpose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, seven years ago, Rutabaga came into his life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd managed to get into the city by, of all things, hiding in a wagon filled with bones, that were destined for the Wizards and such, who wanted a skeleton in their rooms, which was almost a requisite to being a wizard. He'd gotten out of the wagon when the driver went into the inn. He didn't know why he'd entered the city - he had no need for food, sleep, or female company, although he missed those - but something had told him to enter the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when he heard the call -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlicensed Thief!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd heard the running.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt the impact, causing him to lose an arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch where you're going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd grabbed the person, just as they realized what he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe person screamed, drew a knife, and stabbed him. The blade stabbed naught but air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skeleton's missing arm came back to him, and he was able to disarm the person, by simply keeping the knife in his ribcage, held by the free arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mind letting him go,\" said someone else. \"Big Fat Pig City Guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skeleton looked up, and he got a good look at Commander Rutabaga. The guard wasn't afraid of him as he walked up to him, and looked at the knife. He then looked at the person that he'd been holding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Attempted Murder, in addition to Unlicensed Theft, as well as Resisting Arrest,\" the guard said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But he's not-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And neither am I,\" the guard said. \"But it still counts as an attempt to kill another! Complain any more, and you'll pay a visit to the hangman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard took custody of the person. \"Thanks for your help. What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe skeleton had looked at him in surprise. \"You're not afraid of me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not when I have a few who have their own issues on the payroll,\" the guard said. \"I'm Commander Rutabaga, in charge of the City Guard. Your name, citizen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have one,\" he'd said. \"I've forgotten it over the years, since I last had flesh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga nodded. \"In that case, I'll call you Skelly in the report. Silly, I know, but, it will do. There's a reward for assisting the Guard in their Duty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Money's no good for me,\" said the skeleton. \"There's nothing I want to buy, and no one will sell to me even if I wanted to buy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything you want?\" Rutabaga asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A purpose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga looked at him. \"Ever do work as a City Guard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but I used to be a warrior, that much I can remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRutabaga looked at the prisoner. \"Well, given that you don't have issues being stabbed, I might have a slot open for you; it's not glamorous, and it won't be easy, but it should give you something to do, until you get bored of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" the skeleton asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I need someone to help train new recruits, and wooden dummies don't fight back,\" said Rutabaga. \"Then there's checking to see how bad a dangerous situation is, like riots, to say nothing about regular Guard Duty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you want me to be a training dummy, and arrow fodder,\" the skeleton said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could use someone who could handle that sort of work,\" said Rutabaga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take it, and the Name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the Present, Skelly put the helmet on, and checked his armor. It was more for show when it was on him, but it made him feel like he belonged. He then set out to do his Duty.</span></div></div>",

Somewhere, a story-writer would say that skeletons walked rather noisily when they told their audience their stories, but in truth, Skelly's walk was much quieter than the person next to him, who was a beggar with a terrible coughing fit, until Skelly looked at him. The beggar's cough died, and he walked away, reasoning that the skeleton had it worse than him, and wasn't going to mooch money off of him. Beggars knew a dry well when they saw one, most of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThus far, things had been rather dull, and Skelly liked it that way. He just wished he could enjoy the simple pleasures of life. As it was, there was only one way he knew to enjoy them, and that was vicariously through someone else. If some Barbarian Hero, or just your average traveler, had spent their money on food, drink, but had none to spare for a night with a woman, Skelly had no issues paying for it, providing one didn't mind him watching. Granted, some called it creepy, but money was money, and sex was sex. This even went for other things, where Skelly would pay for a meal, or a drink, only for the one receiving it having to describe what it was like to taste, smell, or any of the other things he could no longer enjoy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that point, it began to rain. Skelly looked up, and watched the raindrops. Some feel into his eye sockets, and out the bottom of his jaw. The rain didn't bother him, and neither did the cold that came with it, although he did wish that he could feel them. He sighed. He hated being a skeleton, but, at least as a guard, there was someone he could possibly talk to, his fellow guards for one.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Skelly soon ducked under the eave of a store's front window, to keep the rain from hitting his helmet. While the wind and cold didn't bother him, the sound of it hitting his helmet was annoying. He glanced inside of the store for a moment, before looking back out at the street. However, something caused him to turn his head almost 180 degrees, so that he could look inside the store once more. If he had eyes and eyelids, he would have blinked, but he didn't so he just stared. That being said, whatever magic that kept him alive did give him the sense of sight, and he carefully looked at what he saw. If he had one of Adam's Apples, he would have bit it, and swallowed it. Instead, he kept staring. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat he was seeing was another skeleton, hanging in the window, as a display. A sign was on a stand next to it saying \"I wish I'd shopped at Anthony's Apothecary sooner.\" Around it was a number of potions, which claimed to cure most anything. However, it wasn't the sign that caught Skelly's attention, or the potions, but the other skeleton itself. Skelly could sense the magic that inhabited it. It was looking at him, through eyeless eye sockets, and Skelly could sense it looking at him. Another glance told him something else - this skeleton was a female - the pelvis told him that. At least, Skelly hoped that the pelvis was hers, and that she wasn't really a male skull on a female body, or worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe then turned his head back around, walked over to the door, opened it, and entered the store. For a moment, he wondered if he should be respectful, by taking his helmet off, but decided, since the other skeleton wasn't exactly wearing much, well, anything, he could afford to keep the helmet on. Besides, one never knew when an alarm would be sounded, requiring him to put the helmet back on anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hi,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other skeleton looked at him. \"Hello.\" The voice was a woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkelly chuckled nervously. \"Well, that's a relief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I'm a woman and not a man?\" the other skeleton asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, yes,\" said Skelly. \"I mean, your pelvis is that of a female, but you know how some people are when putting skeletons together, using parts from different bodies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are all mine,\" the other skeleton said. \"I'm Susan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm called Skelly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Skelly?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Been around a while, and over time, with no one talking to me, I forgot my real name,\" said Skelly. \"The Commander of the Guard was nice enough to give me a job when I first came here, and a name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard about him,\" said Susan. \"He's nice enough, from what I've seen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He gives me a reason to exist, and most don't run away from me anymore, except for unlicensed criminals,\" said Skelly. \"What about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The owner of the place bought what he thought was a normal skeleton to use to decorate the place,\" said Susan. \"You know how these places need such things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkelly nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Instead, he got me,\" said Susan. \"He was somewhat surprised when I grabbed his wrist when he tried to mess with my breastbone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkelly stared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not like that,\" said Susan. \"I had, more or less, fallen to pieces, and he was trying to reassemble me, and putting bones in the wrong place - you know how it is.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkelly nodded. He hated it when people, who were trying to be helpful when he'd fallen and popped a bone or two out of place, and placed them in the wrong location. \"So, what do you do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mostly, I just display whatever it is he's selling,\" said Susan. \"That being said, I keep watch when he's out of the store. Can't complain too much. Aside from the Licensed Theft, can't really report many crimes here, except to occasional person who tries to sneak a bottle of something out, only for them to get accidentally caught in my arm, after which, Richard comes to untangle them from me, and in the process, discovers the bottle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkelly chuckled. He'd done that trick a few times before. \"So, what happened to you? I got into a fight with a Necromancer, who cursed me when I killed him. How did you end up like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSusan looked at him and said....</span></div></div>",

Likewise, no royalty, or nobility, or priesthood, or peasants, or any other such thing.

What he was eating was some sort of meat, some sort of dairy product, and some sort of vegetable, which were all between two slices of bread - in short, a sandwich. He looked up, went back to his sandwich, and then looked up again, as he looked at Skelly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, friend of yours, Susan?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Richard, this is Skelly,\" said Susan. \"He just dropped in out of the weather, and saw me standing by the window. We got to talking, and I was wondering what was taking you so long to come to see the perspective customer, so he offered to come with me, to see if you had fallen or something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, nothing's wrong, other than the usual stuff,\" said Richard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you work just here, or do you do jobs on the side for your cousin?\" Skelly asked, as he walked up to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing illegal about having a part-time job on top of a full-time one,\" said Richard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True,\" said Skelly. \"But it is illegal to sell stolen goods without a Thieves' Guild License, in addition to the Merchant's Guild License that one needs to sell things anyways.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't do any of that stuff,\" said Richard. \"Thieves' Guild comes down hard on that sort of stuff. Of course, the Merchant's Guild is even more strict about that sort of stuff. Thieves' Guild just breaks a couple of fingers - Merchant's Guild chops them right off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkelly would have grinned, if he could have. Instead, he just have Richard a Look, a Look that said \"But I can make things even worse.\" Then, he said, \"Enjoy your sandwich.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked back out onto the floor room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I've never seen another animated skeleton before,\" said Susan. \"Perhaps we could do something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about Dinner?\" Skelly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would we go about doing that?\" Susan asked. \"I know I don't eat, and I doubt you do either.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but that doesn't mean that I can't pay for someone else's meal,\" said Skelly. \"You could do the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two then saw a woman try to put some small bottles into a bag. She stopped, and looked at them, in fear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there is an unlicensed thief trying to sneak out of here carrying some of the more expensive perfumes,\" said Susan. \"I'm sure she'd be willing to help me out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know of plenty of Guards that could be willing to help me out with my part,\" said Skelly. \"After all, something would have to be wrong with someone to turn down a free meal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair walked up to the would-be thief, and grabbed her by the arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you say?\" Skelly asked. \"Help me and Susan out with our night on the town, and the Thieves' Guild doesn't hear about this little smelly situation?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman gulped, and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" said Skelly. He looked at Susan. \"Got any ideas that you'd like to try?\"</span></div></div>",

One of these jobs was mucking out the stalls of its owner's valuable, and violent, horses. However, it seems that its owner fell afoul where the Tax Laws were concerned, and had said horses, and the golem itself, confiscated. Rutabaga found out about the golem, and requisitioned it from storage to act as a guard at the Jail House, as few could escape from a golem that had been given a Capture Order for very long. Eventually, a spell was found to give the golem Free Will, as well as other golems. Since its last job was mucking out stalls, the golem was called Muck. Muck was soon placed on Riot Duty, as well as Fire-Fighting duty, to say nothing about regular Patrol Duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuard Gre - Lizardman<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGre is a lizard person. When it comes to lizard person biology, biology is rather tricky. In fact, it's advised to employers to hire males and females in equal numbers. This is because they have a unique survival trait, as a race. If the ratio of male to female isn't about equal, it is possible for the lizard's gender to change from male to female, and female to male, as well as the reverse. The process takes about three days. After that, the population increases. This occurs even if small groups of lizard people are out of touch with other members of their own kind for longer than a few weeks, which is why it is best for lizard people to travel with friends, so that when a Gender Change does occur, they are among friends who won't take advantage of their situation, too much. Gre was partnered with another lizard, Res, to whom the Gender Change did occur to. Luckily, they were friends, but it still resulted in a fertilized egg. Now Gre has to deal with becoming a father fairly soon, all while trying to protect the city.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuard Kess - Snakeman<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKess is a snake person, with a humanoid upper body, and a snake lower body that is as thick as a human's body and over thirty feet long, and is extremely strong, although he tends to be gentle. In addition to his strength, he can also produce several types of venom, from ones that can either paralyze the target and/or put them to sleep, to those that can kill, some of which are rather painless, to those that are extremely painful. He is also very snake-like where his eating habits are concerned, although sapient prey is off the menu, for the most part.</span></div></div>",

The other arm had a knife in its hand, and the unlicensed thief was trying to use it to stab Kess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Buddy, unless you wish for a Healer to treat you for more than just that broken leg from when you jumped out of the window, please quit with the stabbings,\" Kess said. \"I can keep this up much longer than you can, and I can apply more than enough force to break your back, arm, and legs.\" To demonstrate his point, Kess tightened his coils just enough to cause pain to the unlicensed thief, causing them to scream. \"Drop it.\" Reluctantly, the unlicensed thief let go of the knife. \"Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKess then went back into the window with his upper body. \"Sorry about that. I think he got the message though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was good that you were passing by when you were,\" said the woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" said Kess. \"The Thieves' Guild would have loved to have used him an an example, and break every bone in his body, to show unlicensed thieves why stealing without a license is a bad idea. At least this way, he'll get healed up, and only have to do a few years hard labor, unless he has something else to stand for.\" He got out his notebook again. \"By the way, for the Record, what is your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rose H. Thorns,\" the woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" said Kess, as he put the notebook away. \"I will send for you if you are needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you'll come by when you are off the clock,\" said Rose. \"There's some things about your sort I'm curious about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such as?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just how good are you with those coils of yours?\" said Rose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKess grinned in understanding. \"I see.

Granted, it is often times boring, consisting mainly of breaking up the occasional squabble, checking incoming and outgoing caravans for contraband, and other such typical guard duties, at least it's a regular paycheck, which lets him buy the food he need, pay for his rent, and a few other things. While his humanoid half wears armor similar to that of a human, his horse half wears armor similar to that worn by a horse, including, much to his annoyance, something similar to a saddle, along with a set of reins attached to the armor on his torso. He puts up with them because sometimes it's necessary to transport an injured person, guard or citizen, to a healer, and there's always the possibility that someone might blind his eyes in some form or another while carrying someone, meaning he'd need to be guided himself. On his feet, he wears a special kind of boots that can be easily taken off, as he dislikes the idea of having shoes nailed to his hooves like those of a horse tend to be, but they'd still need to be protected anyways. That being said, he does have the ability to run quickly, which is useful when moving someone to another location, or when relaying orders, and can carry a great deal of weight, which is useful when the guards find themselves in some sort of standoff with a group of unlicensed criminals. To his own personal annoyance, some of his gear does require some assistance to put on, and take off. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunis Stronghoof - Minotaur<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMunus is a minotaur who took the job of being a guard in a city, mainly because he disliked the idea of guarding a cave filled with treasure for no real reason. At least, as a guard in a city, one made money and could actually talk to other people. He is very strong, and has a good sense of smell and hearing. He also has no issues in dark places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBaked Beans - Enchanted Rat<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeans is a rat who once lived off of the trash that wizards tend to throw out. However, a miss-applied spell ended up making him sapient. However, he was still just a rat, and thus still had to deal with cats and rat catchers. Eventually making his way to the Guard Station, he built a nest in Commander Rutabaga's office, that is to say, under the floorboards under the Commander's desk. Here, he learned a lot about the law, and even came to respect the werewolf, who could smell him, yet could never catch him despite his best efforts to locate the rat. One day, the Commander was investigating the home of a serious unlicensed thief, when Beans, who had tagged along in the pack of another guard, unbeknownst to both of them, managed to locate a hidden switch that opened a hidden door, that revealed something far more serious than unlicensed theft, which got the criminal an appointment with the Hangman. Puzzled over the door suddenly opening, once the criminal was taken away, the Commander investigated further, and that was when Beans made his presence known. Recognizing the scent of the rat as the one that had been eluding him in his office, the Commander made the decision to hire the rat, and let him live under the floorboards in his office. While not much use in a standard patrol, or in a fight, for the most part, Beans has proved invaluable when it comes to investigating suspects' homes, and has even saved more than a few kidnapped, or captured, people by biting through their bindings, and leading them to freedom, or bringing help to them.</span></div></div>",

Vivian joined the force as part of the Illegal Vice Squad, often going undercover as a non-Guild Seamstress. Her usual tact is to ask would-be clients if they are sure that they want her, and not someone from the Guild. Of course, once she's given the person's money, that's when she slams them up against the wall, turns them around, and restrains them long enough for another undercover guard to come over and tie up the would-be client for the charge of Solicitation of a Non-Guild Seamstress - and the would-be client is lucky when they catch them in the act - Head Seamstresses have been known to disfigure/castrate those engaged in such things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMau the Catlady - Mau is one of the Catfolk.

However, far from being his dinner date, her position is such that she is able to listen to these unsuspecting, and high ranked, criminals, as they talk about their various plans to either overthrow the Tyrant, smuggle in illegal goods, or brag about what they did to some lowly peasant. Once she gets enough information, she lets Rutabaga, or whichever high-ranked Guard she's with, know what's up, at which point, arrests can be made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn the Drow - Dawn works the Night Shift. It's a position she's suited to, as working during the day causes her issues, unless wearing a wide-brimmed hat.

More than one night-time criminal has been brought down by her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTracy the Turtle - Tracy often works the River Patrol. Capable of hiding herself in the murky waters of Big Fat Pig River, her job is to keep track of the various boats and ships, coming and going, looking for those that act a little too suspicious or too unsuspicious, checking for illegal smuggling or fishing, and other such waterborne crimes.</span></div></div>",

Tracy looked at the captain. \"Alright, now that we're out of earshot of the rest of the harbor, what's the real cargo?\"</span></div></div>",

No one thinks anything of them. This Interactive is dedicated to those fine men, among others, including the great Fantasy authors, who created their own worlds.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBowlworld \u2013 it is a world in the form of a very large bowl, sitting in the middle of a disk-like object, which could be mistaken for a giant\u2019s tabletop. Imagine a bowl of cereal, with large chunks of cereal, and plenty of milk. Now, substitute the milk for water, and the cereal for large islands, continents, and you got Bowlworld. Don\u2019t ask where the spoon is, for there is no spoon. Also, imagine that the sugar that you sprinkled on top of the cereal is where various towns and cities are located. One of those sugar crystals is Big Fat Pig City, one of the largest cities on Bowlworld.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe origins of Big Fat Pig City has been lost to history. Were the original inhabitants refugees fleeing from war? Did someone decide that they hated carrying around a smelly tent all of the time, and decide to settle down? Or, more likely, did a wagon wheel hit a rock, breaking it, causing the owner of the wagon to kick the rock, only to break his foot, and cause everyone to have to wait until the man\u2019s injury healed and the wagon wheel was fixed? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe origins of the name are better known, and have been recorded as thus: The Leader of the Wandering tribe came before the Farmer and said thusly, \u201cThat is one Big Fat Pig. Give him to me, and I shall let you marry one of my daughters.\u201d The Farmer and his Wife were married for fifty years, and had twenty children, one of which became King of the City, exactly how is happened is filled with bloodstains (although it is unknown if this is the actual blood of his rivals, or if the writer cut his finger and bled all over the paper) and the city was renamed Big Fat Pig, in honor of his grandsire\u2019s prophetic words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, in time, the King\u2019s bloodline weakened, Civil War came, and the then-King was beheaded by the Commander of the Guards, who was the leader of the Rebellion. He too was eventually beheaded. That being said, no Kings ever retook the throne, and these days, Big Fat Pig City is ruled by a Tyrant, who is, mostly, a Tyrant in name only, as he rarely terrorizes the average citizen, as long as they pay their taxes. As for those who fail to pay their taxes, or those who are not average citizens, well, it is well-known that the Tyrant went to the Assassin\u2019s Guild and graduated at the top of his class, but it\u2019s just a rumor that he kills people himself \u2013 that\u2019s what legally hired Assassins are for.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for the City itself, it\u2019s mostly ruled by Guilds \u2013 the Butchers,  Bakers, Candlestick-makers, Fools, Pest Exterminators, Beggars, Assassins, Thieves, Seamstresses (aka Ladies of Negotiable Affection), among others \u2013 who control most of the day-to-day operations of the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, there\u2019s the City Guard. After a number of Civil Wars, and the like, to say nothing of the legalization of the Thieves Guild \u2013 who were entitled to steal a set amount from people and businesses in return for cracking down on unlicensed thievery \u2013 as well as the Assassins Guild \u2013 who could only be hired to kill those who could defend themselves, or had the means of hiring the means of defending themselves, and had to leave a note after a legal job \u2013 the Guard was reduced to hiring those no one else wanted to work for them, and even that number reduced after a while. This changed after Turnip, a human raised by dwarves, joined the force, and set up improving the Guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, while the City Guard will still hire refuse from the streets, said refuse is honed and formed into an efficient force. The City Guard also looks past the fact that applicants are not always human \u2013 over a third of the force is comprised of dwarves, trolls, werewolves, vampires, intelligent zombies, gnomes, and other non-human races. In fact, the current Commander of the Guards, Rutabaga Blackfur Copperfindersson is not a full human \u2013 he\u2019s half werewolf and half dwarf-raised-human, as Turnip ended up taking a female werewolf as a lover \u2013 The Guard being willing to look past the stereotype that women are the weaker sex, as they\u2019ve found out that females will catch male criminals off-guard nine times out of ten, although criminals also use this trick, which is why there is always one female guard in every group out on patrol. As to how his mother, Vivian Goldenfur von Stoon, and his father became lovers, well, that\u2019s a story in and of itself, but it involved a hostage situation, and, after it was resolved, well, there was a bed in the room \u2013 the real question is Who was the Hostage, and Who did the Rescuing? Romantics claim that Turnip saved Vivian from a Werewolf-Hater, Werewolves claim that Vivian saved Turnip from a renegade Vampire, while Guards claim that an unlicensed thief found out that angering Vivian over her wearing men\u2019s clothing was a bad idea, and thus, while being questioned by Turnip, confessed to a number of small crimes that had occurred over the previous month, in order for Turnip to ask Vivian to let go of the thief\u2019s feet, after which, the thief fell into a pile of horse dung.  In any case, Vivian got pregnant, and Turnip was the father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn time, Rutabaga Blackfur Copperfindersson became a guard, just like his parents, and eventually became the Commander. Thus, he makes life difficult for the Wealthy and Nobility, who like to think that they are above the Law. As such, he is the target of constant assassination attempts, both by Licensed and Unlicensed assassins. Licensed Assassins survive their attempts, but end up with at least a broken arm or leg, although female Assassins get an even worse punishment and are glad that they wear black to every event (especially their own weddings).  Unlicensed thugs end up getting not only both of their arms and legs broke, they also end up going to the Tanty, and, depending upon what all else they\u2019ve done, might end up paying a visit to the Hangman, who is very good at his job, and has never had any complaints from his visitors. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCopperfindersson is also very protective of the guards under his command; should an inexperienced guard wander into the wrong part of town, the worst they\u2019ll suffer, usually, is being robbed of what they had on them \u2013 gear, armor, weapons, snack rations, cigarettes, money, that secret stash they thought had been hidden from the commander under their helmet \u2013 and maybe having some black and blue bruises, and the occasional broken arm, leg, or toes and fingers. That being said, they are usually left alive. Anyone foolish enough to kill a Guard soon finds out the hard way, as Copperfindersson will pay the killer a personal visit, and, if the killer is foolish enough to resist arrest, Copperfindersson will \u201cdefend himself\u201d, meaning that the killer will be very lucky to not be too badly bruised, and thus cheating the Hangman of a visitor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, this is nothing compared to Copperfindersson\u2019s biggest secret; through his father\u2019s bloodline, he is the rightful heir to the Big Fat Pig City throne \u2013 it is a secret that is so-well kept, that everyone in the city has heard about it, and immediately dismissed it. After all, rightful heirs to thrones don\u2019t remain in the Guards, they carry really big swords, which Copperfindersson has, they go right into the Palace, which he has, and they demand what they want and get it, which he has \u2013 pay raises for the guards, better benefits for them, and a new dartboard \u2013 and he always gets what he wants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn fact, the Tyrant has asked Copperfindersson the reason why the werewolf/dwarf-raised-human has remained in the Guards and not become King, and this is the reason: If I were the King, then I would be forced to marry a Princess, and I find them to be very dull. I\u2019d rather spend my time with a Seamstress, as they are more fun, and leave when I pay them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRules:<br>\r\n1.\tThis is a Pseudo- Medieval/Renaissance Era Fantasy, with lots of fantastic, mystical, and mythical creatures.<br>\r\n2.\tRutabaga Blackfur Copperfindersson is the Commander of the Guard, but fill in the rank-and-file yourself.<br>\r\n3.\tSpelling and Grammar are a must.<br>\r\n4.\tThird Person is preferred.<br>\r\n5. While fetishes can pop up, the stories are to revolve around a plot of some sort, not a fetish.<br>\r\n6.\tMost anything else goes \u2013 I\u2019ll think upon any changes later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div style=\"position:relative;width:150px;height:150px;\" class=\"noselect\"><div style=\"position:absolute;left:50%;top:12.5px;\"><div style=\"position: relative; left: -50%;\"><img style=\"position:relative; top: -2.5px; left: -1px;\" width=\"128\" height=\"128\" src=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/trinkets/ukey/5862a61140000637311626.png\"></div></div><div style=\"position:absolute;left:50%;top:0\"><div style=\"position: relative; left: -50%;\"><a href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/tools/action/show_object/ukey/5862a61140000637311626?validator=388f552d2fe11e33cfa94596220be143\" rel=\"trinketlightbox\"><img id=\"collectOverlay\" style=\"opacity: 1;\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/trinkets/trinket-collect.png\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"></a></div></div><div style=\"position:absolute;left:50%;top:0;\"><div style=\"position: relative; left: -50%;\"><a href=\"https://www.Writing.Com/main/tools/action/show_object/ukey/5862a61140000637311626?validator=388f552d2fe11e33cfa94596220be143\" rel=\"trinketlightbox\"><img style=\"cursor:pointer;\" id=\"\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/trinkets/trinket-square-36.png\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"></a></div></div></div><script></script><script>$(\"body\").on(\"click\", \"a[rel='trinketlightbox']\", function (event) { if (event.clicked) { return; } event.clicked= true; event.preventDefault();var options = {onOpen:function(){  if ($(\"#showMyNotifyOuter2\").length > 0) { $(\"#showMyNotifyOuter2\").attr('safeClick','true'); } },  href:$(this).attr(\"href\"), maxWidth :'700px', maxHeight :'700px', innerWidth :'85%', innerHeight :'85%', initialWidth :'300px', initialHeight :'100px', iframe:true, fixed :true, speed :100, fadeOut :50, opacity :.6 }; if (parent) { if (parent.parent && parent.parent.$.colorbox) { parent.parent.$.colorbox(options); } else { parent.$.colorbox(options); } } else { $.colorbox(options); } });</script></td>",
