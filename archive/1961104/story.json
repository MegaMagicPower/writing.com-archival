He was a black dragon, with a dark gray chest and underbelly. While many of his peers in his clan easily broke fifteen feet high on all four legs, Falahar strained to reach ten. Some of the taller humans matched his chest in height, and he was easily the smallest in his colony, only managing to be intimidating with training and some well-placed enchantments. Guys and girls alike turned him down in favor of more sizeable partners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn\u2019t help that he preferred studying the intricacies of magic to any sort of physical activities - so much time cooped up in caves full of books, dashing from project to project, wasn\u2019t exactly the best for a dragon\u2019s health. Even his fellow mages turned him down, either too wrapped up in research of their own or nervous around a dragon with such careless research methods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis frustrations were compounded by his struggles to bulk up, one way or the other. At first, he thought exercise would solve the problem, but he struggled to maintain a consistent routine, often getting distracted with a new research project. Even with his best efforts to eat healthy and workout, he could never maintain more than a slender, somewhat toned body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, it hit him: why not use magic instead? Falahar was more inclined to magic than most, and if it was successful, he could even help others this way! In a rush, the black dragon began pouring through any source of arcane information he could find for an easy way to put on some muscle, and potentially increase his own height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough his latest studies, Falahar found a number of false starts. But eventually, he would find something workable...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A spell, Falahar decided, would both be the fastest to try and the easiest to get started on. He poured through some healing spells, and discovered one specialized for healing muscles. If done right, this could be changed to build muscle instead. <i>If I can get this to work on myself, Falahar reasoned, there\u2019s no reason I couldn\u2019t get this to work on other dragons, too! I could help everyone bulk up, and there\u2019s no way I wouldn\u2019t get a mate then! </i> Caught up in ambition, the small dragon quickly constructed runes on a copy of the healing spell, not realizing the mistakes he was making in his haste to experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stuffed the spell page he was working on with some research materials and writing utensils, and took off for an isolated clearing some distance away. Falahar didn\u2019t think to tell anyone where he was going - he wanted this to be a surprise. Immediately upon arriving, the black dragon pulled out his makeshift spell and set to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let\u2019s see\u2026</i> Falahar began forming mana around his body, visualizing the runes on the piece of paper in front of him. As he continued casting, his body began to slump from fatigue, the spell sapped his energy. <i>I\u2019ll need to make this more efficient, but no major issues so far.</i> Finally, as Falahar neared exhaustion, his body flashed with light and the spell was cast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, nothing happened. Falahar waited, eyeing his body from head to tail to try and detect any increase in muscle. <i>Hm\u2026 perhaps too much of the original spell was retained. I\u2019m surprised a spell that took up that much energy ended up doing nothing, though\u2026</i> As the black dragon\u2019s thoughts turned inwards, however, changes began occurring all over his body. Slowly, his toned body began to disappear, replaced with layers of adipose. His belly went from near concave, to flat, then started to poke out as if Falahar had just finished a massive meal. The fat spread to the rest of his body, his legs gradually thickening, causing Falahar to subconsciously widen his posture as he paced. As his thighs went from from bony to bubbling, his neck and face became chubbier, the telltale signs of a second chin forming. Even his tail and wings began rounding out at the base, inches piling on as the minutes passed. What was once a thin, toned dragon looked as if he had more than doubled in weight over the last few minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, the dragon stopped his pacing and began to sat down - before realizing he hit the ground far sooner than normal. In a panic, he looked down at his body, terrified of what he saw. His stomach looked bigger than a late-term pregnancy, his legs more than twice as thick as when he first cast the spell. His tail had become far less dexterous, and after getting up in a panic, Falahar noticed his body slightly jiggling with his movements. <i>Of course</i>, Falahar realized, <i>All that mana had to go somewhere! But why would the spell do this?!</i> Panicked, Falahar rushed over to his materials, desperately trying to engineer a counterspell as his frame continued to magically expand.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deep in the back of the library where Falahar spent his time studying, the black dragon found an old, poorly-preserved scroll, seemingly forgotten in the back of the shelf. Pouring through its damaged contents, Falahar soon realized something - this was an ancient set of recipes for potions! The scroll had likely sat undiscovered for decades, maybe even centuries, and described a number of research project undertaken by a mage some time ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach entry in the scroll was made up of a target for the potion, a list of ingredients and preparation instructions, and a description of the potion\u2019s actual results. Most of the experiments ended in duds, or were a less efficient recreation of an already-existing potion, but one in particular caught Falahar\u2019s eye - the very last potion created. The opening statement of this potion seemed to have been damaged; Falahar could just make out a few words - \u2018size,\u2019 \u2018grow,\u2019 and the like. The ingredients were also unusual - some of the herbs here were either very rare or extinct, and rarely used in alchemy, with the rest being various strengthening agents. Finally, the results section was also greatly diminished, with only one line: \u2018Abandoned due to duration of effects.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalahr was was fascinated by this potion, and resolved to brew it immediately. If the potion was only a temporary muscle enhancer, then perhaps the addition of some modern techniques could improve the duration, or even make it permanent! Thankfully for the eager dragon, the library was well-stocked with most of the ingredients he would need; the rest would just require some substitutions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Let\u2019s see here\u2026</i> The black dragon though to himself, organizing glass jars of herbs and beakers of glowing liquids into his pack.<i> I\u2019ll need to go into the woods and gather enough elderflowers, plus I\u2019ll need to find a small lake, but other than that I should be ready.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sealing his pack and confirming his destination, Falahar sped off into the nearby forest, scanning the trees for the flowers he needed. Not much time had passed before everything was gathered, and the small dragon soon set to work, hoping to cure his diminutive stature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some time before everything was brewed, but Falahar soon had a complete potion in his claws. Despite his earlier excitement, the mage was starting to get nervous. The dark blue, slightly translucent potion shimmered with arcane energy, and seemed stronger than most potions he had encountered. Still, the dragon was focused on his goal, and after steadying himself, leaned his head back and drank the potion in one big *gulp*. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalahar could immediately tell something was wrong - the potion tasted bitter, and energy crackled on his tongue as the lukewarm liquid slipped into his stomach. The dragon let out a small belch and put a forearm on his paunch to steady it - only for it to swell right underneath his claws. A look down only confirmed his fears, the dragon\u2019s belly sloshing as it filled outwards. In surprise, Falahar instinctively shot upwards, but found flight far more difficult as the liquid weighed him down. It was clear to anyone something was wrong with Falahar, his distended stomach inching outwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing that he was going to be grounded soon one way or the other, Falahar landed, his belly scraping the earth as he did so. The dragon was caught off balance by this, and landed on his rear, his paunch pooling in front of him. In a desperate bid to stop the swelling, the dragon tried hugging his stomach with his forearms - but they could barely wrap around his swollen form, and squeezing only succeeded in causing the dragon to let out a loud belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, the liquid was starting to pool into other parts of his body - his chest and thighs started to swell, body losing some of its definition as the liquid caused it to grow. Falahar knew he only had so much time before he was rendered too big to move - but in order to engineer some solution to stop the swell, he first had to determine what was inside him in the first place. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Deep in the bowels of the library, far from where most students of magic studies, Falahar was lost in thought. In his search for magical muscles, the black dragon had only discovered duds, and was now forced to turn to a rather unreliable source - ancient magical relics, stored far below the surface. Distracted as he was, the dragon didn\u2019t notice the figure standing in his way until - <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d Falahar exclaimed, bumping into the rear of the dragon in front of him before falling on his own behind<br>\r\n\u201cHm? Is someone there?\u201d The other dragon asked, turning around to face Falahar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly, Falahar recognized this dragon - it was Haestra, a fellow student and researcher. Haestra was one of many dragons throughout the colony Falahar had a crush on - the researcher was so passionate about his work, and eager to share his findings with others. Falahar could sit and listen to him for hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now, though, the black dragon had other priorities. \u201cUh, s-sorry about that, Haestra, didn\u2019t see you there,\u201d Fallahar said, embarrassed. \u201cOh, it\u2019s all right, I\u2019ve just been doing some reading,\u201d the larger dragon said as he moved to the side. \u201cWhat brings you down here today?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well, recently I\u2019ve been trying to, ah, p-put on some muscle,\u201d explained Falahar, lightly blushing, \u201cand I thought it would be good to find a relic to help.\u201d \u201cHmm\u2026 I may have something to help with that.\u201d \u201cR-Really!?\u201d Falahar exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing some research into this small device.\u201d As he said that, Haestra pulled a small sphere with holes on top from his bags.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is some kind of incense burner. The idea is, you place something in here,\u201d Haestra explained as he began lecturing, twisting the top and pulling it off, \u201cand then light it on fire. Then, depending on what\u2019s inside, magical incense is released. We thought there was some symbolic relationship to what is burned and its effects on the user, but right now we\u2019re not sure there\u2019s any correlation\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Haestra got caught up in explaining, Falahar sat and admired the dragon before him. Haestra\u2019s scales were a grey-blue color, with a sky blue underbelly and white claws. He towered over Falahar, but was far less intimidating, if only because he didn\u2019t try to be. It was only when Haestra held up a bag that Falahar realized he hadn\u2019t been listening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf you could test those combinations for me, that would greatly enhance my research efforts,\u201d Haestra said eagerly. \u201cUh, s-sure, no problem!\u201d \u201cAnd as long as you follow my instructions, these ingredients should give you the best chance at the changes you seek.\u201d Wow, thanks so much Haestra! I\u2019ll report back to you as soon as possible!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExcited by the prospects of his easy solution, Falahar secluded himself a short distance away from the colony. As much as he wanted to get started right away, though, he soon ran into a problem - he didn\u2019t actually know what he was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRummaging through the bag given to him, the black dragon removed an almost random assortment of items. Some plant specimens here, an animal pelt there - other than all the items nominally being flammable, there was no discernible pattern. Falahar vaguely remembered something about what to combine with what, but couldn\u2019t remember the specifics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Urg\u2026 I don\u2019t want to have to go back and ask Haestra what to do again, then he\u2019d know I wasn\u2019t listening to him. Hm\u2026 I\u2019ll just put a little bit of everything in, what\u2019s the worst that could happen?</i> Falahar took a little bit of every ingredient he had retrieved into the burner, then lit it with a quick burst of flame and stepped back.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the incense burner caught aflame, a shimmering, light crimson smoke began emanating from it, clouding the air. Falahar leaned in and took a deep sniff, muscles relaxing and face forming a relaxed smile as the surprisingly pleasant scent filled his lungs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuh, maybe mixing it all together wasn\u2019t such a bad idea after all. This is pretty relaxing\u2026 The black dragon took a particularly large breath, his chest and stomach lightly swelling with air, and appreciated the aroma before breathing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat the dragon failed to notice, however, was that each breath out did not cause his stomach to return to normal - in fact, every breath Falahar took of the incense was steadily bloating him outwards, each one more than the last. As his belly and chest continued to grow, the expansion spread out to Falahar\u2019s entire torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half a minute of appreciating the incense in silence, Falahar realized something was wrong, and looked down at his chest. By that point, his torso had grown considerably wider, and was starting to hamper the dragon\u2019s movements with his limbs. Startled, Falahar pushed his arms against his bloated belly in a meager attempt to stop the expansion, but only managed a slight indent. His hide grew more and more taught, and his scales began spreading out, unable to cover the whole body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now, Falahar\u2019s uncontrollable expansion had caused him another problem - his limbs were beginning to be swallowed by his growing torso, threatening to render the dragon immobile.  But by the time the black dragon realized this, he had yet to make a move distancing himself from the source of his increase in size - the burner. If the dragon\u2019s growth continued unabated, he would become spherical, stranded in the clearing until someone rescued him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalahar rushed away from the device - or tried to, anyways. his inflating body spread his legs wide, forcing him into a slow waddle. His belly had grown to the point it scraped the dirt underneath the dragon, making a small divot and slowing his progress further.. The dragon attempted to take off, but by this point his wings had been constricted, not able to provide the level of control required. Falahar\u2019s waddle slowed to a crawl, then a standstill as his body continued to grow and constrict his limbs, his face tipping forward from his forward velocity. By this point, Falahar was downright spherical, his head and limbs barely sticking out from the rest of his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black dragon could do little more than wiggle his body or turn his head slightly - most other motion was off-limits by this point. The dragon was now a near-perfect sphere, his head barely sticking out of his body, with only the tips of his claws and hind legs visible. The black ball\u2019s tail had also bloated considerably, thickening with air to match his body\u2019s expansion. And as the dragon sat there, he felt a faint tug upwards - Falahar was floating! In a panic, the sphere opened his maw as wide as he could, and clamped down on a nearby branch. Although the dragon was safe from floating away, he showed no signs of deflating on his own, and the incense was still burning away\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He lay down and started to stroke his member, dreaming that it was a dragoness blowing him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't realise it, but a shadow was creeping up behind him. \"Abba!\" Falahar yelled in surprise. She was a green colored dragoness with a black underbelly. She had spikes beginning from the top of her head to the base of her tail. The dragoness known as Abba smirked, saying,\"gottcha red-handed, didn't I?\" Falahar blushed, rolled over, and said in a anoyed tone,\"well, if you're not going to help me, then you should leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled at him, saying,\"I would, I got a mating session with another dragon.\" Falahar frowned. \"Then way are you here?\" he asked.

Falahar's interest sparked up. \"Where *gah* is it?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then reached with her paw to his forehead and touched it. Bright images flashed through Falahar's mind. When she was done, he knew exactly where it was. \"I believe you can find it on your own,\" she said, getting up and leaving the cave.</span></div></div>",

Lilika sighed, shaking her head. \"Honestly Ryuu, how many times have the elder dragons told you NOT to cause trouble for the humans? its because of stunts like these that they hate us so much.\" she scolded, making the smaller dragon male adopt a more submissive stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...about fourteen times...probably fifteen now...\" Ryuu muttered, making Lilika groan as she sat down heavily. Lilika, unlike most dragons her age, was quite large, and not in terms of sheer size. If a human saw her, they would probably say she was fat, like obese levels of fat, her crystal blue scales shone bright across her large belly, strong as steel, but soft due to the fat they enclosed, her legs were wide and meaty, like cones, giving her a visible waddle when she walked, her rump was massive, her fat tail draped over it lazily, and her mane was pure white, long enough to fall over her green eyes some. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the criticism she received for her weight from the elders, Lilika was one of the most coveted dragoness' in their colony, having turned down many a horny male during breeding season, and only really speaking to Ryuuka out of them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thats just it Ryuu, the elders are deciding your punishment as we speak...\" she said, frowning at Ryuu, who looked shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P-Punishment!? b-but i didn't think it warranted punishment...\" he said, quivering as he knew how harsh the elders got during punishments, cowering like a newborn hatchling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLikila sighed. \"doesn't matter what you thought, now come on, they asked me to fetch you.\" she said, giving him the stern gaze he knew he couldn't refuse, making him whimper and follow her swaying rump through the forest to the 'Dragons village' within the nearby mountain, having to help Lilika get through one of the smaller entrances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside on of the large chambers, there sat five gigantic elder dragons, each the size of a human village, dwarfing the adolescent dragons before them. Ryuuka sat at the center of their gaze, small and helpless as he looked up at the elders, who all gazed at him thoughtfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ryuuka...are you ready to receive your punishment...?\" the central elder, Skaldanir asked, his voice calm and authoritative, enough so to make Ryuuka a bit more relaxed, he knew that no matter what his punishment was, a dragon would never kill another dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes...Elder Skaldanir...\" he said, still afraid, but willing to atone.

Ryuuka continues to sleep until a large gurgling wakes him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was some strange dream. I thought I just mated with a dozen females or something... That wasn't a dream.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few months has passed since Ryuuka has been forced to gain weight and become a brood father and the results are definitely noticeable. Whenever male dragons mate with females their metabolism lowers thus resulting in some weight gain. This usually happens when an adolescent is preparing for adulthood and it takes a few years before their bodies develop a larger and more muscular frame to carry the weight, however brood fathers do develop muscle while mobile, but they often grow larger and fatter in order to protect hatchlings and to breed larger offspring for the larger the parents the larger the offspring. This means that brood fathers can produce some of the most powerful offspring by just overindulging. Now Ryuuka is slightly larger than Lilika and has started to en joy all the attention he gets from every dragoness when he waddles by. It can even be said that his weight gain made him one of the most desirable males in the colony. But Ryuuka would turn down most pervy females, for he had only eyes for Lilika and was hoping that Lilika would become his sole mate for they only mated a few times throughout last four months due to the fact that he had to mate at least once a day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuuka was currently watching his unhatched children from his many mates that he mated with and was waiting for Lilika to come for his feeding session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Big Papa. Are you guarding our kids? It's time to feed you so you can become bigger and fatter.\" Lilika said as she rubbed her mate's large belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Lilika, can I just stay this size and mate? I at least want to teach the kids how to fly and to show them how a real dragon gets a mate.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't have you not learn your lesson. Plus your fate is to become a responsible brood father and raise kids for the colony while being big and fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not if I have a say. I'll become the toughest and strongest brood father alive!\" Ryuuka exclaimed as he started to take flight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang I thought you wouldn't be able to do that anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been training in-between my feeding sessions. If I'm going to be the biggest brood father must as well try to delay immobility by building my strength.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Ryuu. You large cutie. If you're not hungry yet we can always feed you to the brim when that handsome gut growls. So what do you want to do big guy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's see...

If seen by a human they would consider him obese. His emerald scales glistened brightly across his massive belly and was strong as diamond, but also soft due to his multiple layers of fat. His legs were thick and meaty. Many would say that Draxius was stronger than most given to all the weight he carries everyday. Whenever he walked it was he had a heavy waddle that would cause the ground to shake if he didn't tread lightly. His rear was huge and his fat tail casually covered it. His mane was jet black, but it was shorter than Mei's. His red eyes added some ferocity to his usually cuddly appearnce. In short an opposite version of his cousin. When they both were standing talking to each other it looked like an opposite mirror of themselfs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>- And what are you doing here? -</b> asked Ryuu afhter a few minutes of gawking. Lilika turned her massive body, which was jiggling and answered<br>\r\n<b>- Well i just brought food for you and while at it visit you and my dearly cousin  who runs this place.</b><br>\r\nRyuu was more confused<br>\r\n<b>- As a fresh meat here, you need to know the rules -</b> boomed the red muscular dragon. The one which greeted him. He was almost as tall as Draxius. He had red scales all over his body looking like a strong chainmail on his body. Very well defined huge muscles. Broad shoulders and arm muscles bigger then Ryuu legs. And that tail which was twice as big as his. Yet compared to the warden he looked like a twig - he continued <b>- Once in full moon or month if you prefer we restoke our supplies.<br>\r\n-Why?<br>\r\n- Becouse we are closing. And we need food. -</b> Draxious added patting his massive belly<b> - As the warden here i have to be sure we get enough supplies. Becouse when we seal the exit with magic will last for 30 days.

Wait. Almost got me there </b>- laughed the warden. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith all of that, Ryuu realized its going to be a long prison life. Lilika and Draxius shared their goodbyes with themselfs. Lilika to the goodbye added<br>\r\n<b>- And watch for Ryuuka he is a trouble maker.</b><br>\r\nDraxius just smiled and noded, Ryuu only gave her an annoyed experssion.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Its been a month since Ryuu was send to froced labour to attend his sins. During that month He learned a few things. First the layout of the mines. It wasnt just a big hole in the mountain going into diffrent eleveator shafts. In fact it was a maze with lots of caverns. At the first day he and Mei studied the payout so they wont get themselfs lost. Most of the mines shafts were not discovered and it was easy to get lost. But when you know where to go you could find interesting things in it. Caverns that contain things to live here like lairs to sleep in, storage for food and gems, dinning cavenrs to eat, workout cavners which were huge to streach out youre wings or just work out to get stronger. There even was a library, something Mei was monstly interested in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond thing he learned was the crew that work here. Not all of the workers were actually convicts. Some dragons like to dig in the mines. Which shoudnt be a suprise, couse dragons like shining gems and crystals. What was suprising was that they were ok with the closing. Ryuu was just passing by them sharing with them room in the dinning room and greeting once in a while. Usually he was with his crew. He knew that the black scarred dragon Fenir was sentenced becouse he was very aggresive towards other dragons and almost cippled the other one in a \"friendly\" duel. Ryuu was stayng away from him as far as possible. Besides he wasnt much of a talker. Once he wanted to greet him he just grunted and said<br>\r\n<b>- Listen, if you manage to survive 1 week here MAYBE i will learn youre name. For now leave.</b><br>\r\nEven afther the week he was not too friendly. He once heard that he wasnt that bad, since an accident that happend 50 years ago. He was trying to hang out with \"Igni\" Mei and the yellow shy dragoness. But Igni and Mei were busy with each other. Ryuu was teasing Mei for finding a mate, but she was ignoring that fact. Since these 2 were busy with each other there was the shy dragoness he only knew her name. It was Viv and usually when they were alone it was only an akward silence accured or just saying what to do today. Becouse of that he felt lonely here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third thing was how to work here, He did not expect that in labor theres is so much... work. The work looked like that there we assigned by the warden which elevator shaft they should go. They were given a map, so they wont get lost. The start to dig and get out the gems, crystals or other minerals. Usually they were using their tails as sickles or horns to get out some of the materials. Afther geting enough of them they were packing then on saddle backpack's carring on their back and going to the entry of the shaft, then coming back and repeat. Ryuu was extreamly weary. He did not understand who would be able to train in the training room afther that. He then noticed why. Once during carring his backpack he listned how some of the drgonesses miners liked big buffed miners, but only if there were beefer then them. It was quite supring becosue the females were very buffed. Ryuu decided since he is stuck here maybe some muscles will improvve his social skills and have someone to talk to or even to mate. Maybe he had strong dedicaion to it, he was not going to exhausted himself. He still hated that hard work. Sometimes he was even sneaking out with the backpack and going the longer way just to train on its own and just to get out of all the insults of Fenrir and yells of other dragons. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one of thie offsite routes he walked passed one of the abonded shafts. Suddenly he heard something coming from that direction. He only looked there and since he did not see anything he was heading back to his duties. But then he heard<br>\r\n<i>-..me...yone...ear me. elp...me...ease</i><br>\r\nThat time he perked up his hears to hear it more clearly afther a prelonged pause, he was about to shrug it off thinking was only the wind. But again this time still distant, but more clearly.<br>\r\n<b><i>-Anyone can hear me! Help! Someone! Please? </i></b>- the voice seemed feminine with a begging tone. Almost like a whimper. Sensing and adventure opportunity and not ignoring the calls of help he headed towards and yealled back<br>\r\n<b>- Im here! Hello?! Where are you?</b><br>\r\n<i><b>- Ple... Yes finally a fading light of hope was rekindled brigther. Thank the heavens. Please come and help me! </b></i>- answered the voice<br>\r\nRyuu seemed a bit confused becouse the yell was preatty loud like she was close by, but the voice was calling him from far away. Anyways he was going following instructions.<br>\r\n<b>- Do you see youre surroudings?</b><br>\r\n<b><i>- No sorry, but keep yealling i can tell if you are close or not. </i></b><br>\r\n<b>- Youre quite far, how can you tell, echo here is very strong.</b><br>\r\n<i><b>- You ask ill answer just to get pshyced im psycho.</b></i><br>\r\n<b>- What?!</b><br>\r\n<i><b>- Sorry i meant dont get psyched im psychic.</b></i><br>\r\n<b>- Wait do you...?</b><br>\r\n<i><b>- Read youre mind like a book, well yes and no. Yes i can hear youre thoughts, but im not diving deeper. Dont worry youre secrets are kept for you. And yes thats is a relief.</b></i><br>\r\nRyuu had some doubts, but his concerns went to rest when the voice reasurred.him that is ok, and he could hear in her something voice was honest and really needed help. Plus he found that her style of saying things was interesting. Some time later he heard<br>\r\n<i><b>- Yes! You are here i can sense as you stand near.</b></i><br>\r\nRyuu quickly looked around searching where the voice would be. The o0nly thing he saw was a big cavern with lots of boulder lyeing around and broken wooden pillars and of course stone walls.<br>\r\n<b>- Still cant see you<br>\r\n<i>- What is it that you see, you are close it must be.</i><br>\r\n- The only thing is see is some boulders, stone walls and... Hey what a cool looking low relief. It looks like its coming out of the wall.<br>\r\n<i>- Can you describe it?</i><br>\r\n- Well it looks like its been hit. It shielding her head with her paw and wing. <br>\r\n<i>- Its me im stuck here, thats why i could not move</i><br>\r\n- Thats you? -</b>asked Ryu, while poking the statue <b>- can you feel it?<br>\r\n<i>- Well feel some poking?</i><br>\r\n- It is.

Refuse and be prepared to meet my enchanted blade.\" The swordswoman responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok I'll help you, but promise me to let me out and tell me more about this Dago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swordswoman free Ryuuka from the net.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're good to go, but take me to your encampment so no pervert attacks me while I slumber.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuuka lifts the bear and puts the swordswoman on his back. When he returned the that night Lilika was ticked off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had to do something foolish despite Madam Titinina telling you not to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But Lilika, I was just hunting for some game until I fell for a trap. I even have the bear and the princess to prove it. Trust me that princess ordered me to help her rebuild the villages I burned last night. I didn't have a choice. It was either help her or die.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but as long as we get our mission done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry ma'am. As a swordswoman I promised to reveal Dago's whereabouts. He's taken over my father's castle and is using his pets to torture people.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's using the hatchlings as his slaves! That's child cruelty. hatchlings need to be with their parents. Not serving a warlock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's rest. Your friend has a lot of work to do tomorrow.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning the swordswoman explained to Ryuuka that he needed to head to Coalburn Caverns to mine dexterium. A rare material that is said to be formed when diamonds are enchanted with magic. The Coalburn Caverns is the only place to find them, but rumors have it that they can regenerate as long as they retain their magic. So Ryuuka flew to the caverns and preceded to enter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is the first time I've been here. There should be a few dragons around that should know where this dexterium is. The sooner I rebuild those villages the more time I'll have to get fat for Lilika, yet I wonder if she'll mind some extra muscle though. Defibtely don't want to become a brood father. Those guys are fat beyond belief and all they do is mate and eat all day.\" Ryuuka said to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAS Ryuuka went deeper into the cavern he could hear heavy grunts. He was certain he ran into some of his kind. When Ryuuka peered into the chamber his mouth dropped as he saw three extremely buff adults carrying large slabs of minerals. The adolescent became nervous, since he won't become an adult until he's mated at least once. For dragons the mating ritual marks the first steps of adulthood and it's not until after mating that dragons go through strange growth spurts ranging from buff or obese and usually gaining a few feet in height immediately after unlike the slow growth of adolescents.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yo! I need some dexterium! I'll just go take some if you're too busy!\" Ryuuka said as he started using his tail to grab some minerals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold a moment kid! Aren't you supposed to be serving your punishment and not fooling around here,\" glared the massive green and white dragon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I'm doing. I found a lead on the warlock, but my source refuses to tell me until I rebuild the villages I burned down.\" Ryuuka replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like Skaldanir knew what he was doing when he sent you on that mission with Lilika. My younger bro. was burning with jealousy when he found out that you two were sent out together. He's been trying to come up with a way to attract Lilika from right out under your claws.\" The silver dragon replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found out what attracts Lilika. She's not interested in males smaller than her.\" Ryuuka said hoping not to reveal too much about his plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That rules out almost every adolescent and by big she probably means a tough and sturdy dragon with a big appetite. The Blue and gold dragon said. \"Go ahead kid and take what you need. Carrying this stuff should really help you get stronger. It's incredibly heavy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRyuuka picks up a shard of dexterium and is surprised to find the material nearly weighing him down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This stuff is heavy. I'll have to take over one piece at a time. Thanks dudes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRuyuuka than leaves with a small bag of dexterium which was starting to regenerate as he walked back to the village. It was nightfall when Ryuuka arived and he was starving. The swordswoamn gives Ryuuka to bulls to devour for his hard work. Tomorrow Ryuuka would have to use his fire breath to sculpted the dexterium into a wall and start using it around the houses. The next morning...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was a long night. Mei had just finished raiding a city, but the reason is not what most of her kind would assume. Unlike Ryuuka who does it out of fun, Mei does it to liberate people from corruption. She had just finished scaring the warlord of the city into treaty his people like they're actual people and tools to meet an end. This however was against dragon law. Dragon law states that dragons are not to meddle in human affairs, and that it is up to the dragon elders to decide whether to intervene or not, but Mei's sense of justice causes more harm than good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a night. Hopefully that human warlord learned his lesson. I can't scum like him are let loose.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei manages to get some rest before a guest appeared. By then she was awake. A grin formed on her muzzle as remembered the previous night's heroics. Her white mane partially draped her back as she stood on her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last night was great. Hopefully that tyrannical warlord learned his lesson.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me more. How many homes did you scorch just to bring justice one man to justice?\" came a deep and powerful masculine voice, shocking Mei into a sitting position. She then gazes at the large green male with an embarrassed look who's eyes showed disappointment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dra... Draxius! I didn't mean to. I was just trying to rescue them from a tyrant. No one died or got hurt, so it can't be that bad, right?\" Mei said in the calmest tone possible as she looked at her crush, while blushing a bit. Draxius sighed and shook his head. \"I understand Mei, but the elders specifically told you NOT to meddle in the affairs of humans. It's due to your recklessness that humans hate us!\" Draxius said in a scolding tone. Mei  stared at the larger male dragon with shock. She wanted to protest, but the disappointment in Draxius' eyes made her at a loss for words. After regaining some composure Mei's ego came out with vengeance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least I'm proactive. I've saved countless lives! Humans should be thankful that I saved them from tyranny.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraxius shakes his head. \"You don't get it. The elders are waiting for you. I was asked to fetch you.\" Draxius groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Draxius wasn't like other dragons his age. He's one of the largest dragons in the colony, but not only for his size. If seen by a human they would consider him obese. His emerald scales glistened brightly across his massive belly and was strong as diamond, but also soft due to his multiple layers of fat. His legs were thick and meaty. Many would say that Draxius was stronger than most given to all the weight he carries everyday. Whenever he walked it was he had a heavy waddle that would cause the ground to shake if he didn't tread lightly. His rear was huge and his fat tail casually covered it. His mane was jet black, but it was shorter than Mei's. His red eyes added some ferocity to his usually cuddly appearnce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite criticism from the elders, Draxius was the most coveted male. He would often turn away many a pervy female during breeding season, and only speaking to Mei.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go. The elders are deciding your punishment as we speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Punishment! Why should I get punished for stopping evil!\" Mei said, as a tear rolled down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't matter. You deliberately broke dragon law. You should have asked the elders before going on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMei was fuming, but she sighed as she followed her hefty companion to the Dragons' Village in the nearby mountain. Mei even helped Draxius get through the smaller openings. Once inside Mei was overcome with remorse as the village sized elders gazed down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know why you are here.\" A female elder boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't want to hear it. Your intentions are noble, but you often forget that your actions have consequences. It's counterproductive to save a village if you almost destroy it in the process.\" The central elder said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I realize that Lord Skaldanir. But you don't realize that there's a tyrant who's been kidnapping hatch...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually we are aware, but you can't just rush in there. Therefore your punishment is...\"</span></div></div>",
