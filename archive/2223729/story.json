Stretching your arm to snooze it, you turn over and close your eyes. You can hear the muffled voices of your parents. You lay there in content, imagining all sorts of ideas. Looking at a potted plant by your window, you can see it shift a few millimeters. Maybe it was your imagination, you ignore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour door creaks open. Your mum puts her soft hands on your head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honey, it's time to get up!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes, \"Okay, mum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighs, \"Your father must get to work early.

You look at it, then you noticed something move. It was the potted plant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen the plant zooms past your ear and shatters against the wall. You stand there in shock. <i>The wind couldn't have been that strong</i>, you tell yourself in your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour parents come back to the room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do!?\" Your father shouts, upset.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Henry, look at the glass! It's broken!\" Your mum points out the broken shards on the carpet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put up your hands. \"It's not what you think! The window just opened and it flew by me!\" you explain hastily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour parents look at each other, your father says, \"Ugh, I don't have time for this! You must do all the chores as your punishment, or else you will be grounded!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they walk out of your room you can hear your mum say, \"Clean up the glass, won't you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the door, of which your parents left just moments before.
