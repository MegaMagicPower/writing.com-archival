Every vehicle appeared to hover a foot or two off the ground and all of them were brightly colored and some even were covered in graffiti. The city was not without the occasional tree or other flora and there also appeared to be small gardens protected by electrified fences and forcefields of some sort. It would appear that the anthros reached up to 7 feet tall and there were anthros everywhere you looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled up your head because you had no idea what these anthros were like or how they would react to a human. For all you knew, these anthros could be hostile. You even have to duck and hide as a couple of anthro police come forward. Both of them were heavily armored and looked like they were carrying laser pistols and electric handcuffs. One of the police resembled an anthropomorphic star-nosed mole man with a cap on his head that looked like it had digital parts attached to it. The other one resembled an anthropomorphic gaur man with bright blue fur, long horns and what looked like a goatee. Unlike his partner, he appeared to be wearing mechanical goggles. While the stars on their chests signified that these animals were the police, you\u2019d rather not risk it and just run down the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou could see that the sidewalks have glowing lights on them and you even see a three-dimension television screen on a large skyscraper that appeared to depict an ocelot woman on the news that from the looks of it, had large F-cup breasts that were completely bear, though she was still wearing a coat and news outfit. You couldn\u2019t believe it. You were in some sort of anthro animal metropolis and also from the looks of it they were even more advanced technology-wise than your garden variety human being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou eventually walk up to what looks like some form of levitating bus stop and sit down as you survey the area. The skyscrapers were glowing and you saw that they came in multiple colors. Some of them were even painted in patterns and graffiti-like designs. You didn\u2019t even think graffiti artists could reach that far. Obviously this city was a center of technology, culture and art. From the looks of it, there were anthropomorphic animals of mammals, reptiles, birds and even some animals that were supposed to be mythological. It was amazing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was when you say what looked like an anthro who was approaching the bench you were sitting at. From the looks of it, it was a female anthro. You were about to find out what kind she was.</span></div></div>",

She also had a tattoo of a fish skeleton on her arm that appeared to be covered in black fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou begin to shiver. That was one tough looking shark girl. You didn\u2019t think that you wanted to be anywhere near her. Thresher sharks were fierce and one that was sentient was more than likely to be even more ferocious than your average type of shark. But before you can get anywhere, two more shark girls show up and they appear to be skating next to the thresher shark girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them was a yellow skinned sawshark girl who was wearing yellow green glasses shaped like hearts along with a yellow green jacket and a dark yellow spandex unitard with leggings and roller-skates attached to her high heels. The sawshark girl was wearing a helmet shaped like a fish\u2019s skull that looked designed to accommodate her dorsal fin. She was hourglass shaped with E-Cup breasts and had a long saw-ridged nose. She was brunette and worn her hair in a bob-cut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third shark girl was blue skinned and rather fat hammerhead shark girl with white hair worn in a Mohawk and a ponytail. She was wearing a two-piece purple bikini with electronic sigils on it. She was wearing a lot of thick violet lipstick and was on top of a skateboard that was painted to look like it was covered in ghost faces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were three shark girls coming your way.

Anyway...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou listen carefully of what the horse have to say, as he has additional information.  he closes the door leaving you alone in the darkness   You sit in the chair, wondering what going to happen to you.  Suddenly, a light appear so brightly that you are nearly blind.  As your eye adjust to the light, you see that it's the same female bear that you saw earlier.  She is still wearing her black armor, but she no longer has the ax in her arms, but she is carry two torches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope that you are feeling comfortable,\"  The female bear said as she place the two well lighted torches to the torch holders on the wall.  \"I can't believe that Valens just let you be here with any light.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" you mumble as you try to relax. As you see Beth's body, you can't help but admire it. While the first thing that you notice was the large and firmness of her bare breasts.  You see that she has very muscular arms and legs.  You never been a big fan of those \"muscle girls\"  back home, but here, they almost seem natural to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAah! what to do with you?\"  she say as she moves closer.  She give you of what you hope is a friendly smile, and sit  in the throne. She leans forward, looking at you with a bore expression, her giant hand paws cradling her head. You try to look at her eyes, the odd way her fur on her head seem shaped and style to resemble hair,  anywhere but looking down.  As she turn her head and sigh, you take a quick look down at the massive cleavage right in front of you.  It even more alluring that the fact that she topless. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou like?\u201d  you hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and see that you took to much time looking down, and she caught you.  You hoping the poor light does not show how embarrass you are.    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, Ha\u201d  she gentle laugh as she gets up and move till she she behind you.  \u201cWell, I think I have the we have prove that you are a male.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I bored, so let's have some fun, shall we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She grasp and rubber your shoulders as she pressed her giant breasts on the top of your head.   She grab under your head with her big arms and press  She signs as she  rubs her firm jugs over and around your head.  She move in front, and slam your face deep into her cleavage.  Even you can't breathe for a while, you are enjoying yourself so much that you don't even care. You suddenly turned from being a little scared to aroused in a few minutes.  She continue to rub, press grind, and squeezed her giant tits, all over your head, face and shoulder, that you barely notice the click-click of her armor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you enjoy? \u201c  she asks coyly as you hear her voice from above you head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes\u201d  you sigh out.  The feeling is so good,  her mammalian melons are like firm mittens on your head.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just want to TOUCH them.  True, Valens warned you not to touch them, but they are right there! You raise your hands...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhack!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no no.\u201d she admonish, as back away.  \u201cyou don't get to touch those with your little fur-less paws!  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe come in front of you, still holding her breasts up.  Her angry glare that she gives you  worry you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo male gets to touch these, not even Boris anymore!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe drop her breasts,  their abnormal tits bouncing long after they should.  She place her paws on her generous hips.  Her angry flash of teeth, is replaced by a weird smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHmm,... I was having a little fun with you, but you had to ruin it.  Now I going to have to punished you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel that you should be scare with this turn of events, but Beth has said that last sentence in such a teasing and mocking tone that you don't know  what to fell. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if I got to punish you, I can\u201dt do anything with this on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou still unsure of your feeling as you see Beth removing the bottom half her armor.  The loud click-click or her armor falling to the door is loud.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere\u201d  she say as she step away from the mess of discarded armor.  She move towards you, only giving you a few moments to see her in her near bare glory before she slam down on your chair.  Her muscular legs are so long that she is able to sit on your lap and have her bare foot paws flat on the floor.  Not that you feel that way. You are not prepared on how just HEAVY, she is.  It feel like a cement truck was sitting your lap.  You can't help but groan and moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI haven't even started and your already moaning.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI...I sorry.\u201d  you squeezed out.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeth get up form that chair and sit her furry behind on the table.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I going to have to think of something else.  Something that won't hurt you too much... \u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit nervously as she hums to herself, her naked body, with her primal power, is scary you rather than making you hard.  Suddenly she yawns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOHHHH, I more tired that I thought,\u201d  she says as she stretches her arms up.  She lower down on the table, until it becomes her make shift bed.  She lays down, and it look like she prepared to take a small nap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI going to have to deal with you later.\u201d  she say sleepily, \u201cJust do try to esscccapppppeee....\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly stand as she begins to snore.  It seem that she fallen asleep.  You look back at the wooden door. This would be the best time to escape.  You don't know if the door are locked, let alone what's on the other side, but you know that Boris is not there.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other hand,.. maybe her punishment would be so bad..if she remembers.. and they're no telling what she do to you if she catch you as you try to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDecisions, Decisions. </span></div></div>",
