It is an mrgncy.\"<br>\r\nQuickly she ran to the nearest phone booth and punched in her ID, and was immediately warped to the headquarters of SFSA.<br>\r\n\"Agent 69, it has come to our attention that HECISB is planning to use a new weapon, the Bikinifier, to turn all clothing into skimpy bikinis. Now, sexy as that may be for girls like us, the men will look really weird and we can't have that,\" her boss, Agent 1 said upon her arrival. \"Now. We've had our chem girls develop a secret weapon for use against the HECISB- the Invisibility Potion.\"<br>\r\nShe held up a flask filled with a clear liquid.<br>\r\n\"So, it'll turn me invisible?\" Agent 69 said.<br>\r\n\"Yes. But.... but there are two flaws. First, it only lasts two minutes.\"<br>\r\n\"Hmm, I can see how that would be a problem...\"<br>\r\n\"It gets worse. The potion only works on the human body, not clothing. In order to successfully carry out your mission, you'll have to strip naked, then take the potion.\"<br>\r\nAgent 69 blushed momentarily, then regained her composure.<br>\r\n\"Anything for the sake of not having to see men in bikinis.\"<br>\r\nAgent 1 nodded. \"Exactly. Now. I trust you have your spy gadgets in your all-purpose backpack?\"<br>\r\nAgent 69 nodded.<br>\r\n\"Good. We'll warp you to the outside wall of the HECISB compound. Good luck, Agent 69.\"</span></div></div>",

She could see that there was a gate nearby, but also that it was possible to climb the wall using her grappling hook. She nibbled her lip anxiously. She had two options. She could,<br>\r\na) Fire her grappling hook at the wall and climb up. This would take a while though, and she would easily be spotted by searchlights.<br>\r\nb) Take a swig of the potion and slip through thge gate unnnoticed.<br>\r\nBut the trouble with this was the nudity thing, what to do with her spy gear and what if the potion wore off while she was halfway there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn careful deliberation, she decided to....</span></div></div>",

Quickly she stripped, stuffed the clothing and potion into her backpack and warped it over the wall. It was cold, she was naked, but she had no other choice. She held her breath and padded round the corner, through the gate and round the other side, where she found the backpack in the darkness. (The potion had the unexpected side effect of night vision.) She sat down, gasping with relief as the potion wore off and she became very visible again. Quickly she redressed and took a breather while considering what to do next. Ok, she'd made it inside the wall. But she still had to get in the building itself. She couldn't warp in- her portable warping device only worked on inanimate objects. She could see that the place was completely covered with motion sensors- so she couldn't get in through a window or anything like that.<br>\r\nShe sighed. She would have to use the potion again.<br>\r\nFirst things first, though. She accessed blueprints of the building from the SFSA database and located a small supply closet near the front entrance. She memorised its location, then sipped the potion, stripped naked, warped her gear into the closet and ran across the lawn towards the building.</span></div></div>",

She had to get to that other closet. Just then, she heard footsteps. She opened the door and saw a lone HECISB agent approaching.<br>\r\nAgent 69 grabbed her and pulled her into the closet. She beat up the enemy agent, stole her bikini, came out of the closet and shuddered at the childish pun.<br>\r\nThe bikini was ill-fitting and very uncomfortable, but it would have to do.<br>\r\nNow, how to get to that other closet?</span></div></div>",

SECURITY!\" the enemy yelled. Agent 69 had to get her off her tail. She hated to do it, but...<br>\r\nShe undid the clasp on the bikini top and threw it into the agent's path. \"STO-oooooop!\" she yelled as she slipped on the top and fell to the ground.

Be on the lookout for a suspicious character, believed to be a SFSA spy. Suspect is nude, I repeat, unclothed,\" a cool female voice said over the loudspeaker.<br>\r\nAgent 69 said a few more unprintable words. What to do, what to do? If she went out fully dressed, she'd stick out like dogs' nuts. If she went out nude, everyone would be on the lookout for her. She had no bikini with which to disguise herself. She sighed. Potion time again.<br>\r\nShe decided to leave her gear in this closet, now that she'd memorised the location. First she called up the blueprints on the screen. Oh, what luck! The supply closet was right down the hall from the central control centre where she suspected they were holding the Bikinifier.<br>\r\nShe steeled herself and took the potion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe closet door opened and closed as the barely-audible footsteps made their way down the hall.</span></div></div>",
