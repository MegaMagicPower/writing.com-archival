Cards with varying effects, which don't seem to work for the game itself, but rather alter the woman the user targets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cards in question are...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTotal Control - Places the subject into a blank trance. The subject then mindlessly follows any commands given<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBody Control - The subject enters a trance but remains conscious. Their body obeys all commands despite their mind's struggles<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompliant Control - The subject retains her personality, and willingly does anything the user of the card demands<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAware Trigger - The subject is given a trigger phrase that, when said, causes them to take a specific action tied to the phrase. However they will be aware that they are doing it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnaware Trigger - The subject is given  a trigger phrase that, when said, causes them to take a specific action tied to the phrase. They will not realize they are doing it, nor will they remember doing it<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReprogram - Changes the subject\u2019s personality into another the user specifies<br>\r\n<br>\r\nModify - Changes a person\u2019s appearance to match the current effect.  Reprogramming a girl to be a maid, for example, would give her a maid uniform. Changing her attire while instructed to clean would do the same, but change her clothing back once the task was completed or changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIQ Up - Raises the IQ of the target<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIQ Down - Lowers the IQ of the target<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorld Changer - Allows the user to make a large scale change to the world. However it can only be done once.  (Changes include making the user into a wealthy businessman, making all girls have to obey all guys, etc)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this deck here, and the world full of lovely ladies ready for some controlling, the only thing left to wonder is\u2026 who finds the deck?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
