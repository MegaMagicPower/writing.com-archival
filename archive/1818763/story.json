Fighting this young Nobody wasn\u2019t his goal, it was to escape the evil reaches of Organization 13. To do that, he needed to get away from Twilight Town somehow. Besides, he had seen this kid before, when Xemnas had tried to force him into his ranks like he had Aldex..... He was looking on with confusion, clearly too innocent for his own good. Likely, Xemnas had sent him to capture him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat wasn\u2019t going to happen. Spinning on his heel, he proceed to dash off in the opposite direction both to where he had came from and from the blond Nobody. The kid was stunned for a second as he quickly realised what happened. \u201cHey, Wait! Come back here!\u201d He unsummoned his Keyblade and dashed after the hooded figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA game of Tag(of sorts) had begun. For the next ten or so minutes, the two Nobodies chased each other across and around Twilight Town, only stopping when Heartless attacked. The kid was no closer to catching the hooded figure, but the reverse was true as well; he couldn\u2019t shake him. But this soon changed.</span></div></div>",
