She had been sitting out on her apartment balcony, munching on a piece of toast, when the flash of white light blazed by. In retrospect, the phrasing of her wish was careless. However, when the magic of the universe chooses to grant such things, it also tries to give us the very last thing we expect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walked back inside, still eating the toast. Her evening snack, which usually passed for her dinner, didn't seem quite as satisfying now. But it was still early, and perhaps she could splurge a little and treat herself to a night out, or maybe some delivery.</span></div></div>",

Although she hadn't changed out of her cream-colored sweater, she gave no thought of delaying her departure. She had returned home from work not thirty minutes ago, and she put her black pumps right back on and grabbed her purse. Her shoes felt tight, her sweater hot, but none of that seemed to matter as much as getting to the restaurant. She practically flew out the door, not even bothering to lock it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe drive was short, but her stomach had begun to grumble loudly, almost angrily. Even from the parking lot, she could smell the frying garlic and olive oil, the thousands of calories cooking away, the dishes of the happy diners, all taunting and beckoning her. Once inside, however, a mild feeling of panic rose inside her. There were a number of people waiting in the foyer, and through the doorway to the dining room she could see how busy they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie approached the hostess stand. A harried-looking teenager stood behind it, phone to her ear, scrawling a reservation down. When she hung up the phone, she looked up at Julie. \"How many?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just me,\" Julie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's going to be about 30 to 40 minutes, unless,\" she said, gesturing through the doorway to the small table at the very front of the dining room, \"you're okay with this table here. It's sometimes a little loud, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that'd be perfect,\" Julie replied, sounding somewhat relieved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hostess led Julie to the table and sat her facing the rest of the room. Servers weaved in between the sea of tables, balancing armloads laden with dishes of food. Julie's mouth began to water again. \"Here's our list of specials,\" the girl said, \"and your server should be right with you. Enjoy your dinner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie opened the menu.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The bowl of pasta in front of her looked absurd, a bucket of spaghetti and a gallon of sauce mixed together. She had never finished it, not even half before. Ordering it meant lunch and dinner for tomorrow. But as she stared lovingly at the bowl, she wondered whether it was too early to get another order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe twirled her fork against the side of the bowl, compacting it into a neat, bite-sized ball, and brought it to her mouth. It tasted better than she had imagined, better than she remembered anything ever tasting before. She chewed slowly, and warmth emanated from the tip of her tongue through the rest of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next bite, bigger and sloppier than the last. Flecks of sauce dotted the thin white sweater as she slurped up the trailing noodles. Her breaths grew deeper as waves of pleasure rolled over her. Every part of it--the chewing, the tasting, the swallowing--it shook her brain with ecstasy. She scooped up more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSauce ringed her lips. A piece had slithered its way out and trailed down her front, sliding back into the bowl. A slight flush crept up her cheeks, and she began to feel something else, something more than her hunger and her delight from eating. She had no idea why, nor any great concern, but she felt a strange sexual desire flicker and glow.  Her breasts, A-cups optimistically packed into a B-cup bra, buzzed with anticipation, and her sex dampened between her thighs. A soft moan went unnoticed by the other diners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore. A couple of people at other tables glanced over as Julie smacked her lips, and Julie gave the room a small, red-lined smile. Didn't they understand how good it was, how good it felt? She shifted in her seat, a little embarrassed, but a little excited, too. Maybe it was a trick of the lighting, or maybe the cut of the stained sweater, but her breasts looked really good tonight. They felt good, too, and her firm nipples rubbed against the over-sized bra she wore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer waiter stopped by the table, catching her in mid-bite as she stabbed more pasta. \"Good, is it? Can I get you anything else?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. \"One more, please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One more drink?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed. \"No, no. I'm good on that. Could I, er, get another bowl of pasta?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis eyes narrowed. \"You want another order?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded, then hesitated. \"And a--, a salad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want those to go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here is fine. I'm really hungry, is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cracked a smile. \"Yes, I can see. All right, a side salad and a marinara. It'll be a couple of minutes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he left, Julie took a smaller bite. Pasta meant carbs, and that would ultimately mean poundage. Was she going overboard tonight? But the bowl looked smaller than usual, and she was still terribly hungry.</span></div></div>",

Besides, it's not like anyone was watching her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that wasn't entirely true. A few people here and there had been stealing occasional peeks as she wolfed her food down. It was a sight to see, a petite woman like Julie eating so fast, with such passion. She suppressed an urge to smile at the onlookers again as she ate another bite. At five-five and barely a buck-ten, it hardly seemed possible that she was able to eat that much already, let alone eat more. But she felt good so far, like she could keep eating all night. It made her feel special to eat like this, to defy the expectations of those around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, millimeter by millimeter, ounce by ounce, Julie began to change. Her brown hair grew longer, past her shoulders. Her tits swelled bigger with every mouthful, and her pants started to show off her ankles. Julie saw and did not see these changes. She idly ate now, savoring less, and reminisced on her wish tonight. Oh, to be famous, an actress or a model! But the idea was laughable. She would need to grow a half a foot and two or three cup sizes, and then what? She would look like all the rest of the women in the magazines and movies, cookie-cutter bimbos with plastic boobs and suctioned cellulite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No,</i> she thought, to be famous, <i>I would have to be something special.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate faster, her head bent over the bowl. Her bra now fit her, and her toes felt tight in her shoes. Her sweater crept off of her waistband. Her pants drew tighter across her backside as her butt began to grow, as well. Her chair squeaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I would have to get people's attention.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie hazarded a glance down at the bowl and immediately dropped her fork. Her chest was now encroaching on her view. It hadn't been a trick of the light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tits were getting bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she watched, as she chewed her last bite and swallowed, she saw it happen. Slowly, subtly, the tick of her heartbeat pumped her now-B boobs up and out, up and out. Now focused on it, in fact, she could feel them grow, actually feel the skin stretch and weight on her chest increase.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA grin, wide and excited, crept across her face. Was it the shooting star? The pasta? Some freak occurrence? It didn't matter. What did matter was that, somehow, she was getting the body she always wanted by eating her favorite food. She picked up her fork and scooped up a huge lump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sigh escaped her lips as she felt her breasts inflate again. The under-wire bra held on as flesh filled it to the brim. It felt fantastic, indecent. She looked down to appraise her effort. A half-cup or so. And there was more where that came from. So much more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He left with a look of concern for the young lady who seemed all but ready to toss her cookies before the night's end. She plowed on through the first bowl, now sopping up the cut strands and leftover sauce in the first bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Julie ate with purpose, every bite a mini-orgasm that spread to every limb. As discreetly as she could, she kicked off one shoe, then the other, wiggling her toes still bound in stockings. She knew, now, that it wasn't just her boobs that were growing; she was taller, bigger all over. Julie's back cracked as she inched taller. Her bones grew thicker and denser as they stretched to compensate for her swelling assets. Her joints ached as her body adapted to its size. But the only discomfort Julie felt was for her stomach, hungry for food. It wanted more, and faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie wanted more, too. She had resented her small stature before, but had always accepted it as a part of who she was. Unsatisfied, she had secretly grown jealous of women taller, curvier, sexier than her. Women who had an easier life, a better one than her. She had kept it hidden, though, even from herself. Her desire for fame was not really about popularity, but merely recognition from the men who passed her without so much as a second glance, the women who pitied her figure and her looks. She saw them in the restaurant, whispering to their boyfriends and husbands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this gift, this weapon, this opportunity would make them understand who she was and what she would become. She thought about ordering a third bowl, but reconsidered. After two, she reckoned, the restaurant would understand, as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe band on her bra, stretched by her widening bust, finally broke with a muffled snap. Now free of their suspension, Julie's tits appeared even bigger than before as they surged against the tight fabric of her sweater. Someone gasped, an unseen watcher. A small burst of pleasure accompanied a rubbery sound as her areolae stretched wider and her dark nipple thickened to thumb-sized stubs. She thrust her chest out, arching her back, and the hem of her top crept higher and higher. She was past six feet tall now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pulled the second bowl to her, untouched, her new loyal servant. Her sleeves receded from her wrists as her arms grew longer, and her pant legs clung to calves that bulged and swelled as her legs lengthened. Her hose ran from her thighs down to her feet. Calories pumped into her, lengthening tendons and bones, making her stronger. Her ass threatened every seam it met, and she rocked its mass back and forth in her seat, relishing in wanton pleasure as cloth cut across her sopping wet pussy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tables around her had all stopped their conversations and were gawking at the woman who had seemed perfectly normal an hour ago as she seemed to make love to a bowl of pasta. Check that, an enormous woman, at least six and a half feet tall. Every other bite caused her to shiver in an unmistakable orgasm. Some spoke of her tits, how they stretched the woman's collar and filled it with a billowing tower of cleavage. The table in front of her, an older couple, pointed beneath the woman's table to a set of size 16 feet sliding across the hardwood floor of the restaurant. Nobody, however, noticed when her pants split down the back, or when her soaked panties finally snapped off, or when her butt rapidly swelled to the width of the doorway behind her. Nobody except Julie, that is.</span></div></div>",

Both looked nervous. Julie stared at them curiously, but continued to eat, deftly pitching more spaghetti into her mouth as she met the manager's eyes. He fidgeted, settling his gaze on her steadily enlarging breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid we're going to have to ask you to leave,\" he said. His eyes darted to hers, then back at her tits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie looked concerned. Finally, after a time, she stopped chewing and swallowed. Her waiter's eyes followed the last mouthful of food down her esophagus, watching as she pumped up another fraction of an inch. \"Why?\" she asked. \"I can pay you now, if you'd like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manager held up his hands. \"Oh, no, that's perfectly fine. We're happy to provide your meal free of charge. In fact--Edgar?\" He motioned to the waiter, who proffered a bag in front of him, an offering. \"We've prepared something to take home with you. It's just--some of our other patrons have commented on your--your appearance this evening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand,\" she said, feigning ignorance. \"I'm sorry for the mess, I get a little enthusiastic, is all.\" She picked up the bowl this time, palming it in one hand, and poured some of the noodles into her mouth. As she pulled away, the marinara sauce splattered down her front, looking like a blood spill. Some pasta trailed from her mouth, the tail end swinging to her tits. She sucked them up greedily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheeks stuffed, she chewed as the manager continued, nonplussed by her continued gorging. \"Ah, yes, well. We're also concerned with your attire, which is not appropriate. I'm afraid you'll have to leave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed, barely chewing this time, and her growth became immediately obvious as she ballooned outward. A woman screamed and the manager skittered back a couple steps as Julie's head shot up three or four inches. Her sweater rent completely around her arms, their bulk filling the sleeves beyond their capacity, and her tits now squeezed out of every corner. \"Mmm, that one was good, wasn't it? Well, can I at least finish this?\" She gestured with the bowl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ma'am, I'll have to call the police if you don't leave immediately,\" he said, taking a step forward and trying his best to look imposing. The eight-foot tall giantess in front of him looked almost crestfallen. With her free hand, she picked up the plate with the small salad sitting atop it, and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn two quick swipes, she sent the rest of the spaghetti and the salad into her mouth. She chewed once, twice, and it was all gone. The manager stared up at Julie's enormous face, his brain finally comprehending what she meant. She didn't just intend to finish the pasta; she was gesturing toward the rest of the restaurant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sweater tore off like wrapping paper, the cotton rags falling around her. Her boobs leaped into the open, still growing. The wooden chair, which had miraculously held her up until this point, splintered into a million pieces. Her monstrous body blocked the door, and the people before her all stood dumbfounded, spell-bound by her ascendance.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Even sitting on her ass, Julie found herself staring eye-to-eye with the manager. Her long brown hair fell down her back and over her chest, but aside from some stray scraps of cloth still hanging around, Julie was stark naked. Her face was still smeared with spaghetti sauce. With a casual wave of her hand, she knocked her table out of the way.  Her legs, thick as the manager's whole body, flanked both him and the waiter on either side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was a pretty good appetizer, don't you think?\" she said, eying the door leading off to the kitchen. \"But I seem to be getting <i>hungrier</i>. I'll take this, for now.\" She took the bag from the hands of Edgar, who still stood frozen in terror. \"But do you think the kitchen could whip something up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my God,\" whispered the manager. He started to back away, his legs refusing to work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie grabbed his arm, yanking him toward her and slamming him into her soft, enormous cleavage. His whole chest was covered by one of her tits, and her nipple grated on his shirt. She drew him in, her arm pressing him deeper into her boob until he was inches from her face and that wide, dangerous mouth. She whispered, but her voice carried so that Edgar could hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe,\" she said, licking her lips, \"you have Edgar go back there and get me some food, or else I break your neck. How does that sound?\" She looked over the manager's head, straight at Edgar, who jumped when she said his name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manager nodded once, slowly. \"Edgar,\" he said, breathlessly. \"Go ask.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith great hesitation, Edgar turned to the kitchen. Constantly checking over his shoulder, he shuffled toward the door off to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you let Edgar and everyone else here know I'd better not hear any police.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, no police.\" He turned his head to address the restaurant. \"No police, just, ah--stay calm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" Julie said, smiling. \"We're all doing good. Now where were we? Ah, yes, this.\" She pulled up the bag containing the prepared food to her face, and inhaled. \"Ah, more marinara? It's the best. I hope Eddie finds some more back there for me. But this much? Oh, no. No, I'm sure this isn't enough. But it'll do as another snack, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping a careful eye on her captive still wrapped up between her arm and breast, Julie tore open the bag and tore off the lid on the container of pasta. It was a lot for anyone other than her.  she set it on the floor next to her. He let up off of him, but before he had a chance to move, she grabbed his arm again. \"Pick it up,\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I don't--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bend down and pick up the tray. You're going to feed me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! No, no, I won't.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe squeezed his forearm, causing his knees to buckle. \"Yes,\" she said. \"You will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this?\" he asked. \"Why don't you just leave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My food's getting cold,\" she said. \"And I'm getting hungry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manager opened his mouth to respond, but clambered for the tray as Julie applied pressure again to his arm. When he stood, she grabbed the front of his shirt, and dragged him back in again. She opened her mouth, and he took handfuls of the spaghetti, sauce running down his arm, and fed it to her. She moaned in approval. Julie's tongue wrapped around the manager's fingers like a python, sucking the food from his hand obscenely. Pressed as he was against her enormous rack, he could actually feel her breasts get bigger, the warm, soft flesh pancaking against his shirt. Soon, he would slip into her cleavage. He balanced the container on the edge of one tit, the lid fluttering with her panting breaths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More,\" she demanded, and he grabbed as much as he could into his hand. The empty container fell, dotting her thigh with some of the sauce. He brought both hands up, holding them as close to her mouth as he dared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened her mouth wide. Wider, until her jaw creaked. Wider than the span of the manager's offering, the corners turned up in a cheshire grin, and wider still. The manager gasped as he saw her teeth, magnified in size and multiplied in number, surrounding a swelling, lengthening, undulating tongue. It snaked out as she leaned in for a bite. A huge, encompassing bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips engulfed his hands completely, beyond his wrists. He shuddered as her mouth closed, as her tongue shoveled and scraped the pasta from his grasp. Her saliva drenched his hands and flowed out of her mouth, trailing down his forearms. She pulled him away, stripping him of her prize, and it felt like razors and sandpaper as her teeth and tongue passed over his flesh. His fingers cleared her lips with a pop. He looked at his arms in wonder, amazed that they were still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyelids drooped as she sighed, delighted in how wonderful everything tasted. Even his skin tickled her taste-buds in ways nothing had before. And there was more, too. As she held the food in her mouth, rolled it around her cheeks and mashed it with her teeth, she could feel a warmth building in it. It was the power, the pleasure, the pounds-in-waiting. How much did she weigh now? How tall was she? But the numbers could not describe the magic and beauty of her metamorphosis. Her breasts grew, grew from the envy she felt when she saw all the other girls in high school develop around her while she stayed the same. She had bought her bra to try and emulate them, a desperate plea for attention. Now it could have scarcely contained a fraction of her magnificence. Her pants had simply exploded as she had grown, unable to face an ass that could crush chairs, hips that could fill doors. And could this building be far behind? Bras could not contain her. Pants could not contain her. Walls were just a small hurdle now. The power was in eating more, and she would never, ever stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed slowly, a trickle at a time, and she felt an orgasm building. Her huge pussy, kept well-maintained for a non-existent boyfriend, drooled onto the restaurant's floor. Her tits inflated again, pushing the manager away. A centimeter at a time, her head rose toward the ceiling. She was looking down on everyone now, and her feet met another table. Its occupants jumped up and stood, staring as their table began to slide across the floor. Her grip loosened as her passion began to take over. She slid a hand up and down her side, caressing her growing boob, appreciating its heft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe manager now stood eye-level with her engorged nipples, and her pulsating growth rubbed his face against it as she climbed higher. The sound of her expanding flesh filled his ears. Skin rubbed against skin, flesh murmured and shifted as her skeleton thickened, joints popped. The fingers wrapped around his waist lengthened. He watched as more of the spaghetti slid into her body, then more. Through her flesh, he heard her deep, guttural moan. She quivered violently, tightening her grip and now shoving his head between her hundred-pound tits. Everything went dark.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Edgar went to the kitchen and brought back every last scrap of food, both prepared and raw, that the restaurant had in stock. Within 5 minutes Julie ate all of it. With all the restaurant's food in her stomach and none left outside of her, Julia was still hungry. She ruptured the roof as she kept growing! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out an ear-shattering belch, and said, \"That was delicious, but I'm still hungry.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that was all the food we had, and the place is now out of business,\" said Edgar, \"So, I guess you'll have to get more food some place else.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I think I should finish ALL of this before I go some place else,\" said Julie, \"And at my size now, I'm not so sure we're the same species any more!\" She licked her lips with further hunger and anticipation. She was right, for she was now (having grown more after eating the last of the food) 100 meters tall (about the size of a football field from head to toe, and proportioned accordingly). <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" said Edgar, although the fear in his voice proved he was lying. He knew EXACTLY what she meant. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach let out a long and deep growl of hunger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know,\" said Julie, smiling sweetly, \"You're actually adorable from my new perspective. In fact, you're all cute enough to eat!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her being a giantess about to eat everyone, a restaurant customer named Gregory was still immensely turned on, with vague hopes of becoming Julie's next boyfriend. Looking for an excuse to show her, he addressed the crowd, \"Hey, everyone, let's get naked just like she is! Maybe she'll be too grossed out to eat us.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greg, what the f---\" said his friends Lyle, Kevin, and Teresa in unison. Nevertheless, the whole restaurant heeded him, even the waiter and manager (who had boldly jumped out of Julie's cleavage, initially startled when he just barely heard Greg's suggestion). Last of all, even Lyle, Kevin, and Teresa followed suit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awe, you like me,\" said Julie to Greg, noticing, \"My name's Julia, but I go by Julie. What's yours?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gregory, but you can call me Greg,\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Greg, I'm not looking for a relationship just yet. We can be friends, and eventually you'll still end up inside me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds fine,\" he said, being eaten by a pretty girl being the best way to go considering he had to die some day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you all for that,\" she said, \"You'll taste better without your clothes!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ate the manager first, then the waiter, then the creepy boy that was already staring at her when she walked in at her original size. Being Greg's newest friend (and of course the last new friend he'd make), she saved him and his three other friends for the very last, a favor to let them live a little longer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst one by one, then a few at a time, the men and women of the customers and staff crossed the gate of her bright vivid lips, and fell into her smooth perfect belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was nearly 11 PM when Julie finally began to feel satisfied for one night. By luck, there were only 6 people left in the restaurant: Greg, his 3 friends, and a little boy barely 5 and just started Kindergarten 3 weeks earlier. (His parents were already digesting.) The remaining person was Julie herself. She quickly ate the leftovers on the plates of the people she'd eaten. Indeed, she had indirectly eaten the non-leftovers, the food that was eaten by the people she ate, which was now in the stomachs of the people in her stomach. They would continue to digest it even as she began to digest them, releasing what they largely digested themselves when they were fully digested so that she could digest the rest of the way what they had mostly digested. Thus, there was more than one layer of digestion, all at once! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky we made as friends, Greg,\"  said Julie, \"I am still vaguely hungry but only vaguely. That little boy will do for tonight.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the kitchen empty, all the plates clean, and all the people except herself and these 5 others already in her belly, it was quite a night of merciless consumption! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for sparing our lives, at least for now, friend,\" said Greg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome,\" said Julie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further ado, Julie picked up the little boy from under the table where he was hiding. She wanted to make him feel a little better about dying, so she decided to be playful. She brought him up, in the palm of her hand, against her belly to let him listen to its wondrous sounds, of food and people alike bubbling away to become part of her. She held him out, stood up, and let him appreciate her body. He was nowhere near puberty, but a boy no matter how young still appreciates a girl as pretty as Julie. She rubbed her belly, highlighting again where he would be soon enough. She let him take in her image (before taking him in) some more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she brought him up to her face. She burped, and he giggled a little (still laughing at bodily functions like the little kid he was). Then, she opened her mouth wide, and extended her tongue atop her hand, reminding him of a red carpet at the entrance to a castle. At her gentle behest, he walked the carpet of her tongue from the courtyard of her hand to the mighty gate of her lips, all in a manner more like a ceremony than like the ordinary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe crossed the gate of her lips, into the castle of her body, and then admired the pretty girl's mouth from the center of it. She removed her hand and retracted her tongue. She closed her lips, and tilted back her head. The boy fell to the very back of the girl's mouth, atop her throat. When she opened her throat, she finally ate him! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter riding smoothly down her gullet, he landed calmly in her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally full, Julie let out the loudest belch ever, even louder than the \"deafening\" one earlier! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned to the lucky few remaining. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm full, but promise to bring other meals (food, people, I don't care which) to me or else I'll eat you 4 anyway.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregory, Kevin, Lyle, and Teresa briefly talked amongst themselves. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sound of sirens outside the restaurant snapped Julie out of her euphoric state. Someone told on her, and she wasn't near ready for her debut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEdgar, her savior, appeared through the doorway pushing in a dessert cart loaded with dishes. The kitchen had piled everything, from pans of stored lasagna to tubs of cold pasta, onto it, and it had left a small trail of alfredo sauce leaking from one of several bags. Tossing the manager aside, she crawled on all fours, knocking over tables and looming over people, toward Edgar. Edgar, fearing the worst, skidded to a halt and bolted back through the kitchen door, screaming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if on cue, the entire restaurant seemed to explode with shouts as others, who believed that she had attacked the young man, looked to run as well. Dozens streamed through the now-unblocked main door, few looking back at the behemoth beauty. Even those who were initially paralyzed by her sudden race to the cart began to edge their way around Julie's body. She, however, paid them little attention. \"Run,\" she murmured, mostly to herself. \"I'll see you all again real soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bullhorn shouted demands to her, but she ignored them. The cops wouldn't rush in, not without knowing if she had any hostages. And what was she supposed to do, anyway? Come out with her hands up? Her breasts wouldn't make it through the doorway, let alone her magnificent body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, oh, why leave through the doorway when there was a much better choice?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe picked up one of the lasagna pans, which looked smaller than a sandwich to her, and took a bite. Her teeth bit through the steel pan as if it wasn't even there. She began to grow again, and she paused her eating to focus on the wonderful feeling of getting bigger. Her head rose closer to the ceiling, forcing her to stoop lower as she ate. Nipples as thick as Coke cans capped weather balloon-sized tits that grazed the top of a table beneath her. She took another bite, a larger one, and fit the rest of the pan into her mouth entirely. Another earth-shaking orgasm rocked her body. Her head actually hit the roof this time, and she broke a smile. It would only be a matter of time before her debut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd what would the people say about her? The thought almost brought her to climax again. They would talk about her body, how big and tall it was, but what would it mean to have an ass as big as a house? What would it mean to have tits the size of cities, or legs as long as mountain ranges? What would it mean to eat a building, to fuck a building, to crush one in her abyssal cleavage?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted it all, and more. And she wanted it now.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Taking the whole cart in her hands, she considered her options. It wouldn't be more than a couple of bites, but it would be enough. Enough to transform her from merely inhumanly tall into a true giantess. It would be beyond food at that point, and far beyond clothing. It was an easy choice, really.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne great big swallow, and the whole cart was gone. It barely fit, (really, didn't fit), but it slid in anyway. Her insides churned away. The table beneath her growing tits collapsed before the pieces were swept up in her expansion and cast aside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bare back, a broad slope of flesh, broke through the restaurant's roof, raining down shingles and plaster onto the ruins and pavement below. Cries of panic broke out through the crowd that had gathered in the parking lot as Julie rose into view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotlights illuminated patches of her haphazardly, and when combined with the flashing police lights, gave spectators frightening glimpses of the monster before them. Her fingers raked the wreckage and crammed heaps of it indiscriminately into her gaping maw. Her bulk shuddered in paroxysms of pleasure as each mouthful spurred another orgasm. Room-filling tits bobbed and rippled as she ate. Nipples the size of hubcaps jutted outward. Her eyes, half-crazed with hunger and lust, rolled in their sockets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd still, to everyone's surprise and Julie's delight, she grew. Her head rose higher and higher into the night, her expansion pulsating in time with her rhythmic, incessant consumption. The destruction below her snapped and churned as tons of pale, soft woman overwhelmed furniture and slammed into walls. Thighs as thick as trailers continued to stretch longer and plump wider, their girth preparing for the moment she would rise and seek out more food. Given her frantic pace, it wouldn't be long, either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA police bullhorn shouted at her through the din, but Julie paid little attention to the tiny people before her. Their eyes all focused on her, awed at her burgeoning magnificence, while they dwindled smaller and smaller. She tore at the remains of the restaurant, gnashing on what little food was left, mixed in with chunks of drywall and tiling. With everything almost gone, and with her hunger as ferocious as ever, it was time to move on.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The lights flickered in the supermarket as an earthquake shook the building. The dozens of shoppers stood frozen in the aisles, watching as goods vibrated off the shelf and the store's fixtures rocked gently back and forth. An explosion from across the street vibrated the storefront's windows, and several people screamed as another earthquake struck, this one more intense. Sirens erupted, and inside the building flashes of red and blue filtered through from the outside. Was it over? Was there more?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBursting through the wall, a gigantic set of fingers ripped a ten-foot wide patch of roof clean off, then disappeared into the night. Some people in the store gaped at the hole, uncertain of what they saw, while others panicked. When the hand reappeared, clearly and obviously an enormous human hand, everyone began pushing their way toward the doors, toward the far wall, anywhere to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKneeling down in front of the store, Julie brought the piece of the roof to her mouth and ate it without hesitation. It broke apart and dissolved quickly between her massive, numerous teeth. Her body was changing in subtler ways, adapting to her new diet. She could smell the food, the people, even the building itself, and it made her mouth water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt big. Her breasts, swollen and tingling, jutted in front of her so far that she was quickly losing sight of her lap. Her ass had expanded, too, widening her hips and forming a round, fleshy shelf behind her. Curves upon curves, stacked several stories high, topped with a face drenched in post-orgasmic sweat. She squeezed handfuls of her flesh, delighted to feel a boob or butt-cheek flow around her fingers. She felt her body throb and pulsate, her cells dividing, her skin stretching, her bones lengthening, her power growing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEating absorbed her thoughts, punctuated with quick, intense orgasms. She pulled a larger piece of the roof free and stuffed it into her mouth, and murmured in appreciation as it, too, disappeared into her body. The rush of energy that flowed into her felt like taking a dip on a roller coaster, making her light-headed. She hadn't even gotten to the real food yet, but she could already tell that she was in for a massive growth spurt. When she finished, she wondered whether she would even be able to walk down the street without demolishing buildings, whether her feet, even, would be too wide for the roads to handle. She tweaked one of her trunk-like nipples and moaned. When Julie finished, she didn't want any part of her body to fit anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe reached in again, this time pulling one of the shelving units out. Bags of chips rained down as they slid from the shelves, but Julie did little to try and save them. It would only be a matter of time before she would eat the whole building. The bags popped in her mouth as she chewed both them and the metal fixtures. Despite her size, she still could taste the salty, crunchy chips on her tongue, and her belly rumbled in appreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJulie leaned back, her face tilting skyward, as a large spurt shot through her. Those who had stopped to gawk at her could hear the groaning creak of her growing bones, could see her tits fill and expand, could feel the earth tremble as her weight destroyed the ground beneath her. Julie's head rose to the point where, even sitting, she was at least forty feet tall. She marveled at how tall she was becoming. In the ruins of the store, she saw a girl, frozen in fear, looking up at her. She was a thin girl, and young, too. A bit like her, Julie, thought, before her transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh, if only you knew,</i> Julie thought. <i>If only you knew that the power was there all along. Why settle for B cup breasts and size 4 dresses when bigger is so much better? Why settle for measurements at all, when growing feels so good?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabbed another section of shelving. She felt it shrink in her expanding palm, then popped it into her mouth like a lozenge. Like medicine, it was making her better, stronger, healthier. She had been sick all of her life, and didn't even know it; sick with averageness. But now, even if she were normal height, she would be the center of attention wherever she went. What would it be like to smash a man into her cavernous cleavage again, to squash him flat with an ass wider than a couch? How would he react when he felt her grow heavier on top of him, when he heard her pants first stretch, then rupture as she outgrew them? This was Julie's reality now, a world waiting to be crushed under her growing body, smashed by her enormous feet, pinned underneath her bulbous breasts, ground against her hot, gigantic pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hunger was more than food. She hungered for size, for mass, for power. She ate another handful of the wreckage, and continued to ascend.</span></div></div>",
