How he uses them is up to you. The Link who the story focuses on will have many abilities by sources of magic, they are: hypnotism, possession, body switching, mind control, and gaining a set of magic dolls that can be used by him on girls to take control of everything about their mind/personality/soul (including taking their mind or soul away) along with controlling her body remotely and being able to make her say things that he wants her to, and turn them into living dolls or puppets, along with being able to make girls his loyal slaves and make them believe whatever he wants them to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese things can only be used by him (they are connected to his spirit, not his body), you can choose what form the things that give them those powers take (with the exception of Wind Waker/Phantom Hourglass Link having to use the Wind Waker's Command Melody for possession), and he doesn't have to get them right away. Also, the Morph Materia from Guyote's story will be obtained by Link. With the exception of the Morph Materia and the Command Melody with the Wind Waker, the effects of the abilities can't be used on boys (except for that Link can use the body switching on himself), although if Link uses the Morph Materia on a boy to make them become a girl, the things can work on that person. If anyone has an idea for any other abilities for Link to have, tell them to me, and I might put them in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory Two: Virtual World.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony gains a program allowing him to create his own virtual world. Anthony and others can go into it once he makes it. It can't be hacked, and Anthony has full control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory Three: Liquid Suit Maker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony comes across a living liquid loyal to him (and with a crush on him), and it makes female skin suits for him out of it's substance. Starting with fictional characters, but ones of the girls from his world can be made. The liquid entity can control the suits, and the people inside, other than Anthony, including having the suit character's mentality be in charge. Those people can be put in a state where they do not realize what is going on around them. The suits form around the person's body. The liquid can't possess people, but it can fill suits with itself, and act through those suits. The suits come with all of the girl's skills and abilities. The memories of the character can also be accessed while worn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory Four: Me, Myself, and I.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA story inspired by the story I,ME and MYSELF, made by penpal, but with my characters, and I will actually keep up with it, not allowing someone to hijack the story and put something random up that makes no sense, and goes against the plot of the story. Anthony and some friends and family go through with the kind of experiment done in the story mentioned earlier in this paragraph, but Sarah tampers with the device for some sick glee, which backfires when she is made to participate, and can't back out without casting suspicion on herself. The people that become Anthony mentally will slowly gain the memories of their original selves, but keep Anthony's memories and mentality. Sarah is the only person required to become Anthony mentally.</span></div></div>",

He had just played the Song of Time, and the last thing he remembered was a bright flash...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! You're back.\" Link heard the Happy Mask Salesman say after going inside the Clock Tower. He had returned to the outside of the Clock Tower. Link soon learned the Song of Healing and turned back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Salesman held out his hand. \"Now, if you would be so kind to return my mask...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink scratched the back of his head bashfully. The Salesman's smile faltered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You... did get it back, didn't you?\" Link sighed. He suddenly felt himself being picked up and shaken violently, as the Salesman did his light speed movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You little fool!! Don't you realise how dangerous that mask is!?\" The Salesman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTatl fluttered over to the Salesman. \"We're sorry! But the Skull Kid's too strong, and you didn't exactly give us much time...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink felt himself back on solid ground, and staggered as the Salesman magically returned to his original position.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm... I suppose you're right. You might need a bit of help acquiring that mask...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Salesman turned to face them, holding out a black ball of energy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well. This is the last help I can give you. The little imp might've stolen the mask, but I was able to steal back a small amount of it's powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe warped back in front of Link, with his trademark eerie smile. \"Best brace yourself; this will be very unpleasant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, he rammed the ball into Link's body before either Link or Tatl could stop him. Pain coursed through the boy's body, causing him to cry out in agony as black lightening crackled over him. The Salesman removed his hand and Link fell to the floor unconcious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link!\" Tatl moved to fly over to him, but was intercepted by the Salesman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry. He wasn't harmed. But when he wakes up, he may be in for a surprise...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few hours later, Link awoke. He was to soon find out that Majora's power had...</span></div></div>",

How STUPID of him! He'd agreed to help Romani protect her ranch from \"them\" and he was late!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Idiot!\" Admonished his partner, Tatl. \"It's 3am, they'll have definitely invaded by now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right; they entered the farm and found, to their horror, the ghostlike purple creatures were swarming the ranch, being sent down in waves from a glowing ball of light. Every single one of \"them\" was heading for the barn, where Romani tried desperately to hold them off. She had gone outside since Link was late.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink decided to follow her lead and produced his own bow. He attempted to attack, but there were too many of them. For every one of \"them\" he shot, two more appeared to take it's place. He had to do something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hit him. The light! It was their source! He aimed carefully and fired...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...the arrow bounced off harmlessly. The attack, while doing no damage, had clearly angered \"them.\" They all turned their attention to Link, and started to close in on him. He tried to fight them off, but it was in vain. One of them grabbed his arm, two more grabbed his legs, and there was a bright flash...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What shall we do with him, Commander?\" A voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do the same thing we do with all the others who interferein our plans, Lieutenant. Wipe his mind and send him back.\" Another replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may, Commander, I think I have a better idea.\" A third said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, Admiral? What would that be?\" The commander asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been conducting an experiment on what would happen if certain strands of our DNA were to be transplanted to creatures of other species. Our attempts with the bovine we have been abducting have been... less than preferable.\" The Admiral replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed... so you're saying...?\" The commander's voice trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps a sentient organism would be best. Take the boy to the operating room and then send him back. We will monitor his progress!\" The Admiral said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink awoke sometime later. He was in the middle of the Romani field. Tatl was nowhere to be seen. Unbeknownst to him, he was now partly one of \"them.\" This gave him the ability to...</span></div></div>",

That last part was still a bit up in the air, but he was attracted to her all the same. It might be fun to walk a mile in Zelda's shoes, especially with most major threats in Hyrule more or less taken care of. It would make for a fun prank that he was sure he could get away with regardless, he and Zelda just clicked like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo after reciting the spell, it was no surprise to Link that next he knew he'd be staring at Zelda's bedroom wall. He quickly turned to the mirror, and was blown away. Seeing Zelda there, mimicking his every move, was surreal to say the least. Her every feature moved according to his will, and he trailed his fingers down her face. She was incredibly pretty, beautiful, and Link already knew that, but seeing Zelda literally through her own eyes was breathtaking. This moment belonged to him, for this brief instance, he was Princess Zelda, and had that all to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink turned to look at his butt in the mirror. Shameless as it was, he did always love how well she filled out those tight pants of hers. He flushed red as he got a look at it from Zelda's own point of view, a soft delicate hand pressing itself into the soft flesh and squeezing. There was no doubt that royal blood was divine with how amazing that felt. His hands traced all over the Princess' behind, and he sheepishly raised one hand to give it a light slap. He felt kind of bad about it, but he couldn't deny how much fun it was too. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked down at his hands, the hands that he had just used to get up close and personal with Zelda's ass, and was fascinated by how small and dainty they were. Nothing like the strong and hardened grip of a warrior like he was used to. He brought them up to Zelda's chest, not the plumpest in the world, but it certainly got the job done compared to most commoner women. They were soft and delicate, like the rest of her, felt even through the layers of fabric separating them from his grasp. He caressed them gently, like he was handling fine silk, and a moan slipped out of his mouth, causing him to blush once more... yet he didn't stop, it felt too good to do so.</span></span></div></div>",

Her breathing started to grow a bit quicker, and she gulped as her hands continued to massage her chest greedily. She recalled the spell recited to possess this body, and called out with her mind to her original, male body in the other room. Within moments, the husk of her former self entered the room, completely empty and seemingly subservient to her every whim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly, Link peeled off her blue shirt, revealing her fancy lace bra underneath. That only flushed her further, and clearly the lustful thoughts were getting through to empty male body before her, because it moved in and shoved it's arms behind her to grope her ass. Link practically melted in her former self's arms, compelling it to have grope and fondle her to her delight. After a moment of that, she moved it to Zelda's bed. After quickly dispatching those tight pants, Link was left in just her underwear, panting with lust on top of her former male body. The Link body removed it's pants, it's hard cock free from the shackles of clothing. That's all that body was to Link right now, a simple toy for her to use to pleasure herself. It used to be her's anyway, so who really cared? Zelda perhaps, but at the moment the only person here who could even be <i>considered</i> Zelda... was Link.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink's entire body felt hot with desire, and a burning sensation of lust caused her womanhood to react in turn. It knew Link wanted this, responding to her as if she really was the true owner of the body. Link slid the panties down her legs and wasted no time lining her current womanhood with her former manhood before dropping her hips down and letting the full length of his cock fill her. \"Hylia~!\" She whined out loud, the sensation of having her pussy filled for the first time sending a shock wave of new feelings, both emotional and physical, throughout her entire being. She began to gyrate her hips, not willing to release that cock from within her quite yet, but still needing to feel <i>more</i> of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer former body remained as lifeless as ever, seemingly only responding to her thoughts and desires. Not her consciousness controlling both, but more of a puppet dancing according to the strings that were Link's mind. By the Triforce, she couldn't get enough of it. She compelled the lifeless husk to take more of an active role, and it began to thrust it's manhood at a pleasurable pace for Link. Meanwhile, the knight turned princess had undone her bra and tossed it aside, now squeezing her naked breasts and bouncing up and down on the Link body's cock. It felt incredible, a pleasure unlike anything she had ever felt before. Like her entire body was running hot and firing off electricity all at once. Desperate for more, she moved her position, bending over on the covers and letting her other body mount her from behind to continue. She moaned, burying her face in the covers and gripping them with all her strength as her body reacted to the raw pleasure of having sex. Zelda's pleasure, even her very virginity, now belonged to Link, body and soul.</span></div></div>",

Link knew this was wrong but he couldn't stop, he didn't WANT to stop, he kept thrusting upwards, meeting his husk's thrusts again and again, his old body refusing to stop, Link could do nothing but wrap her legs around his waist, pulling him closer, moaning as her breasts got manhandled by his body's strong hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"M....more.\"  Link said in Zelda's voice, a part of him wished the real Zelda wanted this, from the memories he got back him and Zelda were close, he was her protector, even if her father didn't order him to protect her, he loved her then and he loves her now, the Calamity seperated them, but with help he found his way back to her, vanquished Calamity Ganon and saved Hyrule once more with his memories in tact.  Zelda was someone he could never have though, she is royalty and he a lowly knight forever in service of her, still he can at least pretend they can be one.  Her moans were getting louder as his body was grunting, their lips connected, it was the most blissful thing ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Link!\"  Link cried out again, still wishing this is the real Zelda and her true feelings, he hoped the goddesses of Hyrule can forgive him for this sin, but he cannot stop nor does he want to, he knew their climax was reaching it's end and allowed the husk to pull out and finish, it didn't take long for his semen to smear her delicate body.  Link sighed happily at that as she got up to clean herself off, his body staying there waiting for further instructions as the bath was made, Link took Zelda's body and submerged her into the water, enjoying the bath.  Temptation struck him to have his body join her, but he might have done enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now what do I do with you?\"  Link wondered, does he release the spell and chance her knowing, does he keep her a while longer, maybe there is a way to bind her to him, he doesn't know, but what he does know is that this is just the beginning and there might be more in store for his precious Zelda.</span></div></div>",

She caught it several times, but it kept slipping out of her hands, in frustration, she thrusts down with both hands as it lands and knocks it away with a wave from the impact of her right hand, but her left hand ended up plowing right into her vagina. Link moaned, swirling her hand around, flexing her fingers, digging the digits out, but unintentionally pleasuring herself as she did so. That got her turned on again, and wanting to go again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink willed her original body over to her, and he walked over, obeying his mind's command, and took the soap, which she offered, and began washing her as she began using both hands on her womanhood, moaning more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's it... more...!\" Link moaned, getting into it, unintentionally sending some desires due to arousal into her original body, which then became more sensual with his cleaning, and when he got to her breasts, he began caressing them, and rubbing across her nipples, stimulating them. This kept on, until he went down into her vagina, putting his hands in there as well as she played with it, and stimulated it with a thorough cleaning. Link cried out in ecstasy as she came again, right over their hands, and then collapsed like a rag doll, closing her eyes as she let herself bask in the pleasure she was feeling, and was tired out enough she decided it was time for bed, she then felt herself be picked up bridal style, and opened her eyes slightly to see her original body holding her, causing her to close them again, and nuzzle into his body as he carried the shell his mind was occupying into Zelda's bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink found herself standing in front of a younger version of her normal self, who had a man that looked a lot like him, but older than Link's current time self, and as she was eye level with 'Link,' she knew she was younger too, in fact, her memories vaguely told her that they were seven. 'Link' was wearing a blue lobster shirt, dark orange pants, and brown boots, and older man was wearing a knight's uniform. While Link couldn't see what she was wearing, due to facing forward, and unable to change her viewpoint at will, only feeling it fidgeting as if nervous. What she could feel told her that she was wearing a dress, diadem, tights, elbow length gloves (which out of the corner of her eye, she could tell they were white as they would come into view every so often), and shoes with slightly raised heels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hello there.\" Link found herself saying without any input from her own will, feeling her face lightly flush, and a feeling in the back of her head going 'he's really cute.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if it isn't the princess herself.\" The knight said with a smile as he laid his hand upon 'Link's' shoulder. \"Remember your manners, son.\" 'Link' nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, your majesty, my name is Link.\" The boy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you, Link.\" Link felt herself say. \"Please, none of that your majesty stuff in private, you're not a soldier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink suddenly found herself several years older, being 12 years old as a matter of fact, looking around a corner as she saw her normal self, also 12, wearing a green tunic with some chainmail and likewise colored shorts, along still having brown boots, training with a sword, as his father and several knights watched on. She herself felt some differences, as she still felt the dress, but now had heeled boots instead of shoes, no gloves, and not wearing the diadem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's amazing, that boy's a prodigy!\" One of the knights said in a stunned tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, if I had any doubts that he were the hero's reincarnation, they're gone now.\" Another replied. Link felt a bizarre mix of pride and happiness for 'her friend' and jealously and resentment that it came so easy for him, while her (Zelda's) father was pressuring her into ignoring her passion for studying and forcing her to try to awaken her spiritual powers through meditation and a variety of magical means. Her eyes narrowed, and her lips droop into a frown, as she turned on her heel, and stomped away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink next came to in Zelda's room in Hyrule Castle, one month before they left to try to prepare for Calamity Ganon, making Link 18, and Zelda 17. She was siting at a desk, writing a journal entry in her diary. As she was looking down, she was able to see more of her outfit this time, seeing that she was wearing her outfit from when she'd be on castle grounds. Link's attention was, however, focused on the diary entry she was writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>It is just so frustrating, my father refuses to let me pursue my own interest and intents for how to prepare for Calamity Ganon, and is ordering me to do things as he feels they should be done, no matter the fact that his way isn't going anywhere.</u> She is gritting her teeth and gripping her pen tightly in a way that made it seem she was about to snap it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u>He acts like I'm just not trying hard enough, but I am! What's worst of all, I keep taking my frustrations out on Link. I know it's not his fault, but the fact that it comes so easy to him, and he gets praised, while my 'destiny' is so difficult, and gets me scorn, just makes me so frustrated that I can't calm down with interacting with him! I just wish that I could drop my concern of my duties, and be with Link, but if my father is trying to dictate my life like this, odds are he won't let me get with him due to just being a knight instead of nobility. This pent up frustration is driving me nuts, and if something doesn't happen soon, I'm likely to say \"heck with it,\" lock us both in a room, and force him to take me as a slave, even if I have to convince him by getting him on the bed and making him fu-</u> She suddenly jumped as she heard a knock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess!\" A voice who Zelda's memory at that moment supplied as being a younger Impa's called out. \"Your father wants to see you.\" Link heard the doorknob rattling, then felt her face get into a panic-stricken expression as she looked at the journal entry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">\"She can't see this!\"</font> Link/Zelda quietly panicked, grabbed and ripped out the page, quickly rushed to the fireplace, and threw it into the fire, not a second too late, as Impa walked in, saw her with a panicked/nervous expression as she was panting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Princess, are you okay?\" Impa asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes, I'm okay!\" Link felt herself say in a cheerful tone, as she closed her eyes for a moment, before opening them, seeing Impa looking at her suspiciously, before shrugging it off as not being important at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next scene Link came too was right after Zelda awakened her powers and saved the downed Link. Link saw her normal body in her arms as she shook him lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Link! Please, you have to get up! Don't die on me... I-I love you!\" Link heard herself say as she pulled him into her, tears running down her face, not caring when his head ended up falling in between her cleavage. \"Th-There has to be some way... Maybe I can find a way to put him in my body!\" She thought, her face flushing as she imagined Link in her body, and doing whatever he wanted with her, no matter how lew- she shook her head, dropping that thought \"No! Save him now, fantasize later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink next found herself sitting in front of the elderly Impa, her memories letting her know that this was about an hour or two, at most, before he possessed her. She was sitting on her knees, legs bent behind her, hands resting on the top of her thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I see,\" Impa said to her with a nod. \"You wanted to admit your feelings for him after he saved you, but he lost most of his memories, and you don't know want to force him into anything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, please Impa, you must have some idea on what to do!\" Link/Zelda pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only thing I can say, is stick with him, and create new memories for him if he can't regain the old ones.\" Impa replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink suddenly awoke, her eyes opening. She noticed she was in Zelda's bed, naked, with her arms around a similarly naked male body, whose arms were wrapped around her waist, and her head was nuzzled into the crook of his neck. She leaned back, and saw her original body was the one embracing her. She suddenly remembered her dream and blushed heavily.</span></div></div>",

The feeling of heat hit him right away, but rather than feeling overwhelmed, he almost forgot he was feeling it only mere seconds after. He blinked a few times, then noticed the spear in his hand... and then slowly the rest of him. His skin was a dark tan color, and he was insanely tall, over six feet! His biceps were rock solid and bulging, and a few strands of red hair could be seen from the corner of his eye. This possession spell had put him into the body of a Gerudo Town guard!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately Link's hands went to his chest. Whoever this guard was, she was very well endowed, with giant yet soft mounds of flesh being constrained by the fashionable Gerudo garb. His hands then went to his abs, which were as rock solid as the biceps before them. \"Wow.\" Link muttered to himself. He didn't speak often, he didn't really feel the need in such a lonely place as the modern Hyrule, but he was so stunned he couldn't help it. Besides, if he was going to convince others he was really a Gerudo, he'd have to get used to it. It would be trouble if they knew there was really a man underneath this metric ton of Gerudo flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink observed his surroundings, noting that he was in the main Palace. He wandered from his post to find a mirror, which only took a minute. Now that he got a good look at this desert woman he now inhabited, he could admit to himself that he was even more impressed than initially. She looked remarkably similar to his old friend Urbosa from 100 years prior, minus the crazy head of hair. This woman had a much shorter cut by comparison, but her chest was even bigger than Urbosa's, and her muscles felt just as large as that. Link flexed his arms and let out an impressed hum. If Zelda were here, she'd probably tell him to stop fooling around and find some practical use for this situation... but then again, Zelda probably wouldn't be very happy with him stealing this poor woman's body either. The thought made Link slightly annoyed, as he was kind of starting to enjoy this, but he probably should figure out what to do next...</span></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><span style=\"line-height:1.4;\">While he was here, he might as well take advantage of it. After all, it would be nice to explore Gerudo Town and the surrounding desert without the risk of being caught by anybody. That, and he had to admit being so tall and physically strong sounded pretty fun. Sure, he was the legendary hero and all, but even his courageous soul could be potentially upgraded to a superior body... temporarily at least. With that in mind, Link wandered out of the palace, giving a small greeting to the fellow Gerudo that stood outside. The marketplace was before him, and a smile crossed his stolen face. He spent the next little while freely exploring, chatting with some locals (some who he had to awkwardly work his way through a conversation with, since they seemed to know this body's true identity), and just generally having a good time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was still high in the sky, and yet Link was impressed that he was not bothered by the heat in the slightest. This Gerudo body combated heat like it wasn't even there, something he appreciated as he decided to go outside the city for a walk. Of course the few Hylian men who loitered outside the city walls lusted after him, but Link sheepishly did not much of anything until the fellow guards shooed them off. From there, Link was alone as he walked on over to the nearby oasis, which was currently deserted. He peaked over into the water, getting a look for his new Gerudo face once more. She was certainly a pretty one, and he found himself enjoying looking at his own reflection probably more than he should. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe glanced around, and was still alone. A hot flash hit his face as a dirty thought entered his mind, and he stared down at his giant covered breasts. His hands reached back up and softly caressed the fleshy bags, which caused a moan to slip from his throat. He lifted the top clean off his muscular body, placing it to the side and looking down as his naked torso. His breasts were just as eye catching with the top removed, a nice dark tan tone contrasting the hot light of the sun and the glow of the sand. Link kicked off his shoes and removed his pants and underwear, now standing out there in full naked desert warrior glory. His hands moved up and down his muscular form, enjoying the feeling of strength and power this body offered. Slowly, he waded into the oasis waters, and the cool pleasure of the cold water on his tan skin made him moan again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe submerged, popping back up with his wet long red hair shimmering majestically in the sun. Link sat down in the water, his breasts floating slightly as it reached above his torso. Slowly, he stuck his hands down towards the woman's crotch, biting his lip and moaning as his fingers began to rub at the womanhood he had stolen. The Hylian man turned Gerudo woman moaned as he finger fucked himself, the hot sun beating down on his face and the cool water surrounding his form. Link felt his thighs clamp on his hand as the pleasure built, and it didn't take long for him to finally hit a climax. He let out a husky moan as he came, legs twitching slightly before he let himself just float in the water. \"Wow.\" He repeated from earlier. That was way more fun than he thought it would be. He'd almost feel bad he used the poor woman for his own pleasure like that, but it's not like he needed to give this body back anytime soon... right? </span></span></div></div>",

He was starting to adjust to this body fairly nicely, the shape and feel of it starting to feel less and less foreign as he got used to controlling it. hHe stood, long red hair shimmering wet and clinging to his back as he walked to shore and squeezed some of the water out of the red locks. His mind was made up, he was going to keep the Gerudo's body... at least for now. It was too good an opportunity to pass up. Besides, it might be fun to go on an adventure as somebody else for a change. Only problem, there was only so much he could do confined to this endless desert, and without the Sheikah Slate it would certainly be hard to move around conveniently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe... she put her discarded clothes back on, but instead of heading back to Gerudo Town, decided there was no time like the present and headed off toward the cliffs that separated the vast Gerudo Desert from the rest of Hyrule. While the journey worried her at first, she found her new Gerudo form was much more adept to the harsh climb than she would have thought. In fact, Link could swear the entire trek barely felt like an issue at all. By the time she had the cliffs behind her, she was admiring her arms with a smile, impressed with the sheer strength their rippling muscles granted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't long until she managed to find a wild horse, which would make the journey much simpler. She also realized how... different it was riding a horse with a woman's body, and given the state of her moans while crossing the landscape of Hyrule, it wasn't an unpleasant difference either. Finally she reached Hateno Village, where her personal lodge and home away from the castle was stationed. Rather than explain why a Gerudo was all the way out here, she simply climbed up the cliff next to her house and slipped inside. She let out a sigh, tired from the long journey. Before she could even think of doing anything else, Link peeled the Gerudo garb off and flopped into bed, falling asleep almost instantly.</span></div></div>",

After your last day of school you began walking home on your usual route when all of a sudden you think you hear someone calling your name from inside a nearby park. Curious and with nothing else to do, you decide to investigate. After a bit of looking looking around you happen to notice an egg laying on the the ground. (It is a green egg with red brightly glowing spots.) You reach down to touch it but the moment you touch it it explodes causing you to get knocked out. When you wake up you notice a red slime lying on your chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puru!\" The mysterious slime says somehow without any mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You came from the egg didn't you?\" You ask as you attempt to grab it. Before you have a chance to it latches itself onto your hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puru!\" It says in a tone you can only describe as a admittance of absolute love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better take you home little one.\" You say as you begrudgingly put your slime covered and in your pocket and hurry back home. Surprisingly, you manage to make it back home and into your room without having to interact with anyone else. You take the red slime out of your pocket and look at it. The slime surprisingly didn't get your clothes wet and slimy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hello Anthony.' You hear in the back of your head. You look around to see who said that only to find no one around except for the slime.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"D-did you say that?\" You ask, insanely curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yep! Sorry about that, it took me a while to establish a permanent psychic link between us Master.' Is the slime's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you call me master?\" You ask, confused about everything that is happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I guess I should start at the beginning. I am a skinsuit slime, you see, every thousand years, one of us appears on earth looking for a master to serve. Once someone touches our egg, like you did today, we instantly fall in an eternal love with our master.' The slime 'says,' with redder parts on what you guess are the cheeks. 'After that, we latch onto them so we can establish a psychic link with our master so we can always talk no matter where the other is. Now that we got that out of the way, what would you like to do Master?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you were a skinsuit slime?\" You ask confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yep, I create skinsuits based off of real and fictional characters for you, other people, and myself and once they are fully on your body changes to perfectly fit the inside of it and the skinsuit transforms into your skin, but don't worry, if you consentrate on changing back, you'll be able to take it off and go back to your old self. Also while wearing them you gain the all the powers, abilities, and memories of who the skinsuit is based off of. And don't worry about trying to tell me who you want looks like, the moment you tell me who you want I'll know everything I need to so I can help you. Oh, and one more sidenote, I can only create female skinsuits. Now with all of that in mind, who would you like to become Master?'</span></div></div>",

You then watch as it rapidly expands turns a peach skin color as it\u2019s produces the skinsuit. You also watch as it also creates Wonder Woman\u2019s costume as well.

Then you watch as the sagging skinsuit breasts inflate and merge with you, giving you D-cup breasts. After that you feel your whole body change as it becomes a perfect replica of the skinsuit. Finally you feel the slit in the back of the skinsuit fade away as the skinsuit as the skinsuit completely merges with you and replaces your old skin, completing the transformation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, this is amazing!\u201d you say as you check your new body out.

Inspired by a comic series on deviantart called Soul of Venus. Naruto, Ranma, or Ash gets a special necklace with a gem on it. It syncs to their Chakra/Chi/Aura, and thus, can't be used by anyone else (although it can sync to their descendants if they have any). If a girl touches it directly while the boy is wearing it, his Chakra/Chi/Aura will start to be inserted into her body as long as she is touching it. The effects of the Gem causes the girl or girls in question to fall in love with the boy in question. She will feel no pain, and in fact feel pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls' Chakra/Chi/Aura will naturally try to fight it off, although it will be unnoticeable unless someone can actually see a person's Chakra/Chi/Aura, even the girls themselves will not notice. The more the boy's Chakra/Chi/Aura infects a girl or girls, the more they are effected, and the rate that it enters her body is, of course, determined by the boy's current amount of Chakra/Chi/Aura compared to the girls' amount. If the girl has romantic feelings someone else already, they will lose their romantic feelings for that person. The love spell is unbreakable, as is the gem itself. The gem has no effects on relatives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory Six: Disgaea Morph.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony slowly transforms into a Disgaea character (others can change as well).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory Seven: Naruto of the Six Paths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto obtains the Rinnegan, but it is modified by Kurama. The first six girls he looks in the eyes will become one of his paths, each with one of the abilities (he can use them all). All that is left of the girl mentally is her knowledge for Naruto to use. Only Naruto's eyes cause it, any of the girls' bodies with the Rinnegan won't cause the assimilation. Naruto will of course have to get used to moving multiple bodies at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory Eight: Malamar's Mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis starts off at the end of A Conspiracy to Conquer. After everyone is freed of it's control, it tries to take control again, using its power on Serena, Bonnie, and Ash, in that order. Before it can try to use it on anyone else, Ash's aura messes with its power, not only throwing of the control, but implanting something in Malamar, which causes it to overwrite the information in their brain to be an almost exact match of Ash's. It is not Ash being in the girls body per-say, but she will think like him, and believe herself to be him, with his memories up until that point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe difference is that not all of the information is overwritten, and some personality traits may be left behind. Bonnie still has the urge to cuddle anything she finds adorable, and Serena still loves being fashionable in her appearance (keeping the same interest in outfits as before, instead of liking boyish clothes), cooking (which she keeps her skills at), and her immense love for Ash (making her feel awkward for being attracted to what she sees as her body, as well as her feelings towards Ash). They may have the some of their memories remaining to use, whether right away, or having to come back to them, but not seeing them as their own.</span></div></div>",

Neither of them were jealous, and were both keen on making Naruto happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's go see Teme!\"  Naruto said, Sakura giggled at that, another change since the old her would hit him for that and call him a baka.  The three of them entered the room with Sasuke staring at nothing, glaring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasuke, we came to check up on you.\"  Sakura said  Sasuke didn't respond, images of Naruto being better than him, surpassing him flooded his mind, this is unacceptable, unfathomable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Sasuke, let's get you something to eat.\"  Sakura said handing him an apple, Sasuke glared at it, then slapped it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?!\"  Naruto said, Sasuke's glare stopped him from saying anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fight me dobe.\"  Sasuke demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you nuts, you're not cleared!\"  Naruto replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said FIGHT ME!\"  Sasuke demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasuke, stop this!\"  Sakura pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay out of this Sakura, this is between him and me.\"  Sasuke told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not going to fight you because you asked me to.\"  Naruto replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong dobe, scared I'll beat you, scared the girl you're with will realize how worthless you are?!\"  Sasuke taunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough Sasuke.\"  Hinata began but Naruto stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, you want a fight, you got one, meet me at the rooftop.\"  Naruto told him, Sasuke smirked as Sakura and Hinata were worried about what will happen.</span></div></div>",

Eventually Naruto managed to use his shadow clones to get one and attacked her with a Rasengan, but Guren was a bit faster and blocked the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good but not good enough.\"  Guren said, she got a hold of his chest in order to impale him but that was her undoing as the gem once more touched her hand and Guren felt the effect of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh crap.\"  Naruto cursed, this seems to always happen to him.  Guren after a while smiled warmly at him and put him down, she kissed him a bit and snuggled to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To think I was about to kill someone so handsome.\"  Guren warmly said sighing happily.

Still these interruptions were getting annoying, Orochimaru must be pretty butthurt about what happened with Tsunade, one thing was clear though he wanted him DEAD.  Naruto didn't know whether to be terrified or flattered that one of the three Sannin has it out for him, add the Akatsuki into the mix and he just made a lot of enemies from not doing much, probably more.  Naruto really needs to train and badly, but first he has a mission to complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop right there.\"  A woman's voice said, Naruto groaned as he now faced someone that looks vaguely familiar, Naruto's eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know you, you were at the Chunin exams.\"  Naruto exclaimed, the woman Kin nodded, gone was her headband from sound but it was her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am, I'm Kin.\"  Kin introduced, \"I was supposed to be dead, largely in part because of your teammate, once to 'test' him and the other for Orochimaru's Edo Tensei, if I hadn't knocked someone out, use a forced transformation Jutsu on them to have them look like me, and hid while he sacrificed that poor sap instead of me I would've been dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he betrayed you then?\"  Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What else does one do to a pawn when it's expendable?\"  Kin asked, \"I had nothing anymore, no village, nowhere to turn, my team was dead and it's all HIS fault.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean Sasuke.\"  Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Orochimaru's new favourite, the man stole everything from me.\"  Kin seethed, \"all I have left now is revenge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great story, what does this have to do with me?\"  Naruto asked seemingly bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to use you to help me kill him, as an act of spite from my former master.\"  Kin smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do you plan to do that exactly?\"  Naruto asked, still bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have ways of making you.\"  Kin chuckled taking out her bell and ringing it, Naruto groaned in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh!\" Naruto hissed, the ringing was really loud and painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will stop when you agree to help me, no tricks now, I can detect lies.\"  Kin said ringing her bell, Naruto groaned in pain as the ringing won't stop, these sound ninjas were no joke, he knew from her fight against Shikamaru she uses that bell to disorient her opponents, a light Genjutsu, she isn't strong by any means but she's effective at what she does.  Naruto trying to tune out the pain walked towards her to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, you can barely walk.\"  Kin shook her head, Naruto ignored her and stumbled across his way to her to get her to stop ringing but his momentum caused him to land on to her and her hand on his gem.  Hearing a moan meant one thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.....why me?\"  Naruto asked, Kin stopped ringing the bell and smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about that, let me make it better.\"  Kin said kissing him a bit, Naruto's head was still aching and he sat off of her to gather his bearings, Kin went to massage his head to try and make it better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here you go.\"  Kin warmly said, Naruto nodded as it helped.  After a while he recovered and slowly got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, if you need a place to stay go to Konoha, we'll take you in.\"  Naruto told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still want Sasuke dead.\"  Kin said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be the judge of that, if I find him too far gone, and I have no choice.\"  Naruto trailed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll leave it to you then, I'll be waiting for you.\"  Kin said to him, she kissed him once more before going to Konoha herself.  Naruto sighed at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone ELSE want to come out?!\"  Naruto asked, when nobody showed he nodded and continued his journey.</span></div></div>",

He finds he must live out the rest of her life in her place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory Ten: Kingdom Hearts Rewind: Xehanort's Redemption<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaster Xehanort, after being defeated by Sora, Donald, and Goofy, sees Eraqus, Terra, Ventus, and Aqua all having a tearful reunion, and finds he feels lonely. Due to absorbing a shade of his Xemnas self, who felt loneliness and guilt for what he had done, along with feelings of regrets from the other shades, he starts to regret the events and suffering he caused, especially when he looks at Sora, and sees him trying to hide his sadness for what happened to Kairi. Knowing Sora hadn't even been given the Keyblade Inheritance Ceremony, and everything seemed to be against him, Xehanort took action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing a method of time travel he previously found, but didn't use due to this particular one making it so that he can't be on the same world as another version of himself at the same time, he uses the connection he has with Xion, due to part of her merging with him, and jumps back in time through her, taking along two replicas. After arriving, Xehanort is in his own form, and finds Sora, who he performs the Ceremony for, and proceeds to train Sora, Kairi, and Riku in using Keyblades, magic, and getting Sora and Riku the darkness control immunity Riku eventually gained in the baseline, along with preparing them to fight his previous self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing exactly when Ansem Seeker of Darkness would arrive, Xehanort prepares, and uses the replicas to call forth Roxas and Namin\u00e9's hearts from the point where they had just recently been created, thus having no memories or mental traumas, and relinquished his hold on Xion's body, with it turning back to her form, but at the mental state she was in during the time she was on the Seekers of Darkness side in the Keyblade War, with no future memories or mental traumas.</span></div></div>",

To her surprise, the person she sees come out appears to be Vexen, previously killed in Castle Oblivion. He reveals that he is actually a replica, one of 44 the real Vexen prepared in secret at Castle Oblivion, just in case something went wrong, so that he could continue his research.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver time, the replicas started transferring themselves into other Vexen replicas in order to have more replicas to experiment on in order to try to improve them, with the Vexens who shared a body merging. Over time, the Vexens started realizing that they actually were feeling emotions, and not just pretending to well enough to fool themselves, causing some to devote time to research this. The Vexens came to the conclusion that Xemnas lied to control them for some reason, so they decided to prepare the replicas to help the good guys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time he got to Namin\u00e9, that Vexen was the only one left, and he had managed to create three perfect replicas, to be used to help Roxas, Namin\u00e9, and Xion. Hearing this surprised Namin\u00e9, as no one should be able to remember Xion, but Vexen reveals that since he himself never met her, and only knew of her through memories of the original Vexen, along with the knowledge of working on creating her not being lost, that he retained his memories about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two work together in secret, with Namin\u00e9 working on having two replicas set so that once Sora is combined with Roxas, Roxas and Xion are transferred into the replicas while Vexen prepares hers for after she returns to Kairi. Roxas awakens in rage after Sora gets to Yen Sid's tower and hears the sorcerer dismissing Nobodies and their emotions as fake, as he knows his own aren't fake. Roxas is transferred to the tower upon this, and has a confrontation with Yen Sid and Sora, where everything is laid out, and Sora is horrified about what happened, and the sacrifices made for him, especially after noticing Roxas tearing up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXion is restored, joining with Sora and Roxas, while Donald and Goofy have to part ways with them for the moment due to orders, while Namin\u00e9 goes to meet and combine with Kairi, who Vexen takes to the prepared for Namin\u00e9 replica, as the two begin adventuring using Keyblades as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the moment, the other choices shall remain blank until I get around to thinking of an adding more stories.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory 12: Mega Ditto<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the Lake of Rage events, Giovanni finds out about Ash, and looking into it, finds that Ash has been heavily involved in stopping several operations, including finding out the details about Mewtwo hidden in his database. He decides to do something about this hitch in his plans, and has his scientists try to cook up something. One scientist comes across the phenomenon from Kalos called Mega Evolution, and decides to look into that. He brings this up to Giovanni, and decides to use a Ditto for his experiments, due to Ditto's unusual and adaptational DNA, and implants a Keystone inside of it, hoping to keep it always in the Mega state if they succeed. In order to prevent the Mewtwo mindwipe from happening again, Giovanni has the scientists perform gene-splicing experiments to induce a Dark Typing into the Ditto, and try to use subliminal messages to make Ditto go after Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe experiment works, and a Mega Ditto is created, it is found unable to be recognized as a in the database due to the experiments, and Pok\u00e9 Balls have no effect. Unfortunately for them, the Mega Ditto isn't subservient to them, and hates them for the pain and torment they inflicted with the experiment. Also, due the experiments, the Mega Ditto, instead of targeting Ash as they intended, instead becomes obsessed with him romantically, to the point of becoming a Yandere. Mega Ditto shows it's traits as it absorbs several female members, then splits, and begins using them to destroy Team Rocket. After Team Rocket is destroyed, the Mega Ditto merges back all of its pieces, and goes off in search of Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mega Ditto can absorb a girl by surrounding and consuming her, and can also do this to inanimate objects. Pok\u00e9 Balls themselves can't be absorbed, but going through the process turns the Pok\u00e9mon into being loyal to the Mega Ditto. Mega Ditto is able to access the memories of any girl it has absorbed, and can reform into anything it has absorbed, but it can only work with the amount of mass it has at it's disposal, and the amount of any kind of substance. For example, if it absorbed Dawn and Cynthia, it could split and turn into both, or have both become Dawn, but unless it had more mass and human skin absorbed to make up for the difference in size, it couldn't have both become Cynthia. The Mega Ditto has a hive mind, and seeks to have Ash be its and its alone, and if it thinks Ash might want a girl, or thinks a girl's trying to get with Ash, it'll absorb her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory 13: Zorua replaces Dawn<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakes place at the end of the movie where Ash and friends help Zorua and Zoroark against Kodai, but things take a negative turn in the aftermath, as Zoroark dies of its wounds before Celebi can heal her, and Dawn ends up accidentally caught in the time ripple when Celebi leaves, with no one seeing except Zorua. Everyone looks for Dawn in the aftermath, but can't find her, with Zorua not telling what happened. Zorua decides to perfect its bizarre solid transformation, making it so it can hide its non-human traits, and the same powers Zoroark used for imitating the Legendary Beasts to make it look like it's talking in her voice until it can naturally learn to talk and imitating her scent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi returns to inform them of what happened, arriving in front of Zorua, who is the only one around, but Zorua convinces it to instead to lock itself in Dawn's form with its time based powers, but still able to age (characters age in this story, and Ash was about to turn 15 soon, and Dawn was 14, as are all of his long term female traveling companions seen so far in the anime, for us, not in universe, except for Misty, who is 16, and, of course, Bonnie). They do this so that nobody worries about Dawn, as she's lost in time, unlikely to every get back, as Celebi didn't see where or when she arrived, and Zorua just wanted to leave its life due to Zoroark's passing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCelebi helps Zorua pretend to be Dawn, but acting like she has amnesia, acting like it found her and brought her back, as the new time ripple is found, with \"Dawn\" and Celebi there in front of it, with Zorua pretending only to have the memories to know Ash and Brock's names and that what happened with the events of the movie. It decides that Ash would be the ideal mate for a human girl, so it tells the two it \"remembers\" being in love with Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory 14: Princess Dawn, Coordinator Salvia<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike in Dawn of a Royal Day, but Salvia sneaks away instead of having Freesia meet the group, and finds Dawn, before she found out about the contest and said there was no point in joining, with her being separated from the others due to having to use the restroom. She convinces Dawn to switch places with her, and Salvia enters as her, but making sure to wear one of Dawn's dresses for the contest, instead of Dawn's regular outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two work to imitate each other's voices, and tell each other what they can in order to pretend to be each other, including Dawn giving her a rundown on what she'll need to know in order to fool Ash, Brock, and all three of their Pok\u00e9mon, with none of the others, even the Pok\u00e9mon, except for Salvia's Togekiss knowing the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn uses some perfume normally in this story, so Pikachu isn't able to notice the difference in smell, due to never smelling her without it. Salvia pretends to be Dawn, telling Ash and Brock that the princess gave her Togekiss due to it wanting to compete in contests, since she intends to give it to Dawn anyway. Afterwards, they are unable to swap back due to Dawn not being able to get away, due to security being tighter since Salvia snuck out, and Ash and friends have to head out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat night, Salvia contacts Dawn using Dawn's Pok\u00e9tch. Salvia has a cellphone she normally has on her that Dawn now has, since she has her contact information, at a time she knew Dawn would be alone due to her schedule. They decide to stay as each other, and giving each other any more info they would need in order to avoid anyone (especially Dawn's acquaintances) finding out, sending pictures to each other of everyone that stood to them, and info about them. Salvia decides to pursue Ash romantically, and not separate when he leaves Sinnoh. The aging for the characters is the same as the Zorua replaces Dawn storyline.</span></div></div>",

Honestly, it was a little hard to tell how much time passed these days. Not that these days were really anything to write home about. The young Nobody was on her own today, and by that even more alone than usual. Both DiZ and Riku were off taking care of other business today, leaving her to handle her tasks all on her own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was just a short while ago that Roxas had been put into a digital recreation of Twilight Town, following his defection from Organization XIII, and defeating his friend, Xion. Sadly, memories of the latter were already gone from him and pretty much everyone else. Namine imagined she was the only one who did remember her now, by virtue of her connection with Sora's memories. That was perhaps the one trace of Xion left, contained within Sora. Though who knows, maybe the fact that Roxas didn't remember having to kill her himself was a blessing in disguise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEh, she didn't know what to figure at this point. All she could do was continue her task, to set everything up for Roxas to eventually go back to Sora as well. Fun times. She knew as well as anyone that it was necessary, but it didn't make her feel any better about it. So, there she was, looking out the window of the mansion like she did a lot of the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only something else could be done.\" She muttered to no one in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, as if hearing her....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps I can offer something.\" Spoke a male voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNamine jumped a little, seeing a corridor of darkness appearing right in her room. Through it stepped a man dressed in a black coat. The coat immediately gave him away as a member of Organization XIII.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are...\" Namine started, sinking back into her seat a little. The girl had no experience actually dealing face to face with someone who could mean her harm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Vexen,\" said the man, ranked Number IV in the Organization, pulling down his hood to reveal his face, his long blonde hair falling down his back. \"I have some information that you might just find interesting.\"</span></div></div>",

He was one of those in Castle Oblivion, the one with the creepy laugh that was always ranting on and on about his experiments. He was almost even creepier than the guy with the pink hair and the woman who orchestrated the whole incident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot to mention, wasn't this guy defeated at Castle Oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...don't want to hear anything from you...\" She spoke, trying to put on a brave face, though it was hard to hide her fear. Not like she had much of a way to defend herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm aware that you might not be inclined to listen, given what happened at Castle Oblivion,\" Vexen said, as if this didn't bug him. \"However, I assure you that you'll find this information most interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Namin\u00e9 wasn't buying it. Clutching her pad a little, she tried looking away from him. The Chilly Academic sighed, though he didn't seem surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose words won't do much, and I very well can't harm you,\" He said, before snapping his fingers. \"So perhaps these will suffice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, three bursts of light appeared at Vexen's feet, blinding Namin\u00e9 slightly. To say she was confused would be an understatement. Was he attacking her? Didn't sound like he wanted to, but what did she know. All she knew about these Organization members is that they valued her abilities. In any case, the light died down before too long, allowing Namin\u00e9 to look. Once she did though, she got out of her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Vexen's feet appeared to be three white dummy's. One probably wouldn't guess what it was upon seeing them for the first time, but Namin\u00e9 had an idea. These....were replica bodies. Things she had known of from Castle Oblivion. She had previously become acquainted with one based on Riku's image, and of course, there was Xion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I presume I don't need to explain these.\" Vexen said nonchalantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yes but.....why?\" Namin\u00e9 asked, utterly confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose I'll have to give you the full explanation.\" He sighed. \"I suppose I should start with why I'm here. To start if off, I'm not the same Vexen you knew, but rather, a replica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\".....What?\" she repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, or rather the original Vexen, eagerly wanted to explore the details of replica technology. So, to do that, and in case anything happened to him, he made 44 replicas of himself, of which I'm one of. Of course, as you're aware of, the original met his end at Castle Oblivion, so as you can see, it was quite an intelligent maneuver to accomplish this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNamin\u00e9 couldn't help but notice the bit of smugness in that quote.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case, following that, the other replicas and I continued working in secret. As time went on, we eventually started transferring ourselves into other replicas, giving us more to work with. Effectively, our experiences were merging together too, so it's not like anything was being lost. However, during the course of this, we began to realize something. I'm sure this isn't strange to you, but for us, it was startling when we realized we were beginning to feel emotions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrue, something like that wasn't strange to Namin\u00e9, given her nature. However, for someone like Vexen? That was very much new. She didn't speak a word and let him continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At first, you would think we were just fooling ourselves, as we had been doing since the beginning. Yet....these emotions were actually true. The first we had felt since becoming Nobodies. This was against what Xemnas had told us, and while we had suspicions that he had a plot of his own, the fact that he lied in such a matter made it all the clearer that something was up. And so, having faced that realization, the other replicas and I changed course, trying to perfect our replicas for another matter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXemnas...the leader of the Organization. Namin\u00e9 didn't know what the man looked like, though clearly there were those who didn't agree with him. Those two leaders at Castle Oblivion were indication of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what are you saying?\" Namin\u00e9 said a little sternly. Honestly, she liked that it seemed like someone had a change of heart so to speak, but she wasn't entirely on board with him yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To sum things up to where we are now, we were able to perfect three replica bodies, far more advanced than any we had accomplished before,\" Vexen then took a breath. \"Although, it basically required we use up most of the bodies we had. I am now the only replica of Vexen left, after all the merges we did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas there....actually a twinge of regret in there? Namin\u00e9 was pretty good at deciphering people's feelings in such a regard, which made her soften a bit. As bizarre as this was, perhaps he was truly meaningful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay....so what are you suggesting I do with these?\" Namin\u00e9 asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple. These are for you, Roxas, and Xion.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Namin\u00e9 was so floored by what she just heard that she almost fell backwards into her seat. Her surprise was two-fold, one being the idea of these replicas being for her, Roxas, and Xion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other: how in the worlds did he remember Xion at all?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you....?\" Namin\u00e9 started. However, Vexen seemed to have caught on to her latter thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I remember Xion?\" Vexen stated simply as opposed to asking. \"I suppose you could consider it an incredible loophole. I only know Xion through the memories of the original Vexen. Furthermore, the knowledge of creating her wasn't lost, allowing me to retain memories of her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fact that he spoke so simply about it made it seem like not a bid deal, when it was anything but. For someone other than Namin\u00e9 to retain memory of Xion in such a fashion was uncanny, and Namin\u00e9 wasn't too sure how to feel about it. In a way, it was nice that the girl at least had someone to remember her....though this was not really the guy in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, Namin\u00e9 still wasn't sure how much of Vexen's story she could buy, but then again, there wasn't much incentive to lie to her at this point. History already showed that it didn't take much to force her into something. He could have easily just taken her if he wanted to, instead of just explaining everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, say I believe you about all this...\" She said as she took a breath. \"What do you expect me to to do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the time being, the same thing as you've been doing: repairing Sora.\" Vexen stated. He couldn't help the smarmy grin on his face as Namin\u00e9 looked a little alarmed. \"That shouldn't surprise you. I knew you were here didn't I? Figuring out where you were and what you were up to was a simple task once I started my plans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNamin\u00e9's head was beginning to spin. Just how much did this guy figure out? It was almost terrifying in a way, since if he did know as much as it seemed, and didn't have somewhat noble intentions, he could have leaked her to the rest of the Organization.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, and what else?\" She asked, knowing there was more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To put it simply, as you're working on Sora, connect Roxas and Xion to these replicas. That shouldn't be a problem for you as Xion has already returned to Sora and his connection with Roxas should allow you to connect them as well. I am aware that you have Roxas in your possession as well at the moment.\" Vexen explained. \"In any case, by doing that, their memories should end up getting siphoned from Sora into the replicas, without any harm to Sora himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how would they actually return?\" asked Namine, perplexed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That I'm a little less clear on, but I hypothesize that a strong emotional connection should be able to release them. What you're doing would essentially be leaving a door open for them to leave Sora and into the replicas.\" said Vexen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNamin\u00e9 thought on it for a second. It made sense, and doing that was well within her power. However....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what would bring Xion back? Her case isn't the same as Roxas's.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but Roxas likely retains at least some level of memories of her, even if he is unaware.\" said Vexen. \"Sora really doesn't have to do a thing. Roxas would likely bring Xion along with him. Don't you believe so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, it was quite plausible. Since Namin\u00e9 had full access to Xion's memories that were now inside Sora, she could see everything Xion valued from beginning to end. There was no doubt that her bond with Roxas was strong, and with that red-head Axel as well. Course, Namin\u00e9 did wonder if them remembering their ultimate farewell would have lasting effects on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe you would be right,\" Namin\u00e9 said finally. \"And if I'm doing that, what will you be doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll prepare your replica.\" said Vexen, and just hearing the idea of being in a replica made Namin\u00e9 flinch a little. \"Once the replicas are done and Roxas is ready to return, we'll have you go to Kairi on Destiny Islands to reunite with her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure that will go so well.\" Namin\u00e9 said with a sigh. \"Riku sometimes told me of how his own memories of Sora got worse as the year went on. Chances are it's probably just as bad for Kairi. She might not remember Sora at all for all I know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would presume that won't be much of a problem once Sora is returned to normal.\" Vexen countered. \"Even I can't say how long it would take for those closest to him will remember everything, but I doubt it would be long. Chances are, you shouldn't have any problems returning to Kairi. Once that's done, preparations can be made to bring you back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all sounded so convoluted. So much stuff going on to try and bring the three of them back. Course, it wasn't like Namin\u00e9 didn't like the idea. The thought of actually being able to help more delighted her honestly. A way to make up for what happened in the past year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, there really wasn't much of a decision to make here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright fine.\" She said, a little more resolute now. \"Let's get started then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Marvelous.\" Vexen said with a grin.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From that point onwards, things continued....relatively normally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere actually wasn't too much interaction between the two, as it wasn't too necessary to complete their work. Despite some hesitance, Namin\u00e9 didn't need assistance hooking Sora up with the two replicas. Much to her joy, there weren't any notable negative effects to her doing so, giving her hope that this could actually be pulled off. Somehow, she was able to work on that as well as repairing Sora's memories at the same time, all while under Diz and Riku's nose. Thankfully neither of the two delved too deep into her personal matters as long as she was working. Not like DiZ really cared about her well being or anything the way she saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't quite sure where Vexen went off to with the replica for her. In fact, the situation with Kairi almost worried her even more. As the days went on, while she was confident Roxas' situation would be resolved with as little pain as possible, Kairi was another matter. Namin\u00e9 couldn't help but wonder how she was. Did she even remember Sora at this point? She had hoped her continuing repairs to Sora's memories would alleviate that, but she couldn't say for sure. Guess it was something she wouldn't know until she met Kairi herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, she had the replicas fully set up by the 7th day Roxas had been in the digital Twilight Town, and had them carefully hidden away so they wouldn't be harmed. Vexen had briefly told her the other day that soon enough he'd come back to take Namin\u00e9 to Kairi though he didn't say when. Now it was basically just a waiting game for Roxas to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least these days hadn't been boring. She had been going into the simulation herself, having conversations with Roxas and slowly revealing more of the truth, at least as much as she was able before interruptions. Still, she was determined for him to see why rejoining with Sora was a good thing. Heck, she had already believed that before an opportunity was presented for Sora to be whole again yet have everyone else be able to live their own lives.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was kind of funny in a way. Thinking on it, Namin\u00e9 wasn't too sure what she'd do with a life of her own. After all, she lived with the thought that she was just Kairi and that her life and Kairi's were meant to be one and the same. And yet, the two could possibly live as separate people now. Namin\u00e9 could be whatever she wanted.....whatever that was. Guess that was something she'd have to figure out later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, she knew Roxas was on approach to the mansion right now. The time was coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this really going to work?\" She wondered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had hoped to be there to meet Roxas at the mansion in the digital world, but instead there was a data version of her, probably there by DiZ to make sure Roxas kept going. Well, she at least hoped she could have a say in it. She'd make sure she'd tell Roxas whatever he needed to know, even if DiZ couldn't care less what he learned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, as Roxas approached the digital mansion, everything was set to begin.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Needless to say, Roxas hadn't been having the most conventional week. First, he was just enjoying summer with his friends: Hayner, Pence, and Olette. Things were nice, doing silly things like Struggle, and discovering the 7 Wonders and all that stuff. Things you would be doing with your buddies on vacation. And yet, things had been turned upside down rather quickly. Now, he wasn't sure. Ever since the big sword shaped like a key appeared to him, so many weird things had been happening, and in the latest string of weird occurances, he had been beckoned to come to the mansion by some weird guy, after getting attacked....again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's what lead him to here, using said key to unlock the door to the mansion while those weird white squiggly things were coming after him. Actually, he had wondered why they didn't immediately follow him as he went through the gate, but whatever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow....it's even bigger on the inside.\" Roxas murmured to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed, the mansion was pretty expansive, and very rundown too. Splinters of wood were everywhere, stuff thrown there and everywhere, etc. It was a real mess so to speak. In any case, Roxas knew he was here for a reason, so now he just needed to go find it. Hopefully that place where he met Namin\u00e9 should be around here somewhere. Then he could finally get his answers, particularly into this \"Nobody\" and \"Sora\" business that had been plaguing him for days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, it wasn't easier. Coming into the mansion, more of those weird things kept coming, along with a different kind that looked similar yet was larger and featured numerous blades on it. Thankfully, he was good enough with the key to get through them relatively unharmed, nothing he couldn't get through anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice welcoming party.\" He said sarcastically, tearing through yet another batch of the weirdos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, upon looking through many doors on the upper floor, a burst of light caught his eye. Ah, there it was. The room where Namin\u00e9 was. Finally, he could make some headway, and get some answers. The room was as clean as it was before though, and eerily quiet. Looking inside, Roxas couldn't see Namin\u00e9 anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Namin\u00e9?\" he called out, getting no answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to look through the room, seeing what he could find around. What happened afterwards would only be described as a whirlwind of emotions, plus a little headache. A particular picture that Namine clearly drew caught Roxas's interest, and subsequently had his head hurting at the sight of it. Roxas had had no shortage of headaches over the course of the week, but this one was particularly noteworthy. Now he knew who that Axel guy was, and where exactly he and Roxas came from. Many of the pieces were coming together....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh....\" Roxas groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then though, he felt a presence behind him, sitting in a seat at the other side of the room. Didn't take a genius to figure out who, and said person probably already knew what he had just seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Organization XIII....they're a bad group.\" Roxas said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bad, or good, I don't know. They're a group of incomplete people who wish to be whole.\" Namin\u00e9 said. \"To that end, they're desperately searching for something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Roxas inquired, finding all of this pretty believable now all things considered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kingdom Hearts.\" Namin\u00e9 replied, and was subsequently put off by a little chuckle from Roxas. \"Funny?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just, I think....I've been running away from the question I really want to ask: What's gonna happen to me now?\" Roxas asked, gripping the edge of the table, a sliver of sorrow in his voice. \"Just tell me that. Nothing else really matters anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNamin\u00e9 seemed to not give any sort of emotional response to that, simply saying \"You are.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then, her figure flickered, catching Roxas off-guard as her body seemed to disintegrate into data, a phenomenon he felt was all too familiar these days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Namin\u00e9!\" He cried out, before her body completely vanished. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, was she fake? It was hard for him to say. Nothing seemed to make sense anymore. However, he had little time to actually process the information, as that same data phenomenon happened again, with a man in black and red appearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no knowledge that has the power to change your fate.\" His deep voice boomed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot particularly liking the strange man's tone, Roxas replied with a stern look. \"Even if it doesn't, I wanna know. I have the right to know!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Nobody doesn't have the right to know. Nor does it even have the right to be.\" The man said back without missing a beat, almost as if dismissing Roxas's words entirely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what IS a Nobody?!\" Roxas yelled back, frustrated. Nobody this, Nobody that! What in the world did that even mean? For all everyone talked about, they sure weren't being helpful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, right out of the darkness, a large cloaked man appeared, startling Roxas a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DiZ, we're out of time. Too many Nobodies!\" Came the deep voice of the man to the one called DiZ.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, once again, another portal of darkness appeared. Just when Roxas was wondering who else could be joining this, there stood Namin\u00e9. The real one, hopefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roxas. Nobodies like us are only half a person!\" Namin\u00e9 said, finally hoping to get off her chest what she wanted to say. \"You won't disappear. You'll be whole! And....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh did she want to say more. How she wanted to tell Roxas how they would all be able to hopefully be their own person again. How he would be reunited with Xion, the girl he was forced to eliminate himself. She wanted to disclose everything to him. However, she caught herself. Spilling them in DiZ's presence would bring more trouble, and possibly even disrupt their plans. Namin\u00e9 worried that they'd find where she hid the replicas for Roxas and Xion if she said more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll.....disappear....?\" Roxas questioned, not liking the sound of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No further outbursts!\" DiZ announced, beginning to walk towards Namin\u00e9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight at that moment however, much to the chagrin of most in the room, yet another corridor of darkness appeared next to the one Namin\u00e9 came out of. However, everyone looked surprised at this. DiZ questioned who this could be, while the dark-robed man seemed to flinch oh so slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh what now?!\" Roxas yelled out. Seriously, he was kind of getting tired of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Show a little gratitude.\" A smarmy voice came as Vexen emerged from his corridor, grabbing Namin\u00e9 immediately. \"Apologies for the tardiness. Needed to sort out a few more things before I arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vexen!\" DiZ exclaimed, now visibly disturbed. \"How are you here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those answers are for another day.\" Vexen replied. \"Suffice to say, I'm filling the role of the good scientist for a day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ansem!\" DiZ wasted no time in dealing with Vexen's words. \"Eliminate him! Namin\u00e9 too if that's what it takes!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dark-robed man, apparently named Ansem, brandished an odd dark-looking sword, Soul Eater, in his hand, lunging towards Vexen instantly. Unperturbed, Vexen materialized his Frozen Pride shield, blocking the sword attack, emitting a little shockwave form the impact. Vexen's other arm was wrapped around Namin\u00e9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO, you won't disappear!\" Namin\u00e9 cried out against Vexen's grasp as he continued to black Ansem's sword strikes. \"Roxas, we'll meet again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat more could she say? What could she say to him now that would help assure him? Not much she could think of in the heat of the moment came to mind. Still, going with what just \"felt\" right, she smiled gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just....know everything will be alright!\" She said. \"Just know that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, time's up!\" Vexen said, starting to buckle under Ansem's strength. \"Moving on to the next phase.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, he vanished into the dark corridor he emerged from, leaving DiZ and Ansem a little bewildered. Roxas was more concerned with Namine though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Namin\u00e9!\" He cried out, her form already long gone from here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did they know she was here? Blast it!\" DiZ growled a little. \"Ansem, we may need to take certain measures.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas couldn't tell what was being said between the two men, but eventually DiZ left through the dark corridor Namin\u00e9 originally came from, while Ansem wisped out instantly, leaving the room as empty and silent as before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What....What is going on?\" Roxas mumbled, his mind going in all sorts of directions now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe came to get answers, and he had some now. However, it was like a whole new page of questions opened as well.</span></div></div>",

There would have been no use for Namin\u00e9 once that was completed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say Ansem was angry would be an understatement, although he hid it well, the only indication being a slight tightening of his fist. The two had gone to another part of the mansion following the incident in Namine's room. Ansem immediately asked what would be next. Despite some initial grimacing, DiZ continued on with the casual indifference he usually conducted himself with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vexen somehow reappearing was unexpected however. I presume you will want do discover where he's gone with her.\" DiZ said. \"For me, all that matters is Sora's return. Roxas appears to be heading his way right now. That's what you wanted, correct? You only intended to work with me until Sora was re-completed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes....\" Ansem said in a low voice. \"But still....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is beyond my reach. All I will do now is continue what I would have done regardless,\" Diz spoke again, turning his back towards Ansem. \"I believe you should dispose of Namin\u00e9 whenever you find her, but do as you wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnsem couldn't tell for certain just what DiZ was thinking. It sounded like he really wanted Namin\u00e9 gone, yet this unexpected turn didn't disturb him too much. Either way, it made him angry just thinking about it. Who was he to think he had the right to choose someone's fate like that? Namin\u00e9 was a person, regardless if she was a Nobody. Even if she had done some misguided things over the past year, that was no reason to toss her aside like garbage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, as DiZ whisked away from their location, Ansem thought about his next move. At the very least, he needed to find Namin\u00e9 to make sure she was safe. Vexen was hardly a man to be trusted, and how in the worlds was he alive to begin with? He needed answers, and reassurance that Namin\u00e9 was in good hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he whisked away himself into a corridor of darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>Destiny Islands</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA corridor of darkness appeared along the beaches of Destiny Islands, with Namin\u00e9 and Vexen stepping out of it and into the bright skies above. Namin\u00e9 needed a little time to catch her breath, though, from her sudden \"kidnapping\" from the mansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know... you said you'd be back...\" Namin\u00e9 sighed as she caught her breath. \"... but that was really close.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't exactly been sitting around all day you know.\" Vexen stated plainly. \"Getting everything set up in Hollow Bastion took time. I'd be lying if I said there weren't perhaps a complication or two. It's been years since the last time I set foot in that place.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNamin\u00e9 could sense something from Vexen's tone there. Did that have something to do when he was still complete, or in his case, when his original was? She decided not to press about it. Honestly, she was quite enamored with what she was seeing here. Being part of Kairi, originally and seeing Sora's memories, she knew all about Destiny Islands. However, nothing could compare to actually experiencing it with her own senses. Kind of made her wonder if it would feel like this when she had her own body. Guess only time would tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's so beautiful here.\" She smiled, looking at the waves crashing upon the shore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, it's nature. What of it.\" Vexen dismissed off-handedly. \"I also took notice of Kairi's condition from time to time, but I would imagine you already know that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" Namin\u00e9 nodded, smiling a little. \"And Roxas actually came into contact with Kairi a little while ago. Sora's heart even got to speak to her and she was able to remember him, at least better than before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. That should save a little time on explaining.\" Vexen nodded. \"Best we get this over with quickly. With that little scene back there, I'd rather not linger around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riku......\" Namin\u00e9 muttered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wondered what he could be doing now. He followed DiZ's command to attack, but that was likely also fueled by the desire to protect her from Vexen. Now, she hoped with Sora coming back soon, that would ease Riku's torment if only a little. Well, first things first, she now had to prepare herself for a step of her own to take....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>Somewhere in the darkness</i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime seemed to have lost all meaning for Xion of late. How long had it been? Hours? Days? Weeks? Hard to tell in the darkness. Xion's mind often wandered back and forth between murky and a little bit of clarity. Kind of like being underwater all the time. One moment she remembered things, and then the next it slipped her mind. At the least, she could remember why she was here, and she didn't have a problem with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roxas\u2026\" Her mouth moved to make the word, though practically inaudible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere was he now? Twilight Town? Was he okay? Was Axel okay too? Questions came and went in her mind. There were moments when it felt like she could get a clear glimpse of the one she was connected to, but then it was like going right back underwater. Still, there was....a feeling, that he was getting closer somehow.....somehow....it was a warm sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a split second, she could see him. Him being at the mansion where Sora slept....yet the clarity passed as she was taken under once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>The Mansion</i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, Roxas wasn't happy....at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure, he finally found a way into the mansion's basement, which he had walked down almost immediately. He was standing in front of a computer, likely used for that whole simulation or whatever it was. With everything that just came to mind for him, his mood was sour. Not just how Namin\u00e9 was treated right in front of him, and he was concerned for her whereabouts now, but for the other things that were coming to mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riku....\" He grumbled to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, now he remembered. Riku was the big-hooded man, because he transformed as they fought in The World That Never Was. He wondered why he was following the orders of that mysterious man, though frankly the reasons mattered little to him at the moment. Roxas was typically rather cool-headed, but he was feeling something completely different: anger. Anger for what he had been going through this past week, getting told he didn't have a right to know who he was. It was frustrating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrrr....AHHHHH!\" Roxas cried out, throwing his hands in the air before drawing his keyblade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYeah, the keyblade. That's what it was called. A power everyone said belonged to his other half. Sora this. Sora that. That's all it seemed to be. A means to an end. As much as Roxas had this sense that he was doing what he needed to do, it was still frustrating. And it was with that frustration that he unleashed his keyblade upon the computer, smashing it with every fiber of his being. Just looking at it reminded him of that red man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...hate... this!\" He said, finally allowing himself to breathe, after leaving the computer a wreck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOver to the side, he could hear a door opening. Catching his breath, he took that as a sign to keep going. A firm look upon his face, he kept on walking, eager to see just where this would lead.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Awaiting in the next room for Roxas were just more Nobodies, which he had to admit were kind of getting repetitive at this point, almost like someone was messing with him. Still, as he cut down every one that came at him, he had an idea of who was probably behind it. After all, a certain Organization member appeared often in this simulated Twilight Town, and now Roxas knew who exactly was doing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he didn't have to wait long for a confirmation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simply amazing, Roxas.\" Another black-robed man, sporting wild red hair and a cocky demeanor, walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Axel.\" Roxas spoke simply, no longer in doubt as who he was talking to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really do remember me this time?\" Axel spoke in a tone that seemed to be between satisfaction and mockery. Both however disappeared as flames began to erupt around him. \"I'm SO FLATTERED!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flames burst all around Axel, surrounding Roxas as well in a circle of flame within the room. Roxas could tell this meant no escaping from this battle. Roxas admittedly didn't know how far Axel's powers went, as he rarely needed to show off big attacks during their many missions hunting Heartless. Axel was truely taking this fight seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But you're too late!!!\" Axel cried out once more, the flames burning even more intensely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis battle instincts taking over, Roxas took this opportunity to finally unveil another thing that had come back along with memory. After all, there was a reason he got as far as he did before he got captured: an ability he awoke too somehow not too long ago. Honestly, he wasn't even sure why he had such a power, but who was he to complain. Just using that same little Keyblade he had been using up until now was small-time compared to what he had now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBright lights appeared in both hands this time, his Synch Blade power activating. To the left awoke a white angelic blade that glowed many colors and radiated promise: Oathkeeper. To the right, a demonic blade which seemed emanate dark feelings and pain: Oblivion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Two?!\" Axel asked incredulously, before reaching out and summoning out of flame his own chakrams: Eternal Flames.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGripping his blades tightly, Roxas faced down Axel. He had a feeling now as to why Axel was after him, but that being the case he knew he couldn't allow it to happen. Chances were Axel knew that as well. He wondered if Axel would hold back at all. It was kind of hard to tell how the Flurry of Dancing Flames (so he was called on occasion) would react at any given moment. Although, it didn't take long for an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come here, I'll make it all stop!\" Axel said with a snear, his chakrams beginning to light up even more. \"Burn, baby!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel opened up the fight sending flames across the ground at Roxas, which weren't too hard for him to dodge. Of course, both combatants were pretty quick on their feet, and it wasn't too long before all four weapons were clashing, each trying to push the other back. All of Roxas's attention was focused on defeating Axel, as it was evident with the first strike that Axel was hitting him hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not getting cold feet are ya?\" Axel smirked, bringing his left chakram around. \"I'd suggest you fight on as if your life depended on it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't need you to tell me that!\" Roxas crossed both blades to block the attack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe force of the blow pushed him back into the wall of flames, which he bounced right off of. Thank goodness for magical ability to walk on flames. Roxas pushed back into Axel, striking him with some blows before Axel was able to jump back. As Roxas charged him though, Axel jumped even further back, going into the flames. Roxas gasped a little as Axel disappeared into them, completely hiding his presence. He hadn't seen this before. So Axel really was hiding tricks up his sleeves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAH!\" A cry from behind startled Roxas he just narrowly avoided taking major damage from behind, still he still ended up a little singed from Axel's attack. \"You're terrible at defending your backside, ya know? Did I ever tell you that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know... why don't you jog my memory?\" Roxas spat back rhetorically as he swung Oblivion around Axel's feet, getting in a good blow. \"I seem to recall you always letting Heartless sweep you off your feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel smirked again as he re-balanced, resulting into another clash of melee blows with Roxas. \"So you think you got me all memorized huh? Points for actually paying attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe impact forced them both back, as Axel covered the floor in fire once again. Roxas groaned a little as he did, knowing that would only harm him if he stayed in one place too long. Guess Axel wanted to keep the fight moving at a wild pace. Fine with him if that was what it took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, something gnawed at Roxas the more he fought. Particularly his thoughts towards his Keyblades. Oathkeeper and Oblivion, pretty distinctive even as far as Keyblades went. Roxas remembered using a variety of them during his time in the Organization, but these stood out in particular. A part of him told him that they must have something to do with Sora, if what everyone kept telling him had any significance. However, it was like there was more to it, particularly with Oblivion. Honestly, something about it made him tremble slightly. He recognized it as not a Keyblade he had used beforehand, compared to Oathkeeper anyway. Additionally, this was the Keyblade he threw to Riku back then.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy was that? Why did he do such a thing? Why did this particular blade give him pause? For some reason, just thinking on it caused him some level of discomfort.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did I say, about LETTING YOUR GUARD DOWN?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAxel's booming voice brought Roxas out of his brief stupor, and for good reason. Axel was spinning his chakrams alight with flames, and merging them into a single large chakram that caked the room in light. Now this was something Roxas was familiar with. Explosion was Axel's own limit break, and this was his big finisher. Roxas noticed just in time to see the giant weapon coming towards him, holding Oblivion up to guard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe resounding clash bombarded the room with light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>Somewhere in the darkness</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, Xion felt like something just lit up in her head. Granted, she had had this odd sensation for a while now (days maybe?) but this was new. What was going on? It sounded like... fighting... and a really intense one at that....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's.....going on....?\" She tried to say to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFire....so much of it....and two familiar figures... one wielding two Keyblades while the other was alight with flames. For the briefest of moments, Xion had full sight of those two, weapons clashing furiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roxas... Axel....why are you fighting?\" She wondered aloud. \"No... PLEASE STOP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis... was just like before. Axel fighting to bring one of them back. Why did this have to keep on happening? Seeing the one she was connected to fighting her other best friend was too much to watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... you don't have to do this... Roxas... Axel... Please...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she could reach her hand out, she would have. Yet, the familiar sensation of being pulled back under came back, making her awareness murky again. If only she could... just a second longer...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>The Mansion</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>PLEASE STOP!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas heard those words pass through his head faster than he had the chance to process it. He was nearly out of breath after Axel's strike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was...\" He tried to ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, it wasn't long before he felt sucker-punched, Axel dealing a direct blow to his gut, sending him sprawling to the ground. Thankfully he kept his Keyblades in hand. As Roxas got back up, he could have sworn he saw a twitch in Axel's face for some reason, like something was up. Still, if there was, Axel wouldn't say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You going to make it that easy for me?\" He asked. \"Orders are to either bring you back or eliminate you. Frankly I'd rather not go with the latter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking his head, Roxas got back up. For some reason, that sensation he just felt wouldn't go away. All he knew was that it made him feel uncomfortable. This had to end fast. Axel had to be more tired than he was letting on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, then I'll end it,\" Roxas said cooly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis head clear, Roxas once again engaged Axel, being able to keep up easier than he did before. Perhaps he was finally getting more used to this style of fighting, but whatever the case, it worked for him. Axel's movements were slowing down. Seeing his opportunity, Roxas began tapping into his own light powers, finally having a chance to use those. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HAH!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas finally parried Axel's attacks away, getting a clear shot to surround Axel with pillars of light. Before Axel knew it, he was bombarded with each pillar, sending him sprawling to the ground, struggling to get back up. Roxas took a breath and readied himself just in case, but the fires around the room began to cool down, signaling an end to the fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas watched as Axel slowly brought himself back up, chakrams still in hand but clearly in no shape to continue. Roxas watched him cooly, recalling the last moments he had with Axel before leaving for good. Even then, Axel cared about his well-being. That had to be why as serious as Axel took this, Roxas knew he would win.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Axel...\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" Axel sighed, still catching his breath. \"Let's meet again, in the next life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'll be waiting.\" Roxas replied just as cooly. At that, Axel started chuckling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Silly... Just because you have a next life...\" Axel said as darkness began to surround him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, Axel had vanished, leaving Roxas alone in the mansion once again.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A corridor opened up atop Twilight Town's Clock Tower. Staggering pretty much the whole way, Axel ended up falling against the wall to his back, sliding down as he tried to catch his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dang... that was quite the match.\" He chuckled, despite the pain. \"Who'd have thought he could put up that much of a fight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, Roxas always did seem to be special. He'd already done many things no one else in the Organization could have done. He should've figured a serious fight with Roxas would end up taking all his energy one way or another. Kind of made him proud of the little guy he had watched over since his arrival a year ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, there was another thing on Axel's mind. During that fight, something odd happened. As much as Axel got on Roxas's case for letting his guard down, there was a point where he felt something odd too. When his limit break clashed against Roxas, he got these brief images, mostly of him and Roxas on the Clock Tower. That was nothing strange of course, as he thought about those days often. Yet, for a brief moment, he felt like he could see a third black coat sitting with them. A figure that was perhaps a little smaller than Roxas, maybe a girl. He couldn't tell for sure. The instant passed before he could process it, leaving him wondering just what it was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I truly do have all the icky jobs.\" He sighed, resigning himself to regaining his energy before moving forward. At least the scenery was nice as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>In the Mansion</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince Roxas exited the room he fought Axel in, he had been pondering similar thoughts. Now that he had time to think about it, it sounded like a girl's voice. Actually, come to think of it, it kind of sounded like Kairi, given he already knew what she sounded like from a while ago. Yet, something told him that wasn't the right answer. It was kind of confusing. All he could say for sure was that thinking about it gave him a nagging feeling that things just weren't right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm really starting to get tired of not knowing things.\" He sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter walking for a bit, he came across numerous pods. Two of them held Donald and Goofy, who he also remembered from Sora. Guess they were in a similar state at the moment. That aside, the corridor continued onwards, so Roxas continued on his way. After going through another door though, he was greeted with a lit-up room that reminded him of Namin\u00e9's room a little. Immediately, he saw a giant pod in the middle, but he also saw DiZ in front of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWonderful... just who Roxas wanted to see next. If the man noticed any such feelings from Roxas, he didn't show it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At last, the Keyblade's chosen one.\" DiZ spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you talking to? Me?\" Roxas spat, more than done with this man by now. \"Or Sora?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To half of Sora, of course.\" DiZ replied. \"You reside in darkness. What I need is someone who can move about the realm of light, and destroy Organization XIII.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Who are you?\" Roxas asked, not seeing much of a problem with the man's objective, though his methods could use some work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am a servant of the world.\" DiZ replied, giving a chuckle that almost sounded like amusement and despair mixed together. \"And, if I'm a servant, then you should consider yourself a tool. at best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, Roxas had just reached how much crud he could take from this guy. His hands twitched with the desire to shut this guy up by any means necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that... Was that supposed to be a joke?\" Roxas spat with barely concealed anger, Kingdom Key forming in his hand. \"Cause I'm not laughing!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving had it with him, Roxas charged forth, eager to give him a piece of his mind. However, much to his disappointment, what should have been a clean blow ended up going through DiZ, data whirling around the area Roxas struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My apologies. This is only a data-based projection.\" DiZ replied casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot particularly caring, Roxas continued to strike DiZ, getting the same result each time. Roxas cried in frustration, striking the projection over and over again. Eventually, what energy Roxas still had after fighting Axel began to wane, and the projection teleported away, before taunting him and appearing behind him. Was there anything else this guy could do to tick him off?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hate you so much...\" Roxas spat at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should share some of that hatred with Sora.\" DiZ replied, a slight smirk forming on his lips. \"He's far too nice for his own good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! My heart belongs to me! No one else!\" Roxas cried right back, before striking DiZ again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only got the same result as before, although the projection didn't return this time. Instead, the pod came to life, its inner contents finally being shown to the world. Roxas knew what was coming, Sora's name uttering from his mouth as he laid guys on his original for the very first time. For a second, Roxas internally chuckled. For all that talk about originals and Nobodies and such, they really didn't look alike at all. Plus, his clothes were amusingly small for his body. Well, didn't seem to matter now. The moment of truth was here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're lucky...\" He said solemnly, already beginning to feel what was coming next. \"Looks like my summer vacation is... over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>Destiny Islands</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you know who DiZ is?\" Namin\u00e9 asked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I knew him for a long time.\" Vexen replied with a chuckle. \"I only wish I had more time at the mansion to gloat in his face about how far he's fallen. I've got some words for him I want to share.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNamin\u00e9 actually giggled softly at that. Sounds like there was quite a history there. She'd love to hear it honestly. Compared to the months of having to deal with his indifference to her, Vexen actually proved to be entertaining, if not a little creepy, company. The sun was beginning to set, casting the Destiny Islands in an orange glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight then though, Namin\u00e9 felt something go off in her head, causing her to smile widely. She could tell, the deed was finally done. Sora was complete once more, with everything returned to where it needed to be. Roxas had gone back as they had hoped. Vexen immediately caught on to her change in demeanor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I presume he's finally done it?\" Vexen asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Sora's finally complete.\" Namin\u00e9 smiled. \"So...now Roxas and Xion will be able to come back without hurting him, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In theory, yes.\" Vexen said, seemingly pleased with the progress made so far. \"The Replica bodies are ready for the both of them. All that should be necessary now is a strong reaction to fully bring them back. Even I can't say what that would entail, but that should sort itself out in time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Namin\u00e9 said, hoping it would turn out as he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it seems to be not a moment too soon.\" Vexen said as he turned his head. \"Our own objective is here at last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNamin\u00e9 turned in Vexen's direction, and her smile came back at seeing her original approaching the beach. Kairi had changed out of her school uniform for the day, walking down in a pink outfit. You could tell her eyes were set on the ocean, obviously wondering as to just where her friends, especially Sora, were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Kairi approached the beach however, she took notice of the two other occupants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry. I didn't see...\" Kairi smiled an apology before getting a better look at the two people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing an older-looking guy in a black coat was pretty weird. That had to be really hot to wear in this climate. However, the bigger point was the girl. She looked... a lot like her! The hair was completely different, but the face could totally be her twin. As if sensing the bizarre predicament, Namin\u00e9 walked closer to her and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of funny seeing another person with your face, right?\" Namin\u00e9 said, her smile not wavering. \"Trust me, there's a reason for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... okay...\" Kairi nodded slowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't sure why, but she guessed it worth hearing what this blonde-haired girl wanted to say. Chances are it wasn't a coincidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>Twilight Town Station</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt Twilight Town's train station, a particularly odd train was coming in. It was decked out in blue and gold colors, with numerous stars on it. Even more curious was its lone occupant, a really small being dressed all in black. Wearing a coat similar to that of the Organization, Mickey took a deep breath, ready to continue his investigation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mickey.\" A deep voice spoke from the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe particular voice he just heard startled Mickey a little, even making him draw his Kingdom Key D. However, a quick look over to the black cloaked being, wielding a familiar sword, calmed Mickey down quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Phew, startled me for a second there, Riku.\" Mickey smiled as he dispelled his Keyblade. \"Seems like things haven't been easy for ya. Anything new?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Plenty of things actually.\" Ansem, or rather, Riku spoke, still fully hidden underneath the cloak. In his hand was a munny pouch, which he'd intended to give to Sora through Mickey. However, things were more complicated now. \"I hate to take up more of your time, but something urgent has come up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riku, no time with you is ever wasted time.\" Mickey said encouragingly. \"Still, this sounds pretty serious. What's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you see...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>The Mansion's Basement</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sora!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe voices came from two different sources: one being high while the other was pretty deep. Both voices were familiar to Sora, helping him to wake up finally and stretch his limbs out. Such actions caused laughing from his two companions, making him groan indignantly before jumping out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Donald! Goofy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt long last, the three of them were back, even if they weren't quite sure just how long they were out. Then again, it didn't really matter.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next few minutes between Sora, Donald, and Goofy were spent hashing things out and figuring what they were up to. Of course, they were joined by their trusty companion, Jiminy Cricket, as well. They had recounted their prior adventures, and what they were up to following defeating Ansem. Sadly, that's where the familiarity seemed to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only got more bizarre that Jiminy's journal didn't anything in it but the words \"Thank Namin\u00e9.\" That name sounded vaguely familiar to Sora, but that was as far as that went. Donald took the chance to mention how useless the journal was, to which Jiminy looked a little flustered. In turn, he suggested that they instead go and find out where they were, to no objections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora wasn't sure why, but it felt like he had been asleep for a while. At least, he had a feeling he had been. Taking a nap was one thing, but he was never this stiff before. The building they woke up in was pretty spacious, if not falling apart. The scenery outside was pretty nice, though all of it was giving Sora a weird case of deja vu. The feeling didn't fade as they approached the nearby town. He even mentioned to his pals that it seemed familiar, but upon pressing from Donald, he couldn't add any more to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, in any case, the town was quite lively. Sora liked it a lot. Kind of felt like home in a strange way. Along the way, though, he came across a spot where he met some kids: Hayner, Pence, and Olette. Again, there was a little familiarity with them, but in any case they were nice enough. One of them though, Pence, mentioned someone looking for them after they introduced themselves: someone wearing a black coat and sporting big round ears. Such a distinctive image gave them all an easy answer: King Mickey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>Twilight Town Station</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Mickey cried out, louder than he intended. \"Organization XIII got Namin\u00e9?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Vexen did in any case,\" Riku sighed with noticeable distress in his tone. \"I'm still not even sure how he's even around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought he'd been defeated too. Guess you can never tell with these guys.\" Mickey said. \"You think they have her in their possession now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what gets me.\" Riku said. \"If they found out that's where Namin\u00e9 was, why send Vexen? They'd have a much easier time with using one of the higher ups to grab her. Plus, his words seemed off to me now that I think about it. He talked like he was finally doing good or something like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm....you're right how it's weird that he's the one who happened to get her.\" Mickey nodded. \"Well, in any case, we should try to rescue her, or at the least try to discover Vexen's intentions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I wanted to ask about.\" Riku said, turning to Mickey. \"I think one of us should go try to find her. Honestly, I'd like to do it myself but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe truly did want to go look for her. Despite everything that happened, Namin\u00e9 was a good person, and he had to admit, she was kind of a source of relief over the course of the year. She could be melancholy, but he could tell she definitely had Kairi's spirit. It was part of how he kept himself motivated all this time, even when his own memories of Sora were affected. Helping her in her time of need after everything she helped him with was something he really wanted to do. Still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's keeping an eye on Sora too.\" Mickey guessed correctly, smiling as Riku didn't give an answer. \"That makes sense. I wouldn't mind going off to search for Namin\u00e9 myself. That is, if you're willing to help continue investigate the Organization in my place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course.\" Riku actually chuckled a little, which would have sounded nice with Riku's voice, but with Ansem's, it was just creepy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough, Mickey did ponder a little. \"Although, if the Organization is truly more powerful than we thought, I'm not sure if I could handle it on my own... Well, I'll figure it out as I look around Twilight Town.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Mickey.\" Riku said, before dropping a pouch into the King's hands. \"And of course, you can hand this to Sora. Don't tell him about me though. I don't want him, or Kairi for that matter, to see me like this...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMickey didn't like the sound of that, but he reluctantly agreed. The Riku he knew underneath that shell of darkness had his own problems to deal with, problems that he would come to terms with in time. He smiled in spite of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" Mickey said. \"And don't worry, I'll rescue Namine for you, I promise. She does mean a lot to you, after all. Actually, a lot, if I had to guess.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you insinuating something?\" Riku asked in a mixed tone of curiosity, amusement, and indignation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tend to notice things at my age.\" Mickey gave a high-pitched laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRiku decided not to dignify that with an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<u><i>Meanwhile</i></u><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter getting their information from Hayner, Pence, and Olette, as well as saying good bye, Sora and his friends were off and running again, trying to find where the King was now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gawrsh, maybe we should go up. Get a higher view.\" Goofy suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a good idea.\" Sora agreed. \"We could probably see the whole town from up there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then what are we waiting for?\" Donald quaked in his usual barely-readable dialect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio had been looking around for a while, getting a feel for the layout. Sora had noticed that this was perhaps the longest he had gone without really fighting anything, quite the difference from when he was on his first adventure. Heartless were all over the place then, so maybe things had improved. Anything to give him a little piece of mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, as they approached the top of the hill which revealed a clock tower and a train station, that all came to a grinding halt. Before long, strange white creatures featuring an unusual symbol appeared. Much like everything else so far, this came as odd to Sora, who was really beginning to wonder just why everything seemed familiar in a way. Well, in any case, these things seemed about as friendly as Heartless, so it was time to whip out the Kingdom Key once more. Thank goodness he didn't forget that at least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ensuing battle brought back a lot of memories: Sora doing much of the damage, Goofy providing support and defense, and Donald providing the magic and (occasional) healing. Though, despite that, the rust was showing, and it wasn't long before Sora and the others were feeling exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I feel... really out of shape...\" Sora sighed, falling back on his butt. Well, this didn't look too good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, coming in to save the day, a small black figure appeared, jumping back and forth rapidly and taking the white creatures down with ease. All three of them were left amazed at the skill of the little warrior, and once the dust had settled, a better look at the figure's Keyblade provided an easy answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Majesty!\" Donald and Goofy cried, pushing Sora down to get through to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMickey immediately shushed them. \"You gotta board the train and leave town! The train knows the way.\" He said this as he handed a pouch to Sora. \"We'll talk later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that little addition, the King was off before anyone could get another word in, though Donald and Goofy were relieved to know that he was okay after all. The last time they had seen him was right after Ansem's defeat and he had been locked in the realm of darkness. Such good news meant to Sora that Riku had to be around too, furthering Sora's resolve to find him so they could head back to the Islands. Kairi was there after all. After Sora got a quick laugh out of Donald and Goofy about inquiring what they wanted to do, they were off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed were the three of them being sent off by Hayner, Pence, and Olette. It just felt like something they wanted to do, though even they weren't sure. The oddities continued when they found out the pouch Mickey gave them looked the same as the one Olette had. Very strange indeed. In fact, after Sora got tickets for the train, he got this odd feeling, kind of like leaving home all over again. Course, in typical Donald and Goofy fashion, they figured he was over-thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...you're right,\" Sora smiled, though a part of him still wasn't too sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, it was time to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>Destiny Islands</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow....what a story,\" Kairi said in awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNamine just got done recounting most of what she could to Kairi as the two sat together on the beach. Vexen left them to look at some things on his own, and he really didn't need to be around for the \"girl talk\". Granted, Namine couldn't really explain every little detail to Kairi. They were a little pressed for time after all, so she made sure to nail the basics.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So basically....you're a part of me that came about when Sora set my heart free?\" Kairi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In a nutshell, yes,\" nodded Namine. \"That left both you and Sora incomplete. But now Sora is finally awake again. That's why you've been able to recall him now, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKairi admittedly had felt a lot better of late. Slowly, everything had been coming back to her. Knowing full well who the \"mystery boy\" was finally gave her a little relief. Of course, at the same time, there was some dread too. That just meant he was still out there somewhere, which meant he wasn't here with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, if I'm being honest, this isn't the strangest thing I've heard in my life,\" Kairi giggled a little, getting a similar reaction from Namine. \"But basically, Sora is alright now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, and Riku is too, kind of,\" Namine said, a little sad at the last part. \"So now, we should do the same thing. We need to re-complete you, and then Vexen can help you with bringing me back without hurting you.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Kairi exhaled a breath. The last week had been an absolute whirlwind for her mind. She had gone from very little recollection to a lot and then some in such a short time. Then again, after the first bout of craziness the trio had gone through a year ago, what was a little more craziness?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...I'm guessing by that, you mean you trust him,\" Kairi said, a mix between a statement and a question. \"Despite what he did?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like to believe it when someone says they want to atone,\" Namine smiled. \"And I'm sure you do too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's true,\" Kairi admitted. \"So....how exactly do we do this then?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you, not much,\" Namine said, getting up. \"I'll handle the hard stuff.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKairi didn't need much to comply with her request. Namine made for a pretty convincing story, and the uncanny resemblance took care of any other concerns she had. From her story, the tale of a Nobody sounded pretty harsh, so the idea that she could give back what Kairi needed and then be able to live on as her own self sounded nice. With that, Kairi stood up, all to eager to take a step forward towards getting her friends back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, let's do it,\" Kairi said resolutely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready too,\" Namine said, outstretching her hand towards Kairi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKairi reached out and took Namine's hand in her own, awaiting whatever Namine was going to do. Namine closed her eyes, and it wasn't long before her body was encased in light, surprising Kairi a little. As Namine's body began to fade into the light, that very light began flowing in Kairi, filling her up rather quickly. It was a strange yet warm sensation, and it ended nearly as soon as it began. Before long, Kairi's hand was empty, leaving her by herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow......\" Kairi said, looking down at herself. She didn't look any different, and didn't really feel different either. And yet, the feeling of \"something\" being there felt nice to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"About time,\" Vexen said as he walked over. \"I was beginning to wonder if you two were going to talk until tomorrow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well excuse me for just now discovering I had an other half,\" Kairi said, staring at Vexen. \"So, what now? We go to where you'll bring her back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Precisely,\" Vexen said, opening up a corridor of darkness. \"I've been getting everything ready for us to do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be okay going through that, right?\" Kairi asked curiously, pointing at the dark corridor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll be fine. You're a Princess of Heart,\" Vexen shrugged, as if pointing the obvious. \"An ordinary person would be in quite a bit of trouble if they did, but not you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great....\" Kairi trailed off, giving off one last look towards her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuess now she was taking her leave of the islands. Hopefully, by the time she saw it again, it would be with her friends in tow. And so, she entered the corridor, Vexen following right behind and closing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>Twilight Town Station</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Donald and Goofy were getting some last-minute supplies, Sora took the chance to ponder things a little. Really, everything about this town looked nice, yet there was something off that continued to gnaw at him. It hit him once again as Hayner struck up a conversation with him, wondering if they had met before. Sora was positive they didn't, to which Hayner agreed. Weirdest of all, Sora actually found himself shedding a tear at the prospect of saying good bye, which caught the Twilight Trio's attention. They asked if he was okay, to which Sora just gave his usual grin, telling himself to get it together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right....see ya!\" Sora smiled and waved, getting on to the train after Donald and Goofy already went on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the train left, sending them to who knows where. Even after it left though, Sora's thoughts trailed on what had just happened. He continued to look out the window, seeing all of Twilight Town below him. He looked into the munny pouch, pulling out a little blue orb inside. It was kind of pretty to look at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know.....I'm sad,\" Sora said, not to anyone in particular though Donald and Goofy heard it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll be back,\" Donald replied, as if there wasn't a doubt about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! We can see Hayner and those guys again,\" agreed Goofy with a little laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora looked towards his friends, smiling once again. Yeah, they were right. They'd come back some day. Nothing stopping them from doing that. Sora hoped that would assure whatever nerves were racking him at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd at that, a bright light burst around the train, blocking all outside view, before showing the vastness of the space between worlds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>Mysterious Tower</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the train rode into a new world, well kind of at this point, following it's set of tracks towards a small piece of land. Donald and Goofy got off first once it stopped, with Sora following last. He looked up, taking a good look at the tower in front of them. Guess this was where Mickey wanted them to go to. As he turned back though, the train disappeared into light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There goes our ride....\" Sora said with a nervous chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWelp, guess they were stuck here for the time being. Then again, Mickey must have wanted them to come here for a reason. In any case, there was no way to go but forward, though one look at the tower showed something odd. Some big guy hogging the door as if trying to find a way through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's goin' on?\" Donald said with exasperation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure laughed. \"I sent some of my lackeys inside to see if the master of this here tower's as big and tough as they say. Word is, he's a real powerful sorcerer. Which would make him the perfect bodyguard for me. See, it don't matter how tough he is, once he's a Heartless, he'll do as I say!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Heartless?\" Sora cried out, all three of them getting battle ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, whoever this guy is was pretty off his rocker. He continued to go on and on about Heartless, as if it was really that easy. Although, once he mentioned Maleficent, an evil witch they defeated a while ago, and talking about building an army for her across multiple worlds, the stakes went just that much higher. Of course, he just told them to scram afterwards, not even bothering to look back. Goofy replied by saying he should find something nicer to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says who?\" the being finally turned around to look at them. \"Wha....AHHH! It's you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pete!\" cried Donald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you two nimrod's doin here!?\" Pete asked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are YOU doing here?!\" Donald quaked right back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Sora inquired just who he was, Goofy explained that this was Pete, a real troublemaker who had been at it for ages. He was supposedly banished to another dimension years ago, yet somehow escaped. The explanation had Pete laughing, explaining that Maleficent got him out and that soon all the worlds would belong to him soon. The reason: Maleficent would help him. That pretty much got the trio all laughing at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently Pete was completely unaware of Maleficent's demise at the hands of Sora and friends, getting him really worked up while the others just laughed. Perhaps predictably, this ended up in another Heartless battle. Thankfully, battling these guys was much easier than dealing with the white enemies, so they were taken care of easily, much to Pete's chagrin. The big guy just pouted and threw a tantrum at the Heartless being unsuccessful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfterwards, Sora inquired as to just who this tower belonged to. Pete found it hilarious that he would be here not knowing that, but he explained it was old Yen Sid, granted he was pretty confident he was a Heartless by now. This took Donald by surprise, and he rushed to the door as fast as he could. Goofy explained to Sora that Yen Sid was Mickey's teacher, impressing Sora so he took off, eagerly wanting to see this teacher as well. All the white, this just left Pete all alone, stupefied at just being ignored again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora, Donald, and Goofy entered the tower, beginning to scale it at their earliest chance. Of course, the trail was littered with Heartless, causing the trio to take them out as they went. At the very least, they helped shake the rust off of Sora, who was still getting the kinks out of his muscles. Still, it was quite a climb, as the Tower seemed bigger on the inside than on the outside. The stairs went up endlessly, with Heartless all over the place. Donald got frustrated rather quickly after seeing them all, though Goofy was just glad they were on the case. It concerned Sora though, who had hoped the worlds would be more at peace now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, no other way than forward, and they got the sense that their destination was right on the other side of the nearest door. Time to go meet Master Yen Sid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            ],
            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Donald and Goofy went through the door first with Sora following right behind. Right as he entered, he looked all around the decently-sized room. Looked pretty spacious, with lots of trinkets hung all around. Certainly kind of gave the impression of some older resident. Of course, Sora was so taken in by the room that he didn't even initially notice Donald and Goofy bowing. On the other side of a desk sat an elderly man, sporting a long beard and wearing blue robes topped off with a pointy blue hat with star symbols.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master Yen Sid! It's an honor!\" quaked Donald. Sora just took one look between Donald and Yen Sid before smiling as usual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there!\" Sora waved casually, much to the chagrin of his teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sora! Show some respect!\" Donald quaked angrily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora laughed sheepishly at the chastising, though Yen Sid apparently took no offense, calming Sora's companions down. In fact, he was more interested in the fact that he was meeting Sora for the very first time. He asked if that had the chance to talk to King Mickey yet, a fact confirmed by Goofy though they had little time to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He need say we'd talk later though,\" Sora added to the conversation. \"It sounded pretty urgent.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see,\" Yen Sid nodded. \"Well, as we can't assume when of if he'll do so, the task of instructing you three rests on my shoulders then. The journey you face is perilous, so you must be prepared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean......we have to do on another quest?\" Sora questioned, not sounding too thrilled. \"I was looking forward to finding my friend Riku, so we could go back to the islands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I know. However, everything in your journey, Sora, is connected,\" Yen Sid explained. \"Whether you will return to your home in the islands.....Whether you will return alone or with your friend...And, whether or not the islands will still be there. And the key that connects them is you, Sora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm.....the key?\" Sora questioned, before summoning his Keyblade out of habit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Chosen wielder of the Keyblade!\" Yen Sid continued. \"You are the key that will open the door to light.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking it as a pledge of what he must do, Sora nodded. Guess it was time to be the hero once again. It wasn't what he planned, but if it was necessary, then he'd gladly take it up again. Yen Sid took notice of the resolve of all three present, before presenting a book to Sora regarding some knowledge he might need. He implored Sora to study it before they continued, which kind of reminded Sora of school back home. Not exactly the thing he wanted to remember of all things back on the islands. Come to think of it, how in the world would he handle school once he returned? Heck, how long had he even been gone at this point?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, that was all thinking for another time. Yen Sid waited patiently while Sora looked over the book, while Donald and Goofy relaxed a little. Lucky them. Anyway, a lot of what was written in the book was pretty cryptic, not quite what Sora was capable of understanding. He took his time in any case, unaware of how much time he was spending.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy...it's like test time all over again,\" Sora grumbled, before closing the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was right then though, that Yen Sid's door opened again, much to everyone's surprise. For a second, Sora, Donald, and Goofy began to think Pete followed them into the tower, making all three summon their weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah fellas!\" the little figure raised his hands in surrender. \"The cloak isn't that scary, is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat little laugh at the end, plus the big round ears as the figure put his hood down, completely gave away who the mystery arrival was. It was King Mickey once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Majesty!\" Donald and Goofy cried, putting their weapons away and bowing immediately. \"It's great to see you again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah gosh you guys,\" Mickey smiled, laughing again before he looked over to Sora and Yen Sid. \"Nice to see you too Sora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to see you two...uh, Your...Majesty?\" It was almost amusing how much trouble Sora had with simple titles. Well, in any case. \"So, how are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been well, thanks,\" Mickey nodded before turning to his old master, giving a respectful bow. \"I apologize for coming right back on short notice. I didn't think I'd be back so soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is no trouble, Mickey,\" Yen Sid said with no offense taken. \"I presume something has come up in your search?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could say that,\" Mickey nodded. \"I've come back with matters of my own, but I'll let you guys finish what you needed to first. Don't mind me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMickey then walked off to the side, letting their conversation continue since Sora had about enough of that book. Mickey didn't want to steal Yen Sid's explanation after he had already agreed to do it in Mickey's place. He could wait until they were done before conducting his own business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, back to the other thing,\" Sora started. \"Why are Heartless still around? Didn't what we did last time put a stop to them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your previous endeavors indeed did prevent a large infusion of Heartless from the great darkness. Do not presume your efforts were in vain,\" Yen Sid explained. \"However, Heartless are darkness made real, and darkness exists in every heart. They are fewer in number, but extremely difficult to eradicate completely. Even a single heart filled with darkness can call upon the Heartless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was dis-heartening, though it made sense. If Heartless were so easy to take care of, such a thing probably would have been done ages ago. Goofy came up with the obvious solution: that if everyone's heart was filled with light, then there'd be no more Heartless. An idealistic goal to be sure. Sora certainly liked it, and Mickey gave a little laugh at the fun thought. Yen Sid didn't even object to it. Still, in any case, they had more concerning matters to attend to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now it is time to speak of the enemies you will encounter,\" Yen Sid continued, making Mickey's ears perk up. This was especially important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYen Sid continued with reviewing the basics of how the Heartless operated: beings that came into existence due to a corrupted heart. Heartless were always around, seeking for more hearts to add to their ranks. It made it all the more important to keep your guard up around such beings. Afterwards, using his magic once more, Yen Sid conjured up another being next to the imaginary Heartless, a familiar silvery being that caught Sora's attention. It was the same beings they fought earlier. Mickey's eyes fixed themselves on the being, a reminder of what he was investigating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At times, if someone with a strong heart and will, be they evil or good, becomes a Heartless,\" Yen Sid continued. \"The empty shell they leave behind begins to act with a will of its own. An empty vessel whose heart has been taken away....A spirit that goes on even as its bodies fade from existence, for you see--Nobodies do not truly exist at all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobodies...\" Sora mumbled, hearing the name of these new enemies for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, hearing that caused a strange feeling in his chest, almost as if the words struck a chord with him somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobodies may seem to have feelings, but this is a ruse--they only pretend to have hearts,\" Yen Sid continued. \"You must not be deceived!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They don't.....exist?\" Sora mumbled again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMickey closed his eyes a little. Honestly it was a little harsher than he would have put it. Truthfully, it wasn't entirely certain if that was the case. Surely, that's how typical belief on Nobodies were, but it wasn't like they were experts on the subject. Nobodies had only recently truly begun to make an impact on the worlds. Mickey still wanted to investigate himself the true nature of them, as well as the Organization. Besides, there was Namine....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, now Sora was sure something was going on inside him. He passed it off as just a funny feeling before, but now it was like there was a little pressure inside him, like something building up....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this feeling?\" Sora asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>Station of Serenity</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas wasn't sure how long he had been here. Time seems to get pretty hazy down here. Still, at least he got a taste of what was going on outside in regards to Sora. Having to leave Heyner, Pence, and Olette so suddenly got a reaction from him, hence why it was shown through Sora. Roxas still wasn't keen on giving up what him himself though, which was probably why he was just sitting by his lonesome in what he assumed was Sora's heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdmittedly though, he was curious to see where this was going, seeing some old Keyblade Master and all. He didn't pay much attention to all the little things like Pete. Not like that stuff really mattered to him. No, he wanted to hear that this upcoming conversation was going to entail. For the most part, it was stuff about Heartless that he already knew, making him think he wasn't going to get much out of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil the Nobody talk happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nobodies do not truly exist at all.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Roxas spoke, for perhaps the first time since Sora woke up. \"How can he say that? Is he trying to say the last year I spent alive was nothing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Nobodies may seem to have feelings, but this is a ruse--they only pretend to have hearts.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Roxas stood up from where he was sitting. Excuse me? What in the world did that old bag know? He trying to say everything Roxas felt was nothing? Having to leave behind his friend Axel? His desire to take down the Organization which lead to his capture? Having to say good bye to Hayner, Pence, and Olette who turned out to be digital when he was there?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd....this bizarre feeling he kept getting... and the briefest of images.....of another time he shed tears....holding a hand in his own....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A Nobody does not have the right to know, nor does it have the right to be</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll at once, something inside Roxas exploded.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i><u>*Twilight Town Mansion*</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a secluded space, expertly hidden by Namine, two replica bodies were laying side by side, having been hooked up to Sora since Vexen brought them.to Namine. One of them had started to glow from when Namine hooked them up, obviously reacting to Xion, while Roxas's replica did little until his return to Sora. However, by now, his was glowing brightly. A whirlwind of emotions was stirring within him, memories coming forth of everything he had gone through over the past year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOrganization XIII, Riku, that red man, and now this supposed old Keyblade Master. Each of them in some way acted like they had something to say about how he should live, like he was less important as his own person. It infuriated him. It always had to be about Sora. Why him? What was it apparently all about him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHHHHH!\" Roxas gave one big cry from within Sora's heart, light encapsulating him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, light completely surrounded the replica body, and by the time the light faded, it was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>Mysterious Tower</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Urgh!\" Sora grunted, feeling the pressure growing in his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sora, are you okay?\" Mickey asked, coming over to check him over. \"Are you in pain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....I don't think so...\" Sora said. \"It's just....it's like something's building in my chest....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, a spark of light appeared over Sora's chest, appearing for a brief while though stunning every person in the room. Even Yen Sid seemed affected, though the only indication of this was some raising of his eyebrows. It was like a brief spark of light was leaving Sora for some reason, though no one could explain why. After a little bit, the light faded from Sora's body, leaving him a little out of breath but nothing too bad. It only caused him to stagger a little before he was upright again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was.....?\" Donald began to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...that?\" Goofy finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anyone could utter another word though, there was another flash of light, although this one was more....aggressive was the word? It came from the ceiling, arriving right on top of Yen Sid's desk. Not sure what was going on, all 4 warriors drew their weapons just in case,  as the light began to form into a humanoid shape. As it was doing so, the figure's right hand reached out, a distinctive Keyblade forming that happened to match Sora's own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Sora asked. The only time anyone else held Kingdom Key was when Riku took the Keyblade from him at Hollow Bastion. Sora looked to his hands, confirming he still had his Keyblade. So why did this person have it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You....\" the figure spoke, before the light began to die down and everyone could see the emergence of a black coat. While it held no significance to Sora, Donald, or Goofy, Mickey on the other hand was more alarmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? The Organization?!\" he cried out, gripping Kingdom Key D harder. How did they get here? And how did they have another Keyblade wielder? He assumed Riku would have handled all that given Sora was alive and well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...are you talking about?\" Sora asked, clearly confused as to what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black-cloaked figure either didn't hear them or just didn't care. What was evident though was that whoever it was was angry, very much so in fact. The hand holding Kingdom Key trembled, and staggering breathing could be heard. Yen Sid didn't seem to move one bit despite the person arriving almost literally right in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you talk, old man?\" the figure spat. \"You saying I'm just nothing? That I have no emotions? Who are you to say such a thing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone remained on guard, but were all confused and a little off-put by just how angry the figure sounded. It even sounded a little choked up, like it was having trouble getting words out at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know.....I'm getting kind of tired of people always thinking they know better than I do how I should live,\" the figure continued after a while. \"For the first year of my life, people made use of me for my power. Only one person ever actually showed me respect like I was a person. And then Riku showed up, doing everything to make sure I returned to Sora. That was all he ever talked about. All about Sora. Even that guy in red had me trapped in his own personal simulation to keep me around until I had to go back. He too even denied me any right to exist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora's eyes widened at the words, letting down his Keyblade a little. How was this guy related to him? And he knew Riku? He eagerly wanted to ask if he knew more, but something told him the guy wasn't done talking. Mickey was also attentive to what the figure was saying, feeling an odd mix of confusion and sadness. Beneath the hood, the figure was gritting his teeth, even turning around to face the others. They couldn't see the top half of his face, but Sora noticed tears beginning to come down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure wasn't sure if the others even knew what the heck he was talking about, but he didn't care at this point. He was going to say his piece whether or not they had a clue. Maybe it was nice for others to be the clueless ones for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not only that, but I sometimes get a strange feeling in my chest of something else that's missing. Something else that I think was taken from me, and I bet that has all to deal with you too,\" the figure pointed Kingdom Key at Sora, making him raise his own slightly. \"Of all things, why is it always about you? Being your Nobody has done nothing for me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the figure took down his hood, revealing himself to all in the room. At the same time, he held out Kingdom Key, before another key formed in his other hand, both blades transforming into distinctive forms that Sora knew very well. He gasped at the sight of Oathkeeper and Oblivion in the mystery figure's hands. Furthermore, the sight of the guy's face brought a look of shock to Mickey's face. It was that of someone dear to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ven?!\" he cried out. \"H-How are you here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Roxas was capable of getting any angrier, he just did. Who the heck was Ven? He was getting tired of names by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" he cried out, wielding Oathkeeper as to prove a point. \"\"First Sora, now this Ven... My name is Roxas! Get it memorized!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeedless to say, Mickey was stunned silent, while Sora's brain was just trying to comprehend everything he was being told. Donald and Goofy were completely lost by now. Yen Sid himself seemed to be deep in contemplation, probably processing the information better than anyone else was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a little bit of awkward silence, as Roxas had stopped his ranting, coming down from Yen Sid's desk. He wasn't sure who he was angrier at at the moment: Yen Sid for being another person who denied his existence, or Sora for being the one he had to give everything for in the first place. Granted, he didn't particularly care which one, though he happened to be facing Sora at the moment, who was looking at the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....you're saying you're my Nobody?\" Sora asked a little tentatively. \"But....how can you be when.......Oh.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riku told me you turned yourself into a Heartless to save Kairi earlier,\" Mickey said, putting aside his own confusion as to why Roxas resembled his old friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right.....guess that makes sense,\" Sora said, lowering Kingdom Key again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this, Roxas glared at Sora again, bringing his attention back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So nice that you're finally up to speed,\" Roxas spat at him. \"Which still doesn't change anything. I'd like to know what makes you so special! I had to give up everything just so you could wake up! So tell me that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Roxas kicked his foot off the ground, rushing right towards Sora at blinding speeds. Immediately, Mickey, Donald, and Goofy began rushing to get in front of Sora, weapons at the ready. Taking a second for it all to sink in however, Sora put his hands out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay back everyone!\" Sora cried out. \"Don't do anything!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sora, what are you saying?!\" Donald quaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's coming right for ya!\" Goofy cried as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sora!\" yelled Mickey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir hesitation at Sora's words made it all too easy for Roxas to approach Sora. Time seemed to slow down, as Roxas's blades got closer to Sora. Oblivion was raised high, ready to be the first one to strike Sora. Mickey reached out, calling Sora's name again while Donald and Goofy began to get closer. What was just a second felt like an eternity to all five involved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd when time seemed to go back to normal, Oblivion lingered right above Sora's head, trembling as if eager to come down on him at any second. However, what really stood out was Roxas's face, who was twisted with confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world are you not raising your Keyblade?\" Roxas asked, surprisingly calmer than his face indicated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you went through a lot of trouble because of me, right?\" Sora asked, sadness evident in his voice. For someone he only just realized existed in the first place, something told him that everything Roxas said was true. \"Then if that's the case, take it out on me. Don't get my friends involved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Sora even tossed Kingdom Key over to the side, the blade just sitting there instead of being called back to its owner. This just confused Roxas even more. Why was he doing this? Why was he not defending himself? He should have every reason to fight back, right? To prove he was better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why? Why are you acting like this?\" Roxas said through clinched teeth. \"You don't know me all that well. For all you know, everything you've been told about Nobodies could be true, so why through your Keyblade aside like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven Roxas was amazed that he sounded as calm as he did, despite the lingering tension all throughout his body at wanting to continue what he started.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Maybe I don't you too well personally...\" Sora started while looking down a little bit. \"But...now that I think about it, those feelings I must have had when I got to Twilight Town must have been your feelings. You...must have really enjoyed the life you had before I came around...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas's teeth gritted again, not moving from his spot and still lingering Oblivion above Sora. He wasn't sure what to make of Sora's words. Was he trying to be consoling to someone he just now realized existed? How could he? No one had to be that accepting of something so soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't be serious. How can you believe all that?\" Roxas spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can because that shows how different you and I are,\" Sora looked back, looking more determined in his expression. \"You have your own feelings and I have mine. If you feel like you need to take out your frustration and sadness, then do so on me if it'll make you feel better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas couldn't believe his ears. This was ridiculous. How could someone even think of the idea of letting them be vented on like this? Was Sora really that stupid? Or just naive to the point of stupid? It almost made Roxas want to bring the blade down right then, and yet his hand continued to stall. Why? Why couldn't he do anything with all of this pent-up emotion?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then that images of Sora began to flash through Roxas's mind. Honestly, it was stuff that had happened before, but he didn't like paying any mind to them. Yet, this time, it was like everything was passing by his eyes like watching a movie. How Sora acted so selflessly with just about every person he interacted with, never once wishing ill upon them. However, what stood out the most was the moments within Hollow Bastion. That, when faced with the fact that Kairi's heart was inside his own, he was freely willing to condemn himself to being a Heartless just so she got to live again. All that at the cost of his own life, the very event that birthed Roxas in the first place. In a sense, it felt ironic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas began to tremble even more, soft whimpering beginning to utter from his mouth. Darn it....why did this guy have to be so darn selfless? Why did he have to make it so hard to actually stay angry at him? Roxas's frustration continued to grow, until even he could tell where were drops of water going down his face. Sora even seemed to smile sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see that? You need a heart to cry,\" Sora said simply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll eyes were on Roxas as he trembled, unable to contain what was going on inside of him. He slowly began bringing Oblivion down, his whimpers beginning to turn into sobs. Out of the blue, Roxas let out another loud cry, slamming Oblivion down to the ground beside Sora, actually creating a rather sizable dent in the floor. Heck, any harder and he might have broken a hole completely through it. He feel to his knees right afterwards, feeling a rising mix of frustration and anguish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gawrsh....sounds like he had it rough....\" Goofy said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not right.....\" Donald seemed to agree with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after that, Sora began to move towards Roxas, much to everyone's curiosity. He knelled down beside Roxas, before actually enveloping him in a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What are you doing?!\" Roxas spoke out in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, considering your body came from me, that kind of makes us brothers, right?\" Sora asked, his trademark grin returning. \"Or close enough at least, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if Roxas could get any more flabbergasted at what he was seeing. If not for his memories of Sora confirming this was how he really was, he would be sure he was getting pranked or something. At that, Roxas actually began to laugh a little. No one could really guess what was fueling it. Whether he found this funny, or was so off-put by everything that he couldn't help but laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That guy in red was right about you,\" Roxas said, finally wiping his tears away. \"You really are too nice for your own good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Sora for you,\" laughed Donald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we wouldn't have him any other way,\" Goofy laughed as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, come on!\" Sora pouted indignantly at the teasing, before joining his buddies in laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMickey let loose a breath he didn't even know he was holding in, feeling relieved that somehow the tension was lightening up. He walked over to Yen Sid while the others were still having their moment. Yen Sid hadn't spoken a word, merely taking in everything he was seeing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like we've had quite the revelation today,\" smiled Mickey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed,\" nodded Yen Sid. \"And I believe I'm beginning to see what is the source of young Roxas's emotions. You mentioned your old friend, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" said Mickey. \"Ven vanished after they fought Xehanort. To think his image would appear in Roxas....it's got to be connected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" Yen Sid nodded again. \"Truly, when it comes to Sora, everything is indeed connected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two just watched as Sora, Donald, and Goofy had a little bit of fun with Roxas, who was clearly still coming to grips with everything that just happened. He wasn't even sure if he could fully believe it, yet here he was, his own original treating him as his own person. This feeling felt so familiar, the feeling of being surrounded by friends...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The mood had considerably lightened since Roxas's initial appearance, and a little time was allowed for things to fully return to normal before proceeding with any other important business. Sora certainly had some questions of his own that he was eager to ask Roxas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how can you do that?!\" asked Sora with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do what?\" Roxas asked in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use two Keyblades,\" Sora clarified, gesturing to the two blades Roxas held. \"I didn't know that was even possible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at Sora's gesture, Roxas had totally forgotten that he was still holding his Keyblades, finally dispelling them since they weren't needed. Still, Sora's question actually puzzled him for a bit...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....that's a good question actually....\" Roxas pondered. \"From what I remember, I only used one Keyblade before, but I could use two by the time I was captured.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean you don't know?\" quaked Donald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. It feels like....my memory's really off,\" Roxas said with one hand to his head. \"There's this one big confusing spot between when I left the Organization and when I came back and got captured. Before, I had one Keyblade, and then I had two. It...doesn't make much sense I guess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh....weird,\" Sora pondered as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that point, Mickey took a moment to intervene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roxas, I apologize for what I called you earlier,\" Mickey said, lowering his head a little before raising it again. \"It's just that you have an incredible resemblance to an old friend of mine who was also a Keyblade wielder.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas seemed perplexed yet curious at that. Sora's mouth went open at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you know other Keyblade wielders?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Sora. Keyblade wielders aren't a new thing,\" Mickey chuckled a little. \"They've been around for years. Why, it wasn't that long ago that there used to be a place where many were trained in the arts of the Keyblade. Sadly, it's not around anymore. In any case, I knew one such boy. His name was Ventus, Ven for short. And Roxas here could easily be his twin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's...weird. I'm pretty sure he doesn't sound familiar,\" said Roxas, giving it a little thought in case he came across such a person in his travels to other worlds. \"Nope, doesn't ring a bell.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, very curious,\" pondered Yen Sid. \"Yet, I doubt this is a coincidence. Mickey, you know what became of Ven, correct?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. How could I forget?\" Mickey sighed. \"When we brought him here, his heart had already left his body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, your friend lost his heart?\" Sora piped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. It's a little complicated to give you the whole story, but in short his heart was nearly taken over, and my other friend and I had to stop him,\" said Mickey. \"She left to take his body to a safe place, and that was the last I saw of either of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat a pretty sad story. Sora, Donald, and Goofy also had a despondent look on their faces at the idea of losing a friend. For Roxas, it felt like those strange feeling he had been experiencing for a while now were coming back. There was even a tear forming on the corner of his eye, though it didn't fall. Somehow, the idea of losing a friend....felt familiar to him somehow. For a second, Roxas wondered about Axel, but he had a feeling that wasn't the case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what does that mean?\" asked Donald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder.....could Ven's heart be related to Sora?\" said Yen Sid. \"That in turn would explain why his Nobody would resemble Ven instead of Sora himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all sounded familiar to Sora as well, though for a different reason he was pondering about. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait....is it like what happened with Kairi?\" he asked, putting a hand to his chest. \"If Ven's heart is missing....then does that mean it's inside me as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's possible I guess,\" Mickey said. \"You wouldn't happen to remember anything of note would you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm......well.....\" Sora pondered for a minute, before something came to mind. \"Well, I'm not sure if it's related, but...there's something that happened when I was a kid. Like....I think I had this dream where I got a really warm sensation. Actually, it wasn't too long after Riku and I met this blue-haired woman on the beaches.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You met Aqua?!\" Mickey cried out. \"She was my other friend! She and I were the ones who saved Ven back then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I the only one who's head is going in circles now?\" Roxas asked, like a student asking a question in class. Donald and Goofy shook their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope. I'm confused,\" sighed Donald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think my head hurts,\" groaned Goofy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seemed to be turning into quite the revelation. Roxas's own appearance here bringing to light matters that Mickey had spent much time on trying to figure out himself. Honestly, he was feeling pretty happy about it. In his investigation of the Nobodies, he had stumbled upon potential information regarding his old friends. To say the King was feeling pretty happy would be an understatement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...does this Ven really is inside me too?\" Sora asked. \"Because...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Donald and Goofy immediately went up to Sora, looking quite flustered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't even think about stabbing yourself again!\" Donald quaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I don't ta see you as a Heartless again,\" Goofy agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora ended up smiling sheepishly, quickly giving an apology. No further explanation was needed on it. Roxas actually knew it from seeing Sora's memories, and Mickey was filled in on pretty much everything that happened a year ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, curious revelations we've stumbled upon,\" said Yen Sid. \"That may well explain Roxas's special circumstances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still though.....\" Roxas said, looking back at Yen Sid. The old master seemed to read his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I offended you earlier, I apologize. Such was not my intention,\" Yen Sid said, closing his eyes a little. \"If I may clarify though, I do believe that the majority of Nobodies are very much like this. Your situation is very unique. Not only being the Nobody of a Keyblade wielder, but also possibly being influenced by another heart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas heard what the master said, and it did make sense. His anger from earlier had subsided, as it wasn't worth really holding on to it anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may continue on a little more, Sora does need to learn more about Nobodies,\" Yen Sid explained. \"I presume you know what these are, Roxas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYen Sid then conjured up another illusion, which took the shape of one of those silver creatures from before. Of course, Roxas knew what they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, those are Dusks,\" Roxas said, getting Sora's attention. \"They're kind of like basic soldiers. The Organization would use them for all sorts of tasks. Maybe grunts are a better word.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct, they are the most basic form of Nobody,\" Yen Sid explained. \"However, much like the Heartless, there are those with larger forms and far more deadlier powers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That true?\" Sora asked Roxas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep. The Dusks don't really compare to some of the others I've seen,\" Roxas said. \"Many in the Organization can control special Nobodies, and they're in a class of their own. I've never had to fight them myself, so I can't say much about their abilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm....\" Sora, Donald, and Goofy all nodded, before Sora opened his mouth. \"You've mentioned an \"Organization\" quite a few times. Who are they?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may?\" Yen Sid seemed to ask in Roxas's direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go ahead,\" Roxas crossed his arms. Guess the Organization was next on the list.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>Castle Oblivion</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA corridor of darkness appeared within the pure white castle, allowing Vexen and Kairi to walk out. She shivered a little at though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow it was cold going through that,\" she rubbed her arms. \"Those corridors always like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hardly anything of note to those like us,\" Vexen chuckled a little. \"In any case, welcome princess to Castle Oblivion. A rather fitting name so I'd advise not getting lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKairi stood in awe of the place. All she could see was one room, but she somehow got this sense that the place was absolutely huge. True, she probably would get lost in such a place without a guide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This place really important?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why yes it is,\" Vexen said casually. \"In fact, you could say it was the beginning of why you had trouble remembering Sora for so long. It's where he got all his own memories scrambled.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, if not for the fact that Namine already included in her little story that Vexen played a role in how bad things got but he wanted to atone for them, Kairi would probably feel more scared at this. Yet, Namine believed in him, and she supposed she got that feeling as well. In any case though, Vexen directed her vision over to a seat among what seemed like a lot of lab equipment. There was a white body there, emitting a soft glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that....?\" Kairi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Namine's replica,\" Vexen explained. \"Right now it's connected to bring her out of you. Like with the others, a strong reaction would be needed for her to come back. As for how, well that's up to you or Sora. Whichever one of you has a strong reaction to her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't that be me though?\" Kairi tilted her head. \"She's my Nobody, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but you only just now learned of her. Your connection may not be too strong,\" Vexen explained. \"Sora on the other hand has extensive experience with her, as does his Nobody to an extent. They were born at the same time after all after Sora released your heart as well as his own. As long as there's a reaction somewhere, Namine should come back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKairi nodded at Vexen's words. It was kind of confusing, but she hoped it would resolve itself soon enough. She smiled a little though. She had to think Sora was probably doing something that would solve things. That's how he was after all.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><i><u>Mysterious Tower</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYen Sid once again conjured up new images, bringing up 3 mysterious hooded figures. Roxas and Mickey hummed a bit at the sight, knowing more about this than others present, while Sora, Donald, and Goofy's curiosity was evident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Organization XIII is comprised of many powerful Nobodies. It commands the lesser Nobodies, as Roxas alluded to,\" said Yen Sid. \"While Heartless act on instinct, Nobodies act in a higher manner. They can act, think, and it appears they're working towards a goal. Roxas, shall I presume you know as to their goal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, for most of them anyway,\" Roxas said, crossing his arms. \"Everyone in the Organization wants to become whole again, so we were collecting hearts for Kingdom Hearts. Take a guess as to what my role was since I have a Keyblade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora piped up at that remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kingdom Hearts?\" he asked. \"But isn't that....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not the same one you saw before,\" Roxas clarified, remembering Sora's memories of that. \"It was one the Organization was putting together. I was the one tasked with collecting most of the hearts. Truthfully speaking, for a long time, I just did whatever they asked. I don't think I remembered much of anything for a long time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That probably had to do with the fact that Sora was revived by Kairi,\" Mickey gave his thoughts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Sora and Roxas nodded at that, as it sounded sensible enough. That brought Sora to another thought though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...you know a lot about the Organization members, right?\" asked Sora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Most of them at least,\" Roxas said. \"Those that went to Castle Oblivion, I never got too close to except for Axel. The others, I know enough about them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Could you tell us more?\" Sora asked, getting nods from Donald, Goofy, and Mickey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may Roxas,\" Yen Sid spoke up. \"I can show more of the Organization's members through your memories if you wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I suppose,\" Roxas shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a second, Yen Sid cast another spell, and the 3 hooded figures that were in front of them began to display more distinct features. In particular, their faces could be shown. Roxas's face grew more stern at the sight, showing a man with an eyepatch, one with blue hair, and another with striking silver hair: Xigbar, Saix, and Xemnas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those guys are pretty much the top 3 in the Organization,\" Roxas said. \"Xigbar is the one with eyepatch, and he's basically the No.2, both in title and function, answers directly to Xemnas. Saix is the blue-haired one, and he was always commanding the rest of us for our missions. I even briefly fought him, though I don't think he went all-out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And....Xemnas?\" Sora asked, after nodding about the others. Looking at the silver-haired man was giving him chills, reminding him of a certain other villain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's the leader, the one who got everyone together under the goal of getting our hearts back,\" Roxas said. \"Though, truth be told, I was trying to disrupt what he was doing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How come?\" asked Donald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....can't explain,\" Roxas said, a hand to his head. \"It all happens at the same time I got my second Keyblade. I charged the Organization's world in hopes of getting to Xemnas and setting Kingdom Hearts free. Why....I can't say...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh....\" Sora nodded before looking back at the projections. \"So, what do you think Roxas? Do they have emotions like you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, everyone I know had their own quirks,\" Roxas said with a finger to his chin. \"Demyx always liked to goof around. Luxord likes his cards, and so on like that. Saix...well I'd say he fits Yen Sid's definition. He really does come across as emotionless. Xemnas as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess everyone is unique in their own way,\" Goofy said with his usual grin, always seeing the silver lining of things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose so,\" Roxas smiled a little, before something else came to mind. \"Oh, Namine's also someone who had emotions. She wasn't in the Organization though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Namine?\" Sora asked, before remembering Jiminy's journal. \"Wait....that name was in Jiminy's journal. What's that about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can probably tell you the gist of it,\" Mickey came up. \"Riku and I went into Castle Oblivion around the same time you did. That's where you went after fighting Ansem. We both fought against members of the Organization there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Sora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, and those were the ones I don't know as well,\" Roxas said. \"And Namine was involved as well, though I didn't know that before joining you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth be told, Namine is also a special Nobody. She's Kairi's actually,\" explained Mickey, much to Sora's surprise. \"Surprised? She was born the same time as Roxas. Remember? You released both her heart and yours, and both came into existence because of that. Riku actually helped to explain most of what was going on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So...Namine is someone I know?\" Sora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More or less. The Organization used her to mess with your memories. That's why you were kept in hiding for so long,\" said Mickey. \"She was really distraught about doing so of course, so she wanted to make it up to you by fixing your memories. You wanted to thank her for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora pondered on those words for a second, before a surge began to go through his head. It wasn't quite like what happened with Roxas, but it was close. Brief images of a blonde-haired girl, with a face identical to Kairi's, went through his head thanks to Mickey's words. Granted, not too much came aside from that, but Sora did feel a familiar warmth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see....I think you're right,\" Sora smiled once the sensation passed. \"So, that means we should make sure to thank her for that, and then we can be friends for real.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does he do it?\" Roxas shrugged and sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was amused by that, though nobody noticed the sensation that passed away from Sora, his determination and gratitude beginning to make their way towards a certain someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>Castle Oblivion</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Kairi said suddenly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA small light was beginning to form in her chest, making her look down. She wasn't sure what was going on, though the sensation was really warm. Actually, it was kind of familiar too, the feeling only one person would ever convey to her, making her smile at the thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sora....\" she said. \"You did something, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer rhetorical question going unanswered, yet didn't require one, the light began to glow brighter, and Vexen finally caught sight of it after looking up from his equipment. The replica body sitting nearby was beginning to glow even more than it did before. Vexen grinned at the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, finally,\" he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if Sora's determination and Kairi's will were coming together, the light from her went towards the replica body, making it glow even more so until it began to change shape beneath the light. Kairi could barely make out feminine features forming on the replica body, with blonde hair beginning to shine through and the body being covered by a white dress. Before long, Kairi's body stopped glowing, making her take in a breath from the sensation. Once that happened, the light stopped on the replica body, revealing Namine's form in its entirety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm.....huh....\" Namine slowly began opening her eyes, as if waking up from a long nap. \"Where.....wait.....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to Castle Oblivion, though I'm sure you could guess that already,\" Vexen chuckled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? I....\" Namine sputtered a little, before her head began to get itself on straight. \"You...you hid my replica here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. Who else in the Organization would suspect it here without me around?\" Vexen said as a matter of fact. \"It's a smart hiding place if I do say so myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case, welcome back,\" Kairi smiled, walking over to Namine and offering her a hand. \"Nice to see you as your own self.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh....same here,\" Namine smiled, taking her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was actually real. She could actually live apart with Kairi while not having to take away from her. It was kind of funny in the sense that she didn't feel any different, despite there being a world of difference.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, it didn't really matter. She was real now, and hopefully Roxas and Xion would get that too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>Mysterious Tower</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But yeah....\" Roxas continued once their brief talk of Namine calmed down. \"She and Axel. They both have helped many others like Sora and myself. They wouldn't do that without emotions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said Axel was your friend, right?\" Mickey asked before chuckling a little. \"Perhaps you had a positive influence on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome thoughts of Axel having to teach Roxas just about anything and everything went through Roxas's head, making him smile a little. He always do whatever it took to help, even though he often complained. Though, for a brief moment, as he went through memories of Axel explaining various things on the Clock Tower, he could give this brief feeling of someone else leaning up against his left side. A flash of black clothes and black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure,\" Roxas smirked a little. \"He was the one who often had to babysit me while I had no memories or emotions to go on. My other friend too. He did a lot for both her and me.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>That caught most of them off guard. This was the first time Roxas mentioned having any other friends outside of Axel. And a girl too? Most interesting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, a girl?\" asked Donald, though you could hear a glimmer of chuckling in the duck's mouth. \"And who was that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas stiffened a bit at Donald's words. \"Wait....what? What did I say?\" he asked, not sounding sure at all with a hand to his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you asking us?! You just said you had another friend!\" Donald said, getting a little louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um....did I.....?\" Roxas wasn't sure if that was a question or statement. And if it was a question, to whom he was asking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone else eyed Roxas a little, kind of making the Nobody feel a little uncomfortable as if being scrutinized. Granted, he could understand why. Roxas didn't like the idea that there might remain other things about himself that he was unaware of. That was bad enough with what he had gone through already. Though, after a minute of silence, Goofy spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, I got it!\" he said happily. \"Maybe your memories got altered too! Just like Sora!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's right?\" Sora grinned, even pointing at Goofy. \"So if my memories got all messed up, then maybe yours did too. After all, weren't you saying something about not remembering a bunch when you got your second Keyblade?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas heard all those words, and right then his head began to hurt a little. What was going on? Why was there such a gap in his memory between leaving the Organization and then returning with a vengeance to stop Xemnas? Why were there thoughts of a second friend that would come and go as quickly as they came? It was like something fighting to resurface after being submerged in water, although in this case, the effort of resurfacing was causing him pain. This was not unlike how he felt back at the mansion when he got his memories of the Organization, although this somehow felt worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot worse in a pain sense. That was the same. The difference was that these sensations carried a sense of....dread maybe? Like, he was especially emotionally tied to these for reasons he couldn't understand. It was more than just memories. It was almost like he lost a part of himself, figuratively and literally somehow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roxas!\" Sora cried out, coming over to help him, before he felt a little sensation in his chest as well. \"Ugh....me too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on now?!\" Donald cried out, kind of getting tired of seeing his friend in distress again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. There's another feeling in my chest....\" Sora said, looking over at Roxas, who had both hands on his head now. \"But I think it's hurting him more!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhhhhh!\" Roxas cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Darn it, come on! What's going on?! WHO ARE YOU?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>Somewhere in the darkness</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuffice to say, Xion actually felt kind of happy a while ago. For the briefest of moments, she could feel Roxas's presence inside of Sora, meaning that Sora had to be complete at long last. The sensation that Sora was finally back to normal and she and Roxas were both where they belonged made her happy, though she wished she could at least see Roxas. Her situation hadn't changed one bit, just lingering around wherever she was. Still, guess as long as everything was right, she was content.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill....what she wouldn't give to actually see him again....she still stood by the fact that she did what she needed to, yet it was hard to deny the loneliness she now felt even being a part of Sora. How long had it even been by this time?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, at some point though, Xion finally got another moment of lucidity. However, with it came something else. In-between the last time she finally got a feeling for something, the sensation she got from Roxas was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roxas?.....Are you there?.....\" she mouthed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried feeling for the same warm sensation she got when she first learned that he was here, and yet there was none. Trying to keep herself \"above water\" for as much as possible, she kept on trying to feel for him. Yet, for as long as she did, there seemed to be no trace of him. The bits of him that belonged to Sora were still here....but the parts that were undeniably Roxas were gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roxas? Roxas?!\" Xion began raising her voice. \"Where are you?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy? Why he not here? Even if he returned everything he needed to give to Sora, memories and feelings that were his own should remain, just like her at the least. The feeling that there was nothing at all began to make her panic, all the more so at the familiar feeling of being pulled under again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Not yet!\" Xion cried out, flailing her arms about like someone trying to keep from drowning. \"I need to find Roxas! He can't be gone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, part of her was fearing the worst, that Roxas truly gone now. As in completely gone, without a trace of what made him special or the memories they shared like hers. She fought hard against the darkness threatening to take her back under, though it felt almost futile. Whatever this place was was stronger than her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No....please no....\" Xion struggled, unknowingly beginning to let tears form at the corner of her eyes. It felt like she was barely keeping her head and hands above water at this point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Darn it, come on! What's going on?! WHO ARE YOU?!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nXion's eyes widened. That was Roxas's voice! But where was it coming from? It wasn't from anywhere in Sora, but that had to mean he was somewhere! Briefly, she could see this image of Roxas in a hazy place, holding his head in anguish as if something was coming to mind. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere....his words for her? Was he trying to remember her? She had this weird feeling his words were aimed at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roxas! I'm over here!\" Xion tried extending her hand out as far as she could. Was he okay? And was Sora okay? Both questions seemed to be answered in the positive, but that just confused her even more. \"I'm....right here.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe strength in her voice seemed to wane as she was getting pulled under again, any forming tears getting mixed in with her surroundings. If he was there, then she wanted to be where he was. She had hoped they would be together once inside Sora, but if he was there, then she wanted to be there too!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her outstretched hand began to get submerged too, a bright light began to form, confusing Xion even more. She didn't even really have time to digest what was going on, before whatever it was was beginning to engulf her. For a moment, Xion could see her form disappearing. Actually, it kind of reminded her of when she vanished in Roxas's arms back in Twilight Town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am....I...vanishing again? But...why does it feel warm?\" Xion wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light continued to engulf Xion, her form lighting up before dissipating, not leaving a trace behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>Twilight Town Mansion</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the same time, the remaining replica body had been glowing as brightly as those that came before it. The combined cries of Roxas and Sora were calling out to it, with it's new occupant on its way. Once that hit, the body burst into even greater light, before being sent on its way. The final resident of the mansion had left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>Mysterious Tower</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, Donald was actually trying to cast some magic to heal Sora and Roxas, though it was not really helping. Roxas continued to clutch his head, while things had slowly become more apparent with Sora. Goofy and Mickey were especially worried as to what was helping, while Yen Sid tried to ponder what was happening specifically. The last time it happened, Roxas appeared. So, what could this reaction be towards?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey didn't have to wait long for an answer, as a bright light began to appear off to the side, getting everyone's attention. Roxas and Sora's problems seemed to subside for a bit, allowing the two to catch their breath and stand up. Like with Roxas, the light began to take on a distinctive form. Though, for this particular one, the being seemed a little smaller than Roxas. However, what stood out was the prominent black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another one?!\" Donald quaked, getting ready just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope it's friendly,\" Goofy worried as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe light began to die down completely, showing off the black-coated figure. The person's features gave off sort of a feminine vibe, although no one could say with certainty. Sora and Roxas looked to each other, before getting a little closer to the figure. Neither drew their Keyblades.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A friend?\" Sora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....think so...\" Roxas said, his head still feeling all kinds of wobbly at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe black-coated being barely moved an inch, soft breathing being the only sense of movement so far. Sora and Roxas walked right up to it, trying to get a closer look. They could only see the bottom half of the figure's face, giving Roxas a serious case of deja vu. This...felt very familiar. It was on the tip of his tongue but he couldn't quite get it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you.....?\" he began to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the being showed a little movement for the first time, its face slightly turning towards Roxas. Though the hood, Roxas could see a pair of stunning blue eyes.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Xion!\" Roxas suddenly cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, that name just came to him, like a flash of inspiration or whatever. Xion didn't seem to indicate much that she heard what he said though. Even he wasn't entirely sure what it meant. All he could say was that....it felt nice to say that name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xion?\" Sora asked. \"That her name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it is,\" Roxas said after a little pause. \"Sorry...my head still feels a little foggy on the details, but....I just feel like she was a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTruth be told, there was one little thing that was actually crystal clear in Roxas's head. A memory of being within the big room where all of the Organization XIII members sat in elevated chairs. Xemnas was, of course, leading the meeting, acting like it was a really big occasion...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Yeah, he could hear Xemnas's booming voice, telling them all that it was a momentous occassion. A new Organization member was coming: Number XIV. Quite an odd number given the name of the Organization to begin with. Further more, it was another one of the Keyblade's chosen, giving Roxas his own thoughts regarding his recruitment. The new figure said not a word, yet happened to look up at Roxas. Slowly, a soft smile formed, and Roxas could swear it was directly at him.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roxas? Hello?\" Sora waved his hand in front of Roxas's face, snapping him out of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, sorry,\" Roxas said. \"Got lost in memories a little bit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXion hadn't moved since they approached. In her mind, everything seemed foggy. Xion was definitely her name, she could say that much. A lot of everything else though was hazy. Still, seeing the two guys in front of her, there was a peaceful feeling. Sora and Roxas, she could tell those names too. They both sounded nice, Roxas especially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So where in the world did she come from?\" Donald stomped over. \"You didn't have her in your heart too, did you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, I'm not sure?\" Sora questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonald whined a little, before coming even closer. Before the duck could get too close to Xion though, she subtly moved behind Roxas, making no dramatic movements but clearly keeping a certain distance from the frustrated duck, who grew even more so at being blocked off. Goofy ended up laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, I think she's shy,\" Goofy laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't say,\" Donald grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven trying to walk around Roxas just made Xion subtly move in a circle. For a brief moment actually, she actually moved her hand to rest on Roxas's for a brief moment before removing it. Roxas was a little surprised by the brief touch, but shook it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Donald, knock it off,\" Roxas said. \"She clearly doesn't want to be near you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonald grumbled indignantly, while Sora and Goofy laughed. Mickey chuckled a little too, though he couldn't help but wonder. He thought back to when Riku told him about a weapon the Organization was preparing to use Sora's powers. He wasn't referring to Roxas, that much he knew. Could this girl be the other one? Eh, guess it was nothing but a wild guess at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Yen Sid cleared his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as I'm curious of this myself, I believe we should complete our discussion,\" he said. \"There will be time to catch up once we're done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair point,\" Sora said. \"You don't mind do you Roxas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's okay,\" Roxas said, understanding that other things did need to be said. He looked behind his right arm to Xion. \"You going to be okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't give a verbal response, but there was a very slight tilt of her head that seemed to indicate she understood. Actually, after she did that, Roxas could see a faint smile on her face, very much like what he remembered from the first time he laid eyes on her. Honestly, it was a nice feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, with Xion's matter put aside for the time being, the focus went back to the images of the Organization members present. Yen Sid already went over a couple more things, like it was the Organization causing the Heartless to appear in many worlds. That matched Roxas's own story about them wanting to put Kingdom Hearts together. Behind him, Roxas actually felt Xion stiffen just a little at the mention of Kingdom Hearts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrankly, she was also staring a little at the three projections. Roxas couldn't tell if she was fearful or anything, but her blue eyes seemed to indicate a twinkling of distress. In turn, Roxas moved his hand to touch her a little, perhaps as a little reassurance. Again, there was no verbal response, but she seemed to relax a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the other side of things, Yen Sid had been studying the projections intently. In particular, it was Xemnas he was curious about. The Nobody resembled someone he was familiar with. Another of the Keyblade Trio who was lost long ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mickey, you're familiar with Terra are you not?\" Yen Sid asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aqua and Ven's friend? Yeah, I've heard of him,\" Mickey said. \"Though I didn't get to see him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, going by Roxas's memories, this Xemnas looks very much like him,\" Yen Sid closed his eyes in thought. Looks like they really were stumbling upon something far deeper than they imagined. \"I believe we may have discovered where Xehanort went following the battle in the Keyblade Graveyard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMickey gasped at that, while everyone else was confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Xehanort? Keyblade Graveyard?\" asked Sora. \"I don't follow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a long story,\" sighed Mickey. \"But I suppose you probably would have heard it eventually. Allow me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, Mickey began recounting what he could. About how there were three particular Keyblade wielders from a decade ago: Ven, Terra, and Aqua. All three were trained by a professional master, much like Mickey was under Yen Sid. Xehanort was also an old master, a dear friend to the trio's own teacher, Eraqus. However, he had plans of his own, and this culminated in a fight at the Keyblade Graveyard, the site of an ancient war between many Keyblade wielders. Mickey didn't know too many specifics beyond when he had to help Aqua fight Ven, who had been possessed by a dark force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"From what we can gather here, Terra must have been possessed by Xehanort,\" Yen Sid explained. \"Eventually, this person would come to be the apprentice of Ansem the Wise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ansem?!\" Sora cried out. \"So he's related to that guy from before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's actually something else I wanted to tell you,\" Mickey said. \"That wasn't Ansem you fought, it was Xehanort. Additionally, it was his Heartless that you defeated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, so that's why his Nobody is in charge of the Organization,\" Roxas added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds likely to me,\" Mickey agreed. \"I've hoped for years to be able to find my friends. I figured a time would come eventually, though I didn't imagine it happening now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora thought about everything. So an old friend was possessed? It reminded him of Riku from his first journey. If this Terra had been going under the same thing except for even longer, Sora couldn't help but feel sad for him and Mickey's other friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we should go save them!\" Sora cheered, to which Donald and Goofy joined it. Mickey chuckled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's nice of you Sora. However, you can't chase two rabbits at once,\" he said. \"I'd love to find my friends, but we have pressing matters with the Organization to handle first.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess you're right,\" Sora nodded, a little sad but he understood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Yen Sid spoke up. \"As an additional measure, since you now have an idea of what Ven and Terra look like, this is Master Aqua.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, the Organiation member's projections disappeared, and were replaced by one figure. It was a rather beautiful woman, with short blue hair and wearing blue and black-themed clothing. She had a rather light pair of armor on as well. Honestly, Sora couldn't help but be reminded of Kairi by looking at her. Though, Yen Sid said something funny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master? You mean like you?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Correct. Before her disappearance, Aqua was given the title of Keyblade Master,\" Yen Sid explained. \"She's been lost ever since though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Aqua's image disappeared, giving the room with just it's living occupants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, now you know what you're up against,\" Yen Sid said. \"Admittedly, I didn't expect so many revelations to come forth today. Yet, as I said before, everything is connected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" Sora smiled, Donald and Goofy doing the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Yen Sid turned to Roxas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Young Roxas, if you find it agreeable, it'd be helpful for you to assist Sora,\" he requested. \"I find it best that you two stay together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was going to anyway,\" Roxas smirked a little. \"Someone's got to keep him safe from his good intentions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\" Sora cried indignantly, getting more laughs from everyone around, Xion excluded of course.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After the little bout of laughter subsided, Roxas spoke up again, this time a little more serious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Xion though?\" he asked, looking back at her. \"I...don't want to leave her on her own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm....I confess I know very little of her situation,\" Yen Sid pondered before turning to Mickey. \"Since she doesn't seem willing to communicate to us, what do you know of her, Roxas?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well....um....\" Truth be told, Roxas actually couldn't say much. He knew her name, and that she was close to him. At least closer than anyone in the Organization not named Axel. \"I guess.....there isn't too much I know outside of I just know her. She was No.XIV in the Organization....and she can use the Keyblade too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Sora's eyes widened a little. \"Her too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....I'm pretty sure she can. I'm sure I remember Xemnas saying she could, at least as far as my memory goes,\" Roxas said, before turning to her. \"Xion, can you show them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXion seemed to hum a little, though there was a slight tilt of her head. Roxas wasn't sure if she was understanding what he was saying. Sora seemed to be in thought too, before his face lit up like a light-bulb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, maybe she just needs to remember. Let's show her,\" he smiled, putting his hand out and summoning his Keyblade. Roxas nodded at Sora's surprise good thinking, and summoned his own Kingdom Key in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXion looked at both keys, resting in the right hands of their wielders. Slowly, she turned to her own right hand, raising it a little as if it was alien to her. Still, she mimicked the motion that the two boys did, putting her hand out in front of her. She wasn't sure if she was doing anything, but the image of their keys stayed in her mind, so she focused on that. A brief flicker of light later, a third Kingdom Key formed, much to the delight of Sora and Roxas. Mickey didn't seem surprised, but Donald and Goofy were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Donald cried out. \"She can use it too?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the same as Sora's key!\" Goofy said with a smile, not seeing anything particularly wrong with that. \"Does that mean something though?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora was admittedly curious too. Roxas didn't seem to think much on it, but Sora was kind of confused. Roxas using his Keyblade made sense because he was his Nobody. But, why did this girl have the same key? Maybe she was related to him somehow? Honestly, this was kind of gnawing on his mind, so he approached her. Xion's Keyblade disappeared, and she looked up as Sora walked right up to her. She blinked in curiosity at what he was looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, Xion's eyes were really getting at Sora. He...he knew those eyes from somewhere. They reminded him of someone more special than anyone else. He hoped he wasn't overstepping his bounds, but he had to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, if it's okay,\" Sora began. \"Can you put down your hood? I really want to see your face.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the room was curious at Sora's sudden request. Wasn't really like him to be that upfront. Something must have been really bothering him. Still, everyone's eyes went to Xion at his words, and the girl seemed suddenly a little stiffer. She didn't betray any emotions, but...there seemed like a little hesitation. Still, about a little bit later, her hands began to pull at the edges of her hood, letting it fall down and revealing a head of short raven black hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the hair wasn't what caught everyone off-guard, except for Roxas who didn't seem surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kairi?!\" Sora cried out. No way, that was definitely Kairi's face. Heck, if the hair was red instead of black, it would have been a perfect match.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does she look like her?!\" cried Donald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm so confused,\" groaned Goofy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMickey's face lit up in surprise too, and he began to ponder even more at what was going on. Now he felt certain that Xion was the \"copy of Sora\" that Riku mentioned, though why she had Kairi's appearance had him a little baffled. That would explain why she had Sora's Keyblade. Roxas seemed to be especially close to her, given his reaction both before and after her appearance. He was sure he was beginning to see the bigger picture here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps sensing everyone's surprise, Xion wasted little time in putting her hood back on, even turning her head away to hide her face completely as if ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's okay,\" Roxas smiled, putting his arms on her shoulders reassuringly. \"See, told you she can use the Keyblade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Intriguing discovery,\" Yen Sid said, closing his eyes for a minute. \"Then, so answer your question Roxas, I believe she should go along with you and Sora. I believe the three of you shouldn't be kept apart, and it might help to spur your development faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good,\" nodded Roxas with a smile, before turning to Xion. \"Hey, looks like we're teaming up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXion slowly turned to Roxas's gaze. Again, she spoke no words but that smile from before came back. Teaming up....that sounded nice...and a little familiar, but mostly nice. As if to punctuate the situation, Sora came right over and put his arms over both of their shoulders, startling both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we're a team!\" Sora grinned his classic grin. \"I admit I'm a little confused, but I look forward to our new adventure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're hopeless,\" Roxas sighed. Boy, this guy really was going to need protection. Xion's smile didn't leave her face throughout the exchange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs nice as the scene was though, Donald had a complaint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But wait, I don't think Gummi Ships can hold this many people,\" he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that's right. It's not very comfortable with more than three people,\" Goofy nodded sadly. \"You wonder why they don't make them bigger.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Mickey chuckled, stepping forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, fortunate for us, I may have an idea. It's actually the original reason I came back here in the first place,\" smiled Mickey. \"Remember what Roxas said about Namine? Well, she's currently missing and the Organization might be behind it. I told Riku I'd help search for her, but with the way things are, I might need more help than I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he looked his friends straight in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Donald, Goofy, how would you like to come with me?\" he offered, getting gasps from his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A mission with the King?!\" Donald quaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's an honor, sir!\" Goofy gave a salute, which just looked funny from him. \"But, do you think Sora will be okay without us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean? I can take care of myself, and I got these guys with me,\" Sora smiled. Leaving Donald and Goofy would be a little sad, but he knew they'd love to help their King more. \"So go on. The King needs you, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDonald and Goofy stiffened a little, before soon nodding with smiles. It wasn't like they were being thrown aside. This would be an important mission as well. If their King needed them this urgently, then they would answer the call. Yen Sid nodded too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In that case....\" He turned to the window. Soon enough, a blocky ship came into view, one immediately recognized as the Gummi Ship they used. \"Allow me to return your ship. I retrieved it from the deep darkness for this occasion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WOAH! Thanks Master Yen Sid!\" Donald quaked, before looking just a little bit irritated as he pulled some keys from his pocket. \"Now you better not crash it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What makes you think I'll do that?\" Sora pouted. \"I didn't crash once before!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you did!\" Donald quaked louder. \"You scraped the ship against an asteroid last time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scraped, not crashed,\" Sora talking as if he knew what he was talking about. \"Trust me, I'll be fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy,\" Roxas groaned. Well this just got a whole lot more crazy. Guess moving about the realm of light meant a new way of traveling, and possibly more dangerous depending on your perspective.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was another brief laugh, before Sora turned towards Mickey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh! I had been meaning to ask!\" Sora said. \"What's Riku up to these days?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's....well enough,\" Mickey said. \"He asked me to not give specifics, but just know that he is also fighting hard against the Organization, and to find Namine too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora nodded, satisfied at that answer. Funny enough, when Xion appeared, Sora also got this strange sensation regarding Namine. It wasn't much of a feeling, but he could just tell it was something. Eh, he'd figure it out later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, before you go on your way, you should go see the three good fairies for more suitable traveling clothes,\" Yen Sid explained. \"Those clothes look a little too small for you, Sora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh....heh heh....\" Sora laughed bashfully, seeing his old outfit looking quite tiny on him now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it would be best for Roxas and Xion to acquire some clothes as well,\" Yen Sid continued. \"Wearing what they have now might attract unwanted attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fair enough,\" Roxas nodded. Getting out of the Organization's uniform didn't sound too bad to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXion didn't seem all that on board though, watching from behind Roxas. Her hands gripped slightly, as if unsure as to what to make of that. She heard Yen Sid's words, and felt unease about looking different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Xion's unease going a little unnoticed, Sora lead both Roxas and her towards the adjacent room where they needed to go. Mickey brought Donald and Goofy over to him so they could talk things out, as well express some long held-in relief that the King was well. Mickey sure felt lucky to have such caring friends. He felt a little guilty about separating them from Sora when they were about to have another adventure, but he hoped they would be happy with this too. Surely, they'd be traveling quite a bit themselves from here on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora, Roxas, and Xion walked into the next room together, seeing that it was a slightly smaller room than the one they just came from. As always, there were books and stuff all over the place. Near the back of the room though were three women, all smaller than the other three present and wearing vibrant colors of red, green, and blue. The little wings on their back only confirmed what Yen Sid said about fairies. Sora was excited of course, while Roxas couldn't help but think of that little fairy thing from Neverland that made him fly. Hey, come to think of it, Axel got to fly with him but he had the feeling Xion didn't. Maybe they should make a note of that for the future.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the three of them could speak though, the fairies noticed them, breaking from their little huddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, if it isn't Sora. A delightful pleasure to meet you,\" smiled the red fairy. \"My name is Flora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Fauna. Also a pleasure,\" replied the green fairy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I'm Merryweather. The honor's all mine,\" said the blue fairy in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Sora...but I guess you knew that already,\" Sora chuckled sheepishly, putting his hands behind his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roxas,\" Roxas replied simply, before turning to Xion. \"Come on. You gotta at least introduce yourself right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXion gently turned to Roxas, who was standing on Sora's right side while she was to the left. Her mouth moved slightly, but no words came out, as if she didn't trust her voice. Still, Roxas was right. She had a name. Why not tell it? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....Xion,\" she spoke her first words since re-awakening. Even her voice was exactly like Kairi's were Sora's thoughts, really making him wonder what the story was there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Splendid!\" Flora said in turn. \"We're already aware that you're here for better clothes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you've come to the right place!\" Merryweather smiled in delight. \"Though I must say, your new company was unexpected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Indeed. We actually had something in mind for you, Donald, and Goofy,\" Flora said, tapping her wand a little. \"Our idea was for you to gain powers based on your bond with them. With your new companions, we'll have to think of something new for you, as well as for your fellow Keyblade wielders in turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Sora asked, looking a little disappointed at perhaps throwing a wrench into things. \"I'm sorry for that. Things just happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's no worry at all,\" laughed Fauna. \"We'll simply just have to work with your new company. We'll just take you, Roxas, and Xion's abilities into account when making the new designs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohhh, does this mean we get to use my idea?!\" Merryweather said with a lot of excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll talk, dear,\" Flora said. \"We have to be sure Sora can handle that sort of power. If you can excuse us dears for a few minutes so we can discuss this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's no problem. Right?\" Sora glanced at his two companions, who both nodded slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Splendid,\" Flora tapped her wand again. \"Let's just get a better look at your companions so we know what to do for them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFauna walked over and looked around Xion, tapping her wand and humming a bit. Xion seemed a little off-put at the sudden scrutinizing, making her want to hide behind Sora and Roxas again. Thankfully, Fauna's work didn't take too long. Merryweather took the task of looking over Roxas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's not too much trouble, there is something I'd like for my clothes,\" Roxas said. \"There's some I wore in Twilight Town that I liked...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I know,\" Merryweather laughed. \"I already looked into your memories to see that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Is everyone here capable of invading my head?\"</i> Roxas thought bitterly as Merryweather eventually left him alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe three fairies went back to their little huddle, allowing the three Keyblade wielders by themselves near the entrance to the room. Guess they had a little bit of time before getting on the road. At the very least though, Sora wanted to keep talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....I'm guessing you don't have any idea either how you got here?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope,\" Roxas shrugged. \"How in the world we're able to look at each other like this is beyond me. Probably the same for Xion too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSaid girl just hung around behind the boys, not saying anything but just lingering behind as if wanting to avoid being seen. The boys didn't think much of it, though Roxas felt concerned with her shyness. It wasn't this bad before....was it? Xion kept to herself in the Organization, he could remember that much, yet she didn't act like this. Well, hopefully he could get to the bottom of that in time. All he knew was that he felt delighted for her to be back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.....you know, I think we should have a little spar before we go,\" Sora smiled again. \"Feel each other out so we'll be able to fight better in the other worlds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, not a bad idea,\" Roxas nodded. \"I think all three of us have some catching up to do in regards to skill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome,\" Sora smiled, before turning to Xion. \"You in too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXion lightly turned in Sora's direction, giving a small nod, although her head really wasn't much clearer in regards to anything. It didn't seem like something that was going to come to her any time soon. Well, Sora didn't really want to pry any more than he already did. He was okay with her waiting for a time she wanted to talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case, this is going to be interesting,\" Sora smiled again. \"Not one, but three Keyblade wielders on a journey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True, but don't forget it'll probably be hard,\" Roxas said gravely. \"I already tried taking on the Organization once and couldn't get through the front door. We'll have to get a lot stronger for that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right,\" Sora nodded, none of his enthusiasm fading. \"But I'm positive we can handle it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas shook his head but smiled all the same. Guess if nothing else, Sora could keep group motivation going. They couldn't see, but Xion also smiled softly beneath her hood. At that same time, the fairies broke their huddle, seeming pretty satisfied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right dears, let's get to work!\" Flora said, getting everyone's attention. \"Sora, let's start with you. We're going to keep the design we had in mind for you, but what powers they grant will be very different compared to what we were planning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should keep in mind that they're going to be stronger than what we originally had in mind,\" said Fauna. \"So, please exercise caution when learning them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got i t!\" Sora smiled with a clenched fist. No matter what, he could take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSadly, Sora found his enthusiasm waning at what happened next. It started simply with Fauna giving him a set of better fitting clothes, with a distinct green color scheme at that. Merryweather didn't like it though and promptly turned it blue. He wasn't sure if Flora was trying to help but she turned it red right afterwards. What followed was a never ending struggle between the three fairies who kept hitting Sora with magic over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was actually getting to a point where Roxas was beginning to laugh, and he just got louder as the struggle went on. Off to the side, Xion had a hand over her mouth, not being able to stop softly giggling herself. She wasn't quite sure why she was doing that, but it felt nice so why not. Sora groaned as his companion's apparent enjoyment of this, eventually asking the fairies to please just decide already. That got them out of their little competition, finally settling enough to actually cooperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat eventually came out of it was a nice set of clothing that seemed to emphasize black, along with some yellow and red. It suited him rather well, and Sora even caught a glimpse in the nearby mirror, even posing playfully into it that drew eye-rolls from Roxas. Eventually, Flora pulled him out of his fun, reiterating that the clothes were special. Flora conjured up a little something for Sora to take, which he did obviously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I said, this is a little stronger than what we had originally thought of, so be careful,\" Flora said before she conjured up something else, a little crescent moon shaped like a....keychain? \"Take this. King Mickey once used a blade like this so you should make use of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHonestly, Sora had completely forgotten about his keychains. That was really helpful in his last journey through the worlds. He took the keychain willingly, setting it to his Keyblade. It transformed into the Star Seeker, a Keyblade Mickey once used as implied by Flora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And now, watch what happens!\" Merryweather said with excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora felt a rush of power go through him after a little while, the force coming off as incredibly strong, encasing part of him in light. Roxas actually took a step back in surprise, wondering what this was. When the light died down though, Sora opened his eyes, startled to see bits of his clothes had turned a dark green. Furthermore, Star Seeker had turned into a more sword-like shape, glittering stars falling from its edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wow......man!\" Sora said, once he got his bearings. Seriously, this was cool! His Keyblade actually changed!</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Both Roxas and Xion were quite intrigued by the change. They certainly hadn't seen anything like that. It seemed pretty strong too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is called Blitz Form. It's one of many forms you'll be able to take on depending on what Keyblade you're using,\" Merryweather explained. Clearly this was her idea to an extent. \"We're not telling you the rest. You'll have to discover those on your own.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We will add one little nugget of information,\" said Fauna. \"We added a little feature where you can have up to three keychains available at one time, so you can adjust your Keyblade even when in battle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOkay, that excited Sora as much as the new form did. He remembered how he sometimes had a less convenient keychain during certain battles and he never had enough time to change unless the battle was over. Having more options like this was pretty cool. Admittedly, he also felt a little tired too, and his clothes ended up reverting back to normal, Star Seeker changing back as well. Okay, he was kind of already starting to see why Flora was a little weary about it. He was going to have to toughen up to handle that stuff for longer periods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I advised, use it wisely,\" Flora said strictly. \"Don't go overboard if your body isn't capable yet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it,\" Sora smiled. Eh, he felt no biggie at that. If he had to get better, then he would. Simple as that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right then. Roxas you're next,\" Flora beckoned him to come over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Sora's time in the spotlight done for now, Roxas walked right up. Thankfully, the fairies wasted little time in actually getting their act together and doused him with their magic as well. Much to Roxas's delight, they had taken to heart what he asked, and was soon looking at a new set of clothes resembling what he wore before outside of the Organization. Although, he could already feel something radiating off them, not something he ever felt with his old clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you Roxas, and this applies to Xion as well, we had to figure out the correct balance for the three of you to use your skills to the best they can be. After all, you won't get anywhere if all three of you focus on the same abilities. It's bad for chemistry,\" Merryweather explained. \"So, in Roxas's case, we gave you one of the powers we intended to give Sora. It's called Valor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Valor....\" Roxas quoted, giving his new (old?) look a glance in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The fact that you already use two Keyblades makes you perfect for this. It's a battle-oriented form meant for attacking and protecting,\" said Fauna. \"And like Sora, you may be able to tap into more of its power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas could indeed feel something inside him, and having already experienced an awakening of his own some time ago, was even able to summon a little bit of it. He even noticed a symbol, seeing a red fleur-de-lis symbol. Guess that was the representative of Valor's power in these clothes. Not bad at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you,\" Roxas smiled. Being out of the Organization's cloak felt pretty nice right now. He walked back over to Sora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta say, that does look more fitting on you than all black,\" Sora chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, laugh it up,\" Roxas shook his head, though his own smile remained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, last but certainly not least,\" announced Fauna. \"Xion, your turn dear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXion's head piped up at her being called, to which she was slow to move. Roxas looked over to her, smiling as if telling her it was okay. She didn't respond but began to walk forward towards where the others were standing, her hands folded over in front of her as she waited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right, once more dears,\" Flora said, and the three fairies got to work again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slight noise escaped Xion's mouth as the magic hit her. Like the others, the magic took effect immediately, completely transforming her clothes. Her cloak disappeared, giving her a double-buttoned black top. It was sleeveless, had a bit of a collar, and tiny frills on the arms. A large black belt went around her waist, and a white skirt filled out from underneath it. Completely the surprisingly simple outfit were black boats that went halfway up the knees with a little beige at the top of them. The heels on them also mirrored the ones from her cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah, nice!\" Sora cheered on, a completely innocent gesture. The new clothes gave him a far better look, really showing off how much she resembled Kairi. Granted, it wasn't like he really cared honestly. He was just happy for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas was actually silent, his mouth slightly open. This was the first time he had ever seen Xion in anything out of her cloak, and....wow....what word could he think that described her? He actually couldn't think of one. In his lifetime (not counting Sora's life), he had only seen one girl outside of an Organization's cloak and that was Olette. Yet...a thought rang through his head that she didn't look nearly as good as Xion did. Where did that thought even come from?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Xion's case, what came of her mouth was a soft muttering of intelligible words. Seeing her new form in the mirror, she couldn't but feel....a little wrong somehow. She wanted to hide her face again, but the new clothes didn't have a hood, and she had so much skin showing compared to how she was before. Plus, getting to look in the mirror and seeing her Kairi-influenced form in greater detail, she couldn't help this odd feeling of distress. Like...something was wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairies just took it as her being a little shy and thought nothing big of it. Like Roxas's clothes, Xion could see a symbol associated with its powers: a blue flame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you Xion, these clothes will enhance your magical abilities. We call it Wisdom,\" explained Flora. \"Since Donald won't be joining you, you'll need someone to better assist you with magic and healing and the like. So your job won't be just to assist them with fighting, but also to keep everyone healed and healthy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-Yes....\" Xion spoke softly, before turning to go back to the others since she assumed she was done now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well now, I'd say you're all ready to go,\" smiled Flora. \"I wish you all the best of luck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This journey is going to be twice as hard as your last one,\" said Merryweather. \"So you two do your best to help him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll try,\" smiled Roxas. \"Right Xion?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs weird as Xion felt about a lot of things, seeing Roxas's smile seemed to alleviate things just a little. She actually gave a little smile, and nodded slightly. Sora pouted a little bit bit returned to his usual smile fast enough. They all said their thanks to the three fairies, and returned outside to the others. Donald noticed them immediately, saying they didn't look bad in their clothes. He had another matter to discuss though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take these,\" he quaked, handing out three little accessories to the trio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are these?\" Sora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I gave them some of my magic. They'll help to make sure you blend into the worlds since I won't be there,\" said Donald, taping his foot a little. \"You do know why, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah, the world order,\" Sora sighed. \"I got it the first time you said it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No you didn't,\" Donald quaked a little louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone got a little laugh at that, before Mickey came over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's about time for us to depart,\" Mickey smiled before offering his hand. \"I wish you all the best Sora, Roxas, Xion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll do it Your Majesty,\" Sora smiled and gave the King a handshake. \"You traveling in a Gummi Ship too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, I've got one I've been using. It's been kind of lonely too, so it'll be nice to have company,\" laughed Mickey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welp, take care Sora!\" Goofy came over and engulfed him in a big hug. \"We'll miss you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll miss you too, Goofy!\" Sora laughed and returned the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you two get one too!\" Goofy laughed as he turned and gave Roxas a big hug, to which he awkwardly returned and smiled all the same. Then he hugged Xion too, who's face went a little red at the close contact, but she eventually returned the hug too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, as a word of advise, the worlds have returned to how they were before thanks to you guys,\" explained Mickey. \"But don't worry, you'll be able to find new pathways to them. Worlds are always tied, just like our hearts. The Keyblade shall be your guide.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May your heart be your guiding key,\" Goofy said, laughing a little. \"I like that line.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I like that too,\" Sora smiled. \"Where did that come from?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's a really old saying among Keyblade Masters. Truthfully not many recite those words,\" Mickey laughed a little. \"But it's very true all the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May your heart be your guiding key....\" Roxas quoted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas felt curious about it. He was pretty self-assured in his own heart, probably more than most Nobodies. And yet, he was basically setting out on the journey as truly his own person. No Organization XIII to give him missions. No forced missions. No more having Sora over his head. In a way of speaking, this was the first time that he actually didn't have a direction, other than knowing he wanted to take the Organization down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his left, he actually heard Xion recite the same words. He smiled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we have a long journey ahead,\" said Roxas to her. \"So, you ready to see where our hearts lead?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXion stared at him, before hanging her head a little. Hearts....was that something she had? The word sounded nice. If Roxas had one, then it'd be nice if she had one too. Somehow it felt like there was a little bit of dread hanging over such a thing in her head, but seeing Roxas looking at her made her feel at ease about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes,\" she said finally, a slightly wider smile forming.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>So, it was finally time to say farewell to Mickey, Donald, and Goofy for now. Granted, Donald continued to take every opportunity he could to make sure Sora knew everything about the Gummi ship controls, to which Sora continued to plead that he got it already. The bickering between the two was pretty amusing in all honesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group gave Master Yen Sid one last wave of farewell before he took his own leave, and they descended down the tower. To the delight of everyone, Pete had been long gone at that point, avoiding another weird confrontation with him. With one last good bye, the Mickey trio were on their way in the King's own ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck!\" called Mickey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too! Bye!\" Sora waved at them, Roxas giving a wave of his own while Xion mostly remained still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, the King's ship flew out of sight, into the ocean between worlds. Sora exhaled a breath. This was really happening. Another adventure, and with his own Nobody at that. Plus....a girl in which he really had zero idea what the relation was. Oh well, like it really mattered. Whoever Xion was, at least she had her own body. All that aside though, there was another thing Sora was rather giddy for. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne last thing before they got on their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how about that practice before we go?\" smiled Sora. \"Got plenty of room for it out here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, why not,\" Roxas smiled back. \"I probably got a little rusty being in you for so long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, it's been only hours since I woke up!\" Sora pouted a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Felt like weeks to me,\" Roxas shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bickering was short-lived before both of them were ready to go. They took the the time to explain to Xion she could have her turn after them. Giving only a slight nod, she waited along the wall of the tower, seemingly content to watch for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>A little time later</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah!\" grunted Sora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tah!\" yelled Roxas right back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two boys had been going back and forth for a little while now, getting a pretty good idea of how the other fought. Granted, it wasn't like there were completely different styles. Many of them shared similar moves, though there were some variances given their different backgrounds. What was also clearly evident was the difference in their attitude, because Roxas was clearly the more aggressive one when it came to direct combat. Sora was overall the more balanced one by comparison. As an added note, Sora wasn't getting into the Drive forms, as they figured it wasn't too necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, and they weren't going too crazy either, as much as Roxas kind of wanted to go deeper into his bag of light-based attacks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta admit, I didn't know you could do that!\" Roxas cried out as he had another Oathkeeper strike blocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short second ago, Roxas thought he had Sora pretty beat when he knocked Kingdom Key away, but Sora called it back to him just in time to block another strike. That caught Roxas off-guard, giving Sora more than enough time to fight back. Sora was actually feeling pretty comfortable now, given his new clothing. It seemed like it wasn't taking too long for him to get back to a respectable level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kind of nice for me to be the smart one for once,\" Sora grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't push your luck,\" Roxas smirked back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, as the two continued their little spar, Xion continued to watch them, taking it all in. Although, the more she watched, the more she seemed to tense up. Seeing two Keyblades clashing against each other.....was making her feel strange for some reason. She cringed a little as her head seemed to throb slightly. She wasn't sure what was going on, but there was a feeling of dread in there. She involuntarily gulped, not sure what to make of these sensations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you got any other of those keychains then?\" Roxas asked Sora as their spar winded down, as neither wanted to exhaust the other too much before they had to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, when I journeyed before, I got loads!\" Sora smiled before it lessened. \"But...it doesn't seem like I have them anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore their spar, Sora had taken a look at his keychains, wanting to remind himself. However, aside from his usual Kingdom Key, there were no others. Granted, he still thankfully had Kairi's charm with him, which still granted Oathkeeper. He even tried it out a little, which made clashing it against Roxas's own a little strange before he swapped it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder why that is. Think it's just a case of you losing them somewhere?\" Roxas asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it was one or two, maybe, but all of them? I doubt it,\" Sora pondered. \"Although, with all that talk of my own memories getting messed up, perhaps that had something to do with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it makes sense,\" Roxas said. \"Back in the Organization, I didn't get Keyblades like that. There was this weird little creature that gave me items to change my Keyblade depending on what I needed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I could have probably used that,\" Sora grinned. \"That could have made my early journey so much easier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh....\" Roxas thought, chuckling a little. Still, Roxas felt a little glad to be away from that, being able to use his Keyblade in the way he liked now. In any case, it was time to move on. Roxas wanted to get Xion involved. \"Hey Xion! Want to go against me next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXion was taken out of her little stupor, nodding slightly as she slowly moved from her little spot against the tower. Sora took a spot over to the side, pretty curious to see his two new companions would do against each other. Roxas kept his Keyblades drawn, while Xion drew her own, taking on a stance that felt instinctively natural. Roxas got himself ready too, feeling more than warmed up now. His dual-wielding style was part of why he was given the Valor power from the fairies, but he needed to get better at it since he wasn't always going to be fighting on adrenaline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I get the feeling we never practiced against each other. Guess we should make up for lost time then,\" Roxas said. At least, he had a feeling they never practiced against each other, though there was something nagging in his brain about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXion actually felt a little strange too, but soon enough their spar got started. Granted, Roxas didn't go all out, as it was clearly evident that Xion was really starting from the bottom here, only striking Roxas with basic blows. At the very least, while her mind was playing catch-up, her body still seemed to remember how to fight. As Wisdom granted, she supposedly had increased magic now, which was evident when she instinctively sent a Fire spell his way, followed up quickly by Thunder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a surprisingly exciting match, at least from Sora's view. Roxas's aggressive fighting style going against Xion's magic was quite something to see. To the two combatants though, they couldn't help but feel something odd about this. Each clash of their Keyblades, every use of magic, each made the other's head spin a little. Little did both know they were seeing the same things. Flashes of various worlds seemed to go through their minds, too fast to make anything out of, yet there was one constant: fighting. And for both, the most distinctive one seemed to be Twilight Town.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Why am I thinking of that?\"</i> thought Roxas. <i>\"And what is this pressure I'm feeling?\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Xion's head was actually going a little haywire. She had similar images to Roxas, yet she seemed to be greater affected by it. She...could tell Roxas was in her images...but....something was wrong...something that made her chest hurt. Seeing Roxas charging at her, something about it made her hands tremble...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Get ready, Roxas!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>STOP HOLDING BACK!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>DING!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Roxas had knocked Xion's Keyblade from her hands, suddenly bringing everything back to the present. Xion wasn't sure what had just happened. What were those words from? It....sounded like her voice...and it mentioned Roxas. Was...there another time they fought or was her brain just playing tricks on her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xion....Hey Xion?!\" Roxas's words eventually cut through the haze in her mind. He was kneeling in front of her, helping to keep her steady. Apparently she had fallen on her back after the attack. \"Are you okay? I didn't go too hard did I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No....I'm....fine....\" Xion said slowly, unaware of the sweat going down her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven this position they were sitting in felt oddly familiar, and for some reason it filled Xion with sadness. She could see Roxas's face, and then it fading from her vision. She didn't know why. There were conflicting feelings, like she wanted something....but it hurt inside to do it....it made no sense really. Absentmindedly, she had lifted her left hand, which was resting on Roxas's check.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas was about to ask what she was doing, and yet he was experiencing similar sensations, like this was familiar. And it felt crushing to do so for some reason. His arm around Xion tensed a little, as if afraid she was going to slip out of it. Eventually though, Xion removed her hand from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry....\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be....it's okay...\" he said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObserving the rather tender moment, Sora wasn't sure what to make of it. Both of them seemed pretty distressed about something. He wished he could but right in and say something, but then again, both of them were dealing with some lost memories of their own. He liked to think maybe they learned something, but they didn't seem happy about it. If anything, they looked really awkward about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, the two of them separated, and all three finished up any last testing out they wanted to do before they got on the Gummi ship. Sora of course lead the charge, giving them the rundown of the place. All the while, he wished he could ask more about what happened. Maybe he could ask Roxas privately.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sora opened the way to the Gummi ship, allowing his friends to come on board. Suffice to say, Roxas and Xion were a little put-off by the blocky ship. Not that they had seen many ships to begin with, but it just looked really....weird to say the least. Not to mention the fact that it wasn't too big either, though maybe that was a good thing. It'd be a little more cozy, at least that's how Sora justified it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome aboard the Highwind,\" Sora grinned as he sat in the big seat. \"Oh, that's my name for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know. I already saw that in your head,\" Roxas said, looking around a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you like know everything about me?\" Sora asked, slightly miffed about that response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not everything. Seeing your memories just came along with joining with you,\" Roxas replied, before smirking slightly. \"Not that I actually wanted to see your memories. I didn't like the fact that I was there to begin with after all.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry,\" Sora replied. Roxas just shook his head, his smile not faltering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't have to say sorry. I can't help the fact that I was kind of mad, but I know it's not your fault,\" he said. \"I have no clue how Xion or I are here, but I'll take it whatever it is. Let's just stick with that and move forward.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it!\" Sora smiled, giving a thumbs up. \"So, ready for take-off?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas took his seat and got buckled in, though they had to give Xion some instructions on what to do. She didn't speak but seemed to be pretty engrossed in the bizarre machine she was in. Once everyone was set, Sora was able to get the ship moving again, giving Roxas and Xion a little shake as they felt a ship moving for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is certainly a lot different than just seeing it in your head,\" Roxas's voice stuttered a little due to the rumbling. Xion's eyes widened slightly at it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora slowly rose it into the air, though it got a little wobbly as he had to remember which direction was which. Once he was high enough to clear the tower, he put it into drive, pushing the Gummi ship forward and out of the world. Given that this was still connected to Twilight Town, Roxas took one last look back. You could just barely make out Twilight Town's distinctive glow from the horizon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That reminds me...those had to be your tears I felt when I got on the train,\" Sora stated out of the blue. Roxas didn't even need to see his eyes to know what he was talking about.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that was probably me. It's funny, considering in the end I didn't really get to know the real Heyner, Pence, and Olette,\" Roxas said sadly. \"Just those digital versions of them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why we have to make sure we return, so we can all hang out!\" Sora grinned. \"You, me, and Xion too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me?\" Xion cocked her head slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"True. I'm sure they'd like having you around too,\" Roxas replied with a smile of his own. Despite not really knowing what or who they were talking about, Xion smiled slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Sora gave the Highwind another boost, and the ship was flung into the ocean between worlds. Unbeknownst to them though, a familiar shadow was growing in the old tower, one that forced the three good fairies to flee for safety. An old enemy was making her return, to which she could only laugh at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>Ocean Between Worlds</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say it was a startling sight would be an understatement. Despite seeing some of it in Sora's heart, witnessing basically outer space was stunning to Roxas. To think that, while he was already doing through the Organization's dark corridors to get from world to world, he was missing out on this the whole time. Probably took longer, but who could deny the view. The stars formed so many constellations, forms of space dust carved out myriad forms, and all the while, there were lights flying around like shooting stars.. Over to his left, Xion had no words, mouth just left wide open at the sight. Taking a brief glance at her, Roxas couldn't help but stifle a little laugh. She was reaching her hand out, as if trying to grab one of those stars herself. There was a certain brightness in her eyes. Who knows if it was from the stars or something else, but when Roxas's eyes met hers for a second as they looked, he couldn't help but feel himself drawn in before she turned away again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora didn't miss that though, actually grinning throughout the whole thing. These two seemed to have quite a lot of baggage going on that neither one could remember, but there seemed to be some sort of affection in there, and he wanted to see more of that. Probably best to not do that in space though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like it?\" Sora smiled. \"I couldn't believe it myself seeing it for the first time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just...can't believe there's all this between the worlds,\" Roxas said. \"I think I prefer it to the dark corridors.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are those like?\" Sora asked out of curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, they're dark...and kind of cold honestly,\" Roxas. \"Granted the coats kind of helped against that. I never thought too much about it before. You probably wouldn't like it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not, but who knows,\" Sora grinned as he leaned back in his chair. \"In any case....guess we're not going to be traveling too far. There's only one world on the monitor.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the wondrous sight, Sora was right as they could only see one world in their vision. However, Roxas was quick to point out that it looked familiar, and Sora was able to catch on it too. So, with that in mind, Sora get the Highwind in that direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Roxas,\" Sora asked over while Xion was still observing the sights. \"What happened during the spar? When you and Xion had your moment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Roxas tilted his head until Sora's meaning got through to him. \"Oh that.....I'm not sure myself honestly. My head just felt weird as we were fighting, and she was looking a little distressed for some reason. I can't say for sure, but it was like every clash of our Keyblades was bringing something else to mind. And the truth is...I'm not sure if I like it. When we were sitting in that position, I had a sense that we had done that before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Sora asked. \"But you didn't like it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It just....feels like it's related to something bad in our pasts,\" Roxas said. \"Perhaps that's related to why my memories regarding her are still scrambled up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see....well hopefully we can bring those back as we journey,\" Sora said. \"You went to many worlds, right? Perhaps we'll run into some you guys went to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That'd be nice,\" Roxas nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awesome. So, what about......?\" Just as Sora was about to get a little deeper regarding his thoughts with Roxas and Xion, said girl was pointing her right index finger forward, seemingly as calm as ever. \"Xion, what's up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rock....\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Sora asked before turning forward, his eyes widening. \"Uh oh!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy rock, she meant asteroid. And yeah, there were a lot of those too, many of which Sora apparently hadn't thought about when charting the ship's course. Acting a little frantically, he grabbed the controls, getting a little clumsy with how he operated it. Many of the asteroids in front of them were huge, and Sora was having trouble keeping the right controls in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hang on!\" he cried out, pulling the ship up as it circled around the huge asteroid, only for another huge one to appear. Sora rapidly veered to the right, making the ship spin as their bearings were getting off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you said you could drive this!\" Roxas cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, nobody's perfect!\" Sora retorted, now struggling to get the Highwind up right again. \"I just need to find how to....uh....get this thing upright again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, if you're going to be clueless about it, I ought to drive!\" Roxas said impulsively, even getting out of his seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way! I still know more than you!\" Sora stated back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what you know is going to crash us at this rate!\" Roxas said back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis resulted in a further tussle that had the Hindwind going every which way around asteroids. If not the internal gravity offered by the ship, Roxas would have been tossed into the glass dome of the ship multiple times over. The two boys continued yelling over the controls, while miraculously staying clear of oncoming rocks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXion stayed completely silent over this, though if you were to look closely, you see her hands gripping her seat belt, knuckles turning white all the while.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>Hollow Bastion</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That....could have gone better,\" Sora groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio landed the Highwind just outside of town, all three a little worse for wear. Sora and Roxas looked like they had been thrown through the ringer, somewhat literally in Roxas's case. While Xion wasn't very vocal about it, it was clear she was in distress herself, part of her face turning a sickly green. Had there been anything in her stomach, she probably would have hurled thanks to the boy's \"driving\" if one could call it that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, they got their bearings as quickly as they could, walking into town. Sora couldn't quite put his finger on why the place seemed familiar, until he saw the giant castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Hollow Bastion!\" Sora cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you're right,\" Roxas said, remembering the castle from Sora's memories. \"I don't remember the town though. That had been swallowed up by darkness, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was,\" Sora said. \"Maybe Leon and the others have returned home by now. You remember them, too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.....I'm a little vague on that. I...think you met them early on?\" Roxas questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, I met them soon after Desiny Islands fell and I wound up in Traverse Town,\" Sora smiled. \"Come on, let's go see.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that, they had arrived in another world.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>All three members of the crew descended down the steps entering town. Roxas had already made note of the Heartless he noticed a minute earlier, making sure the others knew as well. There were a decent amount of people around, many seemingly oblivious to anything around them, which was fine enough for the trio. Along the way though, they came across someone, a duck that reminded Sora of Donald. It was actually Donald's Uncle Scrooge, who seemed to be quite the businessman judging by his attitude. All his talk of ice cream got Roxas really thinking though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm....I kind of miss ice cream...\" he mumbled. Sora raised an eyebrow while Xion muttered a little herself, even putting a hand to her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good memories?\" Sora inquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Axel and I would get ice cream all the time back in Twilight Town,\" Roxas smiled, then frowned a little. \"I....I'm pretty sure Xion joined us too...but that's kind of blurry right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah,\" nodded Sora before he smiled as well. \"Well I'd be down for that. A nice break every now and then would be nice. I didn't get much of a chance to take a break last time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh,\" chuckled Roxas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they kept walking through the marketplace, they occasionally noticed some sort of orb thing appearing and vanishing throughout the area, confusing all of them. As Sora was wondering that though, a female voice shouted to him that it was the town's defense mechanism. Sora smiled at the voice though, remembering it as Yuffie's own. Sadly, the reunion was cut a little bit short by the appearance of some Dusks. It would essentially be the first real fight for the trio on their journey, so it would be good for real experience. Nothing too special was necessary to take on the Dusks, with Sora and Roxas both going through the majority of them while Xion was still working on catching up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing this brief battle, Sora finally got to introduce Roxas and Xion to Yuffie, to which the ninja greeted them excitedly. Sora and Yuffie did share a brief laugh at a little imitation he did of Leon, a joke pretty much only they got. Roxas just smiled and shrugged while Xion stood by. Following that, Yuffie got them all over to a house nearby, letting them all inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meet the Hollow Bastion Restoration Committee!\" she cheered dramatically, something Sora really seemed to get into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeon, Cid, and Aerith all turned around to greet Sora, happy to once again see the boy they had met in Traverse Town over a year ago. Likewise, Sora was glad to catch up, introducing his two new friends. They had wondered where Donald and Goofy went, to which Sora explained that they were on a new mission. After that, Roxas introduced himself, where as Xion just mumbled her name and ended up walking behind Sora and Roxas. Seeing so many new faces made her really wish she had her hood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXion's introduction however brought particular attention to her, catching everyone a little off guard. Even Yuffie didn't notice it immediately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that Kairi? Your friend from last time?\" asked Leon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question made Xion tilt her head a little bit. That name sounded familiar too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh her? Nah, she's not Kairi,\" Sora laughed a little sheepishly, looking to Roxas. \"She's.....a relative I guess?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you looking at me?\" Roxas asked. \"How would I know that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you know her better than I do,\" Sora retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hollow Bastion crew was justifiably confused at the trio's odd reaction, though they were willing to take Sora's word for it if he was sure. That did have all three of them wondering what that reason was though. She couldn't be Kairi's Nobody, since it was already said that was Namine. So where did Xion come in to the picture? Somehow it felt like the more they went on, the more questions they got. Roxas and Xion both couldn't help but figure they knew why for some reason, where as Sora wasn't even sure where to begin. In any case, they decided to drop it for now. To reason to drag in a potentially delicate subject if it would be avoided.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora got a little indignant when they mentioned they only just now recently remembered him, though the whole memory thing that he knew about that made it more understandable to him. It did make Roxas frown a little though. The fact that so many people suffered from incomplete memories over the past year, not just him or Xion or others. Still, at least now hopefully things could begin to feel more like normal. In any case, it wasn't long before Leon asked if they could help out a little bit. Sora quickly signed them up for it before anyone could object, making Roxas sigh. The guy didn't even give it two seconds before deciding to help. Such an act got a \"sort-of\" compliment from Leon about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter basically becoming honorary members of the committee, rather humorously as they mentioned they originally had cards for Donald and Goofy, they got a visit from Merlin. It was kind of bewildering to already be associated with so many people, and this was just their first world after Twilight Town. Apparently, the old wizard was also familiar with how one of Sora's companions looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That you Ven, my boy?\" Merlin asked. \"My, it's been years and you don't look like you've aged a day. And did you change your hair, Kairi? Why are so many of you youngin's going for the goth look these days? That is the \"hip\" word around, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not again....my name's Roxas,\" Roxas groaned. Was this going to be a recurring theme? He and Xion constantly having to explain how they look? \"I'm not Ven. I just look like him. Don't ask why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name's Xion....\" Xion said softly, somewhat copying Roxas's reply. All this Kairi talk didn't seem to be making her feel much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's complicated,\" Sora tried to say. \"But just...think of him as my brother instead of Ven. And Xion's like a relative of hers....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMerlin seemed confused, of which no one could blame him. \"Well, if you're sure Sora, I won't push it further.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, out of respect for the trio's privacy and to get back to why he was really here, he wanted to touch up on Sora's magic. Guess that had also been returned to rock bottom because of his sleep. In light of that, Merlin graciously allowed Sora to touch up on basic spells again. Roxas smirked at that, thinking that he might as well. Didn't want to make Xion do all the magic work, which made Sora indignant again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, after saying good bye to Merlin for a bit, Sora noted that they had to head to the bailey to meet up with Leon. Thanks to getting a new map, it wasn't too hard to find where Leon went. Along the way though, there were certainly more than enough Heartless around, giving the group more than a good workout. Sora utilized the chance to get caught up on his magic, although his own Blizzard spell was outshined by Xion's own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, I'm really going to have to catch up,\" Sora grinned after their brief scuffle was done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well Xion and I have actually been fighting over the past year while you were asleep,\" shrugged Roxas. \"So I guess it makes sense we might be a little further ahead. Granted, I still feel like I really need to get better myself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess we'll both work on it then,\" Sora smiled. Right then though, he stiffened as a veil of green light surrounded him, feeling the familiar sensation of Cure. He looked over to Xion, who was indeed casting the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your arm looked bruised....\" Xion said softly. \"So....I thought I'd try....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? Didn't even notice,\" Sora said, winding up his arm to try it out a little. \"But hey, it's as good as new. Thanks Xion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome....\" Xion smiled a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the trio continued on their way, taking out what Heartless they needed. One particularly nasty bunch caught them a little off-guard, making Sora shift into Guardian Form for the first time in battle. It was clearly a defense-oriented form, with an emphasis on protection over outright offense or magic. Thankfully, it made pretty good use of Sora's mobility, which he had plenty of. Sora even got the chance to joke that Roxas and Xion could just stand behind him and he'd plow through them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh good. Less work for us,\" Roxas smirked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice try,\" Sora returned the look. The little exchange got a little smile out of Xion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they made their over to where Leon wanted them to be. Looking out over the distance, they got a good look at the castle Sora explored on his first trip: Hollow Bastion itself. Leon made a note of how they wanted to restore the place to its former glory, perhaps even grander than that. However, one little problem was clear: the horde of Heartless that surrounded the castle. Plus, Leon pointed them towards some silver creatures: Dusks headed towards the castle themselves. Sora made sure to relay to Leon what potential troubles they may face. There was Pete, but he was too dumb to be considered a threat. The Nobodies were the true threat here, along with Organization XIII.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"You called?\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA booming voice echoed over the area, making everyone jump a little. Roxas's face immediately turned sour. That was Xemnas, no doubt about it. Just hearing the Superior's voice caused a fire to be lit inside him. Full memories or no, he knew Xemnas was primarily at fault for whatever happened to this point. If he was here, and they could defeat him, that would eliminate so many of their problems. He wasn't alone this time. He had Sora and Xion with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xemnas.....they're here,\" Roxas said seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpeaking of whom, Xion seemed particularly tense. Hearing that voice sent goosebumps down her skin, like some dark sensation coming from the depths of her mind. Hearing Roxas speak that name immediately gave Xion a mental image: a silver-haired man looking down at her from atop a white throne.</span></div></div>",

Consider this our welcoming.\"</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas immediately recognized Sa\u00efx's voice, followed by Xemnas's again. So, was the whole Organization hanging around somewhere? That would make things pretty convenient not going to lie. If they could just take out one of them, that could make things so much easier. Xemnas was likely out of their league, but surely the three of them couldn't take on one of them, right? He knew these guys pretty well over the past year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They know we're with you,\" Roxas told Sora. \"They must be watching from somewhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it,\" nodded Sora, looking everywhere for them. However, his attention was soon drawn to the Dusks appearing. \"Looks like we got to take care of these first though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Leon's help, protecting the gate wasn't too hard between the three Keyblade wielders, though Roxas couldn't help but feel like this was too easy. They were being toyed with as far as he could tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, show yourself!\" Sora cried out as the last Dusk fell, a bit tired of it as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, up on the ledge above the Keyblade wielders, a man in a dark coat emerged from the darkness. After a rather dramatic motion, five more coats appeared. Roxas could remember some details about them, but had to deduce that they were Demyx, Xaldin, Sa\u00efx, Xigbar, and Luxord. Axel would be pretty obvious, especially since he almost never had his hood up to begin with. Roxas wondered where he was at this time, but that would be for another time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good! Now we can settle this!\" Sora cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A shame.....and here I thought we could be good friends,\" said the first cloaked figure, Xemnas obviously. His voice lacked any sense of emotion, very much like Yen Sid's definition of a Nobody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, another cloaked figure approached Xemnas. Probably Sa\u00efx if Roxas had to guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No doubt about it. That is Roxas alongside Sora,\" said Sa\u00efx. \"Quite unusual, for a Nobody to exist alongside his original.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fascinating development,\" Xemnas replied, apparently no less intrigued by this development. \"It makes one wonder....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To my knowledge, only a replica would make such a thing possible. But we were sure the remainder of Vexen's experiments were lost in Castle Oblivion.\" replied Sa\u00efx.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The method hardly matters now. All that matters is how things are,\" said Xemnas. \"We are graced by three Keyblades now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom underneath their hoods, Xamnas and Sa\u00efx looked down upon the group. While Sora and Roxas continued to glare at the two, Xion's face was quite the opposite. For some reason, looking at those two cloaked figures filled her with uneasiness. A bead of sweat came down the side of her head, a sign of agitation that she did not understand. Something was familiar to her about these men, and she didn't like it. Her Keyblade trembled slightly in her hands. Speaking of Xion, her presence didn't go unnoticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSa\u00efx eyed the black-haired girl, his stern face growing even more so. That girl...she had a Keyblade too. Something was familiar about her. He doubted there was a wielder of the Keyblade that they'd be completely in the dark about. And, perhaps similar to Xion, something agitated him too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That girl is also curious,\" said Sa\u00efx. \"I doubt we somehow missed the existence of another Keyblade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe she must be related to this as well. To Sora,\" said Xemnas. \"I believe this mystery will clear itself up in time. However, I am most curious. Xigbar, go entertain them for a while. Use whatever means you wish.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? You mean I get to play a little rough?\" another cloaked figure spoke up. You could just feel a sneer from underneath. \"You don't mind your precious Keyblades getting a little dinged up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Between the three of them, I doubt we need to worry,\" said Xemnas. \"It'll only motivate them further.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever you say boss,\" replied Xigbar, seeming pretty pleased with this. Now he could see some things for himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trio could only wonder what the cloaked figures were talking about. Sora and Roxas were both anxious to get this going, while Xion couldn't help but look back and forth between them and the figures. Before long though, the figures began to disappear, surprising Sora and Roxas. However, before they could do much about it, a portal opened up about in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, did I get in your way?\" the figure taunted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move!\" Sora said simply, the tension in his body no less settled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now isn't that kind of rude? Shutting me down like that?\" the figure continued to act in mock disappointment. \"And here we just came to chat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He said move, Xigbar,\" Roxas stepped forward, Oathkeeper and Oblivion drawn. \"So why don't you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh....As if, Roxas. Nice to see you again by the way,\" Xigbar chuckled, finally pulling his cloak down, revealing his eye-patched face and long brown and silver hair to the group. \"Talk is pretty cheap. It won't change a thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora piped up a little at seeing Xigbar's face for the first time, while Xion continued to be antsy. This guy felt just like the others to her, someone she felt like she didn't want to be anywhere near. Seeing Xigbar's face, she could even see it in her mind. From what, she couldn't tell, but it wasn't good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not in the mood to catch up,\" Roxas stated. \"I'd prefer to get Xemnas out of the way, but I guess you'll have to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've shove you aside if we have to,\" Sora butted back in. \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, if I were any old dude, that might work,\" Xigbar chuckled again. \"But we in the Organization are a cut above the rest.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Says the guy who sat back on the sidelines and let the flunkies do the work for him,\" Sora smirked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy.....Roxas, have you been letting him get a bad impression of us?\" Xigbar once again said in mock disappointment. \"The kid's got some misconceptions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I remember you sitting back a lot of the time myself while I did your dirty work,\" Roxas smirked as well. \"So I'd say it's pretty fair.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gonna cry about it?\" replied Sora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if!\" Xigbar smirked again, clearly not put off by Sora and Roxas's tag-team taunting. \"Maybe I should remind you both of who you're really dealing with here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith those words, Sora and Roxas both got to their ready positions, glaring at Xigbar as if waiting for an attack. Xion on the other hand, while standing a little behind the boys, felt this sensation to get them away from the man. This....this was trouble. Somehow seeing Sora and Roxas go against Xigbar filled her with dread. She couldn't figure why but....the only word she could think of was that she was scared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Xigbar just began laughing, making both Sora and Roxas raise their eyebrows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahaha! You both got that same angry look!\" he laughed. \"Reminds me of another fellow I used to know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you knock it off with the talk?!\" Sora replied back, now actually feeling irritated. \"Saying stuff like that isn't going to psych us out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who knows. You never know unless you try,\" Xigbar chuckled again. \"Still, I am here to have a little fun myself. Boss's permission after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, out of Xigbar's hands came his signature arrowguns: Sharpshooter. Roxas of course already know how they operated. He actually already tried to give Sora at least some of the things he knew about the Organization's fighting styles, at least as much as he knew them from his missions with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know Roxas, it really is nice to see you again,\" Xigbar chuckled, guns at the ready. \"Not entirely sure how, but it must be nice to live alongside your original.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I said I don't want to catch up,\" Roxas was beginning to growl a little. Sheesh did this guy like to talk. \"How I'm here doesn't matter. I am my own person.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roxas....don't...\" Finally taking some action, Xion came behind Roxas, putting her hand on his left arm. \"Don't.....You and Sora...shouldn't....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xion?\" Roxas questioned. Why did she seem really nervous? Didn't seem to be the type from what memories he had of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, that's touching Roxas. You went and got yourself a girlfriend too. You're moving up in the world,\" Xigbar grinned. \"Girl looks familiar too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting a better look at the girl was giving Xigbar the same impression Xemnas and Sa\u00efx got. There was just something about her that got Xigbar thinking. Even weirder though was that, for the briefest of seconds, over the girl's form stood an image of a boy Xigbar very much remembered. The connected between that wasn't really apparent to him, and yet it excited him all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roxas and Xion aren't yours to control anymore,\" Sora got back into the conversation, ever eager to stand up for them. \"The three of us will stop whatever you're planning.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sora...don't....\" Xion again spoke, putting her remaining hand on Sora's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xion....heh, doesn't ring any bells but the name's kind of catchy,\" Xigbar grinned again. \"Maybe something will jog my memory.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>By this point, Roxas was really irritated. The talking had gone on too long. Who cared what Xigbar thought about them or whatever? Beat him down here and that's one problem off the list. Simple as that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's it. I've had it with your talking!\" Roxas growled, clashing his blades together. \"Your last chance before I come for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was determined to end this right now. No more having to deal with this guy's constant talking. Roxas was ready, any feelings of hesitation long gone now. He began to take steps forward, distancing himself from Sora....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil he felt Xion's grip on his arm tighten, further shown by both of her hands clasped around it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xion?\" he questioned, looking into her eyes, seeing....fear was it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Run....get away from here....run....You have to stop him!\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWords of that nature began to flow through Xion's head, with those last ones in particular feeling kind of familiar. Something about fighting them terrified her, or perhaps she was terrified of what they'd do to Roxas or Sora. Somehow, the idea of Roxas charging into a hopeless situation felt familiar to her, like she had told someone to stop him from getting himself hurt. It was all a mess of things that didn't connect in her head, but she could tell one thing. She couldn't let Roxas fight him. She couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sora...stop him....\" she spoke, turning back to Sora, who looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Me?\" he asked. Why was she asking him? Did she not want either of them to fight? Sora looked back and forth between Roxas and Xion: one clearly looking like he wanted to fight, and the other looking like she wanted to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem a little conflicted,\" Xigbar chuckled again. \"Must be troublesome having something anchoring you back like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xion....let me go...now,\" Roxas said, sternly looking back. He felt like he needed to do this. There was no reason not to in his mind. He didn't get why Xion wouldn't let him fight, and to be honest, it was irritating him a little. \"We can take him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you can't,\" Xion said, perhaps in the clearest voice she had since coming back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know kiddo, maybe she's right. You can't do it,\" Xigbar chimed in, before his grin grew even wider. \"Really, you can't do anything. Can't do your job right. Can't keep your buddies safe. No wonder you've gotten into so many messes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Roxas's temper was really flaring. Can't do this. Can't do that. It was like before all over again. Why did someone always have to have an opinion on him? The powers in his clothes were beginning to come to life, reacting to his agitated state. There was just one thing on his mind: putting Xigbar in his place, and no one was going to stop him. Not even his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me go!\" he spat out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXion didn't speak but her hold didn't break, tugging even harder as he kept on resisting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe you should just face the music kiddo....\" Xigbar smirked once more. \"At the end of the day...you're just a weakling, always enslaved to something...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"THAT\"S IT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt last, Roxas finally snapped, his powers flaring up as he shrugged Xion off his arm. However, against his notice, the force from this action was greater than he would have figured, due to the increase in his powers. Xion cried a bit as she was thrown off his arm, actually going airborne for a bit before landing hard on the stone floor, her head actually bouncing pretty badly off the ground. Sora cried her name as he came over to her, while Roxas charged forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hahahahaha!\" Xigbar laughed at the sight, as Roxas's blades made impact with his guns. \"Finally ready for some fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to kick your butt is more like it!\" Roxas spat out as he slashed out one of his blades, pushing Xigbar up into the air as he began to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXion whimpered a little bit as she began to sit up, her head feeling more scrambled than it was before. Sora had actually run over to her side, asking if she was okay. She gave a little nod, nursing her throbbing head as she put a hand up to cast Cure on it. As she did though, she felt something there, bringing her hand down to show a little bit of blood. The impact probably scrapped her head a little, nothing that would be hard to heal. Though, the physical discomfort wasn't what concerned her. Her thoughts were still on Roxas, her eyes looking up to keep track of his form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Xion....\" Sora mumbled a little, looking up to see Roxas. He wondered if he should go up and fight too, but then he'd be leaving Xion on her own. Then again, Roxas knew all about the Organization. He could probably handle it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas continued to slash after slash on Xigbar, trying not to give the gun user even a chance to fire back. Given how much Xigbar liked his range, Roxas figured keeping things up close and personal would be a natural counter to that. Plus, he'd seen how he fought during missions together. He figured as long as he could keep Xigbar's spacial powers in check, he'd have an advantage. The two fighters bounced from rooftop to rooftop, with Roxas doing the majority of fighting while Xigbar tried to get in shots while he could. He seemed to be struggling though, making Roxas smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. I'm faster than he is,\" he said, his blades shining a bit. Getting back into the swing of things with his light powers was coming along slowly, but he figured he had enough for what he needed. He surrounded Xigbar with pillars of light, ramming each into him one by one. Some he dodged, but others went right into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh!\" Xigbar groaned, being sent back by the force of the pillars.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I got you!\" Roxas cried out, jumping right up to deliver another combo on him. There was something really gratifying about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora was honestly amazed. Roxas really was fast, and it really showed how skilled he was over his time in the Organization. Heck, perhaps he could take on one himself. Sora actually began to cheer him on, still remaining by Xion's side just in case she needed help. Xion didn't move or speak, having completed the healing on her head, which was still sore. Her eyes never left Roxas, not exactly sharing the same enthusiasm Sora had. Even in the haziness of her head, she just knew this was a bad idea. Something just kept telling her that he was in mortal danger right now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas once again sent Xigbar into the air, having deflected some arrowshots. Some grazed him but nothing that could stop him. After Xigbar blocked a strike, Roxas brought his leg around to strike him, sending Xigbar flying backwards again. He was feeling it now. This time, he can end it for sure. He thrust forward, right over Xigbar's flying form. Another strike and he could bring this fight to a close.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, all he got was a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I really did hope we could have some fun,\" said Xigbar, bringing his head up as the two were still flying over houses. \"But I suppose you don't have much left.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Roxas cried out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Roxas was gasping out, a knee getting thrust into his back from Xigbar who had rapidly teleported behind him. That was a lot faster than he had been teleporting during their fight. In fact, Roxas hadn't even seen him move. A blink and he was no longer there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since Sora seems perfectly fine, I'm guessing you still ended up giving him the power you were borrowing,\" spoke Xigbar. \"While I'm not sure how you're existing on your own, it's pretty clear to me that you aren't nearly as fast or strong as you were before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Roxas turned around and slashed, to which Xigbar blacked and gave him a point blank shot that forced him to land on his back on a roof. \"I can't be.....but Axel....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe fought Axel back before, and Axel couldn't have been holding back much if at all, so Roxas had no reason to believe that he was any weaker. Although....that fight with Axel did come before he went back to Sora....no....that couldn't be true could it? He didn't feel weaker, though if his attacks had really been doing nothing to Xigbar then.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess Sora must have taken a lot of you with him,\" Xigbar chuckled, reloading his guns. \"Before you were decently tough. Now you better feel any tougher than Dusks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't compare me to those!\" Roxas cried back, readying his blades again as he steadied himself. \"I'm way better!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\" Xigbar clucked his tongue a little, motioning over to where Sora and Xion were. \"You remember how you even got into this fight? What you did to your girl down there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? What did I....?\" Roxas trailed off a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over to where Xion sat, her eyes still fixated on him. However, upon looking closer, Roxas could notice a couple things. Her hand looked like it had blood on it, and he could make out what was at least a bruise underneath her dark hair. When did she get that? She was just fine before. With that, his mind flashed back to what just happened a while ago, when he threw her off his arm to jump into battle. He didn't intend to really do more than shrug her off. Did he do that....?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No....I didn't mean to...\" Roxas said to himself, becoming increasingly guilt-ridden at what he seemed to have done in his enraged state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not very heroic you might say,\" Xigbar chuckled. \"First you betray us, and then you toss her to the side. Perhaps you need a little lesson in how to be a man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do..UGH!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs quickly as he could think, Roxas suddenly felt Xigbar's knee in his gut, before a follow-up attack sent him flying into the roof of another house. Staggering back to his feet, Roxas suddenly felt bullet after bullet raining down upon him, hitting just about everywhere on the roof and on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't give up on me now, kiddo,\" Xigbar sneered darkly. \"I'm just now getting into the swing of things.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sora groaned as he watched Roxas begin to get pelted. Had that guy been holding back this whole time? Roxas looked like he had him on the ropes, and now things had gone the opposite way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We need to help him!\" Sora said, bringing his Keyblade back out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, before he or Xion could move, Xigbar fired some shots in their direction, seeming to be intentionally miss them. It made Sora pause, having to brace himself a little before being able to look back up. Xigbar chuckled as he went back to Roxas, teleporting left and right as Roxas tried to get hits in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let me guess, you figured you'd have a chance based on seeing our skills on missions?\" Xigbar asked rhetorically before bashing Roxas again. \"As if! Going all out on the small fry would have just been a waste.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMany things were going through Roxas's head, too much for him to process in the middle of battle. Not only Xigbar, but also worrying about Xion's condition. The one he caused at that. Just thinking about it was making him feel a little sick. Well, again, he didn't get much chance to think on it before Xigbar was once again firing bullet after bullet, forcing Roxas to have to dodge again. However, he was pretty banged up from Xigbar's previous attempts, to the point where he was limping a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, figures,\" Xigbar said. \"Guess that's all you're good for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrr......\" Roxas groaned a little. \"I'll....get you...sometime...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh heh, maybe,\" Xigbar chuckled, dispelling his guns. \"But, before we wrap this up...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust like that, Xigbar zoomed in front of Roxas, kicking him down to the ground in front of Sora and Xion. Xion gasped slightly at the sight of Roxas's beat-up form, even as he tried to get up again. Sora came over to help him sit up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You alright?\" Sora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh....can't say I am....\" Roxas groaned, feeling a little too weak to fully stand now. Xigbar grinned as he stood around where he did before the fight started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I thank you for the lovely time together,\" he said. \"I figure now you know who you're up against. You're going to have to get a loooot better than that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just watch!\" Sora said back. \"We'll get stronger, and then you'll be eating your words.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, I look forward to it, kiddo,\" Xigbar chuckled, as darkness began to surround him. \"Catch you later!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd like that, Xigbar's form disappeared, leaving the trio alone once again. Compared to the good feeling they had taking care of the Heartless and Nobodies before, all three of them felt a sense of defeat. Roxas, of course, felt it more than any of them. He just got totally outplayed, pulled into something he probably could have avoided had he actually kept a cool head. It was his fault Xigbar was able to push his buttons so easily, not to mention....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon enough, Roxas felt green energy surrounding, an obvious sign of Cure. He gasped a little, looking over to his right to see Xion's hands out, using her magic on him. Her face was indescribable, so Roxas couldn't tell at all what she was thinking or feeling. Still, it reminded him of how guilty he felt. Unintentional or not, he hurt someone he considered a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why....?\" Roxas asked softly, not sure if it was directed at anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're....hurt...,\" Xion spoke just as softly, letting her magic work as much as it could. At least it could get Roxas on his feet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora wasn't sure what to say to his two companions, as much as he would have loved to say something funny or encouraging. The right words just never seemed to come. He had so many questions in his head: the nature of Organization XIII, and what had happened between these two in the past. Still, that wouldn't stop him from being there to support them as best he could. With that said though, he did have a job to do himself. Something was calling to him, something he was already familiar with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe excused himself from the two for a bit, bringing his Keyblade out. The blade began to shine, forming a familiar symbol as Sora began to see a giant keyhole in the sky. Letting the motions go through him, he aimed his blade high, the light striking the keyhole and making it shine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it now....\" Sora mumbled. \"That must be one the gates Yen Sid talked about. Maybe we can go to other worlds now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you gotta run again?\" asked Leon, who had been taking care of his tasks while Roxas and Xigbar fought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We probably should. Other worlds are calling,\" Sora said resolutely, though it lessened when he looked at his friends. \"Although, it might be a while until we're really good to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in that case, why not at least spend the night with us?\" Leon offered. \"It looks like you've had a busy day. Best to rest and make sure you're good to go.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Leon. I think we'll take you up on that,\" Sora smiled, before turning to the others. \"You two okay with that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...I'm okay with it,\" Roxas sighed as Xion's magic left him. \"I probably shouldn't go anywhere like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXion just gave a little nod of acknowledgement as the trio got together with Leon to head back to the hangout, all eager to just be able to sit down for a bit. Heavy thoughts followed each of them on their way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*The White Room*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe members of Organization XIII had returned to their giant gathering room, each giving their own thoughts on their first real encounter with Sora, the Keyblade's chosen. Xaldin wasn't too impressed, given he was just a boy, though Xigbar, upon coming in later, was quick to mock that. Sora was pure of heart, certainly unlike the majority of them. The remaining members squabbled a bit over the boy, with Luxord wondering if he'd made for a good game while Demyx just casually wrote it all off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sora aside, how could he be complete while Roxas lives?\" Xaldin asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite curious,\" said Luxord as he was shuffling through his cards. \"Perhaps another player has entered the game.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only possibility would be if there was a vessel for him to occupy,\" said Sa\u00efx. \"Roxas surely would have lost his form upon returning to Sora, and a body doesn't just form from nothing. The only thing that would fulfill that role would be a replica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You talking about those toys from Castle Oblivion?\" Luxord asked casually, not even looking at them. \"Weren't all of Vexen's experiments lost when he was destroyed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which makes one wonder how we have arrived at this point,\" said Sa\u00efx. \"Vexen could be unpredictable. It's possible something of his could be behind this. I believe we should seek out this answer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps that answer will come in time,\" Xemnas's booming voice spoke out. \"However, one way or another, it means there are three keys out there to complete Kingdom Hearts. Our plans haven't changed. They will seek out the worlds, and in turn fulfill our goals as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep, they can't very well ignore the worlds,\" Xigbar chuckled. \"No no, there's no way they can resist that. The only alternative would be to take us out before that could happen, and I'd say they very much doubt their ability to do that right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I saw that whole fight!\" Demyx waved his arms around. \"Seriously dude, you played him like a drum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, wasn't that hard to bait him. I'd say he knows his place now,\" said Xigbar. \"Probably felt a little too cocky after Axel failed to get him back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Axel....we'll have to deal with him too,\" Xaldin spoke. \"He never returned after his mission.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh he'll have his time eventually,\" spoke Sa\u00efx coldly, closing his eyes a little. \"While we're on the subject, that girl Sora and Roxas were with.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She was quite a looker,\" laughed Demyx. \"Could swear she looks familiar though. Can't put my finger on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I too felt odd looking at her,\" said Xaldin. \"A certain familiarity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a coincidence, so did I!\" Xigbar said dramatically. \"Who knows, maybe we're all forgetting something. You all saw it. She had his Keyblade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Xemnas watched his underlings talk, he mused to himself. The girl struck a chord with him as well. He got the sense that she wasn't totally unrelated somehow. Xigbar was right that the girl possessed a Keyblade that only Sora or his own Nobody, Roxas, would have. That could only mean she was related, and the idea intrigued him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I believe we should keep an eye on the girl,\" spoke Xemnas. \"Roxas may be beyond our reach now, but perhaps she might prove useful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great...more work...\" groaned Demyx, sliding in his seat a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So many wild cards. Fascinating,\" muttered Luxord. \"More players makes the game more fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group began another round of talking amongst themselves. Sa\u00efx turned to Xemnas however.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must ask, why did you allow Xigbar to fight them?\" asked Sa\u00efx to Xemnas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't the plan at first. I merely intended to make our presence known to Sora,\" said Xemnas. \"However, seeing him and his new companions, I admit I was curious to see them tested a little. So I allowed Xigbar the chance to show our former comrade his place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, and I quite enjoyed the chance,\" snickered Xigbar. \"Poor sap didn't know what hit him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As long as you didn't harm them beyond repair,\" spoke Sa\u00efx. \"We require them for more than your own fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah whatever,\" shrugged Xigbar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gentlemen...,\" Xemnas spoke again. \"Regardless of the circumstances, the chosen of the Keyblade has set forth on a new adventure. So make sure it is one he will remember.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roger boss,\" Xigbar mock saluted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the members acknowledged their orders before leaving one by one. Sa\u00efx took his own leave to attend to his own matters, leaving the Superior by himself. All alone, he chuckled hollowly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my, what curious circumstances,\" he mused. \"Three wielders sharing the same Keyblade.\"</span></div></div>",

It made for some nice casual time, something the trio hadn't had really since this all started. Plus, it kind of helped to finally get some food and rest, something that was further punctuated when Xion's stomach growled, getting a good laugh out of most around and making the girl just want to hide somewhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat being said, all three of them couldn't forget their encounter with Organization XIII. Sora was amazed by how strong they seemed to be, though he wasn't letting that get him down. They HAD to defeat them, there was no maybe there. To that end, he was staying positive while also trying to cheer up his friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't let it get you down! Next time we'll show them,\" Sora said as he handed each of them a plate of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah....\" Roxas muttered while Xion wordlessly nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the battle done, Xion's head was back to being hazy. It felt like any emotion she needed only came when it was necessary, and now that everyone was safe, her head had returned to being a mess. Still, what happened earlier had stayed in her mind. She wasn't upset that Roxas hurt her by accident. She knew he wasn't that type. No, the lingering effects of how she felt then were disturbing her. The fear she felt as Roxas was fighting. Why was she so afraid? She couldn't figure that out, but it weighed her down all the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas on the other hand felt the worst out of all of them. Not just that he got completely played by Xigbar, but the very fact that he hurt Xion like that. It felt so unlike him, and yet that's what he did. He felt like he could barely look her in the eye after what he did. It was to that end that he sat by himself as he ate. On that note though, Leon had kept his eyes on Roxas since they returned. Sighing a little, he came over to join Roxas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still thinking about earlier?\" Leon asked as he began to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah,\" Roxas said, not bothering to hide it. \"I can't believe I did something like that. Not only did I get robed into a hopeless battle, but I hurt my friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, I don't think she holds it against you,\" replied Leon. \"You don't seem like the kind of guy to hurt someone on purpose. You kind of give off the same feeling as Sora.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wouldn't be the first to say that,\" Roxas chuckled sadly. \"Still, it feels like my anger gets the best of me at times. Every time it happens, it's like I allow something bad to happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, nobody's perfect,\" Leon chuckled a little. \"Heaven knows I've done plenty I regret. All you can do is to make sure you learn from it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Leon giving a pep talk?\" Yuffie giggled as she popped in between them. \"Now I've seen everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give it a rest, Yuffie,\" Leon rolled his eyes. \"I can give decent conversation when I want to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How often is that? Never?\" Yuffie gave a very Sora-like grin before turning to Roxas. \"Still, for what it's worth, he's right. Have confidence in yourself! I bet the three of you will take down those black coats next time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRoxas actually smiled at that. Sure, as sucky as that whole thing was, at least there were ways to rebound. Roxas already had an idea of how good these people were from Sora's memories, but interacting with them in person really helped drive the point home. Even Xion seemed to at least be enjoying the company, even if she said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right,\" Roxas said a little sternly. \"Next time will be different. I won't let Xion get hurt ever again, not by me or anyone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woo! There you go!\" Yuffie cheered, rocking Roxas a little before smiling wider. \"Speaking of Xion, she seems especially important to you. Got a big old crush on her?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does that mean?\" Roxas asked, a question mark visibly appearing over his head. \"Why would I want to crush her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah...wow, and I thought Leon took everything too literally,\" Yuffie pouted, getting an indignant snort from said brunette. \"I mean you like her a lot. Seriously, you look at her like Sora did whenever he brought up Kairi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike her a lot? What exactly did that mean? It kind of brought Roxas's mind back to a very old conversation he had with Axel. After a mission to Beasts' Castle, he had asked about love, as it was a word constantly brought up there. Axel described it as a stronger feeling than friendship, or something to that effect. He had written it off given the whole \"Nobodies can't feel\" thing everyone kind of took to heart. Was that what Yuffie was talking about? Kind of hard to tell. Roxas wasn't really sure what to make of it. Did Xion make him feel something different?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, forget it. You're just a blockhead like Leon,\" Yuffie pouted again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm right here, you know,\" Leon stated casually. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the point,\" Yuffie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Xion had quietly been observing everyone. After a while, her eyes had fixated on Roxas, just as he was talking with Leon. Seeing Roxas smile again actually brought a small smile to her own, her prior injury not even a factor anymore. With that, she just casually listened to Aerith talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the time went by rather well all things considered. Before long, it was time to turn in and get some rest. Sora was feeling oddly exhausted for someone who had just slept for a year, something Roxas made sure to point out when he exaggerated how tired he was. Taking the slight with a grin, Sora just replied that a growing boy requires sleep, making Roxas roll his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, with much on their minds, the trio went to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>That Night</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Roxas. Good luck today.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXion curiously watched Roxas, intrigued by this dream of hers. She was pretty sure this was a memory, showing off her face to Roxas for the first time. They had started taking missions together, and it was the first time she actually spoke a real sentence. Even Roxas seemed surprised, though there was a hint of a smile at seeing her for real for the first time. With that, the two were beginning their mission. Roxas was the one with the Keyblade while she assisted with magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the good feeling stopped there, as after Roxas took down a Heartless, he suddenly turned his Keyblade in her direction. It feel like a sudden shift in the mood, as the bright suburbs of Twilight Town faded into darkness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Roxas?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but I have to,\" he said darkly, gripping his blade and facing her like he did the Heartless. \"You made me do this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXion had little time to ponder what in the world he was talking about, but with speed she couldn't match, Roxas struck forward, slashing her across the chest.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nXion's eyes suddenly popped open right when that happened, a hand going to her chest to feel the spot where she got struck. Nothing. There was nothing there. She wasn't in Twilight Town, but in the very room she fell asleep in. So, it was just a dream, a really really horrible dream. She was sure part of that was real, fighting alongside Roxas in Twilight Town, a name she could recognize now if vaguely. However, everything afterwards...that couldn't have happened, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nXion felt a bead of sweat going down her face, her breathing slightly faster. Why would she dream that? That couldn't have been because of earlier, right? That was just an accident. Roxas didn't mean to hurt her. And yet, that sensation of his Keyblade slashing her..of being attacked by him....why was there a sense of familiarity there? Was there something else she didn't remember?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll she could say was she didn't like the feeling of this, and as she tried to get back to sleep, she hoped it was just nothing more than a dream. Despite her attempts though, the feeling of dread didn't dissipate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><u>The Next Morning</u></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhh, good morning!\" cheered Sora.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You apparently slept well,\" groaned Roxas. \"I could tell from your snoring.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That just means I'm a healthy sleeper,\" Sora retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right....\" Roxas rolled his eyes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Hollow Bastion group eventually joined them, as did Xion. She barely looked in any of their directions though. It took both Sora and Roxas saying good morning for her to actually give a physical reaction, which was barely more than a nod and wave. There was a slight smile, but it seemed...somewhat pained. Sora and Roxas looked to each other, wondering what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe she's just half-asleep,\" Sora shrugged. \"Maybe she was also sleeping for a long time like I was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Roxas said, but he dropped the subject soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, they all had to get ready to leave. Getting a few snacks for the road after filling their bellies, the trio thanked the committee for their hospitality. Yuffie told them to come by soon, to which Sora replied they definitely would. With a wave good bye, they were off to the Highwind, getting settled back into the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, I\"M the one driving this time!\" Sora made sure to make sure he was the one in charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, whatever,\" Roxas said from his seat. \"Just don't run into anything and I won't say a word on it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora took the Highwind back into space, immediately checking in to what pathways got unlocked because of earlier. The Highwind's scanners picked up two worlds: Land of Dragons and Beast's Castle. Predictably, the latter got Roxas's attention, and even got Xion to widen her eyes slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm, where to first?\" Sora pondered out loud.</span></div></div>",

They decide to possess different girls (among which are the female party members) in order to give him a harem. They can access all of their hosts' memories, with the hosts still being around, but unable to take any action. Multiple slimes can reside in one girl, but one slime can't control multiple girls. The main character doesn't find out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory 16: A Risen Desire<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Grima goes to follow Lucina's group through time, the remains of Robin secretly uses the last of his energy to try to separate the Risen from Grima. He partially succeeds, breaking the link for a group, but they latch onto him instead. They still have the mindsets of Risen for the most part, but they have become self-aware. They wish to serve Robin, and make his life better, so they decide to use their newfound intelligence in order to find a way to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey decide to see if they can possess bodies by one of them possessing Lucina in secret during the first battle with the Risen in game, while she's separated from Chrom's group, upon one doing this, they decide to make Robin a harem, but knowing that he wouldn't approve of the girls being possessed, and wanting to keep under the radar because of Grima being around, they keep it a secret. The Risen possess girls by turning into smoke like the smoke that comes out of their mouths, and going down the throats of the girls. When the Risen take over, the girls' eyes will glow red like the Risens' eyes for a brief moment, then turn back to normal a they lightly let out a burp of the smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory 17: Shadows Spread<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA group of Shadow Heartless regain some sense of self when Kairi turns Sora back to normal. They have little to no memory of their pasts, but imprint on Sora, seeing him as having become a sort of Alpha Heartless, due to getting back to normal while still being a Heartless, even after rejoining with Roxas. They still have a desire for hearts, and instinctively decide to go about getting them a new way... by hijacking the bodies and hearts of those who already have them, choosing girls in order to give Sora a bunch of girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Shadows possess girls by lunging into their chests, right where their hearts are, or would be in the cases of empty vessels and nobodies who haven't grown replacement hearts. Kairi, Namin\u00e9, and Xion are amongst those possessed. The Shadows have access to the memories and abilities of the girls (including being able to use Keyblades), and show no visable signs of the Heartless, with the Princesses of Hearts' own hearts of pure light covering their darkness up so that no one notices.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStory 18: Master PC<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA version of the Master PC arrives in a fictional world. This version is in laptop form, but can have its programming uploaded into another device, and is indestructible, virus proof, and has unlimited charge. It has a form of sentience that will latch onto the main male protagonist (or a protagonist in the case of multiple).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt will try to manipulate the person operating it into using it to improve the life of the person it attaches to, even at the expense of others, including the one operating it, whether by having them unconsciously type extra things while not paying attention to the keyboard, or by mentally nudging them to indulge in desires, such as payback or fantasies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a general alteration page, along with pages for each person, showing a model of how they look at the moment, down to pose of wardrobe, their statistics, and bios. The changes can either be retroactive or remembered normally, depending on the operator's choice (even being able to make some people remember retroactively and some not)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote that the PC can be used against its desires, but it takes paying attention to what the operator is typing, and the PC has the ability to upload its sentience into whoever is operating it as a defense mechanism while they are using it, with them potentially not realizing it's happening, which can be halted by stopping typing. Stopping won't reverse the process, but it can be reversed with other mental altering methods. How fast the person is infected depends on mental fortitude. It can cancel out any and all mental alterations made to the operator by other sources upon them using it if it desires.</span></div></div>",

A lone-wolf, but not a mean person and is very stubborn. Will always be there for his friends if he can; become his enemy and you will have a hard time. He is not a lone-wolf towards his friends. Tall, with dark brown hair and dark brown eyes. Wears dark blue jeans or shorts, black shoes, with the shirts he wears being either completely dark blue, completely yellow, completely red, very dark blue with the word Nintendo written on the front, or black with a picture of Sonic on the front.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther Characters:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura: Anthony's older sister by a few months. 16 years old. She wears brown boots, jeans, and a black shirt. She has blond hair. She is generally a very selfish person who thinks she is better than everyone else. She still cares for her siblings, and unknown to them, has threatened Sarah to not let Zoey know the truth after kicking her butt, since Zoey cares for her step siblings and step father, and Laura doesn't want to risk Zoey distancing herself from them. Kimberly kept custody of her after the divorce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZack: Anthony's older brother. 20 years old. Gets along with Anthony and the rest of their siblings, except Laura, although both care for each other. Zoey thinks Zack is just a friend of Anthony's. Kimberly kept custody of him after the divorce. Has a crush on Mary, but due to being step siblings, feels awkward about it, so he doesn't tell her. He doesn't know she feels the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKimberly: Anthony's 42 year old mother. She wears black high heels, a grey skirt, and a grey shirt. She has long brown hair. A very kind person, she cares about other people and tries to help them if they need it. Sad that her family was split apart, but she and Henry just couldn't make it last.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah: Anthony's older step sister. 17 years old. She's shallow, liking only what's popular, and is a real witch (Not literally, just personality wise, and I won't write the word originally used to describe her that was used by the person who created her) towards Anthony and friends. Always dyes her hair to whatever hair color is popular. Fears Laura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna: Anthony's younger step sister. 15 years old. Just started the swim team 3 months ago. She has a long, straight golden hair, average eyes, pointy nose, and her mouth is not big, but not small, and she always smile in front of people, and giggles as she talks, which makes her look cute on the face. She is thin, and moderately short, around 160+cm in height, she has the breast of C-cup sized, it's not that big. She is also good in sports, and intelligent in her work, and she is popular among her age group, but not exactly as popular as school models. She looks up to and respects Anthony. She loves anime and video games. She wears a wide variety of clothes, but wears a green one-piece bathing suit while swimming. She has a crush on Anthony, but feels awkward about it, due to Zoey not knowing, and them being step siblings, so she hides it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAndy: Anthony's younger brother. 13 years old. Loves video games. Has a crush on Bethany, although she doesn't know (more info will be added when someone expands upon it).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoey: Anthony's younger step sister. 10 years old. She is majorly in love with Anthony, but due to thinking that they are actually related, she feels awkward about her feelings and hides them, acting like she just has a brother complex, however, if she found out the truth, she would make no effort to hide her feelings. She likes her friends, and unlike Sarah, she doesn't like populars or following them. She has a short, light brown hair, amber-colored eyes and a smile that fits greatly on her face. She has normal breasts, not too big because she's so young. She wears mostly skirts and shirts, but she has some jeans, and sometimes she wears dresses, she loves all colors equally, and thus, she has many different colors of clothing. She likes candy (mainly chocolate), playing videogame, and she loves love stories. Anthony likes her too and they've always gotten along. She has the personality of a cute 10 year innocent girl, she wouldn't do anything bad even if forced to. She knows her brother is a nice person and inspires in him. She loves being praised and is a hard worker. Would do everything for her brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia: Anthony's twin sister who gets along with him very well. Her favorite fictional character is Mia from the Fire Emblem series, because they share the same name, and similar personalities. She naturally has black hair, but always dyes it purple in order to be like her favorite character. She is almost always wearing a skirt or dress. She likes sports (one of the few kinds of things that she doesn't wear a skirt for), but can't stand cheerleaders. She is easily excitable, more so when she has some kind of sugar (which is why she usually isn't allowed by her family to have any when at home or out at a family event).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she has some kind of sugar, then she gets so hyper that she sometimes starts pulling pranks, although they're never harmful. She is an odd mix of being a tomboy and girly-girl, but gets annoyed with girls who are complete girly-girls. Shares Anthony's love of the sword, anime, and video games, but because of how hyper she is, she hardly ever reads books, because she think they're too boring for the most part.. She's a little faster than Anthony, but a little weaker. She is also a couple minutes younger than him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMary: Anthony's older step sister who is in college. 21 years old. Waist length, dark brown hair kept in a ponytail, same eyes as Anthony, shorter than Anthony but athletic. Humble and willing to help out. She enjoys playing video games with Anthony a bit. Likes spending time with friends and Anthony when possible. Adapt at video games somewhat (not as much as Anthony or the others), pretty fast as she almost beat a track record. Nimble as well (as in she could be an excellent thief if she desired) She likes sticking up for people when they feel oppressed, she has a strong sense of justice, and she is a tomboy. Prefers to wear a lavender sweater over a white tank top, along regular jeans and white shoes. She has a crush on Zack, but since they are step siblings, feels awkward about it, and doesn't tell him. She doesn't know that he feels the same way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDiana: Anthony's step mother. She is a widow, with her late husband being Henry's cousin. She married Henry a little over a year after her late husband's death, during that time, Zoey was born. Since Henry has the same last name as her married name, Zoey hasn't been able to find anything weird about it that could cause her to figure out. (This is all for her for now, I'll update it if/when she is used again)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry: Anthony's father. 42 years old. Is in the military, but his section hasn't been called in to outside conflict at the time. He is about to begin some military training required, and won't be back for two weeks. He'll either leave while Anthony is at school, or the next day, depending on who is writing. Originally married to Kimberly, but they couldn't make it last. All of his kids blame him for splitting up the family. (more info will be added when someone expands upon it).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNatalie: Anthony's step aunt. 35 years old. A near mirror image of Megan (mentioned later). Tall and slender, she goes on business trips for a technology company she and her late husband co-owned. She always dresses professionally, and is completely dedicated to her work and children. She is fearful of taking the children with her, traveling due to the nature of her husband's death, but she calls them two times each day, fifteen minutes each. To relax, she practices Tai Chi (a non violent form of martial arts). She drives a cherry red corvette. She will be on her business trip for three months, working on a contract deal with a European company.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyle: Natalie's husband. Deceased. He was tall and muscular with jet black hair and deep blue eyes. He traveled across the globe, taking care of business abroad while his wife worked at home, raising their three daughters. He was shot in the heart by a robber he had cornered inside his apartment while on a business trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJacinta: Natalie's oldest daughter. 16 years old. Tall and slender, like her mom, jet black hair and piercing green eyes. She is cold to anyone she does not know, will warm up though... given time. Jacinta is the top cheerleader in her school but prefers to play football as she is strong for her age. She hates video games of any kind as she is into real adventures such as mountain climbing or cave exploring... would climb a building, if it were not frowned upon, lives for the next challenge. She prefers to wear blue jeans and snug fitting shirts, of earth tone colors, and boots. She is on the cheer team to be closer to the game she would prefer to play. Jacinta had a fair relationship with Megan, but the two have not talked since receiving news of their father's death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHannah: Natalie's daughter, and the middle child of the sisters. 14 years old. Short for her age, with shoulder length brown hair and gentle green eyes. She is a tomboy, kind to all, but she can fight well, if provoked enough. Hannah is a member of the junior ROTC, low rank but eager to learn. She is into martial arts of any kind, has a black belt in Kung-Fu and Karate. She is a big fan of the Kamen Rider series. Hannah loves video games and is often teased by Jacinta for playing them, causing the occasional fights. Hannah loves to wear skirts and dresses. She is more popular with the boys than her older sister, which often drives her crazy. She got along very well with Megan but has been quiet since their father's death... seeing a pattern here?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan: Natalie's youngest daughter. 13 years old. Andy's height, with waist length brown hair, and curiously deep blue eyes and doll like features. She is very intelligent for her age and very quiet, but she will speak if surprised or impressed, which is not very often. Megan prefers to dress professionally, usually wearing a modest length skirt and dark colored blouse. She frowns upon video games, but will play is challenged. She loves to read and watch TV. Megan is a dreamer with a wish to actually visit the Pok\u00e9mon world she loves to watch. She is deeply hurt, losing her father, worse, having her family spit up while mom does the traveling. Megan secretly fears that the same fate awaits her mother and is constantly worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy: 16 years old. She has long blonde hair, is kind of pretty, and wears a lot of make-up. She recently moved next door to Anthony. She wears black fingerless gloves, and black jeans. She wears combat boots which always cover her pant leg bottoms, and have striped black and red laces. She normally has 3 different belts on at the same time, she wears a dark blue shirt all the time, but nobody will see it because she has a long black jacket, that everyone thinks is a dress at first sight. She wears a necklace, the chain is metal tubing, while the amulet is that of a creature with red eyes. The eyes are rubies. She has blue eyes and wears black lip stick. She is a gothic person by appearance, but is she really gothic?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichael: 16 years old. He has short brown hair that is very messy, but not stubble. Kind of an average body, not muscly, but not feeble. Doesn't really go out with girls, is a bit of a loner (This is mainly because of his rather obscene addiction to video games, especially Pok\u00e9mon).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrianna: 16 years old. She has long white hair, dark skin and bright green eyes. She wears a red, white, and blue jacket with a Puerto Rican flag on the backside. She also wears a pair of pitch black jeans and red and white chucks. Laid back, yet somehow, easily excitable. She loves video games, knows Spanish, but not as good for some rules as most people from Puerto Rico when she was younger, and was teased for it when she went to school there. Her mother is dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBethany: 13 years old. She has long, straight, blond hair that comes halfway down her back, and blue eyes. She wears dresses and skirts most of the time, usually yellow, and she wears yellow knee-length boots with them, but wears dark blue biker shorts, a yellow shirt, and black shoes when doing physical activities and a yellow one-piece bathing suit when swimming. She is very shy, and has a crush on Andy (Just like she doesn't know Andy likes her, he doesn't know she likes him). Likes anime, video games, and cartoons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaria: Bethany's older sister, and Sarah's best friend. 17 years old. Like Sarah, she is a shallow witch, only caring about what's popular. She is also on the cheerleading squad. She is dumb, to the point where others wonder how she has enough brains to keep passing her classes (Anthony, his siblings, except Sarah, and his friends suspect that it has to do with her boyfriend, who is mentioned right below). She has long, blond hair and blue eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike: 17 years old. Maria's boyfriend, and the Quarterback on the school's football team, he isn't much brighter than Maria, so Anthony, his siblings (except Sarah), and his friends suspect that the teachers are changing his grades since he is so good at football. Has short brown hair, brown eyes, and very big muscles. He gets annoyed at the fact that Anthony, his siblings (except Sarah, who he has no problem with since she's Maria's best friend), and his friends aren't afraid of him and won't let him push them around. He doesn't try to mess with Anthony, or anyone Anthony gets along with anymore since Katherine (mentioned a little farther down) sent her bodyguards after him when he attacked Anthony in front of her once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRose: 15 years old. Anna's best friend, who has a major crush on Anthony, who doesn't know it. As her name implies, she loves flowers. She usually wears a pink dress with flower designs on it and sneakers. She has long, straight, brown hair and brown eyes. She is very kind to people who aren't rude to her and her friends. She likes anime and video games. Like Anna, she is on the swim team and kickball team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine: 16 years old. A rich girl, but she isn't a snob. Her father is dead, but it didn't matter too much to her because he didn't care much for her and was always away on business, and her mother, although still alive, is very much the same. Because of how she grew up, she believes everything can be bought by money (although, as I said, she's not a snob).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnthony once saved her life by getting her out of the way of a car that came out of nowhere and was going to hit her as she was crossing the road, and ever since, she has been in love with him. She doesn't understand why he didn't agree to become her boyfriend after she offered to pay him a large amount of money to do so, because of how she believes anything can be bought. Anthony, his family (except for Sarah, who encouraged him to accept so that she could try to take the money from him), and his friends got annoyed when she tried to buy his love, although they were thankful when she sent her bodyguards after Mike to protect Anthony (except, of course, for Sarah). Henry, Norman, and John are the only males she has working for her. She lets her friends, her uncle Henry, and Anthony call her Kat, but no one else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe usually wears a sparkling silver dress with gems imbedded in it, expensive bracelets, a diamond necklace, and silver high-heeled shoes, although, despite the way she dresses, she is a bit of a tomboy, and likes many sports (she dresses the way she does, because her mother wants her to keep up the family's good image in front of the media). She lives in a mansion, and rides in a limo whenever she isn't going on foot. She loves video games, and has every console system, along with most of the games for them. She has long, straight, black hair and blue eyes. She knows martial arts, and is good at it, so she can easily handle most threats on her own, and her bodyguards can handle most of the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSandra: 23 years old. One of Katherine's bodyguards. Short black hair and blue eyes. Always wears a black suit, black boots, and sunglasses when on duty. She never shows emotion while on duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn: 26 years old. One of Katherine's bodyguards. Short brown hair and brown eyes. Always wears a black suit, black boots, and sunglasses when on duty. He never shows emotion while on duty. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine: 24 years old. One of Katherine's bodyguards, who is on duty whenever either Sandra or John are not on duty to make it so Katherine has two bodyguards at a time. Short blond hair with blue eyes. Always wears a black suit, black boots, and sunglasses when on duty. She never shows emotion while on duty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHenry: 38 years old Katherine's uncle on her father's side. Unlike his late brother and his sister in law, he cares for Katherine, and wants the best for her. He is rich (although not as rich as his sister in law and Katherine), but he is very humble, always donating money to worthy causes. He works as Katherine's Chauffeur by his own will so he can have a reason to watch over her. He met Anthony about a week before Katherine met him. Anthony and Henry get along well, and Henry hopes that Anthony will fall in love with and marry Katherine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNorman: 46 years old. Katherine's butler. He is more like a father to her than her real father was, and always helps her out. He knows martial arts. He wants nothing but happiness for Katherine, and after finding out about her feelings for Anthony, found out more about him, and approves of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJill: 16 years old. Has brunet colored hair and bright blue eyes. A bit of a brave heart she won't let anything deter her from her dream job. She wears mostly the color blue and her favorite outfit is a bright blue tank top with a dark blue skirt that is so dark that people think that it is black blue sneakers. She loves to dance and likes to have fun. Her favorite game is DDR.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dream is to become a dancer like ballet, or something like that. She recently met Anthony a month ago, and has developed feeling for him, though he doesn't know that, and in turn he has a bit of a crush on her. She's an only child, so she gets lonely, but Anthony helps solve that by putting his number into her cell, and telling her to call him if she ever feels lonely. She has another hobby, which she keeps to herself, as she's a little embarrassed because of it. She's a massive anime fanatic. She lives by herself as her parents had died a year before she met Anthony, leading her to have depression, but that cleared up mostly after meeting Anthony. She always wears a broken heart necklace that her mother got her for fifthteenth birthday, which is May 30th. She is currently sixteen<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lives in a dirty apartment, which she's doesn't clean due to her depression issue. Her parents lived with her in that apartment until they died. She prefers to go out instead of stay in and cry, but she sleeps alone, and sometimes cries herself to sleep due to being lonely (that is, until she met Anthony, of course). Anthony often takes her with him when ever he goes out to play at the local arcade. He even bought DDR in order to play with her at his house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you create a character, then you must give the details about them, such as their appearance and personality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one but me is allowed to start a \"real world\" storyline. I'm willing to take suggestions for other stories to add.</td>",
