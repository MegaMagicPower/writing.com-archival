Her bed felt hard and there was noise around, like she was lying in a tiny city. \"Ridiculous\" she thought to herself. But then she opened her eyes and could see a tiny crowd, which immediately panicked. Sitting up in shock, she realized she was now a giant as she looked around to see Portsmouth as seen from the top of a skyscraper and quite a bit of her neighbourhood in ruins. She then looked at her girlfriend, who was sleeping next to her on the debris of several buildings her expanding body had crushed in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Steph, Steph! Wake up!\" she said, shaking her. Her F-cup breasts, now big enough to crush whole buildings between them, jiggled to Julie's distraction.<br>\r\n\"Ummmh? Good morning...\"<br>\r\n\"Come on, have a look around!\" As she sat up too and complied she was as amazed as Julie. But unlike her she was happy rather than shocked.<br>\r\n\"Is this a dream?\" she said.<br>\r\n\"It doesn't seem so\"<br>\r\n\"Oh wow, this is amazing!\"<br>\r\n\"Woah, wait a moment. I know this is your fantasy, but we're in deep trouble! What are we going to do?\"<br>\r\n\"You know, today's my 20th birthday.\"<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah. Congratulations, honey\"<br>\r\n\"You know, since I was a child I've been having this dream where I was told I would turn into an all-powerful goddess when I turned 20. I never took it seriously, but maybe this has something to do with it? Let's see if I can change my size at will.\" <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Now the city was a model set compared to them, with most buildings barely reaching their ankles.<br>\r\n\"Don't worry about that\" her all-powerful girlfriend replied cheerfully.

We'll just be hated\"<br>\r\n\"Come on people, please calm down. I can repair everything and bring you back if you are harmed, so you have nothing to fear\" Stephanie then told the panicking people with her best smile, brainwashing them.

Madeline kissed back moving down to Stephanie's breasts and giving them a hard suck, she continued as Stephanie moaned in shaking the city below them. She pushed Madeline off of her and rolled her into a 69 position. The two licked and sucked at each other's vaginal openings before cumming with a LOUD moan which turned to a scream as they came again and again and again. \"That...was some really good...birthday sex!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMadeleine was much more worn out suddenly she felt herself renergized. \"Shall we have some more fun?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of fun dear?\" Stephanie asked.</span></div></div>",

Sun shining outside, occasional clouds passing by, gusts of wind at the right time, the perfect Saturday afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut for Julie, it was another boring day. Without a job and no school to attend to, she had nothing to do but surf the internet all day in her apartment in New York. She tried to have a boyfriend but he ended up being a major jackass so she just dumped her a couple of days ago and didn't bothered looking again. Even though she was living in New York, she still has her cute little British accent, which added to her charm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting comfortably on a chair in front of her computer desk, Julie was painting her nails blood red while surfing the web. Day after day Julie was browsing for Giantess related material like a maniac, she couldn't get enough of that fetish and wished it could happen to her in some way. Some people in her entourage knew about her fetish, most found it weird and disgusting but some of them thought it sounded fun and bitching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter finishing her nails, Julie admired her job well done and resumed her search on the web. While on google, a pop-up burst out of nowhere that said \"Want to be taller?\" and only that. There was nothing particular about that ad but she never saw it before and felt compelled to click on it. It was strange, it didn't redirect her on another page but instead, it just switched to another question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt reads: \"How do you want to be taller?\" with five choices following that question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is getting interesting AND ridiculous.. but what else there is to do..\" she sighed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

On the sidewalk, she looked around for anybody she knew, but there was no one out that she recognised. \"Ok Julie, don't get your hopes up, its probabably a weird joke or something\" she said to herself. \"But how big should I grow to, to start with?\" She decided to add a whole foot to her frame, 6'6\".

Now she was getting attention. As her body expanded the neighborhood suddenly seemed cramped. She was 20 feet tall and filled the sidewalk where she stood. Still she expanded her growth still accelerating. Whole feet flew by, then yards. Quickly she was encroaching onto the street. At 100 feet high, she felt the awning of the shop behind her brush against the lower part of her calves, and then yield as it fell to the ground. Up up up and out out out she went. Her toe were well into traffic (not that it was going anywhere and her heels were pushing back through storefronts, shattering glass and knocking down displays while the people shopping were either trying to make good their escape, or were frozen trying to figure out what in the hell they were looking at. Her height was becoming really noticeable now. Some blocks away the buildings were taller, and those inside could see the form of a woman rising up above the rooftops. At gound level her feet had completely crossed the street and now her toe were smashing threw the buildings over there. The buildings behind her had already given up and she was sort of standing in yet on the rubble. Julie was 500' tall... and growing.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Julie stopped her ascension at 1000' high.<br>\r\n\"oops\" she whispered. \"Well, we're here now\".<br>\r\nJulie pulled her right foot from the rubble and set it squarely on the road. at 53' wide it was actually wider than the road, but that really didn't matter. As it rose high into the air, debris fell from the massive flip flop, crashing down onto people and cars. Looking up, the massive sandal seemed to hover a moment, then turn 90 degrees as it aligned with the street, then it came down. Everything underneath was completely flattened into the pavement., Then the pavement into the ground. The hard surface that had seen traffic for almost a hundred years was now giving way to foam rubber.

Then more loudly and more violently as she approached. Most of the \"tall\" buildings only came up to her shoulders or so. She was having an absolute blast looking in the tiny windows. Taking in all the little details. She was so enthralled, that she was totally unaware of the mayhem under her feet. The streets had become broader, but were absolutely full of cars and people trying to escape. And anyone too slow was trod upon. No mercy, no cruelty, just screaming then goo under the incredible weight. She stopped for a moment, to observe a man on a rooftop. This gave the crowds a moment to flee. Some of the people were right up against her enormous feet, although they couldn't see them over the 15' high sandal soles. Then disaster. She got bored and took another step right into a teaming crowd. Even in all this horror, a moment could still be spared to admire her huge boobs, that quaked with every step.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

If she shrank back, they'd surely find her. The only way out she could see was up. She again began to expand. way faster than before her height doubled, then doubled then doubled again. Growing bigger and bigger and bigger until she felt like she would be safe from attack. She felt safe at five miles high, but wanted to be sure and grew up to ten miles tall and stopped. This happened so quickly that it took the pilots by surprise. A moment ago they had been flying 1,000 feet above a 1,000 foot woman. Now 2,000 feet of altitude put them somewhere above her toes, but below her ankles. Closer to her toes as her feet sat a top 800' thick sandals.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Tanya ran back along the corridor to the apartment complex stairwell, her hands clenched in anger around the box of cookies she'd almost sold, most likely turning the contents to crumbs. She threw them angrily into the garbage can at the top of the stairs and sat down on the first step, frowning, the words \"little girl\" echoing in her head, she couldn't deny she was petite, standing at the same 4'5 for the last 3 years while her friends and even her younger sister had all grown up around her. She hated it, it was the one part of her life she couldn't change or control, in school she was a straight A student, and had been selected from all the scouts in the state to take part in this trip to Switzerland, if she could raise the money, but her height was beyond her control. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking deep breaths she started to calm down a bit, angry that she'd let chubby older woman push her buttons like that, other than her height she was happy with the way her body was developing, an active, outdoors lifestyle left her slender and toned, and the genetics of her mother's family were starting to show through as her breasts had begun to grow nicely and her B cups had started to feel a little too snug in the past few days. \"Stupid old drunk\" she muttered under her breath, she hadn't seen the beers but she'd smelled the alcohol in the air through the woman's mockery. \"One day I'll show her, show them all\" She promised herself as she began to stand, straightening her uniform as she did. She had to reach out to steady herself as the blood rushed to her head making her dizzy and fogging her vision. Clinging to the stair rail she reeled as the room span around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up on the floor, the dingy apartment stairwell slowly coming back into focus \"Ohh, what was that?\" she groaned, her head throbbing where she'd hit the floor. slowly she began to recover, moving to a crawling position, then kneeling and finally dragging herself up to her feet. \"That was strange\" she muttered her body left with a slight tingling sensation that was almost pleasant, leaving her feeling oddly more content than she had been before. She decided she was done selling cookies for the day, not wanting to risk passing out again in a more risky location, she walked down the stairs and out to the apartment door, which opened suddenly almost pushing her off her feet \"Hey, what the hell?\" she yelled up at the mailman who'd opened the door.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry little one\" he smiled down at her, his tone polite but condescending \"Is your mommy around, should you be out by yourself?\" Her slightly brighter mood darkened almost instantly, Julie's mockery and now this well-meaning but insulting mailman were entirely too much. \"I'M FOR-FUCKING-TEEN!\" The venom and volume of her voice caused the older man to take a step back, his eyes growing wide at the words coming from the girl infront of him. \"One day you'll pay for this, you and that bitch up stairs, one day I'll be bigger\". <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the final word left her lips she felt the dizziness returning, groping for something to hold as the world span, but this time she didn't pass out and and the world refocussed. The mailman was staring at her, his face pale with surprise, his mouth soundlessly trying to make words, for a second she couldn't understand what was wrong with him, until she realised she wasn't looking up at him anymore. She looked past him into the glass, catching a glimpse of her reflection. At first she couldn't believe it, everything was the same, her toned legs, flat stomach, firm ample chest, long auburn hair...but it was all scaled up to match her new height, which she estimated to be just over 5'9. \"Oh now that's just too fucking perfect\" she gasped, her voice almost a whisper with excitement. \"Out of my way, LITTLE man\" she smirked, not waiting for a response she bulled into him, pushing over as she strode confidently out of the apartment. Her clothes had scaled with her, she was happy about that, she didn't fancy walking naked through the streets even with her new size. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder what happened\" she thought aloud to herself, her mind trying to think past self admiration and onto explaining her unusual growth. As thoughts rattled through her young mind she couldn't help but wonder whether her growth was done, and how awesome it would be if it wasn't. As soon as that thought entered her mind she couldn't shake it and almost on cue her head started to spin, she felt less dizzy than before though, this time the feeling was almost pleasant, almost like how she felt after the few sips of wine her mother had let her try in the past. And she could see herself growing, or at least things around her shrinking. She stopped herself at 6' and looked around at the world which had seemed so big to her this morning. Her face formed a smug smile as she walked out to the road and stopped a cab, to take her back to her house, she had so many plans but first she wanted to change, a GIRL scout's uniform suddenly didn't seem fitting for the 6' redhead amazon. And she had so many ideas about what to do next.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The young girl who only reached your stomach a few minutes ago was now big enough to hold the entire city in the palm of her hands. She was clearly enjoying the fact that the lives of countless people who had once mocked her small size were now all at her mercy. Tanya gave you a mischievous smirk and you could immediately tell that she was planning to make the most of her new power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OKAY YOU PATHETIC WORMS!\", Tanya called out, \"IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED ALREADY, I HAVE GAINED THE ABILITY TO GROW AS BIG AS I WANT!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe booming sound of the once-small teen's now omnipotent voice was enough to cause the entire city to tremble. You were shaken to the core by the fact that a girl that you had made fun of only mere minutes ago now had complete control over the whole city. You knew that you would probably be one of this teenage tyrant's first targets, and you quickly began to regret belittling her earlier. As if she sensed you fear, Tanya gave you a quick glare that told you that she meant business, and she then proceeded to begin growing again. Within only a few seconds, the city that once barely fit in both of her hands was now only the size of a baseball to her. You looked up in shock, only to see the blue sky completely eclipsed by the wall of flesh that was her face. It was then that Tanya spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW THAT I HAVE GIVEN YOU A DEMONSTRATION OF MY POWER, I INTEND TO HAVE SOME FUN WITH YOU PITIFUL INSECTS AND YOUR PUNY CITY!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if Tanya's last announcement wasn't loud enough, the sound of her voice at her new size caused windows to shatter throughout the city. All of the citizens had to cover their ears to prevent their eardrums from exploding. Seeing this, Tanya couldn't help but giggle at her amazing power. She then began to take this as an opportunity to tease all of the people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AWWW, AM I REALLY THAT LOUD TO YOU LITTLE GUYS? WELL, I SUPPOSE THAT IF I WERE AS INSIGNIFICANTLY SMALL AS YOU ARE, THEN THE BEAUTIFUL VOICE OF A GODDESS WOULD BE PRETTY LOUD...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing her declare herself as a goddess frightened you greatly. You could only imagine what kind of plans Tanya had in mind for you and the rest of the city. Just then, much to your dismay, your question was answered by the booming voice of the goddess Tanya...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M GETTING PRETTY BORED OF THIS PATHETIC LITTLE CITY...

The entire city could do nothing but stare up in terror as the teenage goddess let out a bone-chilling laugh. The citizens were petrified by this. Everyone knew that she was about to do something that would spell out their doom, and as scared as they were, the city was still perched in the palm of the young girl's massive hand &amp; escaping was impossible. The only options were a 5000 foot (more or less) drop to the hard ground below, and waiting around to see what the all-powerful kid had in store for them. As the people of the city were panicking, Tanya began to speak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I SUPPOSE I'LL JUST CRUSH YOU ALL BETWEEN MY MASSIVE TITS... *giggle* THIS IS GOING TO BE SO MUCH FUN! I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO TRY DOING THIS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Tanya proceeded to press the tiny city into her huge chest. After she felt that she had the city securely trapped between her boobs, Tanya grabbed one boob in each hand and began squeezing them together. At first the city struggled to stand against the pressure that the young girl was providing, but it quickly became to much for the small buildings to endure. As the enormous mountains of flesh were pressed closer and closer together, the puny city began to give way to Tanya's amazing power. She continued to apply more and more pressure to her breasts and the city between them. Then, all at once, the two mountains collided with each other and the city was completely flattened between them. Feeling this, Tanya separated her breasts and watched with joy as a rain of rubble that once was the city fell from between her boobs to the ground below. However, Tanya wasn't finished toying with the city just yet. She looked down to the crumbled remains of the city and smiled again. She then proceeded to raise her foot above the rubble. After positioning her foot directly above the wreckage, Tanya let out one last laugh before sending her foot crashing down onto the city. With the city underfoot, she ground her foot back and forth into the earth to remove any traces of the city from existence. When she finished and lifted her foot, there was nothing left of the city but a massive, foot-shaped crater left behind by the goddess. Despite knowing that there had been no survivors, Tanya decided to address the city one final time before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL GUYS, IT'S BEEN FUN, BUT I NEED TO BE GOING NOW... I HOPE YOU ENJOYED THE UP-CLOSE VIEW OF MY BOOBS... I'D LOVE TO STICK AROUND, BUT I HAVE AN ENTIRE PLANET TO TAKE OVER! THIS WORLD IS HAS A NEW GODDESS, AND HER NAME IS TANYA!! I'M REALLY GONNA ENJOY HAVING THIS KIND OF POWER OVER EVERYTHING!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that last comment, Tanya set off to bring the rest of the world to its knees. She knew that there was nothing that could possibly stop her from taking over, and she could always just get even bigger if she had to. She wasn't afraid to admit her opinion of the situation either, and readily made a challenge for anyone to try and stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OKAY LITTLE BUGS! I THINK WE ALL KNOW HOW THIS IS GOING TO TURN OUT! THIS WORLD BELONGS TO ME NOW! IF ANYONE HAS THE GUTS TO TRY AND STOP ME, THEN BY ALL MEANS TRY IT! I CAN ALWAYS USE SOME NEW TOYS TO PLAY WITH... JUST KNOW THAT I PLAY ROUGH! ANYONE WHO OPPOSES THEIR GODDESS WILL BE DEALT WITH MERCILESSLY!\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Slowly, she felt her feet push in her sneakers. She could see her arms getting longer as her shirt was covering less and less of them. She looked at her legs and watched her jeans getting to narrow for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKate let out a faint moan \"Holy shit\" she said excitingly as she watched her hands getting longer and longer. \"This is fucking awesome!\" .. she grabbed her breasts as they felt bigger and fuller than ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping her growth, Kate looked for a mirror but couldn't find one, so she raced in her sister's bedroom to look at herself. To her astonishment, she had grown from her previous 6'2\" to 6'8\", a whole 6 inches of women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My god I look hot, this is too good to be true, I need to feel that again\" lust could be read all over her face.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

What if her mother was now able to change size at will? \"Mom, sorry... ehm, could you picture yourself like growing?\" Jane smiled to what seemed an amusing playful proposal. \"Of course, honey? Let's see... like th...? Ouch!\" Julie gasped - her mother's head had just hit the ceiling. She had more than doubled in size, outgrowing her clothes. \"Hey, I actually grew! I wonder how I got such a cool power...\" she exclaimed delighted, feeling her titanic body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, mom...! Could you now picture me growing?\" Jane asked her.

It causing her to practically scoff at it in disbelief at what it said. As preposterous as the whole thing felt to her, it felt all the more fixed at the idea it would pass the \"power\" in question off to the person she hated most, which it took no time for her to already register a name in her mind, Trish Pierce. A woman who probably ranked pretty high up on that list for anyone who went to high school with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she hadn't seen Trish in years, and the last she had heard of her was talk around town about some of her fights. Still, many a day go by when Julie could remember being punched int he stomach more than once by this girl, due to something minor and losing any money that she had on her in the process. It sent a shiver down Julie's spine when she thought about it, what Trish could do with that power, it legitimately terrified her. Although after a moment of reflection, she couldn't help but laugh at the thought. \"Ridiculous\" She would say to herself, as if easing her fear down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment though, a slight tinge of anger would fill Julie's mind. Not only had this survey been utter bullshit, but it pulled the typical angle of tossing it to someone you didn't like. Such as a great power in someone you didn't want to be at the mercy of. She had read many a story based on the GTS community like that, and in said stories it always ended with them being killed off in some way. Oh sure, as exhilarating as it may have been to read, the idea, especially for Julie, of being snuffed out underfoot by Trish was just a nightmare waiting to happen. Shaking her head, Julie would simply close the window and push herself away from the desk in a huff. The thought never leaving the back of her mind, of all that power perhaps belonging to Trish Pierce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Name</b>: Trish Pierce<br>\r\n<b>Age</b>: 19<br>\r\n<b>Gender</b>: Female<br>\r\nAppearance :5'4\" 154 lbs, this little scrapper possesses the body of a fighter. Possessing a toned body which has seen many a day in the gym to stay in shape. Raven black hair adorning her head, cut moderately short, her hair brushed mostly to the left side of her head as the right side is shaved. She having a set of beautiful green eyes, and remarkably soft features for what she does, often training for sanctioned MMA fights. Dress wise, nothing special, a black tanktop and tighter fitting pair of black jeans and old beat up sneakers. A relaxed look whilst also showing off a few tattoos she's acquired in her recent years, including a large sleeve tat on her right arm of Oriental imagery.<br>\r\n<b>Personality</b>: Often seen as a cold and calloused person. Trish isn't someone who is much on words. Usually seen walking around with a permanent scowl and a bad attitude. Known to start fights and somewhat of a rebel of their school. As a fighter, she possesses a highly aggressive personality, often quick to throw a punch. Although she does have an explosive temper, one should not simply ignore some of her finer traits. A certain resourcefulness to her, mending well with a attentive, calculated and sometimes manipulative side of her. Though she might beat your face in over little to nothing, don't think that she is at all a mindless thug, because nine times out of ten, she is two steps ahead of you.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
