The population is well below three hundred people as far as the U.S. census can tell. People tend to go around it when they can, and see those who dare stay a night or even enter the town as foolish.

The people are very uncooperative, and sometimes hostile. There are stories of Bureau members entering the town and never being heard from again. You drive down main street In your company car,a black Cadillac, and survey the town you will be staying in for the next three days.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see very few people on the sidewalk. Most of them are young teenagers with dull bulging eyes ambling in small groups. The few adult males you see look a little off. Perhaps there is a lot of inbreeding in this town. With their lack of outside contact it wouldn't be too unbelievable. There are many buildings with boarded up windows, but as you pass them you get the feeling you are being watched. There is one motel in town with the generic name \"Morriston motel\", one small grocery store, one restaurant. and a fishing port. The city gets most of its money from the fishing industry and has little big business besides the fishing port.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'll be here for three days going from door to door and figuring the population of the city, so you have to find a place to stay. You're awfully hungry though, maybe you should grab a bite to eat first.</span></div></div>",

An old man (the only old person you've seen since entering the town) stares at you indifferently from the other side of the counter. He doesn't look touched like the people on the street, but there is something unwholsome about him. \"I'd like a room please\" you say to him nervously. He pretends he doesn't hear you. \"Excuse me\" You say but he cuts you off \"one hundred dollars per night.\" That seemed a little steep, but you didn't want to argue with the jerk, so you payed him for all three nights in advance. He stared at you as if he was waiting for you to leave. \"key\" you said. He grunted and handed you the key. \"Water's not working, hope you don't mind\" You mumble a response under your breath and head upstairs. You are in room 208. There is a dingy bed with sheets that have various dark splotches from unknown sources, a small chest of drawers with a lamp on it and a restroom. The lamp doesn't have a lightbulb in it, but for some reason this doesn't surprise you. Cobwebs have formed in the toilet and it doesn't flush. \"perfect. I have to stand three days of this!?\" You decide it would be best to spend as much time as you can away from the motel.<br>\r\nThe man at the front desk gives you the creeps.</span></div></div>",

This is a small town anyway. Since the town is so small you decide to walk to the nearest house. No use wasting gas. As you walk down mainstreet you notice a group of small children playing in a grassy field. While some of them are normal a few of them are a little bugeyed. A young woman with equally buggy eyes glares at you menacingly from her bench. She is apparently watching the kids. Maybe she could give you some info.</span></div></div>",

She looks young, but her neck is very wrinkly. Seeing that you'll get nothing from her you head on your way. Many of the windows of the building in the residential side of main street are boarded up. You feel eyes staring at you from the empty sockets of these corpses of buildings in this graveyard that was once a thriving town. You finally find a house that has signs of life. It is a little more maintained than the previous buildings, but is still very dilapitated. You ring the doorbell and hear nothing. Must be broken. You knock on the door. There is no answer. As you start to walk away the door opens. \"What do you want!\" A gruff voice calls from within the shadows of the door. \"I'm with the census Beurau, and I just have to ask you a few questions.\" \"Not interested\" the voice growls from inside.\"Sir you're required by law to cooperate.\" The man grunts and opens the door.\"make it quick.\" he stares at you bored. His eyes are bulgy and don't blink. He is balding and his lips are big. His skin has a grey tint to it, his nose is flat, and his ears are almost nonexistant. \"Are you the man of the house?\" He looks at you like you're an idiot. \"No, I'm the woman, what does it look like?\" \"righ, how many people live with you?\" \"Just me and my wife\" \"What religion are you. Catholic, Protestant,Jewish, Islamic, Hindu, Bu-\" \"I am of the Esoteric Order of Dagon\" he cuts you off. \"Cute\" you say and mark him down as an athiest. You ask him a series of questions getting many snide answers and answeres in dodgy ways. you thank him for his time, he grunts, and slams the door in your face. One down, about two hundred to go. This is going to be a long three days. </span></div></div>",

You also found out that everyone in the town was a member of the Esoteric Order of Dagon, apparently the first man wasn't joking. You decided to head back to the motel.

He listens patiently and seems completely fascinated by what you say. When you get to the part about your threatening visitor he gets excited.\"So, he looked inhuman to you huh?\" \"What? Don't you believe me?\" you ask. \"Of course I believe you. I'm a paranormal investigator.

Fortunately, most of the windows are broken, and the boarding up job was poorly done, so there are plenty of gaps for you to look through. <br>\r\n  As you look through, you see naught but the inky darkness , but you hear the gasping and the hissing of the old man. He seems to be whispering something, but it's to unclear for you to make out. The little fragments you can sound like no language you've ever heard. There seems to be a reply, from the girl, in the same unclear words. As you listen, her voice changes. It is not the voice of a little girl,but something else. It becomes more guttural,and seems to rise in tone. It sounded bass and primal.<br>\r\n  \"Flechs't tla R'leyh wgahl nhula.\"<br>\r\n   At least that what it sounds like to you.  It makes no sense. There is some further conversation, but it can't be made out. There's an eerie, all pervading silence for a moment, then the sound of metal scraping on metal. Then a single, sharp desperate,cry, and the sound like some great door slamming.<br>\r\n    Then, shuffling  footsteps tell you the old man is coming back. Quickly, you run around the corner and hide. He opens the door, and scans around. Seeing no one he exits, and takes out a large key from his coat pocket and uses it to lock a padlock on the door. All the time, he mutters something over the lock and key. As he rises, he sniffs the air, like an animal, as if smelling something that didn't belong there. Apparently satisfied, he walks away, fading into the dark. </span></div></div>",

As you push against them, they snap, releasing a cloud of particles into thre air, as well as a dank smell of mold. You hope the sound wasn't heard, and you wait several moments, lest the gnarled man comes back to investigate.  <br>\r\n After that time, you clear the rotting boards away as best as you can. Inside, you see naught but Stygian darkness. Grabbing the sill, you bring your body through the crumbling stone of the wall. The sound of your landing doesn't echo, which you don't really notice at first. You rise, and feel the air. It feels thick, like it actually has a palpaple mass somehow. <br>\r\n  You pull out the flashlight from your pocket and shine it. The beam seems to actually get lost in the darkness. Walking in the direction of the beam, then you notice your shoes make no echo noise. For a place this large, it must echo, why is there none?<br>\r\n  \"Hello?\" you try. For a moment there is just the overwhelming silence.<br>\r\n   \"Who's there?\" you hear faintly.<br>\r\n   \"Where are you?\" <br>\r\n   \"I think it's the center of the room.\"<br>\r\n   You try to follow the voice. Sweeping the floor with the flashlight, you see faint footprints that you think must have been the hunched man. Something else is near it. As you explore further, you see lines and what look to be  ancient writings on the floor. They're no language you're familiar with. They go in a large circle.<br>\r\n  \"Hello?\" you hear again. As you swing the flashlight up, you see an old iron cage in the middle of the runic circle. In the cage is the little girl.<br>\r\n  \" You're the one that was following us.\" she said plainly.<br>\r\n   \"Uh, yes\" you swing the light up to get a better look at her. She looks like any blonde girl, maybe 10 or 12, but something about her doesn't look....right. <br>\r\n   \"Why are you here?\" you ask her, still trying to shine the light on her. You don't want to get any closer. Experience and instinct is telling you not to cross the magic circle.<br>\r\n   \"That man.. he's going to kill me! \" she whimpered. A tear goes down her cheek. Then you see it! Her eyes!  The irises are so dark, they appear black! It looks like she has one large pupil.<br>\r\n \"He'll kill me!\"<br>\r\n    \"Why?\"<br>\r\n   \"I don't know!\" she reached her arms out of the cage towards him. \"\"Help me, Mister, please!.\"<br>\r\n    \" I don't know if I can.\"<br>\r\n  \"You have to, or I'll die!

With those word, the girl's whole demeanor changes. She let out a long howl that seemed too loud for a girl of her size to make.<br>\r\n \"No, you fool!\" Her voice changed. It became, slippery,almost as if it could creep around the room. It had a presence that could be felt.<br>\r\n \"Do that and were both dead.\" It seemed to echo forever in your brain, reaching into it, compelling you to listen to it.

Subtle changes were happening to the girl. Her fingers were  lengthening. Her mouth was growing wider, and more slit-like. Soon, it seemed to go literally  ear to ear. Then a tongue came out.

It was long and warty, and at the end seemed to be almost another mouth, with 4 fang like projections guarding it.<br>\r\n \" It hungers!, That's why it's glamor is fading!\" yelled the old man.

You place a hand on the door knob, and you realize that your hand is trembling. You call out, \"Hello?\" You try to make your voice sound as friendly as possible, but you find it difficult to disguise a gnawing fear. <br>\r\n   'Hello?\" you holler out again. \"Anyone there?\" <br>\r\nYou peer down onto the dark basement steps. The scrapping sound suddenly stops. You rationalize that the sound must have been rats after all. You're high-pitched voice scared them into silence. But then you hear voices coming from another room. You can't decide if you're relieved or terrified that you aren't alone in the house. The voices are coming from another room, a dining room perhaps. You near the dining room door and the voices become more distinct. <br>\r\n   \"You can't kill the damn thing.\" An elderly man says. \"I tried... couldn't kill it with my shotgun.\" <br>\r\n   You hear a younger man's voice: \" I say we gather up all the women and children and take a stand, right here in the house.\" <br>\r\n   Who are these people, you're wondering. Take a stand against what? You open the dining room door and terror rushes from your face to tingled your arms. The room is completely empty of people. </span></div></div>",

The citizens usually keep to thier selves and only deal with \"outsiders\" when they really have to. You are a person {tourist, investigator, commuter} who is in the wrong place at the wrong time. Keep the story dark but imply what happens. Horror is about what you don't show. Keep the continuity of the story and have fun. I'm basing this on H.P. Lovecraft's work, but if you aren't familiar with his stories feel free to make stuff up. Just keep it in the horror genre and try not to let the main character know too much.</td>",
