Because of her bravery and strength in the previous battles she had been chosen as a subject in the military\u2019s new cloning project. With even one more soldier like her victory over the invaders was that much closer and easier to reach. But when Zelav\u2019s clone emerged from the chamber some accidents happened. Fortunately the clone, whom was now called Valez, was still sound in body and mind and still on their side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd soon enough the attack came. Round after round of laser blasts soared past Zelav\u2019s head as she sent blast after blast at the advancing hoard. \u201cDamn! There\u2019s too many!\u201d A male soldier beside her swore. \u201cStay strong corporal. We haven\u2019t lost yet.\u201d Zelav shouted. She knew he was right, there were too many enemy troopers for them to force back, but she also knew someone who could force the enemy to retreat. \u201cGeneral! It\u2019s Zelav, we need our special backup and we need it now.\u201d Zelav shouted into her communicator over the blasts and explosions. \u201cShe\u2019s on her way.\u201d The general replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelav smiled to herself as she resumed shooting, the enemy wouldn\u2019t know what hit them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon over the noise of the battle Zelav heard the sound of approaching footsteps, and as loud as they were she knew the enemy would hear them too. And it seemed they did as all the shooting stopped as every soldier on both sides, except for Zelav, tried to figure out what the sound was coming from. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they discovered the source of the noise, or rather it found them. A giantess that looked exactly like Zelav appeared. Zelav smiled as she heard the screams from the enemy, but she heard plenty from her fellow soldiers since none of them knew that Valez was on their side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nValez\u2019s armor was quite different from Zelav\u2019s and that of regulations. Valez was mostly covered with spare parts from old tanks and aircraft, but plenty of skin still showed; unlike Zelav\u2019s armor which was well streamlined and covered everything but her face, and that was protected by a mask and clear plastic eyewear. Valez kept an expression of calm concentration as she drew her weapon; a giant-sized pistol once again made from parts of an old tank, and opened fire on the enemy militia. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon men! Victory is ours!\u201d Zelav shouted as she resumed firing.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since Valez was so big she had to use an old warehouse for a bunker, and she still had to crawl into it. Zelav volunteered to sleep with Valez in the warehouse, originally as a show of good faith, but that soon changed. Zelav felt an odd yet non-frightening connection with her giant clone, one that was like the connection between sisters and that between a mother and her daughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Valez, you were great. You did quite well for your first time in combat.\u201d Zelav said as she started undressing for bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThanks, I just wish our guys didn\u2019t scream when they saw me\u2026\u201d Valez said as she removed the pieces of her \u2018armor\u2019, \u201cI guess I should be thankful that this was in the countryside and not a city. Those that wouldn\u2019t run and scream as I came would probably be staring at me as their noses bleed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust give \u2018em time to get used to you. General Macintyre set them all straight so you shouldn\u2019t need to worry about a repeat performance from the guys. Oh, by the way, Doc\u2019s coming soon to make sure nothing happened to your molecular bonds or something like that.\u201d Zelav said as she put on her nightgown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then there was a knock on the steel door before it opened. \u201cHello Father- I mean Doctor Hanson.\u201d Valez said, blushing in embarrassment. It was a subconscious habit of hers to call Doctor Hanson \u201cFather\u201d and occasionally call Zelav \u201cMother\u201d. Valez then seemed to realize she didn\u2019t have anything on and quickly covered her private parts with her hands and arms. Doctor Jim \u201cDoc\u201d Hanson was the scientist that brought Valez into being, and was a good friend of Zelav\u2019s. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEvening ladies. I heard that Valez did excellently at the front today.\u201d Doc said as he adjusted his glasses and strolled on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey said that?\u201d Valez asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot exactly, they said you \u2018performed\u2019 excellently, like you\u2019re some kind of tool.\u201d Doc said angrily, like Zelav he felt very strongly for Valez, even though she wasn\u2019t born like most humans he still considered her a person. \u201cAnyway, Dr. Burns tired to convince the big wigs to allow him to find the chemical formula that made Valez grow so he could create more giant soldiers.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelav sighed, ever since the accident when Valez emerged from the cloning chamber and knocked some chemicals from some shelves that eventually caused her to grow, Dr. Franklin Burns had been trying to get his hands on the formula. \u201cI hope they shot down his request again.\u201d She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLike a duck with no wings. Ol\u2019 Mac gave the costs of rations and material stuff the other generals wanted to hear.\u201d Doc replied. Zelav and Valez smiled, when such things came up General Macintyre would prattle on that Valez alone was costing a fortune to feed, and eventually clothe and arm, but all three of them knew he felt for Valez and wanted her to feel secure as an individual.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, enough of the news. I need to make sure nothing\u2019s going wrong with Valez. So I\u2019m going to have to ask you to relax and put your arms at your side Valez.\u201d Doc said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>     The next day Zelav got up early just before dawn which she was always accustomed to doing.  She looked out the scenic area past their military compound and she could she the remnant of the beauty of this alien planet.  She began thinking about the peaceful times of her growing up on Beta 6 a beautiful planet similar to Alpha Prime but 2.5 larger and a 37 hour day and 4 time longer year.  \"Hey this is the first quiet morning in months!  I bet those fagots were shitting in their pants when they saw Valez!\" she amusingly thought to herself.  \"Let get sleeping beauty up!  Valez up and Adam!\" Zelav yelled but Valez was dead to the world snoring so loud that she made steel door to warehouse rattle.  \"What the hell?  How am I suppose to wake the bitch up?  I know what will do the treat!\" Zelav said with a bit of playful malevolence in her voice.  She got the water hose that would have normally been used to extinguish a fire or hose the floor of the warehouse down but Valez had been using to drink water from and pointed her huge groin and shot the water full force.  For a normal sized person the water pressure would have sent a her sliding down the floor for several meters but for Valez with felt like someone turned on a faucet of cold water on her sensitive coddy.  \"Shit!  Have you lost your mind?!\" Valez yelled after being so rudely awakened.  \"Ha ha ha ha!  You stupid shithead its time to wake up.\"  \"Mother...I mean Zelav can't you be a little more subtle?\"  \"Valez you are a MEC [a name the marines called themselves taken from the M.E.S.C. Marine Extraterrestrial Space Core] there is no sweet good mornings bitch!\"  \"Whatever...and I was having a good dream too...\"  \"About a man? ha ha ha or are you into girls? Ha ha ha!\"  \"Well...not exactly...\"  \"Come on Valez give me all the details,\" Zelav said with great anticipation on hearing really juicy story.  \"Not until I have some breakfast I'm starving!\"  \"Okay don't be such a tight ass or 'mommie' will have to spank you ha ha ha!\"  \"Mother you are so crazy ha ha ha!\"  For some reason when Valez called her mother she felt something different, was it the way she said that was different she thought or was it because of this peaceful moment in this God forsaken war that she allowed herself to be human for a moment.  \"I'm right on it....hello mess unit?  This is staff sargeant Zelav I need you guys to send down Valez's liquid food supplement in the tanker right away...what you mean another hour?  Either you guys get off your lazy asses and get that tanker down here in the next 5 minutes or I can let Valez go and get the tanker herself...I thought you would see the light!\"  \"I have to go through this everyday.  Just because I'm big I still have to eat I like everyone else.\"  \"Don't let them get to you\"  \"I know mother...I know...Thanks for caring...\" for the first time Valez started to get choked up and a single tear formed in her eye and fell to the ground almost hitting Zelav.  \"Hey...that's what I'm here for..\" Zelav said as she patted shoulder.<br>\r\n     They both had their morning field rations which had not improved much down through the centuries.  \"I need to wash! I know I must smell God awful Z!\"  \"Yes you do ha ha..\"  \"Z can you do me a big favorite?\"  \"A girl your size can only get big favors ha ha!\"  \"Seriously mother, normally  they spray some sterilizing chemicals and they smell terrible I almost lost my lunch after one treatment!\"  \"That would have been a mess!\"  \"Ha ha ha Z you're too much ha ha!\"  \"I always aim to please, now what can I do for my big girl?\"  \"Can you hose me down with the water hose.  I would do it myself but my fingers are too big to work the controls.\"  \"I understand Boo.  I know General Macintyre will have a royal conniption for me using that much water but this planet has plenty of water.  Are you ready?\"  \"Yes mother.\"<br>\r\n     Zelav began hosing down Valez with the cold water.  She fussed and complained at first but her body got use to it.  Zelav began washing her face and her hair and rest of her body.  It took her almost 4 hours to completely wash Valez down.  \"Girl that is the last favorite I do for you! I am exhausted...I am going to get a shower....\"  \"The hell is going on here!\" Dr. Franklin Burns yelled!  \"Well it is so good to see you too Dr. Burns!\"  Dr. Burns had pulled strings to get aboard a star cruiser to come there.  Zelav had gotten a heads up from both General Macintyre &amp; \"Doc\u201d Hanson that the viper was on his way and they also came in the warehouse along with him.  Zelav felt for Valez who was embarrassed with them walking in on her like that unannounced and she wearing only the water that Zelav had dosed with earlier and trying to cover her breast and her groin and not doing a a success job at it to be assured.  \"Valez my deepest apology for this intrusion on your privacy but I would have allowed this civilian into this military unit unless it was crucial to this war,\" General Macintyre said with such tenderness that it was like he was talking to his own daughter.  \"This information which I am about to tell you is limited to we that are in this room, the secretary of Interstellar Defense and the United Federation of Planets President.  We have just deciphered a coded message from the enemy that have send for a secret weapon to neutral our secret weapon, being you Ms. Valez..  We have reconnaissance information to confirm that several heavy military cargo freighter have landed on the far side of the planet.  We don't know what they have in mind but it will not be good for you Valez or the troops. We cannot permit them to assemble whatever machine is.  Zelav you are to take Valez and a limited number of your best soldiers to go into their territory and destroy that thing.  I will leave it up to your discretion as to what equipment you will need to get that job done.  I suggest you get moving after twilight.  Any questions?  Gentlemen we will leave the women to prepare themselves for the mission,\" General Macintyre concluded.  \"But I was promised by the council that I would have full access to the test subject!\" Dr. Burns demanded.  \"All in good time after they complete their mission,\" \"Doc\" Hanson said as he &amp; the general escorted him out of the warehouse.  \"Can you believe that nerve of the guy?\" Zelav said.  \"I hate the way he looks at me. He gives me the creeks.  I bet you any amount of credits that he wouldn't twice about dissecting me to suit his purposes!\" Valez said with absolute disgust.  \"I would have to agree with you on that one.  We better get ourselves and the gang ready for this mission tonight.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Zelav adjusted the view of her night-vision goggles, focusing in on the enemy camp. \u201cYep those are military grade cargo ships.\u201d She muttered before turning to look at the task force. The dozen being gathered behind and beside her were some of the best units in the United Federation of Planets military, though only three of them, besides Zelav and Valez, really stood out. First off there was Yivra, a Tiragg, a red skinned black haired near-human species. Though Tiraggs were by nature pack beings, Yivra had stayed to herself occasionally speaking to others in a generally downward tone; at least until Zelav saved her life during the Naiga Campaign. After that she and Zelav became quite good friends. Then there was Vassk, a seven foot tall bipedal lizard-like Drashian. Vassk was one of the UFP\u2019s best units, his ability to see in the infra-red spectrum and discern an enemy\u2019s species by their scent, as well as being a cunning and ruthless warrior, made him an invaluable asset to the war effort. And lastly there was Nera; the only other clone besides Valez, except Nera wasn\u2019t fortunate, or unfortunate, to have a similar accident. And unlike Valez, Nera\u2019s template, another human woman named Aren, wasn\u2019t alive anymore. Such brought some sadness to Zelav; Aren had been her mentor through her years of training before becoming a field soldier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVassk, what\u2019ve you got?\u201d Zelav asked looking to her left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c[It is difficult,]\u201d Vassk replied in his growling dialect, his vocal chords unable to make the right sounds for Universal, \u201c[I smell the natives, like the ones in the attack yesterday, but the other scent\u2026 Wait, by the nearest transport. It is a Zex.]\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Zelav said refocusing her goggles to the spot Vassk mentioned. To her deepest fears, it was indeed a Zex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zexs were considered the stuff of nightmares. No one could tell what kind of being they were, whether mammal, crustacean, insect, plant, or whatever; in fact they seemed to be a bit of all. They looked like humans, except for their green skin, armor-like shells growing over their lower arms and legs, insect-like wings, and their tendril-like hair that some could move and grow at will. But the real thing that made the Zexs the terror of the galaxy was that they would assimilate \u201cworthy\u201d beings and brainwash or enslave, or simply kill the rest. The Zexs were infamous for their merciless advance from a secret and mysterious homeworld, and their hive-mind efficiency and behavior while still able to think and act as individuals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n{Author\u2019s note: Zex appearance based on this picture, it is not mine: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2010/084/c/d/Starcraft_evolution_by_Karbo.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2010/0...</a> }<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if the Zexs are here, that means we\u2019ve got to win this planet all the faster.\u201d Yivra said from Zelav\u2019s right. Zelav knew why Yivra was so eager: long before joining the UFP\u2019s military Yivra\u2019s homeworld of Tinagg, a Tiragg colony, had been overrun and assimilated by the Zexs in a few short days. Leaving Yivra an orphan as she escaped with other survivors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell then, let\u2019s go.\u201d Valez whispered behind the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c[Wait. I smell\u2026]\u201d Vassk started to say before Valez suddenly screamed in pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelav saw a few sparks from a powerful stunner-shock arcing across Valez\u2019s skin before Nera cried out \u201cAmbush!\u201d and the squad opened fire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDamn! It\u2019s a trap!\u201d Zelav heard Yivra shout before another stunner-shock rendered her unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelav moaned as she awoke, the lingering tingle of the stun-shock still coursing through her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMorning sunshine.\u201d Yivra said from Zelav\u2019s right. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZelav slowly turned to look. She and Yivra were bound by their wrists and ankles in an old stone cell by heavy iron chains. <i>The Zexs are quite nostalgic</i> Zelav thought before asking aloud, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, as you can guess the transports were fakes. The whole thing was a trap to lure some of our best soldiers into this trap the Zexs set up. I hate to admit it, but it worked quite well.\u201d Yivra replied, bitterly thinking of her failure and that of the squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are the others?\u201d Zelav asked, realizing as the stunner\u2019s effects wore off that it was only her and Yivra in the cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cVassk and the others were taken for \u201cre-education\u201d. I even saw them putting a brain-worm in Noven, not a pretty sight. But I think they may have decided to assimilate Nera. Which is likely\u2026\u201d Yivra answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhich is likely why we\u2019re here.\u201d Zelav finished. Unbidden, memories of stories of Zex assimilation from her childhood forced their way into her mind; none of the stories were pleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was almost an hour later when a Zex guard entered the cell. \u201cYou have a visitor.\u201d It purred before steeping to the side. Two more Zex guards stepped forward, dressed in finer armor than the first, then they too stepped aside. From between the pair of guards in stepped\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Valez is too big for your methods, there\u2019s no way for you to assimilate her.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zex queen turned to Yivra, outrage blazing in her eyes, \u201cWe shall see. Bring the human.

Underground and seeming carved from the rock, the chamber was cylindrical, about 200 feet in diameter then rising 100 feet before a dome ceiling started. In the center of the chamber floor held down by several large and heavy chains was Valez, still unconscious from the ambush earlier and striped of all armor and clothing. Zelav was unable to call to Valez as the two guards chained her to the wall. Zelav was facing Valez\u2019s right side and saw the queen move to stand by Valez\u2019s slightly agape mouth as other Zexs started entering the chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Zexs were seated the ritual began. The audience chanted in the alien Zex language, the queen would occasionally shout out a short phrase before going silent again. Zelav soon saw a wicked looking knife in the queens had. The queen turned to face Valez\u2019s mouth, and brought the knife down on the unarmored palm of her other hand. Metallic-blue blood burst out of the wound and leaked into Valez\u2019s mouth. Zelav guessed that similar rituals were done for assimilating regular size beings, but rarely was the blood sacrifice done by the Zex queen. <i>Their blood must be a mutagenic.</i> Zelav realized in horrified awe. The queen stepped back, accepting a purple colored cloth from an underling to bandage her wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ritual was over, now all there was to do was wait, and in Zelav\u2019s case hope that it didn\u2019t work on Valez.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She tore up the lab, throwing beakers of chemicals out windows, expensive equipment through walls.

Just with a tower around her body and one on her hair she walked into the room and sat on the bed to apply some creme on her body. Taking the pot and switching on the T.V. The news started. A war in Chibekistan and an economic explosion in a country she probably never will see - far away. The next one was video about a hostage taking of high ranked people in the society. An armed mob has assaulted a Party and now they wanted to pronounce their claims. Zelav was not really listening as she was busy with her own body but a sudden scream and a familar voice mixed with something she could not quite identify made her take a look at the screen. The cream landed on the bed and slowly rolled to the edge until it fell. Zelav was solidified as she saw the twisting black boot which now lifted the sole while the heel still stood on the ground. She could just get a short glimpse of what it revealed before the Screen went black with a beep. Two seconds later it showed the newsspeaker completly in shock. \"S-Sorry for this... Oh my god. That is just...\" He was speechless for seconds and was visibly fighting to calm down a little. Then he tried again. \"If you see this - please Zelav. Go to the local authorities or she will kill more - in similar ways.\" Then he got up and left. Zelav could not believe what she had heard and saw. She was still staring at her picture which had been faded in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had happened to Valez? She was not naked anymore and it seems that she had ganged people around her. It was obviouse that she wanted to kill her since she had dodged deliberate stomps more than once and had luck to still be alive but she had never killed a zivilian on purpose.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Cloning. The ability to create a copy of oneself. Finally, Aaron had completed the technology and processes necessary to make a perfect clone of an individual, with no side-effects. In a matter of weeks, his idea would be swept up by the company, and his patent would become their patent... well, whatever. At least they would give him a promotion, pay raise, etc. Aaron took a sip of his self-bought wine thoughtfully. The important thing was that he'd make an important contribution to society, and he was now set for life...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n And yet, something was missing. He dwelled on that thought with closed eyes for a minute or two before realizing what it was. Questions. He still had questions he wanted answered, and once the patent was taken, he'd never be able to answer them. For instance: If two different individuals led identical lives, would they have the same reactions to the same problems poised to them? Aaron Gregiro had always wondered that as a child and never found a satisfying conclusion. It was one of the reasons that he became so interested in this field as he grew up. Of course, now, he realized, such an experiment was impossible- to make identical fields for a child to live their lives in, even with cloning, would still take billions of dollars that he didn't- and wouldn't- have, even with his forthcoming raise. He lost most of his interest in that matter anyway. He grew out of it, he supposed. And yet, now, with his work completed, the question nagged at him again...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps he was being mischievous, perhaps he was genuinely curious, or perhaps he was just killing time, but Aaron decided to make a real clone with one of the blood samples he'd collected. The machines started up, the capsules buzzed, and Aaron was left with two babies which were perfect clones of each other in a matter of hours. He then took them to similar orphanages on different sides of the city and put them in. Many people would've thought this nothing short of despicable, toying with human life on a whim, but Aaron Gregiro was the kind of person who didn't really have a firm moral structure. It might have even been because of this that he had managed to complete such a project. Well, in any case, the deed was done, Aaron thought while driving. Years from now, in my early retirement, if I should be so inclined, I'll have something to look at. Well, okay, a large deal of this is being left up to random chance, but whatever it's not like there'll be any serious repercussions towards me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, he was fantastically bored; he now had nothing else to do. He brought up the programming code for his machines and ran through them again. Once again, like the many other times he'd done this, Aaron saw no mistakes. Scanning programs were fine, graphic data reconstruction programs were fine, enzyme, protein, and molecular distribution programs were fi-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait a sec. This one, the one for the left cloning chamber, had been exponentiated too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron looked at the program with a cocked eye. Here, it was meant to be raised to the second; apparently, his finger had slipped, and it had been raised to the twenty-second. He fixed the error, then ran through the software again with his estimation program. Okay, THIS time it checked out. But then what does that mean about the other program?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron make his mistake again, then ran the estimations one more time. His stomach instantly dropped into queasy hell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to the program, the cloned girl who came from the left chamber would store and duplicate nutrients and chemicals abnormally well, showing no outward physical changes or health conditions at all until the sixteenth year. At that time, the stored nutrients would release themselves, creating a massive explosion in development and growth far faster than normal speeds, for an unpredictable amount of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAaron had created a time-bomb teenager giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How... what...\" Aaron stuttered, then fell on a chair suddenly. He now understood very well what was meant by karmic retribution.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt isn't understood what happened to Aaron, but he was never seen again by his benefactors, who, not knowing how his machines worked or anyone else who could use them, deemed it a failure and closed down the experiment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth children were soon brought into decent homes, with decent families. If Aaron had cared any more about how his half-hearted experiment, he would've been pleased with the results, and how closely the developments related each other. Against all odds, they ended up going to the same high school. Fifteen years passed, with the girls' sixteenth birthday coming up very close...</span></div></div>",

It was like looking into a mirror for both of them; they both had the same long brown hair, the same green eyes, everything was perfectly identical. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other girl broke the awed silence first. \u201cHi, I\u2019m Laura. Laura Simmons.\u201d She said holding her stuff in one hand and holding out the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m Carolyn Lismore.

They both were adopted, Carolyn from the Happy Camper Orphanage and Laura from the Tiny Tots Orphanage on the other side of town, and they both had similar interests in fantasy and science fiction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, I think the only difference between us is that I never seem to get sick.\u201d Laura said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally?

He tried to explain what he knew, but all that medical mumbo-jumbo made me even more confused. All I could get out of it was that I seem to store and use nutrients better than the vast majority of the population.\u201d Laura answered with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThe closest I\u2019ve got to something that most people don\u2019t is a father that knows all the opening scrolls from Star Wars by heart.\u201d Carolyn joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere does our story go now?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

How\u2019s it going Carolyn?\u201d A red hair female doctor asked.<br>\r\n\u201cHiya Mrs. - I mean, Doctor, Gallanger. I\u2019ve been alright Is Laura okay?\u201d Carolyn replied.<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I couldn\u2019t find a reason for the pain she experienced. Given her medical history I would never have expected it. When did this happen?\u201d Dr. Gallanger asked.<br>\r\n\u201cIt was about twenty minutes ago when it started.\u201d Laura answered.<br>\r\nCarolyn glanced at her watch before saying, \u201cThat would have made it 10 o\u2019clock. Right as you turned sixteen.\u201d<br>\r\n\u201cAn odd coincidence. Almost as odd as what if found just a few minutes ago.\u201d Dr. Gallanger said.<br>\r\n\u201cWhat did you find?\u201d Carolyn asked.<br>\r\n\u201cI was looking at the blood samples we took from Laura and I discover that both of your genetic make-ups is exactly the same.\u201d Dr. Gallanger replied.<br>\r\n\u201cYou mean like, we\u2019re twins?\u201d Laura asked.<br>\r\n\u201cEven in identical twins this occurrence happens once in millions, and that\u2019s high estimated odds. I would think that one or both of you were clones if cloning wasn\u2019t beyond our capabilities.\u201d Dr. Gallanger said.<br>\r\n\u201cBut, wasn\u2019t cloning within humanity\u2019s grasp once?\u201d Carolyn asked.<br>\r\n\u201cOnce. But the only man that knew how to work his machine disappeared about sixteen years ago. The project was deemed a failure and no-one\u2019s tried it ever since. Well, Laura can leave in about half-an-hour. I\u2019ll see you around outside a medical setting Carolyn.\u201d Dr. Gallanger said before she left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019d you know that doctor?\u201d Laura asked.<br>\r\n\u201cOh, a couple years ago I busted my leg while biking. She was the doctor my parents brought me to. Isn\u2019t it incredible, we may actually be related?\u201d Carolyn replied.<br>\r\n\u201cYeah\u2026 that is way out.\u201d Laura said.<br>\r\n\u201cHey Laura, is it just me or do you look a little taller?\u201d Carolyn asked looking at Laura with a confused expression.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
