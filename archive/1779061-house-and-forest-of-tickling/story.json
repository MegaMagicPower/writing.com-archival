A group of girls found out a huge mansion there as they were hanging out together. Their homes were in the countryside of the city nearby. And those girls decided to go to the forest nearby which is the one I (narrator, I will only show up in this chapter) talked about just now. As they got to the forest, they found something really weird. \"First,\" Sarah said. \"It is way too cold here, I mean it is not cold, but the temperature it way lower then outside. It is supposed to be warm at the point of time wherever it is at this area.\" \"I agree. And that's why I'm wearing shorts and t-shirt now. ooh, well, don't ask why I wear my high-top converse. I just love them so much, and, we were coming to the forest.\" said Anna. Anna is a fashionable girl. She likes cool things. Although normally she likes cool jeans, it is a little bit too hot for jeans at their city in summer. Since Megan didn't have a chance to say anything now, she decided to say something. \"So, what shall we do, shall we try to get into this house and explore it or keep wandering in the weird forest? I have a feeling that if we stay here, something bad will happen.\" Interrupted Megan. <br>\r\nBefore we go on, I am going to talk about their clothes first. Anna is wearing her t-shirt and jean shorts, as well as her high-top converse.<br>\r\nSarah, another hot girl, is wearing a pair of boots (I have no idea about the style, u guys can talk about it), short skirt and her cool shirt.<br>\r\nMegan is like a normal girl, not that fashion, she is wearing her tennis shoes and jeans. She is not that afraid of hot days like Sarah and Anna.<br>\r\nWell, now, should the girls get in or not?</span></div></div>",

As the look at the house from outside, it has really old walls and just like a house from 200 years ago. However, it is fashionable and fancy inside the house. Suddenly, the door of the house shut. Boom! The girls got scared, they tried to push the door and escape, however, it is impossible. As the girls carefully look around after they found out they cannot get out, they found that the house is like a special \"space\". It is way bigger then it looks from outside. Suddenly, a voice came out, \"welcome to my house, ladies. Hopefully, you will have a lot of fun and.....jejeje, enjoy the \"fun\" my buddies bring to you.\" Then, the voice fate away. <br>\r\n\"hey, what the heck is this house\" Sarah shouted with anger.<br>\r\n\"Crap, let us out!!\" Anna and Megan shouted together.<br>\r\nAs they are shouting, some kind of liquid comes out from the crack between the main gate of the house and its fame. Megan was the closest to the gate, as the liquid touch her sneakers, it just went through the sneakers and touched her feet. However, she didn't notice that. Consequently, both Anna's and Sarah's feet touched the liquid. Then, the liquid disappeared just like it has never appeared before. No one know what that liquid was, except for the owner of the occult voice. He (She) knows that the girls body, especially their feet, are going to be extraordinarily ticklish<br>\r\nLooking forward, it is a long hallway. <br>\r\nSuddenly, the voice comes out again. \"Well, visitor, you can now go to pick your own room, and have a rest, we are going to have some real fun tomorrow. Don't worry about the time, the time here is different from outside.\" <br>\r\nwhat should the girls do? Explore? Rest?</span></div></div>",

The hall ended in a door that was locked. Whether it would continue behind the door or just open to the final room on the ground floor the girls could not identify.  A wooden staircase led up to the first floor. Sarah, Anna and Megan looked at each other, shrugged their shoulders, and went up. Each step yielded a cranking that would wake anyone or anything within the building. The noise of three young girls moving up the staircase was immense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah, who went up first, stopped half way. The other two girls almost ran into her. Sarah pointed upstairs. The twilight from windows out of sight barely allowed to spot a large cat sitting on the edge of the landing. Her green eyes shone like little stars in the twilight. Although three girls were coming up this way, the cat did not seem to go away. It just sat there. Carefully the girls moved towards the lending. When they were only a few steps away from the cat on the landing, the animal suddenly got to its legs, its back arched into a hump, and a surprisingly loud hiss came from the now open mouth. Sarah tried to shoo the cat away, but it did not flinch. Carefully the girls stepped over the cat, trying to avoid the still open mouth. When they did this, their bare legs and ankles came within reach of the cat's tail. They did not talk to each other about it later. Otherwise they would have noticed that the cat took effort to briefly touch each leg with its bushy tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lending seemed to be in the center of another hall that mirrored the one on the ground floor. Megan proceeded to go left, followed by her friends. She found a number of single or double bedrooms, dressed in varying fashion over the last two centuries. Some looked rather old and dusty, while others were almost of the style of a princess' bedroom. They found a beautifully styled and slightly larger bedroom with a wide bed, a wardrobe, even four seats next to a long tea table and a gold framed mirror. Anna decided that if they did not find anything better they should make this room their home base and possible bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls</span></div></div>",

After some time has past, Sarah wakes up, though the other two are still sleeping. She decides that she'll look around a little, but be back before the others wake up. She goes through a door and closes it quietly as not to wake the other girls. As she walked down the hallway her cowboy boots on the wood floor was the only sound to be heard. She came upon a door that was ajar. Sarah decided to take a look inside. But first, she smoothed out her short skirt and adjusted her sleeveless t-shirt. She pushed through the door and instantly realized it was a mistake. From above her poured cool green slime which coated her long brown hair and tickled all of her exposed skin. She actually thought it felt kind of nice. She couldn't resist it. She rubbed it all over her arms as if she was in a shower. She took off her one of her boots and rubbed the slime all over her foot. It felt so cool, and ticklish she could do this all day. Suddenly she realized, what am I doing? She put her boot back on and headed back to the bedroom the girls were sleeping in.

Right beside her size 4 feet, there are her converse shoes. \"Lucky, I didn't lose them. I really don't want to walk with my barefeet.\" Quickly stand up, grabbing her shoes, Anna is so eager to leave this room. Accidentally, she touches her pocket on her shorts. Her face became pale. Her wallet is still there, but her cellphone disappears. \"Where are my cellphone. F**k, my new iphone is gone!?\" After putting on her converse, she looks carefully on the ground for her cellphone. Unfortunately, it was really gone. But the lucky thing is that she found a note:<br>\r\nAre you looking for your cellphone? Is it gone? If you want to get to back, you can keep going in. If you don't, you can leave now. But remember, you may never get it back again. Oh, I need to warn you again, if you come, it doesn't mean you will get it back.

Her phone, being new, was just too expensive for her to replace right now.  \"I'll keep going,\" she says to the empty room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna hears a faint scrape to her left, and turns towards it.  A small table has appeared, with her phone sitting on it.  Anna immediately realizes if she wants her phone, she'll have to make it through the ticklish air to get to it.  She tentatively takes a step toward the table, immediately feeling the resistance of the feathery air as she tries to walk forward.  A glorious peal of laughter escapes her lips as she feels hundreds of feathers tickling every inch of her exposed arms and legs, almost making her stop again.  She had to have her phone, though, and she focused on it with every bit of resolve she could muster, taking another step towards the table, then another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she walks, the air begins to tickle her armpits, and forces it's way into the bottom of her shirt, making it billow out and up.  Anna's laughter intensifies as her sensitive bellybutton and armpits are tickled, in addition to her arms and legs.  It also flows into her shorts from the top, tickling her hips, then her inner thighs.  She's more than halfway to the table now, fighting the laughter even as she takes another step.  She can feel the air beginning to flow into her sneakers again, tickling her ankles.  Anna has the faintest sensation that she forgot something, but the intense tickling makes her forget the sensation as fast as she had it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air makes it's way past her ankles, into the bottoms of her shoes, and Anna laughs even harder as it begins to tickle her soles again, then finally gets between her toes.  It's getting harder to focus, the massive amount of tickling almost overloading her senses.  She's all of six steps away as the air changes tactics, changing into a mix of the feathery and slimy air, and Anna explodes with laughter.  The air is scratching, and rubbing, and caressing, and licking, all at the same time...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCan she get to her phone?  Does she lose something else in the process?</span></div></div>",

Anna, in sensory overload from all the tickling, focused so heavily on her phone, hasn't noticed how her clothing is moving as she fights her way through the air towards her phone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe air had managed to push her shirt completely above her midriff, the bottom of her bra showing, and continues to push it up.  Her shorts are working their way down her hips, the tops of her hipbones showing over the waistband, as they continue to sink.  Her Converses are slipping with each step, her bare heels first peeking above their tops, then smashing their heels down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith each step, the air pushes harder, and tickles more intensely, as Anna struggles towards her phone.  It feels like a tongue is running between each of her toes, and feathers are scratching her arches and heels, armpits, and knees.  Her bellybutton is being rubbed by the air and tickled with the very ends of the feathers.  The Mistress, watching via her magic, cackles at Anna's glorious peals of laughter, though she is slightly concerned by her drive.  She watches with delight as the air manages to push Anna's right arm up, forcing her sleeve over it.  Anna doesn't seem to notice as she presses onward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna stumbles the last few steps, kicking first her right Converse, then her left, off without realizing it, as she reaches for her phone.  As her hand finally closes around her phone, the tickling abruptly stops, leaving an exhausted, sweaty Anna to gasp for breath as she leans against the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt takes her several minutes to catch her breath, her skin tingling as her nerves slowly recover from the massive amount of tickling.  As her normal sense of touch is finally restored, and her breathing finally steadies, Anna looks at her phone and grins, then tucks it in her pocket.  She'd gotten it back!  She goes to take a step towards the exit, and stops as her bare heel thuds against the wood floor.  Anna looked down, first in surprise, then in dawning horror, as her bare toes wiggle against the floor.  She looks around, and finally realizes her shoes are gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother note sits on the table, which says, \"You know the rules.  Stay, or leave!  Your choice!\"  Anna groans as she realizes she probably should have just left her phone behind.  At this point, she's sweaty, completely exhausted, and sorely tempted to just leave, but she now knows the ticklish secrets the mansion holds...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she stay, or leave?</span></div></div>",

Soon she came inches from her phone, however not realizing that the air had her shirt completely over her bra and free of one arm, her shorts were to her knees and her heels were from out of her shoes.<br>\r\nThe air began tickling more rapidly in every space it could fine with what felt like feathers, tongues, and fingernails. The fingernails rapidly scratching her armpits and hips while the tongues licked her ears, belly button and in between her toes leaving the feathers to torture what was left. She stepped to reach for the phone but her shorts being almost completely down her legs tripped her causing her to slap the table knocking the phone off of it and into the darkness.<br>\r\n\"NOOOhehehehehe\" Ana screamed as she watched her phone disappear into the darkness. Mesmerized by her defeat, the air tripped her again knocking her on to the cold floor to be tortured by the ghostly tickling, she felt her arms be pushed up over her head as her shirt was pulled over her head. Hands grabbed her arms, free of her t-shirt and pinned them above her. Her shoes were quickly snatched off her feet and thrown into the darkness. However, the air seemed to struggle to take off her shorts. Meanwhile Fingers were scratching her inner thighs, armpits, and soles while tongues still tortured her ears, toes, and belly button.

After getting \"improved\" by the unknown liquid, she has a \"disadvantage\"---she is really ticklish. Also, she has only one sneaker, no shirt, no shorts. However, Sarah has her boots on, her t-shirt and her jeans. It seems that there is no way for Anna to win. After the first engagement, Anna falls on the ground, but Sarah also sits on the ground and gasps. This time, Sarah quickly goes towards Anna's one bare foot. With such a fast attack, Anna doesn't have time to react. Her foot is caught! Then, Sarah begins to slide her fingers on Anna's bare foot. \"hahahahaha...Sarah,hahahaha....we are.....friend....aren't...hahahahaha...we?\" \"....\" still not response but tickling. Without any hesitation, Anna quickly grabs one of Sarah's booted feet and tries to remove her boot. \"hahahaha....hahahaha...stop...hahaha...Sarah.\" She is still laughing. It seems Anna is begging, but actually she is just trying to earn some time for her to remove Sarah's boot. Sarah is kicking her feet, trying to get rid of Anna's hand. However, it is just impossible. After a while, Anna finally takes off Sarah's one boot. Although she is tickled a lot, and she is feeling really tired now, she has to tickle Sarah back. Anna quickly makes several scratch on Sarah's foot. \"hahahaha....hahahaha...\" now laughs Sarah. Then, Anna is trying to let her bare foot escape from Sarah so that she can use her legs to trap Sarah's foot and take off the other of Sarah's boots. Luckily, things are going just as Anna expect. Now, she successfully traps Sarah's foot and begins to take off the other of her shoes. However, Anna's converse-covered foot is also caught by Sarah. As Anna is working really hard on taking off Sarah's boot, her converse sneaker is already taken off. \"hahahaha...hahahahaha...noooooo...hahahaha...my feet,..hahahahaha...hahahahahaha...hahahaha\" Anna is laughing really loudly. It really slows down Anna's action and Sarah's foot escaped! However, that boot is already very loose. In order to protect herself first, Anna tries to kick Sarah. Fortunately, Sarah let Anna's feet go. After the second engagement, Anna is in a deep trouble. After a second, the fight keeps on. Anna rushes to Sarah and tickles her underarm in a sudden. Sarah slides onto the ground and her super loose boot slides off her foot. During this moment, Anna quickly jumps back to where Sarah takes off her shoe and grab the shoe. However, with her hand catch the shoe, Sarah catches her feet. As Sarah's hands touch her feet, it feels that time slows down. Then, something just come up from deep in Anna's mind: things are not supposed to be like this, I am supposed to be in the weird house. \"ping!\" with a sound that glass break, ber illusion breaks.<br>\r\nWhen she wakes up, she is not inside the flower anymore. She is safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens then?</span></div></div>",

Also, I was the one who tickled in the \"ghost box\".\" says Chris. <br>\r\n\"Why, why do you tickle me and then save me? I don't get it.\" says Anna, her voice is much better now.<br>\r\n\"Because I don't really want to tickle you. I want you to leave as soon as possible. I also don't want anyone else to be like me.\"<br>\r\n\"Hold on, what do you mean by being like you? Were you a real person?\" asks Anna.<br>\r\n\"Of course I was. Why I am like this now? It is all because of the mistress.\" says Chris, with anger.<br>\r\n\"what did she do? But isn't it nice to be immortal like this as a ghost? And you can tickle others\" says Anna. When she says the last sentence, her face gets a little bit red.<br>\r\n\"She tickles us and make us go through the illusion like you did just now. If we cannot wake up from the illusion, we will become the \"ticklish ghost\". Also, this is not immortal! People can tickle us easily. And we are thousands of times more ticklish than others, even than you.\" explains Chris.<br>\r\n\"But you can change shape, right? And you must have some ways to protect yourselves, don't you?\" asks Anna. She is a little confused.<br>\r\n\"We do, but our body is actually always there. If you have some kind of device, you can see that our body is still there and it is just hard to see us though. The answer for your second question is that we do wear clothes. For example, I am wearing my t-shirt, skirt and boots now. \" answers Chris.<br>\r\n\"I see. But, you said \"we\" just now, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, I did. There are many of us here. We are all girls who came to explore here before. But all of us were turned into ghosts. Plus, the clothes on my body is the ones I wore when I was turned into ghost. Once they are taken off now, I will not be able to put them on again for 3 days. In these 3 days, I won't have any protection on my body. It is awful! I am dead, so I cannot faint or something. I have to bear the tickling!\" says Chris, being really mad.<br>\r\n\"I am sorry to remind you of that. But why do you tell me this?\"<br>\r\n\"That's ok. I need your help. The only way to rescue us is to destroy the whole house as well as the boarder part of the forest. And only real people can leave the house. But I need to tell you, not every ghost is good. We need to tickle real people to prevent us from getting the punishment from the mistress.\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks, anyway.\" says Anna, with a smile<br>\r\n\"You r welcome. I will try my best to help you to get out of here.\" says Chris<br>\r\n\"Thanks again, but what should we do?\" asks Anna.<br>\r\n\"I don't quite know, what I do know is that there is a labyrinth. Inside this labyrinth, there are ghosts that completely obey the mistress. What you need to do is go through the labyrinth and get out. It will be really tough. But I will go with you.\"<br>\r\n\"All right.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, we are friends now, right?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes, hold on for a second, where do you put my shoes?\" asks Anna, with her bare feet on the bed. Her fingers are on her bare feet, slightly tickle herself.<br>\r\n\"You don't want me to tickle you a little bit more?\" offers Chris. \"Your shoes are over there.\" Chris points her finger to the corner of the room.<br>\r\n\"Um...nope thanks.\" As Anna is talking, she jumps off the bed and begins to go towards her converse sneakers.<br>\r\n\".....Do you want to know why your shoes are over there?\" asks Chris, trying to attract Anna's attention.<br>\r\n\"Nope.\" Anna stops walking, turns back and talks to Chris.\"<br>\r\n\"Because I will be able to tickle your bare feet more though.\" says Chris.

It says, \"Welcome to the tickly washer. You can see this means you are on the chair. Now, you are not able to move anymore. But don't worry....\" At this time, the chair locks her legs and arms up so that Anna cannot move anymore. \"let me go!! unlock it!!\" shouts Anna. Some time later, she finds it useless. Then, she keeps on reading the instruction. \"Don't worry, it won't hurt you. Maybe, it will be a little uncomfortable. If you are ready, press the button on your right. Hint: your fingers can touch the button. Notice: you don't need to take off any part of your clothes, if you did, the washing may make you really uncomfortable. Also, please make sure your shoes are tied tightly, they may fall off if they are too loose. Now, press button please....\" Right after finishing this part, she presses the button. She doesn't really care what is left there. Anna thinks she is all set, but she forgets that her shoelaces get untied during the fight in the dungeon...Since her shoelaces are hid under the tongue of her shoes, she didn't really care about that. Then, some kind of liquid comes out of the holes on the water, pretty soon, the liquid as high as her neck. The washing begins. From the same holes, many tiny little medal balls come out. They begins to moves wildly in the liquid. The little balls hit the clothes and take away the dirt from Anna's clothes. However, some of the balls come into Anna's clothes hit Anna's body inside the clothes. \"hahahahaha....get them out..ohohohohohohoh...hahahahah...it tickles...hahahaha..\" laugh Anna. After suffering for some time, the balls come out. Then, the cleaning goes down to her skirt, then, finally, her shoes. All the little balls begin to hit her shoes from the top towards the heel. About half of the balls get into Anna's high-top converse sneakers begin to hit her feet to clean her socks. \"hahahahah...hahahah....sto....hahaha..stop...not...hahahaha...my fee....my feet...hahahahah...\" Anna really suffers a lot from that. But this is not the end, since Anna didn't tie her sneakers well, one of the converse sneakers gets \"hit off\" her feet and flows to the top of the liquid. However, the balls keep hitting Anna's feet. \"hahahahaha...hahahaha...stop..hahahahahaha...no..hahahahahaha..stop it...hahahahahahahha...my sole..hahahaha..\"while she is laughing, another sneaker comes off, but lucky, her sneakers are clean enough now. Soon after that, the socks also get taken off. \"hahahahaha...my soles..hahahahaha..it tickles...hahahahhahahaha..ohohohohoh..not my.....hahahahaha..toes...hahahahahha..stop..hahahahahaha....\" Anna laughs like crazy. \"hahahaha....hahahaha....\" Anna keeps laughing for about 5 minutes. Finally, the torture stops and the liquid begins to go back to the wall. All the balls come back to the wall too. After the liquid is gone, her shoes and socks come back to the ground. They are really clean now. Then, she puts her ankle socks and converse sneakers on. This time, Anna ties her shoes tightly. <br>\r\nAfter that, Anna goes out of the room and swear in her mind, \"Damn, I will never come back to this room again. It is not \"uncomfortable\", it feels awful.\" <br>\r\nAt this time, Megan and Sarah are outside and waiting for Anna to come.</span></div></div>",

Right before they leave the room, a voice come out, \"if you leave the room, you will not be able to come back again. But there are going to be some other room like this. Are you sure you are going to leave? If sure, please go ahead.\" Then, the girls walk out of the room with a great joy. They are happy they may be able to get back to their home. At this point of time, a sign shows up in front of the girls: <br>\r\nWelcome to the tickle tunnel. Someone also call it the tickle labyrinth. As a gift for you girls, we have a warn. EVERYTHING MAY TICKLE. If you don't believe, you can try it. <br>\r\nThen, a map with a totally black background shows up. Nothing is on it except for some shining dots and a red dot. At this time, the words on the sign change. Another sentence appear on the sign, maybe we can call it a screen. It says: the shining points are shelters like the room you come out just now. And you are on the red dot. You may need the shelter somehow. And, that's all. Have fun.<br>\r\nAfter reading the sign, the girls regret a little bit. There are only 5 shelters in the labyrinth and they are far away from each others. Also, they only know the direction but not the way to get there. \"Anyway, we cannot get back then, let's just go! Come on\" says Anna. \"Wait, I need to check if what the sign says is true. If it is true, I am going to be in trouble.\" says Sarah. Then, she slips off one of her sandals and put her bare foot on the ground. \"hahahahahaha...ohohohoh...hahahaha...it tickles..hahahaha..\" laughs Sarah. Soon, she puts her foot back into her sandal. \"Oops, I guess I am in trouble now. It feels like something sliding and then dancing on my sole and my toes are like being rubbed. Also, I think there is a potential that my foot is going to be licked by something.\" says Sarah. \"God, we are in deep deep trouble now.\" says Megan. \"But..we cannot get back, damn.\" Megan keeps on saying. \"Well, whatever. We need to face it anyway, or we will be tickled forever. I don't want it at all.\" says Anna. \"All right, let's go for the next shelter first.<br>\r\nAs they are going, something is wrong with Anna's socks, those socks that were stripped from the evil ghosts feet....At the same time, a vicious comes out on the mistress's face. <br>\r\nwhat happens then?</span></div></div>",

Now, Anna's converse are still fine. She doesn't really notice that her shoes are getting looser and looser. Partly is she has been used to loose shoes, partly is because the shoes are loosen slowly.  Suddenly, one of Anna's feet partly slips out of her shoe. It is weird for Anna. Because she knows that she ties her shoes pretty well. Then, she checks her shoelaces, but they are still tied tightly. \"what's up, Anna?\" asks Megan. She sees Anna stop and check her shoelaces. \"Nothing, my shoes are getting loose now. I don't know why.\" says Anna. \"It sounds really weird.\" says Sarah. \"I know, I will figure it out gradually.\" answers Anna. As she was checking her shoelaces, Megan and Sarah were still walking. So Anna runs to the two girls and then she gives a poke on Sarah's waist. \"hahaha..stop, Anna, that's mean.\" complains Sarah. Anna is trying to relax. She doesn't want Megan and Sarah to worry about her. Only she knows that she is really in trouble. She cannot fiure out why her shoes are so loose now. When she was running to Sarah just now, her shoes almost slip off her feet completely. If her shoes are getting looser, she will have to spend more time on picking up her shoes and tickled by the ground then walking. After walking for a little more, Anna's converse are really loose now. Although her sneakers are well tied, but it feels like there is no shoelaces. Every step Anna walks, her shoes slips off one time. Also, when her feet get out of her shoes, the air tickles her feet really slightly. Finally, she steps out off one of her converse and her foot get on the ground. Suddenly, the great tickling strikes her. \"hahahahaha..ohohohohohoooooooooohohho....no...hahahahaha...ohohohhhhoooo..h ahahaha...sto...hahahahahaha..stop..hahahahahahahaohahahahaha......oohhohohhahah aha...nooooooo.hahahahaha...\" she cannot stop laughing. Now, her feet are like 100 times as sensetive as before. She laughs and lift the foot off the ground, slowly put them back into her shoes. She cannot touch her feet now. They are too ticklish. She knows that this is the socks fault. They are slipery now, and they make her feet sensetive. Finally, Anna makes up her mind. She decides to take them off. No matter how much tickle she is going to bear. But at the moment, a voice comes out. It is the mistress again. \"You love the socks I gave you, don't you? They are good for girls feet. I'm sure your feet are now soft and ticklish. Also, the socks have another feature, they can prevent the monsters from spoting you. Are you still going to take them off? Think about it. Bye\". Then, the voice fates away. Now, Anna really needs to think about it. Should she take them off and put her bare feet in her converse or not?</span></div></div>",

Although this may make the trip not that safe, it is still a better idea to take them off. Then, Anna sits on the ground and takes one of her converse off, slowly put one her hand on the top of the sock, trying really hard not to touch or, you know, tickle her foot. Now, she needs to make a hard decision, to take it off slowly and let it tickle slightly or take it off quickly and get a super powerful tickle for a short time. After thinking about that for a second, Anna decides to take it half off and then strip it completely. \"Damn mistress, damn trick.\" Anna whispers. As she is whispering, she begins to srip it, and her two friends are also looking at her, feeling weird that why she takes this that seriously. \"hahaha...hahahaha...haha\" When she is taking it off, it tickles really a lot. Anna thought she can stand it, but it is impossible for such a ticklish girl to stand that. At this time, the other two girls finally figures out how much tickling Anna has beared the whole way. In order to help Anna, one idea come out. They decide to make Anna lay on the ground and let Sarah hold Anna's foot so that she cannot move her foot, and let Megan takes her sock off. In a sudden, a light whipping noise comes and then fates away. Right, after that, comes a girl's laughing and her swearing. \"hahahahahahahahahaha...I hate you...Megan...hahahahahaha...it..hahahahahahaha...ohhhhohohohohohoh...hahahaha.. .so much....hahahaha..ooohhhhhh...my foot...hahahaha...\" the laughs lasts for about 10 minutes. Anna puts on the shoe and soon after that, a sounds of shoe falling on ground comes. Then, comes again Anna's voice, \"again? MY GOSH!! NOOOOOOO!\" And again, the whipping noice, and the laughing. But this time, it is much stronger. Because while Megan is taking off her the other sock, she gives her a bonus scratch on Anna's foot. It seems she is upset about Anna's swearing. \"hahahaha...sorry...hahahahaha..Megan...hahaha...ohohohohhh...my poor feet..hahahaha...\" this time, the laugh last for 15 minutes and then, right after Anna slid the foot into her shoe, not even have time to put it on completely, a weird noice comes from far away.....<br>\r\nwhat's then</span></div></div>",

The monsters know that the girls are here a long time ago, but they were afraid of the power of the socks. So they didn't come. But now, there is nothing to afraid of, so they are rushing to tickle the girls now. After spoting that, the girls decide to run (of course), Anna puts her shoes on and stand up as soon as she and begins to rush, as well as other two girls. However, the monsters come much faster than they do, also, they girls get tired soon. Just in a few minutes, they monsters get really close to the girls. But luckily, a room appear in front of the girls. It is the shelter! They find it, in such a great danger. They enery just comes back to the girls and they run faster than before. However, Sarah doesn't notice that her slippers are going to break. About ten meters away from the room, a whipping sound comes from Sarah's slipper. They are broken. The next moment, Sarah's senstive feet touch the tickling ground. As Sarah feels the great tickling on her feet, she slips and falls on the ground, it is just 1 meter away from the door of the room. And both Megan and Anna are in the room now. Sarah's hands, feet, legs are all touching the ground, she is laughing crazily. \"hahahahhahhaha...help...hahahahaha..me...Meg.....hahahahaha...Megan...hahah aha...Anna..hahahahahaha...hahahahahaha...\" Both Anna and Megan notice that Sarah is still not in the room yet. They both give Sarah a hand and begin to pull her intp the room. It works pretty well. Anna and Megan successfully pulled most part of Sarah into the room, and on her feet are outside the room then. However, the monsters arrive at this point of time. They grab Sarah's feet and begin to tickle them. \"my...hahahahahaha...hahahahahahaha...feet...hahahahaha...are..hahahahahaha. ..still..hahahah..hahahahahaha...out...hahahahahahaha..outside..hahahahaha\" Sarah is laughing as her feet are tickled. Some of the monsters begin to lick her feet. It is even worth than tickling. Some of the monsters are even trying to pull her out of the room. Since then, Anna and Megan are pulling harder.<br>\r\nCan Anna and Megan save Sarah? What is inside the room? The answer will be in the next chapter</span></div></div>",

They don't want their friend to be tickled forever when they are out. Although they are going to come back to destroy the haunted house. As they pull harder, more and more monsters begin to tickle Sarah. They tickle her underarm, and they draw weird shape on her feet with their claws. However, they don't pull Sarah that hard anymore. With that being lucky, Sarah is getting closer and closer to the room. Finally, in a sudden, Anna and Megan pull Sarah into the room and the monsters cannot get her anymore. Sarah is still laughing. \"hahahahahaha...hahahaha\" partly is for her great ticklishness, partly is for her great luck of being saved by her good friends. Gradualy, they calm down and begin to explore this room. Same as last one, there are some clothes, but the different part is that there isn't a place to wash their clothes. However, beside the exit of the room, there is another door, says, \"ticklercoaster\".  Of course, there is a sign for it:<br>\r\nThis is an roller coaster. Maybe you should try to relax by taking it. After taking this, you can get a mark and you can exchange gift by showing the mark.<br>\r\n\"Sounds like fun. We should try it.\" Says Sarah. She is back to normal now. <br>\r\n\"Sure, we will get the gift. The gift sounds good.\" says Megan.<br>\r\n\"um..Fine..But, I am a little afraid of height.....\" says Anna.<br>\r\n\"Come on..You will be fine.\" encourages Megan and Sarah.<br>\r\n\"Fine, I will try it.\" answers Anna.<br>\r\nActaully, here comes a question, should Sarah put on some shoes or not.

Then, they get into the room of \"ticklercoaster\".<br>\r\nIt is a big room, but the only thing inside it is a roller coaster. The roller coaster looks exciting. The highest point is like 500 feet high. Then goes down 300 feet. It also seems that it is really dangerous. However, those two crazy girls just love this kind of roller coaster. They get onto the roller coaster and Anna looks really scared. But those two girls begin to \"bully\" her and tell her if she doesn't want to have a ride, she will get tickled forever. At the same time, Sarah put her hands on Anna's converse-all-star. Then, she says, \"well, if you don't take a ride, they are going to be mine.\" Under Sarah's bullying, Anna has to take the roller coaster. They put on the seat belt and whatever they need to put on. But none of them noticed that there was a sign by the door says that ride with shoes on is not allowed.<br>\r\nHowever, the ride still starts.

Just the oppisite, since they are small, they tickle harder than bigger ones. As well, it is hard for people to find them because they can change their color as the color of things around them change, kind of like chameleons. Now, the girls have already fastened their seatbelt and they are holding they hand tightly on the handles which locate on the side of the door. There are two seats every row, and this is a door-like-thing on each side of one row. They are designed to protect the rider from droping from the side of the roller coaster. The girls are excited. They have been nervous for so long. They think that they are going to relax themselves. However, some even worse situations are waiting for them. For example, now, the roller coaster has just started, and the feathers begin to move slowly on their sole. They are moving too slowly that the ticklish girls even haven't noticed that. Later, the roller coaster is going upwards, to the first high tide of this ride. The girls are feeling a little nervous then, there is a little sweating on their hands. They keep their eyes wide open and waiting for the sudden accelerate and the sudden delight. Sarah begins to shout to show her great joy but just in a sudden, her voice turns to laugh, and swear. \"Wow!!!!! ahahah...hahaha....ah..hahahaha..what the...haha..hell...!!!\" However, Sarah was not the only sufferer. Both Anna and Megan burst into laughters too. Their hands are now totally off the handle which is a really dangerous thing to do on a roller coaster. But they cannot think that much. All what they know is ticklishness. Great ticklishness. Small drops of tears fly into the air and fall onto the ground from place 200 feet away from the ground. The small feathers quickly slide on the soft soles of the girls.Their feet are so tender after running for so long and being encased by the shoes. The girls close their eyes to prevent the tears from keeping bursting out. It is not crying. They just laugh too much and tears just go with the laugh. They want to take off their shoes and scratch their feet but it is not an option for the girls in such a situation. Obviously, the safety protecting devices are not going to allow them to bend down and take off their shoes. The only option is to bear the tickling and laugh out loud. Even more unfortunately, as the roller coaster going faster and faster, the feathers are moving faster and faster. They are now shuttle back and forth inside the girls' shoes, sometimes going between their toes. When the cart reachs the very bottom of the roller coaster, Anna cannot bear it any more and she just tries to jump off the cart! It is so dangerous. But at that moment, some bright light burst out from Anna and when the light fates away, both Sarah and Anna disappear, leaving only Megan on this roller coaster. However, at this moment, the torture stops. The little feathers come out of Megan's shoes and form a circle. A couple seconds later, a anklet shows up. Also, they same thing happens to Anna and Sarah who are now at another place....<br>\r\nWhat's going on next?</span></div></div>",

She bolts to her feet, looking for the source of the noise, and says, \"Guys, we have to go NOW!\"  Without hesitating to hear their responses, or even to get her left shoe on properly, she heads off down the path again.  Megan and Sarah's complaints die on their lips as they realize they have to stick together with Anna, and they hurry to catch up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the monsters can feel that the socks no longer protect the girls, and they begin to follow them.  However, they can tell the girls are somewhat close to a sanctuary room.  They decide to continue to make noise at random, and hopefully drive the girls farther from the room, before they pounce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna explains to Megan and Sarah about how the socks were protecting them from the monsters, and that they should try to get to the safe room.  Another howl in the distance punctuates Anna's explanation, driving the girls onward as quickly as they can walk.  It isn't long before their rapid pace begins to cause problems for Anna and Sarah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna is the first to have a problem.  She'd been dragging her left foot with every step, since she'd simply smashed the back of her left shoe beneath her heel, turning her converse into a very loose sneaker mule.  She'd kicked her shoe several feet down the path, the glorious peals of her laughter as her bare sole hit the ground echoing through the labyrinth.  It was several minutes before she finally managed to push her foot back into her shoe, the rough material tickling her sole faintly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah was fighting her own problem.  Ever since she'd  placed her bare right foot on the ground, she'd had the sensation that something was sliding and dancing against her sole.  Her sandal had felt slicker after that, too, and she'd been having some difficulty keeping it on, which had only gotten worse with every time she'd stepped out of it.  Again, her right sandal shot off her foot, landing almost twenty feet down the path, and, again, Sarah was almost immobilized by the ticklishness of her foot, before she finally got her sandal on again.  She really wished she had chosen sandals with a heel strap right about now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this moment, the girls hit a 'T' intersection, and could go left or right.  Anna really wanted to fix her left shoe, but another roar resounded from behind them, sounding closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes Anna think she has the time to fix her shoe?

More claws hook into the waistband of her shorts, seeking her sensitive hips and lower back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFortunately for Sarah, this means the monsters aren't pulling as hard, and Anna and Megan finally manage to drag her into the room!

The miniskirt only went to her upper thighs, leaving her legs entirely exposed.  What really excited her, though, was the shoes she'd found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were a pair of flat sandals, with a couple of quarter-inch wide straps that went over the ball of her foot, just behind her toes, and two more at the heel.  The heel straps attached to the sole just in front of her heels, to either side, and were designed to be pulled around the back of her feet, just above her heels.  They crossed there, then wound around her ankle a couple of times, and were tied off.  The soles were unique, too.  They were a very thin piece of leather, maybe 3/8ths of an inch thick.

There was a brief flicker from by their feet, and all three girls gasped as they suddenly felt the cool, smooth floor beneath their bare soles.  \"Very well,\" the Mistress' voice came back to them, \"Enjoy your walk!\". A faint cackle was heard as her voice faded away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a really bad feeling about this,\" Anna mumbled, as she wiggled her toes against the floor.  \"It won't be that bad,\" Megan replied, looking down at her exposed toes.  \"We just have to stick together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah looked at both of them, grinned, and said, \"Come on!  We can't wait here forever.\"  She headed for the door before Anna or Megan could add anything else, and they both hurried to follow her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out the door, the girls could feel soft, damp dirt beneath their bare soles.  True to the Mistress' word, it didn't tickle them at all, though they could feel just how sensitive their feet had been made.  It felt almost like the dirt was caressing their soles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking ahead, the girls could see where an old stone path had run, before parts of it had disappeared into the ground.  Muddy puddles littered the patches in between, and grass lined the sides of the trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This doesn't seem so bad,\" Anna stated, and she led the way down the trail.  Sarah and Megan followed, quietly listening as they padded onto the first stone patch, before stopping as they saw the giant muddy swatch between them and the next chunk of pathway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way we can jump this,\" Sarah noted, looking at the nearly 5 meter gap in the stone path.  Megan responded, \"I'd rather not get my feet all muddy.  This is bad enough.\"  She lifted one of her size 8 feet, showing her dusty pink sole to Anna and Sarah.  \"Let's cut through the grass.\"  Anna shook her head.  \"The Mistress said the ground won't tickle us.  I'm not keen on getting my feet muddy, either, but I'd seriously doubt the grass counts as ground.

The floor was rougher than they were used to, and they could see one spot where it looked to get rather narrow.  There also seemed to be random small tunnels dotting the walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore they set off, Anna turned to a small protrusion of rock on the floor.  \"Let's see what the Mistress meant by 'much less durable.'\" Anna gently rubbed the sole of her right shoe on the ground, then equally gently, rubbed the inside of it, next to the ball of her foot, on the protrusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned so Sarah and Megan could see her shoe, then lifted her foot.  All three girls gasped at what they saw.  There was a scuff in rubber sole, where Anna had brushed the ball of it against the ground, that looked like she had vigorously rubbed it for an hour or so.  Where she'd brushed the side of her foot against the rock, they could see her pink skin through a two-inch split between the sole and cloth upper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I really think this was a bad idea,\" Megan stated, looking at her Nikes.  \"We're going to have to be really careful, or this could get bad fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah swallowed, steeling her nerves.  She enjoyed the idea of risk, but this seemed nearly impossible.  If she pulled this off, she'd be estatic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the girls carefully approached the narrow gap, stepping gently, they could see that the path was just as rough on the other side.  Megan volunteered to go first, as she was the tallest, and best-endowed of the three.  If she could make it through, Anna and Sarah would be fine.  Turning sideways, she began to edge through the gap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes she make it through, or get stuck?  And what of those tunnels along the walls?</span></div></div>",

Where she scraped the wall on her back left a 4 inch diameter hole, where the fabric of her t-shirt is beginning to fray and fall apart.

The door disappeared behind her.  Her path through the labyrinth looked like a jungle.  Leaf-covered vines covered the walls, creeping through thick, tall grass towards the narrow line of the path before her.  It was an old, decrepit stone path, made up of a bunch of randomly-sized stones seemingly just thrown down in no particular order.  None of it was even, and entire sections of the stone seemed to have been swallowed by the muddy ground beneath them.  Sarah shuffled her feet gently, feeling the texture of the stones beneath the extremely-thin soles of her flimsy sandals, as she realized their smooth soles afforded nearly no traction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she carefully started down the path, tentatively checking each stone before placing her foot down, she felt like there was something near her, though she couldn't tell what.  She looked around, and realized the vines were reaching towards her as she walked!  If she moved too slowly, they'd reach her.  If she moved faster, she risked slipping and falling, or breaking her flimsy shoes.  She could see an intersection in the path about 50 meters in front of her, that looked fairly clear.</span></div></div>",

She dodged a vine reaching towards her from the front, stumbling as the toe of her left sandal snagged the edge of a stone.  A faint *SNAP* accompanied that, and she suddenly felt the cold, smooth edge of the stone digging into her foot beneath her toes as she pushed off with her left foot, leaping over the last patch of mud into the intersection.  A giggle escaped her lips as it felt like a dozen fingers had gotten beneath her toes, but the sensation was gone as fast as it had come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat oh-so-brief tickle had caused her to go slightly off-balance as she jumped, the shock of it briefly breaking her concentration for a brief moment, and she landed heavily on her right foot, which slid sideways as she skidded to a halt in the middle of the intersection.  Another *SNAP* sounded as her right heel suddenly slid off the leather sole, touching the smooth stone underfoot.  Sarah laughed again, her ticklish skin feeling as though it had ants crawling over it, as she twisted her foot sideways to get her heel back on the sole of her sandal.  She gasped for breath and wiped her sweaty brow, giggling slightly at the thrill of the run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking back, Sarah could see the vines coming her way still, though it seemed she had a few moments before they would reach her.  She took a brief moment to glance at her sandals, assessing the damage they had received.  Her left sandal had broken a strap over the toe, leaving just one to hold it to the ball of her foot.  Worse, she'd cracked the sole just behind her toes.  It hadn't come off, just bent backwards, splitting the leather such that it flapped beneath her foot when she raised it.  Her right sandal had broken the outer strap by her heel, right at the sole.  While it was still tied, the one remaining strap wouldn't keep her heel on the sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up, she could see the stone path continuing to the left, though it seemed to fall into even worse disrepair as it continued, and was lined with more grass and vines.  To her right was an extremely narrow, muddy, puddle-dotted track, lined with tall grass.  It didn't seem to have any vines on it, though, and appeared to head to a pond in the distance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking behind her at the approaching vines again, Sarah debated whether she had a moment to try and patch her sandals up, or if she needed to move on...</span></div></div>",
