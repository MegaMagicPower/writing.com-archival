Her puckered anus although properly cleaned still gives off the smell of shit and is pulsating like it wants Zac closer and thats exactly what happens a second later when he's slammed against it. Its hot and sticky from the sweat dripping down Sophie's buttcrack and its almost twice as big as Zac tiny body and the only thing he can do is grab on tight to the folds of her butt skin and hope he dont get dragged in further to the depths of Sophie's colon.<br>\r\nHer anus quickly contracted sealing Zac  inside her ass. He try to struggle out but her butthole is like quicksand and he find himself up to your shoulders with his arms stuck inside her with his head just barely sticking out. The anus sucks and slurps on Zac like a cild sucking on a loilpop causing him to whimper.

I'm not that stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZac climbs up Mark leg and then him stomach and chest with no problems. he considers climbing his lips and trying to be seen in front of his eyes but the risk of getting sucked up Mark's nose or licked into his mouth makes Zac shiver with fear. \"I dont need to be a snack to my annoying friend. The last thing i want is to see is what the othim side of his belly looks like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Zac gets to Mark's long strands of blondn hair, he finds a little difficulty in climbing but he wraps the thin hair around his arms and pulls himself up.
