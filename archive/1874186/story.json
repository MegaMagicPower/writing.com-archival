I just got home from my first job as a Cashier at a gas station and I get the weekend off. I am planning to go to college after summer to become a Earth 2 Officer. I got the idea when I was 13 from Centauri who has always made sure we all wake up at a certain time. Centauri is our family guardian but she has taken up more simpler tasks than blowing Nashtonville soldier heads off. Now she helps mom around the house usually and the only violent thing I have seen her do is almost crack a boys skull in half in grade 5 when he beat the shit out of me and threatened to kill me, Centauri thought he was serious and kicked the kid in the side of the head, The kid is still in a coma today from that day and no charges were filed against Centauri since by law if you shout to someone \"Im going to kill you\" then you have the right to kill them right there in self defense. Earth 1 has really cracked down on laws recently, If your caught littering your fined 600,000$, If your caught with a knife in school, even if its in your bag your arrested and fined for Violence serving 4 years in a juvenile school, Oh yeah and theft is charged by Murder so if your caught stealing something you get injected with C2X44 which can kill you in 2 minutes or you are killed by firing squad. Due to this Crime rate is almost 0 and the worlds are finally at peace. My sister Teresa however thinks that we are just living under fear and she despises Centauri. So Over the years I am Centauri's favorite, Centauri has the attitude \"If you respect me I respect you, If you treat me poorly I treat you poorly\" attitude. She is also a great helper at science and math homework. My parents have it easier than other parents. They get a Robot that can fight against 3 thousand humans alone easily to defend there family and it has no problem helping with cleaning and children since it knows exactly what to do to calm a screaming baby down. by scanning its brain activity. My father has taught me for a long time how to fight and since that day Centauri kicked that poor kid in the side of the head she has taught me Military techniques as well. My uncle Colonel Andreas Drachen however has taught me about War tactics and how to disappear in different environments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat my plan today to do is to play Victory Conquest which is a Conquest game based on the Nashtonville war. The Soul Catchers and Vinichi family does not exist in the game because they are not famously known. Although there are information pages about them on the internet from what people know of them but it is all very vague. All that people know about them is that they are assassination organizations with one being more honorable than the other (The Soul catchers will kill the innocent). My family knows alot more about them than people who research them and are trying to find them. For example people think there headquarters is in China when it really is in Japan from my fathers info. The game loads and I smile before logging in and beginning to play.</span></div></div>",

You bastard!\" I say as my fighter jet begins losing control and it barrels into a building causing a loud explosion that causes other players on the ground's characters to fall from the shock. \"haha! got you Alex\" says the Neighbors kid and I go back to the character menu to see Centauri as an option for me to use and I smile before clicking it. I control my avatar version of Centauri to begin shooting down fighter jets on the game but for some reason everyones fighter jet stops dodging and instead they drop to the ground slowly meaning they have gone AFK. \"What the hell?\" I ask over the microphone before I move the avatar down onto the ground and I see everyone is now Afk. \"Uh...\" I say before a fur covered arm wraps around my neck in a head lock and yanks me away from the computer. \"The Fuck!\" I shout before I manage to get my pocket knife from my jeans and I open it up with my left hand before I stab backwards into what ever is holding me's face and I hear a yelp before it lets go of me. I quickly turn around to find the person who was holding me is a male wolfkin standing 6 feet 6 inches tall and with some muscle. He has black fur and the odd thing is he is wearing human clothing. He wears a pair of camo pants and a black jacket with a hoody underneath and he snarls at me. \"Centauri!\" I say but there is no answer so I quickly begin sprinting towards the kitchen. I get a glimpse of the clock on the stove which reads 2:35 AM. I rip open the fridge quickly before I grab a pistol behind an Arctic breeze can and I aim it at him before pulling the trigger and sending a bullet inbetween his eyes. He collapses to the ground with blood leaking out of his skull and I sigh before I hear a noise to my left and I quickly turn just in time to see another Wolfkin holding a 2x4 board and smacking me in the face with it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>I slowly open my eyes to find myself on my knee's with my hands tied behind my back inside some kind of dimly lit cave while we ride through it on old styled train tracks and we are on wooden platforms that hold us on them with Wolfkin watching us and holding Earth 1 guns beside us. The cave is dimly lit by lights along the roof of the cave and from how long the tunnel looks we are going very deep into a mine or a mountain. We eventually reach the end of the tracks which have 40 Wolfkin standing and holding rifles and looking right at us. However one stands out over all. She is a female Wolfkin standing 6 feet 3 inches tall with amazing Obsidian fur (Midnight black). Her eyes are silver like star light and she looks younger than alot of the other Wolfkin, Judging from Science class she looks about my age. She is wearing a pair of black jeans along with a black officer jacket that has white circles around the sleeves and the jacket hangs down to her knee's. She is smiling at us which makes me curious. All I am wearing that is left is a blue t-shirt, Black jeans and black tennis shoes with a pair of dog tags my father made a few years back. The train cart thing stops a few feet infront of the Wolfkin's and then the female one begins walking infront of the rows of people. \"What do you want with us?!\" screams a woman before the female Wolfkin looks at the woman as she speaks and then growls before walking over to her and then back handing her across the face. \"Shut up!!\" screams the Wolfkin and the Woman stops speaking with tears now running down her eyes. \"I am General Rain Silvarz, You are now all slaves to our Organization\" says Rain Silvarz and a Man stands up. \"Not a good Idea\" I whisper before he begins talking. \"Listen, We are not slaves!, We are human be....\" begins the man before he throat is grabbed by the Wolfkin who digs her claws into his neck brutally causing blood to drip down his neck. She growls in his face before leading him to the wall and then smashing him against the wall. She takes a laser pistol out of its holster on her belt before pressing it to his head and pulling the trigger before he falls limp and collapses to the ground causing some people to scream. \"SHUT UP!!\" screams the Wolfkin growling and Everyone becomes quiet. \"Now!, What I recommend you all doing is shutting your fucking mouths because if you don't Ill fucking kill you!, Now stand up!\" she yells and everyone rises to there feet before she points to a hallway. \"Down the hallway!\" she commands and we all begin walking.</span></div></div>",

Each time it hits the wall a small part of it falls to the ground. I can hear other bangs echo through the caves from other pickaxes and I turn around to look at the Wolfkin. \"Are you gonna stand there all day?\" I ask and he crosses his arms continuing to watch me and I sigh before continuing to bash the pickaxe against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>4 hours later....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI drop the pickaxe and I can't take it anymore. \"Replacement!\" shouts the Wolfkin before grabbing my shoulders and dragging me on the ground and out of the cave where another man is pushed into the cave where I was. The Wolfkin drags me down a long stone hallway that is dimly lit before opening a wooden door and throwing me inside. I sit up and I find myself stuck in a room full of other people from my village all of them looking exhausted. \"what the hell\" I say before I notice my grandfather. \"Grandpa!\" i say jogging over to him and he looks at me. \"Alex? Thank god your safe!, Where are your parents?\" he asks and I shrug. \"We have to find a way out of here\" I say and he nods. \"I have a plan\" he says.</span></div></div>",

My grandfather is wearing a ripped up black jacket, a pair of blue jeans and black workboots. My grandfather is a bit over weight with a greyish black goatee and short black hair. \"Lets keep this quiet\" says my grandfather and I nod before he begins whispering. \"I know where we are, We are near Mount Kroshaar, Most people were knocked out, I wasn't, I faked\" he says and I nod before I have a question on my mind. \"where the hell was Centauri?\" I ask. \"I took her to get her upgrade from the government earlier, I told you but you were busy playing some game so you didn't hear a thing\" he says and I nod. \"Alright, Where is she though?\" I ask and he shrugs. \"Probably looking for us by now, When we get out however we will need to inform the Wolfkin on our situation\" he says and I nod. \"Who do you think is behind this?\" I ask and he chuckles. \"Nitari Silvarz, I know it for sure, You know that Wolfkin with the Silver eyes we saw? Thats her daughter\" he says before picking up the bone of a dead animal and snapping it in half with his knee. \"make this sharp\" he says handing me one part of the bone and I begin rubbing it against the stone floor trying to get it as sharp as I can. \"When we get these sharp, We strike and run, If I fall you keep running\" he says and I nod before another prisoner walks up. \"What are you two doing?\" he asks. \"Making a tooth pick\" says my grandfather and the Prisoner looks at us weird before walking away.</span></div></div>",

We wait for a whole hour before the door finally begins to unlock and then opens and we tackle a wolfkin with black fur wearing army pants. I raise my knife above my head and I bring the point down into his neck causing his blood to spray out of his neck. I rip the knife out before my grandfather helps me up and we begin sprinting down the caves. My grandfather leads me left, then right, and then left again and again till we reach a large open area with hundreds of Wolfkin down below sitting at tables and eating and talking. \"Stay silent\" says my father before the two of us begin to scale along the wall towards an open exit with one guard standing outside looking in the opposite direction. My grandpa crouches down and begins making his way towards the guard who he stabs in the neck with his bone knife and then throwing him down the mountain. \"Come on!\" he says in a hushed tone and I follow him outside. The view is beautiful, It shows hundreds of mountains in the distance and there is a fresh layer of snow on the ground. \"Lets go\" he says before we begin to climb down.</span></div></div>",

I can feel the chill of the ice through my jeans and I take a deep breath before pushing myself forward. The closest thing I can say to explain what it feels like is a fighter jet going mach 10 straight down to the ground in a nose dive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI say my prayers as I begin sliding almost straight down on a sheet of ice and struggle not to try to stop myself because I know that, that is not what you ever do on these things. I lay back and I begin going increasingly faster before the Kroz Slathk cuts to the left and I slide up on the wall almost over the edge before the slide begins flattening out and I let out a breath of relief and soon it slows down enough for me to get out. My grandpa is right behind me and he overshoots the exit causing him to roll across the ground laughing. \"That was actually alot of fun\" he says and I smile before he points into the forest. \"Wolfkin city is that way, including the closest town, Lets go\" he says and I nod before we begin running.</span></div></div>",

My uncle is wearing a Colonels Uniform which is made up of a trench coat that hangs to his shins and has 3 blue stripes around the sleeves and around the bottom of the jacket. He has all of his metals on the left side of his jacket over his heart and he has an officer hat sitting on the table. My uncle has never married since he spends all year at Luna usually and wouldn't have time for a wife. \"So, Nitari's back?\" he asks and I nod. \"Yes, We need you to bring some soldiers to save the people\" I say before his coffee arrives and he drinks it black with no sugar. \"Can't do that\" he says and me and my grandfather Gawk at him. \"What the hell do you mean?\" I ask and he looks up. \"Exactly what I said, Centauri is all the help you need and Earth 1 doesn't want to risk soldiers unless it is fully necessary\" he says and my grandfather looks pissed. \"Andreas this is your fucking Sister and her husband in there!\" says my grandfather and he nods before drinking some of his coffee. \"Tastes like shit\" he says before dumping it into a plant and putting the cup down. \"I know that, Which is why Centauri will assist, If I went to the Overseer right now and requested to send Soldiers to there death he would probably put me in prison and experiment on me to see if I was mentally retarded\" he says before Centauri walks into the restaurant and she gets a few curious glances from the people inside for a second. She walks up to us and bows to Andreas. \"Centauri, Do you think it would be smart to send 300 soldiers into our current situation?\" he asks and she shakes her head. \"That would be a horrible tactical error since our soldiers are limited\" she says and he nods. \"see? and thats from a robot with all the info you could ever need right there telling you\" he says and I cant believe this. \"Fine we will go to the Wolfkin\" says my Grandfather and Andreas stops him. \"Alright but, your not using earth 1 government request, If you say that the earth 1 government requires the help Centauri will arrest you\" he says before picking up his hat and putting it on. \"Nice to see you nephew, Here, Here is a present for your future....conflict\" he says before handing me a black revolver and its holster. \"Thanks....\" I say and he nods. \"Sorry I can't help, My hands are tied, Good luck\" he says before walking out of the dinner and getting into a armored government truck. \"So how are we traveling?\" asks Centauri and I look at my Grandfather who is smiling.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Awesome!\" I say looking at a Zugot train sitting infront of us. A Zugot train is black and heavily armored with Zugot soldiers sitting ontop of the train cars holding Zugoten rifles and looking at us standing infront of the train. The front of the train has a giant light on the front of it and there are about 40 cars in total. There are only 3 cars that humans are allowed into because technically the Zugot trains are only for Zugot's wanting to see all of Earth 2 in Luxury and without the fear of getting robbed. A few weeks ago I heard on the news that 9 criminals tried robbing a Zugot train armed to the teeth with explosives and assault rifles, they only lasted 5 seconds before being Vaporized by the Zugot's and there explosives did absolutely nothing, didn't even scratch the armor of the train. \"Humans, stay in human cars or we throw humans off\" says a Zugot conductor wearing a black robe with a glowing blue trim and wearing a Zugot respirator. His fur is black and his eyes are blue. \"understood\" says my grandfather paying our tickets and we get onboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe interior is lit with glowing blue tube lights on the floors, walls and ceiling and the walls are made out of the black armor that the exterior is made out of with tinted windows. Everything is written in Zugoten which looks like kind of like Korean with a mix of chinese and a bit of Latin looking symbols as well, It has similarities to Wolfkin and Sakia but its much more complex written but extremely easier than Sakia to speak since in Sakia Hello said wrong could mean shit face. We take a seat in a chair that lights up when we sit down and a few Zugots walk through the cabin in uniform before a few other humans board the train. \"Wow, Amazing eh?\" comments a man to his family before they sit down, They sound Ukrainian or Russian by there accent. The train begins moving after a few minutes and easily picks up speeds about 400mph. \"Here we go\" I say looking out the window.</span></div></div>",

He has Black fur with blue eyes and he stands 6 feet tall which is very short for a male Wolfkin since the average height for a Wolfkin male is 7 feet 8 inches with the tallest height being 9 feet for a very tall Wolfkin. The tallest Wolfkin ever recorded by Wolfkin history is a Wolfkin named Zabathuur who was the Wolfkin who made contact with the Wolfkin god, He was a mighty warrior with fur that shined silver and he stood a giant 14 feet tall and wielded a giant 9 foot long 2 handed sword. Royal Wolfkin are said to have Zabathuur's blood in there veins even though Takinari only is 7 feet 8 inches tall which is considered Very tall for a female Wolfkin. Females are usually 5 feet 9 inches to a maximum of 7 feet 3 inches. Most Females stop growing at about 6 feet usually. Zabathuur is a sacred name and is only allowed to be given to Wolfkin of Royal blood. If a Wolfkin were to name her child Zabathuur and she was not Royal her child and her would be burned to death because they would be considered evil and Wolfkin believe they would desecrate the name of the first king. The Wolfkin have an After life where they look after there loved ones and spend eternity together and they have a version of hell for the evil Wolfkin called Falkin which is where Wolfkin will always be alone and will never escape or see light again, All they can do is scream and beg there god for redemption but it never comes. \"Hello\" says the Wolfkin standing infront of us putting out his hand and I shake it. \"This is my Son Altrozk\" says Kirasa and my grandfather smiles. \"So Altrozk, Are you in the Wolfkin army like your mother and father?\" asks my grandfather and he shakes his head. \"I am a Trader, I travel to human cities and sell authentic historical Wolfkin weaponry\" he says before smiling. He looks to be about 22 and he doesn't have very much muscle like most male Wolfkin meaning he has never had a liking to warfare and instead has invested all of his early life in learning how to trade and not get ripped off. \"Do you know how to fight?\" I ask him and he nods. \"I don't fight like most of my kind however, I prefer using a Skyth\" he says and I notice it on his hip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA Skyth is a Wolfkin version of the Rapier kind of. A rapier is meant for stabbing but it can be used to slash as well. a Skyth cannot. A Skyth requires 100% stabbing since it has no blade. It is pretty much just a long metal point with a hilt guard. They are extremely effective however if you know how to use them. Humans have been extremely surprised by how easily a Wolfkin can rip a sword out of your arms while using the right technique with a Skyth. Skyth's never dull unless you bash the tip repeatedly into a wall or something. 99.9% of Wolfkin soldiers never use Skyth's since they have absolutely no power behind the weapon and require pure agility and balance with skill to use. It takes 15 years to master a Skyth which is another reason since you can easily learn to use a battle axe. Skyth's are usually wielded with a Defending dagger called a Skak which is a curved dagger used to help defend and slash/stab if needed. Altrozk has his Skyth tied to his belt and his Skak there as well with the metal made out of the famous Black metal the Wolfkin call Torvok. \"Ill bring word to Takinari about the situation, If you'd like son you may go with Michael Vinichi, He is a good human\" says Kirasa and Altrozk nods. \"If he would like me to I will\" he says and my grandfather nods. \"That would be fine, Kirasa will you be attacking them ASAP?\" asks my grandfather and she nods. \"We have to, Earth one might assume its us and if they are killing Sakia then we got another war on our heads\" says Kirasa and my grandfather nods. \"We will meet you there\" he says before we say goodbye and take our leave.</span></div></div>",

Kia switched her robe to black last year which gives her a much more scary appearance. I make the wire tighter around the man causing the razor blades on the wire to begin cutting into his skin. \"Pay attention little Misa!, This is what happens when you misbehave!!\" screams Kia forcing the little girl to watch who now has hundreds of cuts all over her face, scarring her beauty for life. I smile as the razor wire begins slowly wrapping around the mans face, bloody tears crawling down his cheeks. I jerk my arm to the left smashing it into the ball before the Razor wire rips the man into shreds of flesh and bone sending pieces all around the room, Raining down ontop of Kia, the Girl and myself. \"Daddy!!\" screams the little girl and I close my eyes taking in the sweet scent of death. \"Now, Misa, We have much much fun ahead of us Misa\" says Kia before I see her small cute cat like tongue appear out of the shadows of her hood to lick a bloody tear from Misa's cheek which makes the fear climax in Misa's eyes. Kia isn't a lesbian, She's only 8 years old, She just has a blood lust like everyone else and doing a move like that is fun for Kia because it gives her the feeling of dominance. \"Come like a good girl Misa, Or do we have to go get your baby brother?\" I ask and she shakes her head while crying. \"Excellent, Kia, Portal\" I say and Kia giggles evilly before a portal opens and then she begins leading Misa into the portal and I smile before walking through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel the life force inside of myself die out before my robes magically turn into what they truly are, Shredded. Most of my skin rots away with what is left becoming a greenish brown color and my eyes turn black with a small green iris. Kia closes the portal and stretches her spine which I can see through her shredded robes and she smiles at me with a mouth full of sharp teeth and 2 fangs. Misa however looks the exact same and is now in a full panic. Infront of us is our masters castle with hundreds of twisted corrupt creatures walking by us, guarding the front walls to The Castle of Suffer. Me and Kia begin walking towards the front gates with Kia keeping one of her claws to Misa's neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Kia's point of view).<br>\r\n\"Kia, What shall we turn her into?\" asks Mausso after I sit down on a bench made out of human bones. \"hmm...\" I say thinking before pulling my hood off of my head while putting on a scary cat mask at the same time. I am the Overseer of creation in the Suffer realm, My home for thousands of years. I was human, once, A long long time ago, I was the Emperor of China's Daughter in ancient china till one day when our Lord found me, He tricked me and turned me into a half cat half human creature with modifications of course, Mainly my claws. He returned me after I begged him to release me and he did, But my Father called me a Demon and didn't want anything to do with me, He kicked me out and Banished me, Telling everyone I was dead. Our Lord Showed himself to me again and I had to come with him. And here we are, 4000 years later I think. \"Well we could change her into a Troll\" says Mausso making his hands glow red to turn her into a troll and I push him aside before putting my clawed hand onto Misa's forehead before I erase all of her memories and then I change her into a troll. \"There, Objective done, Now in 5 months we will go kidnap another child\" I say smiling and Mausso smile before picking me up to give me a piggy back ride. \"Yay!\" I say happily as he begins walking up the stairs so that we can go see our Lord.</span></div></div>",

My son is the same as me, Black scales for skin, Snake eyes, Snake tongue, Weird S sound speech problem, Clawed hands and feet and a long tail that now has a Earth 1 device on the end of it so that he can use it as a weapon if he wishes. He is dressed in a navy blue jacket that hangs down to his shins with black baggy jeans and a pair of black running shoes. On his hands he wears black fingerless gloves and around his neck he wears a black scarf. The two of us are far up North in the mountains trying to find a Earth 1 Helicopter that crashed up here during the Nashtonville war and is thought to have a Rad gun inside it. Rad means Radiation, They were just being developed during the Nashtonville war and are known to be able to burn a hole through someone in 40 milliseconds. It would fetch a giant reward for returning it to Earth 1. \"How far issss it from here?\" he asks sitting down beside me infront of the fire and I look at the map. \"About 500 milessss\" I reply and he shrugs. \"That sssshould take about....3 dayssss?\" he asks looking at the mountains infront of us and I nod. \"Put on ssssome better glovessss and footwear for god ssssakessss\" I say and he chuckles before pulling out a pistol and beginning to clean it. His mother died during birth due to his claws causing more damage on the way out which was a hard blow to me but I've gotten over it. Im not sure about him though, He never talks about it. \"Would you like to head out?\" he asks and I nod before standing up. \"Lets go\" I say stomping out the fire with my boot and then walking over to our Dirt bikes.</span></div></div>",

They are dressed in human clothing and to my luck are holding real swords. All of them are males standing roughly 7 feet tall and wearing black clothing. \"Fika Sukontai Shukaro (Come quietly shorty)\" says one of the Wolfkin and I smile before they charge. I block two of the attacks and I duck under the other two slashes before my Skyth blocks one of there swords which I spin around before kicking his hand causing him to release his sword before I stab my Skyth through his chest and blocking another strike while kicking another Wolfkin back. I grab his sword in mid air before throwing it at one of the Wolfkin causing him to hit it out of the way which I use to my advantage to charge him. I slide across the stone floor before I stab my Skak into his groin as I slide between his legs. He howls in pain before I stab my Skyth up into his back before pulling it out in time to kick his body into one of his allies. I pick a dagger off the ground in time to block the next strike before I stab my Skyth into him and then I throw the dagger into the chest of the final one. I smile before grabbing my Skak and Skyth and then sprinting down a stone hallway where gun fire is erupting from.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Alex's point of view).<br>\r\nI draw the pistol my uncle gave me and I take aim at a Wolfkin before pulling the trigger sending a bullet through his head. I sprint up to his body and I grab his laser rifle before I turn it to automatic and I take cover. I check the powercells to see 80% remaining before Centauri uses her rockets on the bottom of her feet as roller blades, only using a small amount of the power to make her hover and she quickly zips around the corner. I jump out of Cover to see her dealing with these Wolfkin with ease, Stomping ones head in while she's at it. I run past her before I see my mother behind cover holding a Laser pistol. I run across a fire fight before sliding across the stone floor beside her. \"Alex?\" asks my mother and I nod before she gives me a quick hug. \"Wheres dad?\" I ask and she shrugs. \"I've been looking for him\" she says before standing up quickly and firing her pistol twice before ducking back down. \"I think he is near the headquarters of this place, Its down the left hall\" she says pointing. \"Alright, Ill go see what I can do\" I say and she nods. \"Be careful\" she says and I smile before I begin sprinting across the fire fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy adrenalin kicks in that runs in my families blood and everything goes slow. I take aim at the Wolfkin firing at us and I pull the trigger sending little red hot lights through there bodies and they drop dead. I begin sprinting down the hallway with my heart beating quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI kick open the last prison door revealing my father chained to the wall. He is wearing shredded clothing that use to be a shirt and pants and his face and body is bruised from torture. \"father!\" I say running up to him and he looks up. \"What the hell is going on out there?\" he asks and I go to reply before he looks behind me and I turn around in time to see a female Wolfkin with green eyes get her head blown off from someone wearing a white robe and holding a shotgun. \"Good Luck\" he says before sprinting down the hallway. \"That guy was from the organization....What the hell is...\" he begins but i answer him. \"The Wolfkin army has come and are massacring this cult\" I say and he smiles before I grab the key off the wall that was on a hook and I unlock his shackles. My father takes a second to stand up before he weakly follows me outside into the hallway where we find Kirasa running down the hall. \"Lets end this!\" says Kirasa running up some stairs and we follow.</span></div></div>",

Rain Screams in agony before collapsing to the ground with the dagger in her gut still tears showing in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOTHER!!\" screams Rain after pulling the dagger out and holding her wound while gripping Nitari's robe. \"Oh Rain, Sorry to say this but....Wait I am not sorry.

I look to my right to see a pistol on the ground and I grit my teeth from the fire like pain of my wound. I begin to slowly crawl across the floor desperately trying to get this pistol to end this fight. I reach it and I grip it tightly in my right hand before I spin around and I aim it at my mother who has tripped Kirasa and is ready to stab her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Nitari's point of view).<br>\r\nI raise my sword above my head and I smile knowing I am finally getting my revenge. A loud <i>ZANG!!</i> echo's through the room and I freeze as a red hot pain forms in my chest inbetween my breasts and I look down to see a burnt hole from a laser pistol. I look forward to see my Daughter laying on the ground holding the pistol growling before aiming to my face and my eyes widen before a red light flashes infront of my eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Kirasa's point of view).<br>\r\nA red laser bullet burns its way inbetween Nitari's eyes in a blink before she collapses limp and lifeless ontop of me.

Wolfkin sit all around the court room on 3 different floors watching my case with the Vinichi family sitting in the front row. I have been charged with High Treason, Assassination attempts and Mass murders so im pretty deep in the gutter. \"Your Majesty, I do not have anything to say, I just followed orders that my mother had given me, For that I am sorry\" I say and everyone in the court room curses at me and calls me names causing me to lower my ears and tuck my tail under my paw. \"I do\" says Kirasa standing up behind me and I look back at her surprised. \"Very well Kirasa, What is it you have to say?\" asks Takinari. \"Rain may have done things that were wrong all her life, But I must ask you this, What other choice did she have?, You, yourself have heard Nitari say that if her child was a girl she would murder it, But she didn't for one reason or another, Nitari while I was fighting her had nothing but Blood Lust in her eyes, she was a monster, A young woman like Rain would be scared by that....Someone as Cruel as Nitari probably never showed Rain love, She probably beat the poor girl brutally, I think you would have done the same thing if all your mother had done all your life was beat you and put you down for everything you did, Rain was trying to win her mothers affection but never got it due to Nitari's cold heart\" says Kirasa and I look up at the Queen who is thinking. \"Rain Silvarz, I find you not Guilty, However if I ever see you in this court room again I will have you burned\" says Takinari before standing up and walking out of the court room and a few Wolfkin complain but accept the verdict anyways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wag my tail happily and I perk up my ears knowing I am going to live. \"Congratulations\" says Kirasa and I thank her before I look over at the Vinichi family who is packing up. \"Alex Vinichi\" I say and he looks at me.

Teresa has short black hair with blue eyes and her bangs close to her eyes like our mother. She is wearing a pink T-shirt and black jeans. \"It can't usually unless you had something with super human strength ripping an entire coil of Razor wire across someone\" says Rain sitting beside me. Rain has stayed silent alot of the time she has been with us, She doesn't usually join conversations and usually only talks when it has to do with the cases of these. \"We have data of very similar incidents happening back during the Napoleonic Era, However it has to be a copy cat of someone who was a sadist is what I am thinking\" says my Grandfather and I sigh. We are sitting in the City hall of the last killing in a town called Krotkat. The child that went missing was named Misa Orinowa. We suspect that the person capturing the children works along side a child because from what the evidence shows is that the Children always seem to be lured somehow, A full grown man or Woman that the child does not know in the middle of the Night coming in through the window or closet would scare the child and cause them to scream for the parents, However, this child along with a few others in the history of the kidnappings screamed when they saw who ever it was immediately, The criminals panicked most likely when the father came in and began trying to protect his little girl and some how he got ripped apart by razor wire. \"This reminds me of an incident with your father....\" says my grandfather and I look up. \"Its the reason why your father has his arm, Someone by the name of Mausso stole a child in Italy\" he says and I think before pulling up my laptop and searching the name <i>Mausso</i>. One of the links says <i>The Children Of Suffer</i> so I click it and then a page pops up with the boarder wrapped up in bloody Razor wire. I read through the website and from what I get out of it is that it is a Cult devoted to worshiping Pain, Bondage, Domination and Submission, Darkness, Sacrifice and The theory that Pain and Suffering purifies the soul allowing a mortal to achieve immortality in there Gods Realm that they call The Suffer Realm. I show it to everyone else and after they read through it everyone but Rain thinks its nuts. \"Why do you think its real?\" asks Teresa. \"Its the only thing that makes sense\" says Rain and I think about it. \"Ludicrous\" says Teresa and Rain stands up. \"Im going to go out\" says Rain picking up her jacket and walking to the door. \"Ill come with you\" I say and she nods allowing me before I grab my jacket and we leave.</span></div></div>",

I don't know why I rubbed my face against Alex's, He just was so caring and nice to me in my time of need instead of just shoving me away so maybe thats why I did it, But I want to do it again....for some reason. \"Hello, What can I get for you?\" asks the waitress and I look up at her. She looks about 20 with long blond hair and green eyes. \"Uh...I don't know...\" I say letting my head hit the counter and I sigh. \"Are you ok?\" she asks and I shake my head before getting an idea. \"I have a question\" I say and she gives me a questioning look. \"If you found yourself attracted to a male Wolfkin who was nice, spent time with you even when it was not needed, would you build upon it or leave it and bury it?\" I ask and she looks confused. \"I don't know sorry\" she says and I sigh. \"Its fine\" I say before I turn around on the stool and I see across the road a Woman standing there, watching me. She has short blond hair and has her eyes hidden by a pair of black sunglasses. She is wearing a black long jacket like me that hangs to her shins and she is just standing there smiling. \"Have a Nice day\" I say to the waitress before walking out of the restaurant and I walk across the street. \"Can I help you?\" I ask her and she smiles at me. \"Nein, but Ich vill see du again fery fery soon Rain Silfarz\" she says with some kind of European accent and she looks over her sunglasses revealing ocean blue eyes. \"Guten Tag Rain Silfarz, Ich vill be Vatching du\" she says before beginning to walk away and I turn around and begin walking back to city hall.</span></div></div>",

Fothus!! (Gah! Fuck!!!)\" Shouts Rain and I look at the Razor wire which is slowly moving like a snake and absorbing small amounts of Rain's blood. \"Here\" I say taking a pair of pliers from the drawer before gripping the wire with them and pulling the blades out of her hand. \"Ow..ow ow ow OW!!\" says Rain before cursing as I remove the last of the Razor wire and it moves around very very slowly. \"This...Is Bazaar\" says my Grandfather looking at the Razor wire before putting his finger close to it and it snaps towards his finger. \"Put it in something\" he says before I take my sisters metal water bottle and I put it in. \"Lets go\" I say before we walk down the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Im curious what this thing...\" I begin before a car slams into us so hard ours almost flips over. \"Gah!!\" I shout before unbuckling my seatbelt and then the door opens revealing a man that looks very similar to Sarok Magiak. \"Hello Vinichi\" He says smiling before grabbing the water bottle and walking out of view. I crawl my way out of the car just in time to see him take off full speed in a black car with the front end smashed. \"Who...The Fuck...Was that!!\" screams Rain obviously pissed off  and getting out of the car in time to see the car speeding away. \"Gah!, Asshole\" she says before beginning to help Teresa and my Grandfather out. \"He looked like Sarok\" I say and Rain stops. \"Wait....that was shade?\" she asks and we all turn to her. \"Who?\" asks Teresa before my grandfather gives Rain a serious face. \"Tell us, Everything you know about anyone\" he says and she lowers her ears.</span></div></div>",

I stop and try to concentrate, seeing if I can hear anything out of the ordinary that tells me its Rain. I hear some shuffling noises a little ahead of me and I continue on to find her sitting on a large rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you are!\u201d I say out loud and she doesn\u2019t do anything, she just keeps staring into the sky and trees. She sighs and I climb up to her where I sit down next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSomething up?\u201d I ask her and she looks down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you let me come along and try to help change my reputation because of my whore and bitch of a mother\u2026 but please, can we try to not do anything else to hurt all of us and what people think?\u201d she asks and I wrap an arm around her waist to reassure her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo promises but I\u2019ll do what I can.\u201dI say and she smiles as she snuggles closer to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell me\u2026 why did your dad send you and your sister with his dad on investigating these children\u2019s disappearances?\u201d she asks and I begin to wonder as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou saw what my dad had become\u2026 no matter how messed up this world is, and no matter how much control one has in it, it\u2019ll always be life scaring to most people. Maybe he thinks that sending me and my sister on this type of assignment will try to strengthen us for anything else this world has to offer.\u201d I give my best answer and she smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSounds like a smart man.\u201d She says and I smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe has too\u2026 he killed Nashton after all, and he managed to gain a truce to every species on this planet right?\u201d I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrue.\u201d She says. A few minutes pass before Rain looks at me and asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you like me?\u201d she asks and I look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah I like you.\u201d I say but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what she meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo I mean do you like like me?\u201d she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, well\u2026 uhhhhh\u2026\u201d I begin but she interrupts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSince I\u2019ve been with you, you\u2019ve shown me compassion and have been nice to me, the only other person ever to do that was my father. I also like you Alex, but I want to know if you really like me.\u201d she says and I think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Rain, I-\u201c I begin to say but I hear something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlex, what-\u201c she says but I shush her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold on I heard something.\u201d I say and jump down onto the ground where I pull out my revolver and look around. I walk forward to try and find what made that sound. I quickly look behind some trees and I slowly check around but I find nothing. I holster my gun and begin walking back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuess it was nothing.\u201d I say before some kind of invisible force launches through the air and I hit a tree hard before I fall unconscious. Rain gasps at what happened and looks to the source of that. She sees two people come out of the shadows and they have the same clothing and features as people have reported seeing and the description that Alex\u2019s father gave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Rain\u2019s point of view)<br>\r\nThe people in front of me are the ones I know of, the ones that I believe are the ones that kidnap children. I can\u2019t see their faces because of their robes. I jump down onto the ground and get ready just in case.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRain Silvarz, we come to extend you an invitation to join us.\u201d One of them says and I\u2019m shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy in the hell would I join you monsters?\u201d I say and I hear them smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBecause our main embodiment and goal is to do the will of our lord, and he wants everyone to suffer, to produce misery to any and everyone we know and find. You know of what it is to suffer, all your life, you were tormented, beaten and humiliated by your own kin and especially your mother. No one will truly love you for the actions you\u2019ve taken and the people you\u2019ve worked with. With us\u2026 we will give you a purpose and a chance to turn all that suffering you\u2019ve been given and turn it into your own pleasure as you inflict it on others\u2026 and get your revenge on your bitch of a mother\u2019s soul. Will you join us and become a family member of us?\u201d he asks and the other answers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, if you join us, we will have lots of fun tormenting the souls of others, especially your mother\u2019s.\u201d the second voice says and I can tell its female. I think for about minute, the chance to get an eternity of revenge on my cunt of a mother is almost too go to be true\u2026 but do I really want to torment the lives of other innocents, just for the fun of it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2026 wil-\u201c I begin but I hear a couple loud pops and they jerk a bit. I look to where I think they are shot from and see Alex standing with his revolver in one hand and his katana in the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Alex\u2019s point of view)<br>\r\nI managed to wake up from my forced sleep and I fired a shot in each of them. I run forward and I fire a few more shots at them but they jump out of the way and in the shadows of the forest around us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRain, get out of here and get the others! I hold them off!\u201d I yell to her and she freezes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook out!\u201d she yells and I bring my katana up and I deflect a slash from some kind of razor like whip. It bounces off and goes back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo now!\u201d I yell and fire more shots at where I think they are. I move away from Rain and I look around to try and find them but nothing. I then feel a presence behind me and I use adrenaline rush and I duck, a razor whip nearly cleaving my head and I throw into the person wielding it. I tackle him to the ground and I get up and pick him up and slam him into the tree. I pull out my sword and try to stab him but he disappears and I don\u2019t know where he is. I quickly slash behind me but I find nothing. I look around to find them but still see Rain there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRain! Goaaaaaaaaaaahh!\u201d I yell as my words suddenly change to blinding pain as I feel something tear through the skin in my back. I crouch for a second from the pain before I look to the right and I see some claws come at my face, knocking me onto my back and leave four slash marks on the side of my face. I groan a bit and I open my eyes to see the both of them looking down at me before the guy kicks me in the side hard enough to make me roll against the rock I sat on before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Rain\u2019s point of view)<br>\r\nAlex, the only other person besides my dad to show me compassion has just nearly risked his life to keep mine from another that could have just costed me much more. The one person\u2026 I love. I ready my claws as anger begins to course through every fiber of my being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow that that nuisance is done, have you-\u201c the guy begins but he gets cut off as I tackle him to the ground and I begin clawing at his face, revealing him to be 22 with his skin pale but normal pale. He has a few barely noticeable scars on his face as well, but I begin to give him a whole lot more. After clawing at his face for a bit, I throw myself off him in another direction and tackle the girl. Her hood falls off to reveal a Chinese little girl with skin that is a grayish white. Her eyes are demonic red with 2 cat ears on the top of her head. She has short black hair and has veins on her face that are black. I claw at her face, hearing her squeal in pain as she tries to throw me off her. After I do some damage, something stops me then lifts me into the air throws off her into a tree. I look up and see a portal open up in front of the girl as the guy helps her up. She quickly goes in and the guy looks at me and points to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2026 have made a grave mistake, Rain Silvarz. You will regret it.\u201d He says before disappearing into the portal. I sigh and I hear a groan before I quickly get up and go over to Alex. I turn him over and look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlex! Are you alright!?\u201d I quickly ask him but he just stares at me for a second. He brings both of his hands to either side of my face and I am confused for a second but instead am surprised when he forces my lips to his where he begins French kissing me like crazy, driving his tongue deep into my mouth as he can and rolling it against my tongue. I\u2019m too stunned by this to return it but soon stops, a small trail of saliva connecting our mouths together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026 was that for?\u201d I ask and he smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRain\u2026 I do love you, and the way you went berserk on those two\u2026 made you look even more beautiful then I can ever imagine. He says and I smile as I wag my tail happily and my ears perk up. I accidently hug him a little more tightly and he groans from his wounds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cC\u2019mon, let\u2019s get you back to camp and all patched.\u201d I say and I help him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright.\u201d He says and we begin walking back to camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you, Rain Silvarz.\u201d He says and I smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you too, Alex Vinichi.\u201d I reply and he smiles.</span></div></div>",

I break the kiss after a few minutes before she giggles. \"Im sshhorry that.....I may...be acting weird\" she says and I chuckle. \"Its alright\" I say before I begin helping her walk back to the hotel. \"Alex....Do you actually find me....attractive?\" she asks as we walk and I nod. \"Yes\" I reply. \"Even though I have a muzzle, Pawsssh, fur and the fact that I have a heat cycle?\" she asks and I nod. \"those don't bother me\" I say and her tail wags. \"Thank you\" she says before we enter the hotel.</span></div></div>",

Everyone else is gone meaning they have probably gone down for breakfast. I kick the covers off of me and I sigh before standing up and I begin my daily stretches. It only takes me about 10 minutes to complete the round of stretches which use to take me 40 minutes when I was 8. One of the good things that my mother forced me to do was learn how to fight. I was forced to stretch every morning to make sure I could fight without injuring myself. When I am finished I get myself dressed and I head down stairs to find Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good Morning Rain, We took the Liberty to order you some breakfast\" says Michael and I nod. The restaurant has sand colored walls with white tables and white table cloths. The floor is made up of white tiles and the chairs are made out of white painted wood. \"Sleep well?\" asks Alex  sitting beside me and I nod. \"My head hurts a bit but other than that im great\" I reply before the Waitress brings us the food. Alex got eggs and sausages, Teresa got a fruity yogurt thing, Michael got Bacon and Eggs and I got Sausages and eggs like Alex. I pick a straw up from the table and I put it into a glass of water before sucking on the straw. \"Did we have Sex?\" I ask Alex since I don't remember a single thing about last Night and Teresa stops eating for a second before continuing to eat the yogurt. \"No, When we got to the hotel you passed out like a light\" says Alex and I nod before picking up a fork and knife and beginning to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>30 minutes later...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright so where are we going and what are we doing?\" I ask Michael. \"We are going to Hunt down Sarok's son Shade Magiak because I know for a fact if we don't now we will regret it\" says Michael before Alex stands up. \"Well lets get going then\" says Alex before we all stand up.</span></div></div>",

Wolfkin Ear plugs are used to lower the volume of music in clubs or the sounds of the city. I open the door again and this time I can atleast walk inside. The music is very fast and electronic with the bass going high and then low quickly. The floor, walls and roof are covered in glowing tubes and at the end of the very large room is a woman with glowing blue short hair Djing. I walk over to the bar and I sit down before the bartender walks up. \"Hello Wolfkin, What can I get you?\" asks the Bartender. \"Do you know anyone who makes contact with the Karism?\" I ask and he nods. \"Vinyl does, You can talk to her when she is done her set\" he says pointing to the Dj and I sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>3 hours later.....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe DJ finally finishes her set and just as she steps off the booth another person gets up and takes over.

Rain stops the car and gets out holding her pistol and she takes aim before shooting the poor bastard in the foot. \"AAAAHHH!!!\" screams the dealer who now is fucked up. His nose is squished up against his face and bleeding rapidly and by the looks of it he is coughing up blood. I grab him by his summer jacket and I pull him up off the ground and to my face. \"Tell me where Shade is!\" I say and he  keeps his mouth shut before Rain grabs him and smashes him against a brick wall. \"Tell us or ill rip your fucking cock off!\" she roars  while snarling at him with her ears pointed back making her look vicious. \"He's in...Uh...Durzai City\" he says before Rain turns him around and smashes his face into the wall knocking out 3 teeth and chipping half of another one off. \"TELL ME!!!, Durzai fucking city is the Most secure city in all of Earth 2 by the Earth 1 Government!!\" yells Rain. \"Fine!, He is at Gallows Rock!\" says the Dealer and Rain smiles. \"Thank you\" says Rain before bringing her knee up into his groin so hard I hear a faint pop that makes me cringe.

We are driving on the Galactic Highway over one of the Rare Rof tree forests. Rof tree's are not like Huk treee's. Rok tree's are usually infested with insects making the Wood useless 99% of the time. Huk tree's have a Natural insect repellent in its wood that is deadly to all insects of Earth 2 which allows Huk tree's to grow freely. Rof means Red in Wolfkin. Rof Tree's do not have the repellent in them, Therefor allowing the thousands of parasitic insects to burrow in and eat it alive. Pure Rof wood is very rare and just a 2x4 of Rof wood is worth 15,000 dollars while a 2x4 of Huk wood is only 5,000 dollars. The reason why everything costs so much is because the Wolfkin hate Humans chopping the forests down because some parts of the forests hold historical history. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Rain's point of view).<br>\r\nSomething hitting us from behind shakes me from my sleep and I sit up to find Michael flooring the gas pedal. I look out the back window to see a speeding sports car behind us painted black with green lights glowing underneath it. Its rims glow bright green and its Lights are green as well. \"Who the fuck is that?\" I ask before a window is rolled down and a SMG is brought out. \"DOWN!!!!\" I scream and everyone ducks down just in time before bullets begin ripping through the back window and the roof. I draw my pistol from its holster and when the bullets stop I sit up to fire but another bullet rips into my shoulder. \"SMART BASTARD!\" I shout as I collapse into the places where you put your feet in the back seat of the car. \"RAIN!!\" yells Alex getting down as close as he can without getting ontop of me and I keep my right hand up against my left shoulder to keep the bleeding as little as I possibly can. \"Incoming!!\" yells Michael before something hard crashes into the car sending me and Alex through the car and I smash my head against the window.</span></div></div>",

There is a 2 foot in width platform to walk on while the entire cars themselves are 15 feet wide. She brings her fist up and smashes it into my face before kicking me off and within a blink she grabs my jacket and almost throws me off the train. My legs are still on the platform while my torso and head are over the side and she is trying to force my head down to the tracks to grind my head against them. \"Sterben, Du kleiner Schei\u00dfer\" she says to me as my face comes to an inch from the tracks before I free my elbow and I bring it up into her face shattering her sunglasses and causing her to release me.

I hear a squeaking noise and I turn around to see a weird Rat like creature. It has blue fur with brown stripes on its back with green eyes. It has a long thin head with feet that only have 4 toes on them. It looks kind of like a badger however its feet don't have claws and it has a more rodent look to it than something that wants to rip your leg off. It has a small fur'd tail on it and it is about 3 feet long. \"Hey little guy, Do you want to become supper?\" I ask it while slowly taking out my pistol and it sits up before beginning to eat a nut. \"sorry\" I say before taking aim and pulling the trigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk into our camp to be shocked by the sight of a bed made out of the forest infront of me with a fire hole ready. The bed is fully made out of blue vines tightly tied together and tied to the 4 Huk tree's around it making it 4 feet above the ground. \"Hey Alex\" says Rain before noticing the rat thing on my shoulder and her tail wags. \"OH! you caught a Dami!\" says Rain excitedly before taking it off my shoulder and then putting it down on a rock before taking her knife and stabbing it before cutting it open and beginning to gut it. \"This....is Awesome but it looks like alot of work\" I say pointing to the vine hammock bed and she nods. \"It was, But tell me this, Would you rather sleep soundly and with no worries or would you rather have an insect crawl down your urethra and lay its eggs in your testicles so that when they hatch they feast on your balls?\" she asks and I stare at her. \"Id rather sleep happily\" I say and she nods before wagging her tail. \"Now, Its getting close to Dark, Im gonna go bath and Fish, Your free to bath as well\" she says before walking down to the river and beginning to strip. I turn my head reluctantly not wanting to seem like a perv and I then begin looking at her job at gutting the rat thing. Its sitting on a stick ready to cook with the skin being ripped off in one shot which is rather impressive. I sigh and I begin to clean off my Katana blade with a cloth.</span></div></div>",

I moan and almost collapse from the pleasure. He pushes me forward and I have no choice but to comply as he pushes me onto a large rock that sticks out of the water. His hands let me go and I feel him place them on my soft rump. I think he\u2019s about to fuck me but then I feel a warm tongue on my pussy and he pushes it into my folds, making me moan loudly and claw the rock as he begins to eat me out. I\u2019ve never experienced an orgasm or ever heard of the thing that Alex is doing to me right now. I just moan and let my tongue roll out as he hits something in my folds, making my claws dig into the rock and let out a very loud moan. I moan and I feel I am about to pass out from my very first orgasm but he lays himself against my back, mashing my breasts against the rough stone. He shoves the head of his large cock into my pussy and this makes me go wide eyed and I look back at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait! I\u2019ve never done-\u201c I begin but he cuts me off by mashing his lips and tongue against mine, making me lick and suck the inside of his mouth and tongue, along with him having a very distinct taste that usual. He pulls back and I begin panting from the whole ordeal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know. You were about to pass out from just me eating you right? But don\u2019t worry, once I\u2019m done with you, I\u2019ll take you back to bed where you can properly rest up.\u201d He says and he pushes more of his cock in and I cringe in both pleasure and pain as his huge cock begins to stretch me wide. I cringe and moan in pain as I feel him hit something. He stops and leans his head down next to mine and says:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ready?\u201d I look at him and give the side of his face a long lick in approval before he thrusts the rest of the way in. Making my eyes water and I bite just below his neck. I stay that way for a few seconds before I let go and I open my eyes and he pulls out and thrusts all the way back in, making me moan in pleasure as I feel him hit another barrier inside me but not of pain but intense pleasure. I cum again but he just continues to pound me, nearly driving me insane from another orgasm I have, making me have an orgasm spike. My breasts scrape against the rock I am laying on as I fight the need to open my mouth and yell to the heavens how much I want him to fuck me and abuse me like a bitch in heat. I cum again and now my body is weaker than before and I swear I can feel him getting bigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRain, I\u2019m about to cum.\u201d He says to me and I moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Alex. Cum, cum inside me.\u201d I silently yell to him, mostly the water splashing beneath us being the loudest of our actions. He opens his mouth and give off a low moan as I feel cum. Feeling the hot ropes and liquid of his cum filling me up. I can\u2019t take it anymore, he makes me cum again, combined with the hotness of his semen inside me, my vision turns black before I pass out.</span></div></div>",

I get out of our vine bed before sighing and beginning to do my stretches. I hear something fly by over head sounding like rockets and I look up before something grabs me by the neck and slams me against a Huk tree. I look into its Robotic glowing lenses and it makes a loud <i>Ruuuaaahh!</i> noise at me before a glowing blue laser wrist blade pops out and she brings her arm back to kill me before Alex shoots up in the bed. \"CENTAURI STOP!!!\" yells Alex and the robot freezes with the blade an inch from my muzzle and then turns its head to its left to see Alex sitting up. \"She kidnapped you\" says Centauri and Alex nods. \"But I also had intercourse with her last Night, I love her\" says Alex and Centauri's lenses open up more to imitate surprise. \"Uh....\" she says before looking back at me and then releasing her hand allowing me to breath. Her sword goes back into her wrist before she looks at Alex and then me. \"Um....Alex Id like to talk to you, But...Please get dressed\" says Centauri and I notice Alex is completely naked still and he nods before grabbing his boxers. Centauri walks down the the River and sits down on a rock as formally and lady like as possible on the odd boulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Alex's point of view).<br>\r\nI walk down to the beech and I sigh before picking up a rock and skipping it. \"6\" says Centauri giving the total number the rock skipped. \"What do you want to talk about?\" I ask. \"why did you have intercourse with a Wolfkin?\" she asks before I hold out a rock for her to scan if its good and she nods before I throw it and it skips 20 times. \"I love her\" I say and she stands up before walking into the water 4 feet and grabbing a rock before coming back onto the beach and throwing the rock. Amazingly it skips countless times all the way across the river with the final skip landing about 5 feet onto the other side of the river's beach. \"123\" she says and I stare at her before smiling. She has always been one of my best friends as a kid even if she was a robot and always forced me to act polite and respect everyone. \"How are you certain that you love her?, She kidnapped you and tried to kill you\" says Centauri and I sigh. \"Have you ever felt love?\" I ask and she nods. \"Who was it?\" I ask. \"I feel love towards my Creator who is now sadly deceased, I feel love for Caroline, You, Your Family and I feel love for the Overseer in the same way\" she says and I shake my head. \"Not Family love, I mean love love, The kind where you want to hold them, be with them, Have....intercourse with them, children, That kind\" I say and she shakes her head. \"I am not a sexual pleasure bot, Nor have I met any other robot with the same level of intelligence other than Caroline. As far as I am concerned my orientation is straight, I also do not wish to find this love because from my studies, it gets in the way and it also degrades you\" she replies and I give her a confused look. \"Look at your Uncle, He is still battle ready and runs military tracks 3 times a day to stay in shape, Now look at your Mother, It would take her a good 3 weeks to charge into a battle again, She has gained a bit of weight from pregnancy, She has begun aging along with your father alot quicker and both your mother and father only go for a jog every second morning for an hour which by my calculations doesn't make them lose nearly enough weight or gain enough muscle, Your father hasn't worked for years due to his bonus from the Nashtonville war and all of this was caused by Love\" she says and I shake my head. \"My uncle is a hard ass War veteran who lost most of his soul from the Nashtonville war because the Overseer sent him to execute innocent people, Without my Mother and Fathers love I wouldn't be created and without love there would be no human race meaning no you\" I say and she makes a beep noise that she makes whenever she is corrected. \"Your right\" she says and I nod. \"But falling in Love with a Wolfkin is....frowned upon\" she says and I shrug. \"They can go fuck themselves if they don't like it, I love her\" I say before she stands up and gives a bow. \"Then I will respect it Alex-san\" she says and I smile before she walks back to the camp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Rain's point of view).<br>\r\n\"Rain Silvarz\" says Centauri and I freeze before slowly turning around. \"I am so very sorry for my assault\" says Centauri. \"Its...Ok\" I say and she shakes her head. \"My sensors indicate that you fear me, I am sorry\" she says before going to sit at the fire and I give Alex a curious look and he shrugs.</span></div></div>",

I smile at him and I nod before he leads me and Alex to a table with a young Asian human sitting on the opposite end. He has short black hair and a tattoo on his face and is dressed in a white t-shirt. \"Rain, This isn't a smart Idea\" says Alex and I shush him by pressing my lips to his and forcing my tongue into his mouth in a passionate kiss. \"100 Dollars!\" I say slamming a 100$ bill on the table for my bet and the asian man puts down 1,000 dollars for his before handing me a razor sharp dagger. \"You go first Wolfkin\" says the bald head man and I smile before starting off slow. I jab the knife inbetween my spread out fingers at a steady pace before slowly beginning to speed up. I can tell Alex is tense expecting me to cut my fingers off any second now. Within 2 minutes I am going full speed hitting the table two times a second and I look up from the table with a smile before the bald man shouts \"Time!\" and I stop before sliding the dagger across the table to the Asian man. \"Your turn\" I say and he takes it before beginning to jab the table between his fingers. He picks up and after about a minute and a half I can tell he is trying to be faster than me, But what he doesn't know is that I have been doing five finger fillet since I was 8. He brings the dagger down a final time and his scream is heard across the bar causing people to turn around and I smile at the sight of his middle finger 3 inches from his hand. \"GAH FUCK!!\" he yells before I grab his bet and I smile at Alex who is gawking at me. \"Want to dance?\" I ask and he nods happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Alex's point of view).<br>\r\nRain leads me out onto the Dance floor that is currently full of Single people and couples of all ages dancing to a hip hop/Electronica song and Rain smiles at me before letting go of my hands and beginning to club dance and I smile before dancing myself close to her. After a few minutes Rain pushes her back up against my chest and brings my arms around to her hips and I smile before beginning to caress her while we both move around. I move my hands up from her belt and I run then up under her shirt and I feel her soft obsidian fur in my hands. \"Rain!?!\" asks a Voice and me and Rain are knocked out of our lala world to see a Male Wolfkin standing there wearing a Jacket like Rain. \"Do I know you?\" asks Rain. \"I am a Major serving your father\" he says and Rain looks at me before him. \"Prove it\" says Rain and the Wolfkin begins saying some kind of oath in Wolfkin. \"Oh...follow us\" says Rain beginning to lead us out of the Nightclub to talk.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I found myself wearing a black robe that had a white spike styled trim. A man said hello to me and I turned around to find a man standing there with blood red eyes full of sorrow and hatred. He told me it was time to become what I am suppose to become. I told him that I was the emperor's daughter and that he should release me immediately. That was a bad idea. Black metal string with razor sharp blades all over it shot out of the ground all around me before wrapping tightly around my arms and legs before they lifted me off the ground and spun around trapping me in a sharp hooked cocoon. I screamed and begged him to release me as the wire slowly moved around and sliced into my body drawing blood easier than a soldiers sword. He asked me why he should let me go when I was making threats towards him. He laughed at me when I urinated myself from the pain and then he made the metal string wrap around my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis went on for two weeks. While I was in the Cocoon of Razor wire as he called it, It changed me. it gave me sharp teeth, the ears of a cat, Cat paws instead of my feet and hands, A cat tail, Cat eyes and it also gave me long steel blades instead of finger nails. He told me the name Salitar for his name but I was to refer to him as Lord Suffer. I yelled and screamed at him to change me back and all he did was laugh before telling me that this is how I would be from now on.

I grit my teeth and I close my eyes tight while my breathing becomes nothing but struggled gasps as I cut the knife down to make the first line of the R. I finish the first line and now for the hard part, The half circle to make it a P and then another line to make it an R. Blood now has bled down my torso and to my belt. I finish the R and I take a deep breath before Rain's father smiles. \"Very Nice, Now all you have left to do is the rest and then her last name\" he says and I feel like taking this knife and stabbing him in the throat but I know I can't so I continue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>an hour and a half later.......</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI carve the final line of the Z in her name and I stab the knife into the table with my hands shaking. \"There!\" I say and he smiles. \"That was impressive, You are free to explore our fortress with Rain\" he says before standing up and leaving after giving Rain a hug.

Guddonaitoarekkusu-san is the only sentence in Japanese I know. Centauri has said it to me since I was 4 when ever she was the one putting me to bed. Centauri was interesting to me when I was a kid. I would always try to annoy her but she would never act annoyed, Instead she would just grab me and handcuff me to the staircase if I misbehaved and then put a gag in my mouth to make me shut up, With my mothers permission of course. I also tried playing Hide and go seek with her but she turned on some kind of X-ray mode and found me in 5.3 seconds. Im surprised she isn't bored with the job. I close the door behind me and Rain before she begins taking off her clothing for bed time and I do the same. The bed is a vine bed like the one we had in the forest except it is covered in furs and sheets for much better comfort. Rain climbs ontop of them and pulls a very thin white bed sheet that I know is either Zugot or Human made and I get under with her before puling her back against my body and I hug her tightly and her tail wags slowly. Her fur is nice and warm and incredibly soft. \"Good Night\" I say but I notice she has already fallen asleep and I smile before closing my eyes to fall asleep.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>(Kia's point of view).<br>\r\nI sigh while looking at the walls my fathers men built thousands of years ago before he forsaken'd me. My father never believed I was his daughter when I returned to him. He called me a Demon and ordered his guards to execute me. I escaped and Ran back to Lord Suffer eventually and he took me in and told me he was my new father, My father of Suffering. After I joined a teenager from Portugal joined in 6,234 AD named Zaros who saw his parents massacred because his family were Necromancers. After him came a girl who was raped and beaten to death named Kora in 9,452. After her came Relinquish, an Alchemist who was suspected of Devil worship and was burned at the stake in 11,453. After him came Cloud, A english archer who murdered his parents. Finally came Mausso in 1792. After him came Scar, A Shutzstaffel officer who was killed by a Riot of Jewish people in a concentration camp. Finally we found Didra, A Woman from Saudi Arabia who was stoned to death after being accused of murdering her husband and children. To join our Ranks we need those who suffer but are not obsessed over it. If someone is constantly on the ground sobbing with a bottle of alcohol in there hands there is not a shot in hell. If you are someone who suffers on the inside but it doesn't consume there life we accept them into our ranks, It cant just be a one time thing, They need to suffer there entire lives over something. For example Mausso had is heart broken by a woman he wanted to be his wife 5 days before he was killed, Also all his child hood he was abused by his father and made fun of every day by children. Scar suffered because people always broke his heart because of a horrible scar he got from his father on his face. I am the only one who did not have a life of suffering. I was the Emperor of China's daughter back when the Great Wall of China was being built. Zaros, Kora, Scar and Relinquish tried taking over the Suffer realm a few hundred years ago and it lead to them being Banished. \"N\u01cel\u01d0 sh\u00ec n\u01d0 de f\u00f9m\u01d4 xi\u01ceo n\u01dah\u00e1i? (Where are your parents little girl?)\" asks a Chinese soldier wearing a Lieutenants jacket for the Government. \"T\u0101men q\u00f9 hu\u00f2d\u00e9 y\u01d0nli\u00e0o (They went to get drinks)\" I reply to him and he nods before walking over to socialize with 2 other soldiers. My claws are hidden inside my paws so that I don't get unwanted attention and I am wearing a hoody on my head with a pair of blue jeans to make myself look like a Anime fan from my cat ears, eyes, paws and tail. \"Hello Kia\" says a familiar voice and I look over my shoulder to see Relinquish standing there wearing a black robe with a purple trim and wrapped in purple razor wire. Zaros' followers all wear different kinds of robes, For example Relinquish dresses much different from Zaros since Zaros' robes glow. Relinquish does not scare me at all, His power is far weaker than mine, He is childish and Zaros actually hates the guy. Zaros however I would have a problem with, He could possibly even kill my soul meaning I would become nothing, Kind of like how Atheists think happens when you die. Relinquish only got his power because Lord Suffer found his begging amusing. \"Hello Traitor\" I say looking at his face. Relinquish has short black hair along with black dead eyes and a Black metallic eye on his forehead that allows him to read people's minds, I know because it was mine and I gave it to him for a reward for bringing in Scar. \"So how is this going to work are....\" I begin before an invisible force grabs me and smashes me into the stone wall. \"Thought so\" I say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI make my claws come out of my paws before I use my power to transform myself back into my robes and my use a cloaking spell to hide my face. \"N\u01d0 f\u00e0nle y\u012bg\u00e8 k\u011b p\u00e0 de cu\u00f2w\u00f9 (You have made a terrible mistake)\" I say while levitating with my arms spread out. Tourists and other citizens notice the two of us and begin running while the soldiers grab there guns. \"I have no Idea what you just said, Nor do I care, After I steel your soul im going to....\" he begins and I lose interest after that. I lay back while levitating to look up at the sky while he goes on a huge rant on how he is going to hang me by my intestines etc etc etc. He finishes after about 3 minutes which is amazing that it took him that long. I smile before thrusting my claws up into the air causing Razor wire to shoot out of the ground and wrap around him before throwing him through the air towards me and I float to the side two feet before I make my claws glow green and I stab them into him causing him to glow green and then teleport away. I teleported him to the Moon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>2 hours later.....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Timothy's point of view).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Timothy\" says Kia to me and I look up at her in the pitch black room to see two glowing red demonic eyes. \"Are you sad again Timothy?\" she asks me and I don't look back up at her again. She destroyed Father Patrovi, A man of God and she made him into....some kind of horrible beast. \"Get away from me demon!\" I shout to her and she smiles. \"You were such a fun boy to play with, Its still me Timothy, I gave you hugs to make you feel better\" she says and I try to throw a stone at her but it flies through her as if she was just a hologram. \"YOU LIED!!, You told me Father Patrovi was OK!, But it hurt even more that you!, My only friend left betrayed me!!\" I scream at her and she giggles evilly. \"Oh innocent little Timothy, That was the whole point of this, To break your heart and fill you with sorrow and betrayal\" she says to me before her eyes disappear and I look around for her before I feel her arms wrap around me from behind and I feel her claws across my chest and her head rested on my shoulder. Her claws smell like fresh blood and her breath stinks of the same irony stench. \"I can give you anything Timothy, you just have to accept the sorrow, Let go of your faith and beliefs and believe in reality, This....Is reality, Tell me Timothy, What do you want?, Your in your 20's, I can get you Woman, Slaves......Power\" she says before I feel her tongue lick up my cheek to taste my tears. \"Your sorrow is so lovely, You might even be able to join our ranks, Mausso would love to have a new apprentice and you would be able to meet our Lord, Salitar\" she says and I turn my head to look into her eyes. \"Burn in hell\" I say and she giggles. \"Go ahead Timothy, Follow your faith, But Remember Little Timothy, I can wait for Eternity\" she says before she is gone.</span></div></div>",

I begin walking down one of the isles of the children and I keep walking while looking at all of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk for about 40 minutes till in all directions there are endless lines of children. \"Hello?\" I say before all the children in synchronization look up at the sky causing me to jump back because they no longer have eyes.

There heads all turn to me in all directions the ones infront of me having there heads turn around completely and I freeze. \"<i><b>His name is Salitar, Lord of Suffering, His name is Salitari, Lord of Suffering....</b></i>\" they say repeating the sentence over and over at the same time and each time it begins getting louder and louder. \"SHUT UP!!\" I yell closing my eyes and covering my ears and it stops immediately. I open my eyes and I find all the children to be gone. \"W...what the fuck\" I say looking around in all directions. I sigh before turning around to see Rain standing there. \"RAIN!, What are you doing here?!\" I ask and she smiles at me. \"Im sorry for coming Alex\" she says and I am confused before she pulls out some kind of wire like cable. \"You cannot save me Alex\" she says before taking the cable and biting down on it before the cable yanks upwards and it rips her head off. \"RAIN!!!\" I scream before I look away and I find myself now in a gymnasium. \"Curiosity killed the cat, curiosity killed the cat...\" says a female voice and I turn around to see my Sister Teresa standing over a dead Zugot holding a board with nails in it. \"HAHAHA!!! Curiosity Killed the cat!!\" she says before her face begins melting \"<b><i>CURIOSITY KILLED THE CAT!!!</i></b>\" she screams. \"SHUT UP!!\" I scream now tears running down my face before I find myself back in the field. No children, No Rain but I sense someone behind me. I turn around just before a face made out of shadows comes right up to mine. It has red pointed eyes and a sharp mouth glowing blood red and it screams in my face and I scream in terror. \"<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><b><i>DON'T FIND THE CHILDREN OF SUFFER!!!!</i></b></font>\" it screams before fire ignites from its jaws sending flames at my face and I scream in agony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sit up while screaming in bed and Rain is sitting up in less than 5 seconds and Centauri kicks the door off the hinges. \"Whats Wrong?!\" asks Rain looking concerned and I breath heavily in a cold sweat. \"Oh my god.....\" I say before I reach over and I lightly grab Rain's ear before feeling her neck and muzzle. \"Are you ok Alex?\" she asks and I look at Centauri before collapsing back onto the bed. \"What a fucking Nightmare....Holy shit\" I say before getting out of bed. \"Time?\" I ask Centauri. \"7 am, I was about to wake the two of you up\" she says and I sigh before looking at Rain. \"Ill....tell you over breakfast\" I say and she nods before I put on my jeans and shirt and I walk out of the room needing some fresh air.</span></div></div>",

Trofk tree's are the rarest tree on Earth 2, There is only 1 Trofk forest and its small compared to the giant Huk tree forests. Trofk tree's get there color because they have a black oil inside there bark and wood.

The Train falls forward even more as what I guess is more of the bridge collapsing and the entire car turns vertical causing me to fall down a few more set of cars but I manage to grab hold of Rain's paws which cause her to yelp for a second and whimper as she almost loses her grip. \"What the hell!?!\" I yell before a man falls from above and crashes against a few seats before hitting the ground which use to be a wall and blood begins to puddle around him. \"I love you\"  I say up to Rain and her tail wags. \"I love you too\" she says before the Train begins to drop and everyone screams before the seat is yanked from Rain's hands and then we fall before some how the gravity changed and we crash into the glass of the windows and I fall unconscious. </span></div></div>",

I turn my tail blade on before I charge towards him letting out a loud hiss before I jump through the air leaning forward so my hands touch the ground which I use to propel myself into him. the two of us crash the ground and I raise my arm up with my claws ready to claw his eyes out but an invisible force rockets me through the air causing me to crash into the roof and then I collapse onto the hard floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Mausso's point of view).<br>\r\nI sigh before sending Alex crashing back into the fridge to keep him down and then I look at Kia who is smiling at me. \"Great job\" she says before I make a cord of Razor wire shoot out of the ground and rip the handcuffs off. \"Why haven't you healed yourself?\" I ask Kia as she stand up. \"Little prick put my blood on my hands, meaning I couldn't use my powers on the handcuffs\" she says before I heal her. \"Open the Portal Mausso\" she says before I draw a circle which glows green and then enlarges before turning into a perfect image of the Suffer realm and then we both walk through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Alex's point of view).<br>\r\nEveryone!, In we go!!\" I yell stumbling forward to follow Mausso and Kia and I see Rain coming as well. \"Rain!, Stay here!\" I say and she lowers her ears. \"Lets go!\" I say jumping inside the portal and I collapse down onto the grey ground before Sector jumps through followed by my grandfather, Venomous and then Rain jumps through. \"RAIN!!\" I yell before she wags her tail happy that she is now coming. Centauri tries to follow at the last second but is blown back by an invisible force again and after that I don't see anything else because the portal closes and we are all left in the Suffer realm with Kia and Mausso gone. </span></div></div>",

The playground equipment isn't the same either. The slide is covered in Razor blades and the swing is held by Razor wire with the seat covered in large fish hooks. \"Hello Again\" says Kia and we all look up to see her floating in the air, wearing a obsidian colored robe. Her claws have grown back and her face is hidden by shadows leaving only her eyes visible. \"We got you once, and this time we will kill you\" says Alex and Kia giggles. \"Last time you had a robot, You also fought me in the mortal world, This is my world and my powers are much stronger Here, Now, Let us begin\" she says before coils of Razor wire shoot out of the ground and begin moving through the air around Kia before shooting towards us.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI draw my bow and I take aim with an arrow in my hand before releasing the arrow. The arrow cuts through the air and soars through the Razor wire coils and buries itself into Kia's chest. \"Ha!\" I say before she rips it out and appears infront of me. \"Z\u00e0iji\u00e0n!!!\" she shouts before the invisible force blasts me back through the air and I crash into Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Sector's point of view).<br>\r\nWhile Kia is distracted I turn on the laser blade for my tail and I dive through the air to stab her and I do manage to bury my blade into her neck while stabbing my tailblade into her gut. I am simply blown off of her and before I know it I crash into someone and we both hit the ground with a loud thud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Alex's point of view).<br>\r\n\"Off!\" I shout to Sector pushing him off of me before I draw my pistol with my Katana in my left hand and I cross my pistol over my elbow of my right arm before I begin pulling the trigger sending bullets into Kia's face and chest. In a blink she disappears and I feel a set of blades slash me in the back. I quickly turn around in time to block another slash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Kia's point of view).<br>\r\nI jump up into the air to slash Alex in the face, hopefully blinding him but he blocks my claws before kicking me down to the ground. I roll across the ground before I teleport behind him but he is ready and he blocks another strike. I enlarge my claws to attempt to stab him in the face but he dodges it before grabbing them and smashing his fist into my face. I use my power to lift him off the ground and then throw him back a few feet into the swings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Alex's point of view).<br>\r\nSomething sharp stabs up into my ass before 2 razor wire cords break off from a steel bar above me and wrap around my arms. disabling my movement. \"I would have thought you all would have stopped trying, As you can see I am an immortal, Your weapons cannot kill me\" says Kia now having all my friends in the air by Razor wire wrapped around there arms and legs. \"It is time that this party ends Alex, You can't win this\" she says approaching me. \"Now, Lets have some fun shall we?\" she asks before The razor wire holding Rain Brings her closer so she is only a few feet away. \"Poor little Rain, All her life she has been hurt by her mother....yet male Wolfkin would love to fuck her cunt raw, You accomplished that even though it goes against everything you both taught....That was actually fun to watch, If I was an adult I probably would have fingered myself right there in the tree......However that would be painful\" says Kia giggling evilly and I manage to get the razor wire a little loose but then it tightens even more around me, Cutting through my shirt and into my arms. \"well, lets ruin little Rain's beauty\" says Kia before slashing downwards with one of her claws down Rain's face leaving a bleeding scar over her left eye. Rain grits her teeth as her blood soaks her fur and Rage fills me. \"Oh is Alex Angry?, Hows about I move down to her breasts so th....\" begins Kia before I feel a power ignite inside me and I roar \"NOO!!!!\" at her and she flies back through the air screaming with surprise before she crashes into some of the playground equipment causing it to come crashing down ontop of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Razor wire around me uncoils and I stand up with my katana before I begin walking towards the wreckage while my friends are released. We reach the wreckage to find Kia crawling out of it and she looks at us. \"How?!\" she asks confused and I draw my Katana and I go to slash her but she disappears in a black smoke. \"Dammit!!\" I yell.</span></div></div>",

I see his blood on it and I lick my claw clean before I get an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>5 minutes later.....</i><br>\r\n\"What do you need Kia?\" asks Mausso sitting at his desk and reading a book. Mausso spends 95% of his time reading all the books ever made in history to ease his usual boredom. Unlike me he can't get as much of a kick off torture. \"Give me all the books on Salitar\" I say and he looks up giving me a questioning look. \"Just do it\" I say before 3 pages made out of stone from 3000 BC float down and land on the ground beside me. \"Thank you\" I say before I pick them up. These are the only pages about Salitar because his ancient followers never recorded much, Shovashkin was eliminated by the Catholic church because if Shovashkin gained the popularity that the Catholic church did the World would be infested with demons and there would be torture everywhere, people would be masked murderers with chainsaws and there would be cannibalism everywhere. I take a seat in the chair before I begin reading the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The title Lord of Suffering can only be achieved by being born with demonic blood and slaying our master Salitar, No mortal however may have demonic blood unless Salitar or his children curse them with it, Those cursed with blood will slowly grow in power and eventually take on Salitar himself, This is the legend told by Xiok.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finish reading and I stare at it for a few seconds. \"Shit\" I say knowing we are probably fucked now. Xiok is the only entity Salitar fears, Xiok is a Demon and is believed to be Salitar's father, Xiok was eventually killed in 1343 by Demon slayers known as the Puritatem deus which means The Purity of God in Latin. They hunted Xiok down on horses and slayed him with 600 members of there organization, They killed him but he killed them before he died, That is why they are not recorded in history. \"Kia\" says Salitar behind me and I lower my ears before looking behind me to see him standing there. \"Alex Vinichi has demonic blood.....doesn't he?\" he asks and I nod before he nods. \"Then stop him, release the army\" he says and I nod before I teleport away.</span></div></div>",

The man has short brown hair and he is wearing nothing but shredded clothing about 10 sizes to small. He looks a good 70 pounds underweight giving him an anorexic look and he stinks like rotting shit. \"Who are you?!\" demands Rain pointing her pistol at him and he puts his hands up. \"My name is Timothy, Get ready for a fight, Didra is coming!\" he says and he isn't lying because the tree we are standing beside explodes half way to the top and crashes down towards us. I use my new power to slingshot all of us out of the way just before it crashes down where we were standing and I look up to see the Woman wearing the middle eastern robe and veil. \"Ah!, Hello again\" she says in a happy voice her eyes blood Red. \"Kia said you had Demon blood in your veins, I don't believe her, You may know a little push and pull but You definitely do not match our powers\" she says before a black apple appears in her hand and then she throws it at us. \"DUCK!!\" screams timothy managing to tackle me to the ground and I pull everyone else down with my power before the apple flies by us and hits a tree. A green smoke sprays everywhere and the tree begins burning away from what looks like acid. I draw my sword and everyone else does the same before a scimitar with a glowing purple blade appears in both of Didra's hands. \"Show me what you mortal's got\" she says before appearing in the center of us and she blows us all back through the air in opposite directions with her power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Didra's point of view).<br>\r\nI spin my scimitar's around in my hands before the snake boy charges towards me with a dagger and pistol out and I smile before I block the dagger and I slash his pistol barrel in half before he can pull the trigger. I then quickly spin behind him before slashing him across the back causing him to collapse. I then spin my scimitars around before smashing the hilts down into his back knocking him down. I quickly turn around to see Timothy with a Dagger and I smile before Kicking him in the chest while using my power sending him soaring through the air and into a tree that before he collapses to the ground. I spin my scimitars around before stabbing backwards and I look over my shoulder to see Rain Silvarz on the ground, Her only chance of escaping my scimitars. I spin around with my left leg up before I bring it down as hard as I can in an Axe kick into Rain's solar plexus knocking the wind out of her before I block Alex's blade from behind before I slow time down with one of my powers and I block 3 bullets that the older snake man fires before I throw my scimitar at him having it stab him in the shoulder and pin him to the tree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI Quickly teleport to the snake man before I rip my scimitar out and I turn around to block Alex Vinichi's blade again before I kick him in the groin causing him to bend over before I side kick him in the face sending him down onto the ground. Michael Vinichi pulls out a shotgun and pulls the trigger before I make a wall of razor wire shoot out of the ground blocking the blast before they shoot through the air to Michael vinichi grabbing the shotgun and then throwing him across the forest clearing into another tree. I turn around to block the blade of the younger snake person before I spin around and I slash his sword in 3 different pieces giving him only a hilt with a dull 1 inch blade to fight with and I slash him across the face before kicking him back through the air. I catch a glimps of steel to my left so I quickly turn and I block Alex vinichi's blade with both my scimitars. \"Give it up Alex, I might kill you quickly\" I say before he smirks. \"If my love doesn't kill you first\" he says and I just realize my mistake of blocking with two swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Rain's point of view).<br>\r\nI swing my sword with all my rage at Didra and she looks over her shoulder just before my sword cuts through her neck. Her head falls off her shoulders before hitting the ground and her body falls to the left before crashing down onto the ground squirting black blood out of the neck slowly. Her body ignites in purple flames before we hear a million screams  come out of Didra's corpse before thousands of tiny white dots shoot out into the air and then her body is nothing but ashes. \"I can't believe it.....\" says Timothy walking forward stunned before he collapses on his knee's infront of the ashes that use to be her corpse. \"You.....Killed Didra.....amazing.....\" he says before looking at me and Alex. \"THANK YOU!!!\" he yells before giving Alex a hug and Alex gets a disgusted look from how bad he stinks and he goes to hug me but I snarl at him and he steps back. \"alright, Thank you so much, What are your names?\" he asks. \"I am Alex Vinichi....\" begins Alex and Timothy's eyes light up. \"WAIT!!, Are you Marco Vinichi's Son?!\" he asks and Alex nods. \"I knew your father years and years ago!, I was just a boy!, But.....Then Mausso and Kia took me and Father Patrovi....\" he says before Sector asks the question everyone's been wondering. \"Why the fuck do you stink like shit?!\" asks Sector and I smile before Timothy turns around to see sector. \"are you and the older gentlemen experiments?\" he asks and sector nods. \"sinful what the government does....Do they still do stuff like that?\" asks Timothy and i nod. \"They still do horrible shit like this, Even worse alot of the time\" I reply before Timothy thinks. \"Everyone work on getting supplies and I will tell you all my story\" he says.</span></div></div>",

I scream out for help and she smiles before lowering her claws towards my chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Present time......</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god\" says Michael and I nod before showing them the hundreds of permanent burn scars all over my chest and stomach that Kia has cause. \"Did she let you do anything?\" asks Sector and I think through all the horrible days. \"The only time I was ever able to do something was when Kia let me walk so that my legs wouldn't stop functioning, if she didn't allow me to do that then I couldn't have escaped\" I say before we hear a gunshot in the distance and everyone looks to the right. \"Hopefully we don't run into who ever that is\" says Sector before we all get ready for bed.</span></div></div>",

Clove turns around and aims her pistol before pulling the trigger 3 times at Alex who surprisingly doesn't get hit by them. Alex puts his hand out before throwing Clove to the left in the air causing her to crash into a tree and then Michael is upon her and forcing her face into the dirt. \"Hurensohn\" says Clove before Michael forces her against the tree trunk and takes her sunglasses off revealing blood red demonic eyes like Kia. \"where did you get those?\" asks Alex and Clove rolls her eyes. \"Vell, nice to see du again Alex Finichi\" says Clove with a smile.</span></div></div>",

It stops and the room is dark and I feel ropes that have bound my wrists together and I\u2019m kneeling. The lights suddenly turn on and I\u2019m blinded a bit. I look to see a bunch of wolfkin around and most of them are wearing torn human and wolfkin clothing, some of them also have some of their flesh and fur torn from there body\u2019s and the walls are red with an even deeper shade of red in splash shapes along the walls, along with spikes coming out of them but they are spread out. There are also a bunch of different torturous machines used to give people a slow death or just plain torturing them. I look to my left to see Venomous and my grandfather bound like me. I turn my head to the right only to get pistol whipped again. I spit out some blood and look up to see the most horrible and most hated wolfkin and a complete and total bitch on every scale, Nitari. I look to my right more and see Rain next to me with sector on the other side of her. Nitari soon grabs my face and brings her face close to mine. She sniffs me a few times and looks at rain and growls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust when you couldn\u2019t disgrace me anymore, Rain. You manage to.\u201d She says and jerks my head back. I look back to see a face I haven\u2019t seen before but I remember its description, Sarok Magiak. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, well, well\u2026 if it isn\u2019t the son of the person who murdered me and my family, along with being one of the most famous and renowned commanders ever to come out of human history, son of Marco Vinichi, Alex.\u201d He says and I groan knowing this piece of shit is still alive, well sort of. The bullet wounds are still there and so is the clothing he died in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell do you guys get out of being puppets for one such as lord suffer?\u201d my grandfather asks and Nitari chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur lives back for one. Not to mention the power we can have for serving him, not to mention immortality for when we earn it.\u201d She says and I look at her with her back to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd how do you earn it? By being a breeder, a cheap whore cow to everything with cock here in the suffer realm? Beecause I distinctly remember Kia saying how your recruitment has been a little low lately, what better way than make your own?\u201d I say to her and she looks at me before bringing her leg up and clawing my face. I groan from that and she punches me in face, then kicking me in knee, nearly cracking the bone, and then hitting my throat, not enough to completely sever my breathing, just enough to make it difficult. I groan and try to breathe as I hear growling and look to see Rain growling at her mother with an intense fire in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re lucky I\u2019m bound mother or I\u2019d permanently end right here and now!\u201d she yells and her mother comes close to her and slaps. Nitari then grabs her daughter by the muzzle and brings both their faces close together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, there are plenty of wolfkin here that still remember you and still hold their feelings, their rough hard love to be with you every night.\u201d She says and Rain looks away. Her mother stands up and turns around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t care for that. Lord suffer will surely reward all of us with immortality for adding more suffer to his realm and killing the only person who can kill him.\u201d She says and I stop breathing and look up at her with a questionable look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Venomous asks and Nitari looks a little sick and Sarok is mad and disappointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe will punish you severely Nitari.\u201d Sarok says and she laughs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt won\u2019t matter, they\u2019ll die anyway. Because you have a piece of the suffer realm flowing through your veins, thanks to your father, you can kill him, but since you all are bound here and going to die, he won\u2019t know. This may be his realm but he can\u2019t see everything that goes on his realm, and-\u201c she continues but Sarok intervenes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNItari!\u201d he says and she groans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine. I\u2019ll stop. Lets end them now.\u201d She says and two wolfkin grab each of us and begin taking us to a conveyer belt. They strap in all of us with me in the front except Rain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll let my loyal subjects have their fun with my whore of a daughter. Especially since I\u2019m the only female wolfkin around here and they are just oh so pent up.\u201d Nitari says and I struggle against my rope binds and the chain on my legs and neck that are attached to the conveyer belt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou try anything Nitari and I swear I\u2019ll disembowel you and feed you to all your fucking loyal subjects!\u201d I yell and she smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be as rough with her as you were. I can still smell your scent on her; its faint but there, especially around her mouth where you too swap spit and tongue.\u201d She says and Rain begins to struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! I won\u2019t let you take me!\u201d she yells and her mother chuckles before her, Rain, a dozen wolfkin and Sarok begin walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRain! Don\u2019t make it easy! For god sakes you better make them work for every little piece! I will find you!!\u201d I yell and begin struggling as hard as I can before a wolfkin hits me in the gut with the butt of his rifle. I groan and feel the conveyor belt move and I look up to see at the end a bunch of blades spinning around at almost supersonic speed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI will get out of here, Rain, and I will make sure nothing like this every happens again.\u201d I say to myself.</span></div></div>",

The room is completely dark except for a small light hanging over me. I am completely naked and the chains keep my legs spread so whoever can thrust however deep they want into me. My mother comes out of the shadow with a wolfkin by her side, and by the way he\u2019s panting and the massive red knotted throbbing erection he has, he must be the most eager and most pent up out of everyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swear, mother, I will kill you. And nothing will stop.\u201d I say and she smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat may be so, but until then, let\u2019s see if all my loyal soldiers and servants can break your mind until you are nothing more than a babbling breeder for all of them. What better way for my daughter to become a whore than by this. He\u2019s going to go first, then another and another until they\u2019ve all cummed once. Then of they are all still in the mood, they will all come in here and have their way with you in every possible way.\u201d She says and she pulls something out, something leathery and before I can get a good look, she fastens something around my muzzle and now I can move my jaw or breathe through it, except for my nose of course. I struggle in her grip but she manages to fasten it so now I can barely moan or groan, and not even talk whatsoever. She begins walking away until there is another light and she walks through a door where I see a bunch of other wolfkin just waiting to take their turn after this one\u2019s done. Once the door closes, the wolfkin licks his muzzle and he quickly moves forward. His throbbing knotted cock rubs against my clit as his tongue begins to go all over my left breast and biting my nipple, making me yelp to myself. He stops and licks my face that isn\u2019t covered by the muzzle and begins prodding my pussy with his cock. He pulls back and I look at him and he smiles. I look down and see he is about to thrust. I close my eyes to prepare for what is to come but I hear groaning and I look at the wolfkin as he struggles as a pair of hands are on his throat. He tries to pull the hands off him but can't. I see the expression on his face turning a bit of something like pale and his eyes roll back. The fingers on the hand are placed perfectly on his neck to cut off the blood flow to his brain. Soon, he stops struggling and the hands get a tighter grip before they snap the neck. As the neck twists, the built up blood in his neck burst and blood lands on me. I groan and look up to see my savior is Alex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEarlier\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Alex\u2019s point of view)<br>\r\nI struggle as hard as I can in my chains as a couple wolfkin watch us struggle in our binds. I had no idea how I exactly used my new powers before and right now I can\u2019t because the only thing going through my head is Rain. I finally stop so I can rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you giving up?\u201d Sector says and I groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking!\u201d I yell to him but right now I got nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell think faster.\u201d My grandfather says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRemember, if you truly love\u2019ssss the wolfkin, do whatever it issss you need to ssssave her.\u201d Venomous says and I think harder until I get something that\u2019s going to hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is going to hurt.\u201d I say and the others look confused before I begin struggling even harder and they hear bones cracking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d one of them says as they both walk over to be and I dislocate my right wrist and the rope becomes easier to slip out of. I inch away from them and when one of them brings there rifle up to bash me, I roll, he hits the conveyor belt, I slip out, grab the gun, ball my right hand into a fist and hit him in the throat, stunning him bad. He falls to the ground as his friend tries to ready his weapon but I throw the gun I got at him and hits him square in the forehead, disorienting him. I take this chance and grab the chain on my throat. I can\u2019t break the shackle but I can at least break the chain off. I use as much strength as I can and the chain comes off. I do the same thing to my legs and thank god they are not shackled, only wrapped in the chains. I roll off the conveyor belt and I go for the wolfkin that got in the head with the rifle. I tackle him to the ground and I begin beating him as much as I can, my wrist beginning to get more and more messed up with every hit as the pain escalates. Finally his brain rocks for the last time and he\u2019s dead with blood coming out of his mouth, nose, ears and eyes. I throw myself back and slam the other wolfkin that was getting up against the conveyor belt. He struggles against me but I head butt him, grab him and push him into the spinning blades, the blades almost disintegrating the top half of his body as the rest hangs out before it slowly rolls in. I give a groan of disgust from all the blood splattering on me and I back up to the controls. I look at them and I quickly turn it off and everyone breathes in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank god.\u201d My grandfather says and I help everyone get out. I soon look at my wrist and I hold my breath in before I twist and snap it back into place, bringing out a massive amount of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBrutal.\u201d Says sector and I groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah.\u201d I say and I grab the rifles and toss them to my grandfather and venomous. I pop my knuckles and take off the chains go to find Rain with the others in tow. The corridors are somewhat like the room we were in before and they still use a standard vent system. I make it to a corner and look to see a dozen wolfkin waiting outside a door, with Sarok with them and Nitari coming out the door, which means she\u2019s there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTake Sarok and Nitari alive, I\u2019ll get Rain.\u201d I say and they nod before I find a vent above, where they help me into it and I make my way to the room silently. I make it to a vent and find the room dark except for a light that shows Rain bound and a wolfkin getting ready. I open the vent and I jump down without a sound, where I move forward to kill him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the Wolfkin is dead, I breathe a sigh of relief and look over to Rain who is in one hell of an interesting position. Just seeing her like this makes me start to get hard. She tries to say something but the muzzle on her face prevents actual words. Maybe now I can try something new.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know Rain, I was worried as hell for you. The thought of you being fucked repeatedly by all those wolfkin just made my blood boil\u2026 then I thought, what I\u2019m gonna do to you when I get you back.\u201d I say and she struggles a bit, probably thinking \u2018what the hell is he doing?\u2019 I walk over to her and I run my fingers through her fur, smearing the blood a bit more and as I walk around her. I hope they have showers here so we can clean up when I am done with her. I stop between her legs and stare at her as she looks at me with those pleading eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I have you back Rain. And I\u2019m going to remind you one of the reasons why you chose me.\u201d I say and I undo my belt and I let my pants and boxers drop onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Rain\u2019s point of view)<br>\r\nMy eyes widen at the size of his cock, it\u2019s now rock hard, ranging its size to about 1 foot long. I guess this realm has increased more than just Alex\u2019s powers. He places his hands on my thighs and he places his throbbing cock at my pussy. He rubs it a bit against my entrance, making me moan as my juices coat his tool. He pulls back and thrusts it deep into me, making me arch my back as best as I can and almost screaming from the sudden intrusion, but the best I can do is moan loudly. He pushes even deeper and I feel him hit something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh god! He hit my womb! Fuck. Its so big. Why of all times he has to do this to me now?!\u2019 I practically scream into my head. He leans down onto me and whispers into my ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not all of me.\u201d he says and my eyes widen even more before he thrusts more, piercing my womb, making me have the biggest orgasm I\u2019ve ever had and moan like a cheap whore as he uses me like crazy, his hands groping and kneading my breasts and nipples, the sensitivity making me cum like crazy as I feel his cock scraping the inside of my womb as it stretches my cervix open, his hot pre-cum already seeping into my flesh, making my body shiver as it heats up from his taint.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh god, Rain! You\u2019re so fucking tight, I\u2019m about to cum. You feel it.\u201d he says and I shake my head as he wraps his arms around my waist and fucks me nice and deep. He\u2019s about to cum but I don\u2019t think having a kid right is the best thing. He pulls out of me and I sigh but my breathing stops as he plunges his cock deep into the other hole I have just below. I can\u2019t take it anymore. I struggle against my binds and they break. I wrap my legs and arms around him as pain and pleasure rockets through. Soon, he cums and my eyes roll to the back of my head at the sheer amount of volume he has. I open my muzzle as hard as I can it breaks, making me almost scream in pleasure but he shoves his tongue down my throat, his tongue being the same size as mine. We stay held together for a bit until he pulls back and I moan loudly as a waterfall of his cum seeps onto the floor. I look and find that my stomach has gotten slightly bigger than before. He helps me up and I groan from the pain in my rump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI won\u2019t be able to sit for awhile.\u201d I say and he kisses me on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry love, I\u2019ll hold back until you\u2019re ready again.\u201d He says and leads me over to a table in the darkness, showing my clothes. We both get changed and head out the door to see all the other wolfkin are dead except for my mother and Sarok, who tied up by the others. I walk over to her smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe are going to have a little chat.\u201d I say and she groans.</span></div></div>",

I get an idea so I begin walking down the isle looking for S and I find it near the end. \"shot, Shout, Shovashkin\" I read out before I grab a book and I pull it out revealing the title saying <i>Deities and Laws of Shovashkin</i>. \"Alex will want to read this\" I say before running off to find him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Alex's point of view).<br>\r\n\"Get anything out of them?\" asks my grandfather carrying a large book. \"Same crap that we got from when we were tied up, we are keeping them alive....for now\" I say before he throws the book down on the picnic bench we are sitting at and I read the cover. \"This might be useful\" I say before opening the book to see the word deities written down and I flip the page to see a perfectly accurate picture of Kia wearing a obsidian black robe that has been shredded, Her eyes are blood red orbs and her claws her covered in blood with a graveyard behind her and I begin reading. <i>Kia the Sorrowful, Overseer for Salitar (Lord Suffer)'s army and the strongest of the Children of Suffer. She may have the body of a child but she is by far the smartest of the children, She enjoys torture and feeds mostly on the tears of sorrow and pain from her victims, Tears give her power, She is one of the children that is said to support a mortal with a demon's blood when they shall come from the Mortal world to the Suffer Realm. However she must....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am stopped by Timothy who stabs a knife through the picture of Kia and I look up at him. \"What are you doing?\" I ask and he sighs. \"Do not be fooled by this book, It has probably been tampered with by the Children....\" he begins but I shut him up. \"Just let me fucking read it\" I say and he pauses before removing the knife and walking into the other room and I continue reading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>However she must appear to be against the Demon blooded mortal and appear to fight him using only a fraction of her strength to make sure Salitar did not suspect her betrayal. She can only be killed by her own claws or a immortal or there weapon.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nI finish reading and I smile at the idea before Rain wraps her arms around me from behind. \"Lets go take a shower, Sector found some\" she says and I smile before standing up to go with her.</span></div></div>",

One swings a sword at me which I dodge by using the floors to slide down onto the ground and I trip the one with the sword before I stand up and I axe kick him in the center of the face shattering his goat like muzzle before I pick up his sword and I decapitate one of his pals before I spin around with all my power in this blade to bring it down like a axe against wood and his body literally splits like that. I leave the sword in the fallen before I bring my leg up kicking a creature in the chin before I bring my foot down in a Axe kick into its clawed foot shattering the bones inside causing it to roar in agony before I grab it by the fur on its back and I throw it out the window. I duck below two swinging battle axes causing both wielders to lose there heads from there comrade before I jump up and I grab the battle axe. I spin to the left before I hook my leg behind the head of one of the creatures and I use his neck to propel myself up through the air and I bring the axe above my head before I bring it down cutting a creature in half vertically before I throw the axe with all my might to my left pinning 4 more creatures to the stone wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Sector's point of view).<br>\r\nI spin my whip around above my head keeping the creatures at a distance before I send the whip out at one of them. It wraps around a cat creatures neck and it roars in agony before I pull my whip and the hooks and blades covering it shred the creatures neck completely leaving survival impossible since I ripped the arteries and wind pipe out. I spin around with my tail and the lase blade slashes 5 chests open before I whip my whip around another creature's gut and I pull him up to me before I stab my foot long dagger up into his head from his jaw before I rip my whip loose ripping its intestines out before I feel one of them grab my jackets hood from behind and pull me back to stab me in the back but I grab his arm before I lean forward quickly pulling him over my back before I use the claws on my foot to rip the creature's eyes out. I duck under a battle axe before I jump up and I bring my foot up in a kick hitting its jaw and as my foot is now above its head I bring my foot down with my claws shredding its face and neck open before I see I am surrounded again and I smile before beginning to spin around with my tail out and my whip and the blade on my tail and whip begin cutting down the creatures that have surrounded me and when i stop spinning I see they are all dead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Alex's point of view).<br>\r\nMe and my friends all stand in what use to be a small army of demonic creatures but is now a blood bath of limbs and chunks of flesh. All of us are dripping in the black and red demonic blood and we all are breathing heavily before we all continue down the halls.</span></div></div>",

My teeth have become sharper as well and I am wearing my regular clothes under my new robe, buts it\u2019s a bit uncomfortable. I shake my head to clear it because I\u2019m wondering what Rain wants. As I walk down the hallway, the candles that I past light up. I finally come to a big set of double doors and I push them open with ease to find a bunch of candles lighting up the room, some on some shelves near some books that are on the wall to the right, on a couple dressers, near the window that\u2019s on the left of the wall, on a small table at the end of the kind size bed that\u2019s opposite from the door I just entered in, and another small table near the door to the bathroom to my right where me and Rain cleaned up; speaking of Rain, she\u2019s lighting up another candle with another near the shelf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRain.\u201d I say and she looks at me as I walk over and she places them down and walks past me to the window which has a massive view of the suffer realm, revealing the torn red landscape and dark red sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d She says and I\u2019m confused and I walk up behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou told me to not come and I did, because of that, I almost got killed and raped to oblivion. I\u2019m just sorry I disobeyed you.\u201d She says and I smile and place my hands on her shoulders gently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRain\u2026 no matter what you do, I\u2019ll always love and cherish you.\u201d I say and she smiles and places a right hand on my left. She turns around and walks past me but I grab her arm. She turns to me to talk but I bring my mouth to hers and French kiss her deeply, showing another perk of my new role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Rain\u2019s point of view)<br>\r\n\u201cGuh!\u201d I moan as he shoves his tongue down my throat. His tongue being even longer than before, and nearly twice the size of mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh god! His tongue! So big\u2026 so thick. Fuck! He thrashing it about in my throat. God, I can feel it just entering my stomach!\u2019 I yell in my mind. God, if becoming the new lord suffer did this to him with his mouth, my pussy already begins to ache and wet at the thought of his cock. I feel his hands going down my back, gently sliding down until he comes to my ass and he grips it hard. I give a gurgled yelp as he lifts me up off the ground. I instinctively wrap my legs around his waist and my arms around his neck. He carries me over to the bed and lays down with him on top of me. He didn\u2019t stop the tongue fucking of my life and until he lets go of my slightly bruised ass and untangles me off him. He pulls back and I take a massive breath of air as his tongue leaves me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean I like you disobeying me.\u201d he says as I lay there on the bed breathing heavily, my mind dazed a bit from the whole ordeal and lack of oxygen. I then feel movement and I look down to find Alex taking off my shirt.I lift my head and my arms up to let him and he takes my shirt off me, revealing my bare chest and breasts. He looks at me with this evilish smile as I watch his eyes beginning to change, once they were just red are now red and have changed to the slits of something like a snakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlex, what happened to your-!\u201d I begin but he jumps to my neck and bites me. I don\u2019t move, I just give off a breathless moan as I can\u2019t talk. He just keeps his teeth clenched against my neck as I feel the fangs of his teeth against my fur and flesh on my neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Don\u2019t move. Don\u2019t talk. Just lay there and take it all.\u2019 I hear in my head and I recognize the voice is Alex. He slowly takes his jaws off my neck but he gives a long lustful lick from my neck and along the side of my face, making me shiver and shake under his grasp. He continues to lay on me as he looks at me with a straight face, probably wondering about my response. I slowly nod my head in a yes and he smiles before going back to my neck and licking and kissing me. He goes down to my breasts, licks and kisses both of them before going down across my stomach and nipping my clit and I jump. He licks the lips of my pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh god!\u2019 I yell in my mind as he starts rubbing a bit harder until he pulls his tongue back and drives it fully forward until he hits hard against my cervix. I give off a loud moan as he roughly licks and stretches out the walls of my pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I won\u2019t\u2026 last long!\u2019 I yell in my mind as best I can since I can\u2019t think straight. He runs his tongue over my g-spot and I arch my back. Pleasure soon shoots straight throughout my entire body as my barrier to hold my orgasm breaks and I moan loudly as my juices spray straight into his mouth. I hear loud gulping noises as he drinks and swallows all my juices that I give him. My orgasm soon ends and I fall flat on the bed, completely spent from the experience. He stands up and looks at me as he licks his lips slowly and sensually, already making get wet again. I look down to see a massive tent on his pants and he begins removing his clothing, first he takes off his robes, then his shirt. He then trails his hands down and unbuckles his pants and lets them and his boxers drop. My eyes go hide and don\u2019t breathe as I see his cock has expanded to a length of around two feet and his balls have to a size slightly bigger than oranges. I begin to breathe heavily at the thought of him shoving that monster into me. He finishes stripping and crawls on top of me until his iron hard cock is just a couple inches from my muzzle. I just stare at it for a second before he leans down to my ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGet it nice and wet, bitch. I don\u2019t want to have to hurt you now do I.\u201d he says and I don\u2019t know if he meant by he hurts me if I don\u2019t lick him, or he hurts when he fucks me; either way, his cock is now in my mouth all the way down to the back of my throat. I suppress my gag reflex as I work to coat ever section of this monster in my saliva. I twist my tongue around the head and down its length as much as I can but when I can\u2019t get the rest, I pull him out and I go down to the base, where I wrap my tongue around it and I lick up until I stop at his head and go back down. Once his cock is practically dripping, I look at itfor a sec before he stops me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, I want to unload everything on the first shot.\u201d He says and forces me down. Making me yelp before shoving the head into my pussy, making me give off a breathless moan and groan as he slowly pushes it in, the obscene length and girth of it stretching me in ways I can\u2019t dream of. He stops at my cervix, grips me hard and shoves it the rest of the way in, sending pleasure ripples throughout my body. He just stays like that with the weird but pleasurable stretching feeling I have. He grabs the back of my head and makes me look down to see a big bulge pushing my skin. He pulls out a bit and the bulge deflates before he rams it back in and my flesh stretches again. I moan loudly and shake at the same time as he bounces the both of us on the bed, sending massive ripples of pleasure through me. As he continues to fuck better than ever, I feel his balls tighten up and his cock growing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you want me to cum in you? Just say it, beg it.\u201d He says lustfully and I snap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes! Cum, cum inside, fill me with gallons of your demonic potent seed!\u201d I yell to him and he smiles before completely taking it out and ramming it into my asshole. I clench my teeth and my eyes roll back as I have a massive orgasm as he pushes slowly into me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod Rain! Your so fucking tight!\u201d he says to me as I feel him straightening and stretching me out. He grips me hard as he buries himself completely into me and cums. I feel the torrent of his cum through the skin of his urethra through my anal ring as his urethra widens out and explodes gallons of cum into me. I claw the bed as he fills me up completely, more than that. I feel my stomach begin to inflate and expand as he continues to cum. My eyes roll back as I give off a breathless moan from the second orgasm I have. Soon he stops and lays down to my right as I feel his cum flowing out my rectum and hits the floor until I tighten up and it stays locked inside me. I breathe heavily as I look up to the ceiling and look down to see I look nine months pregnant with twins. I rub my stomach a bit and so does Alex. I sit up and turn around so I can crawl off the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI think I need to use the restroom.\u201d I say but he grabs my tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d He says and rams his cock back into my ass. I yelp as he grabs my ass and pounds away into me doggystyle. I lean down as my ass stays in the air and leans down onto me as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna fill you up so much until it comes out your mouth.\u201d He says to my ear and I moan as I feel his cum slashing around in my stomach already. Soon he cums again and I feel my stomach expand even more, my stomach hitting the bed I feel sick. I close my mouth to stop myself from throwing up and I feel everything about me beginning to stretch out, my stomach, intestines, my throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh\u2026 god.\u2019 I say in my mind and Alex leans in rubs my throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s right my love, let it all out.\u201d He says and it comes out my nose and I can\u2019t breathe. I can\u2019t take it anymore. I open my mouth and I scream loudly as best I can through my gurgled throat as I have a mind shattering orgasm and the pressure on my body lessens as cum shoots out my mouth and lands on the floor that soon makes a massive puddle. He stops cumming and the flow out my throat comes to a halt as I breathe weakly and swallow the cum still on my muzzle and nose. We collapse together with him still inside me and now I look like I have quadruplets. He kisses me on the cheek before my vision turns black and I fall asleep from exhaustion.</span></div></div>",

Me and Rain are really close together as I hug her tightly to me. My cock is still inside her but its flaccid but still long. I slowly pull out and she gives off a low moan in her sleep. Once I\u2019m out, a small torrent of cum leaks from her abused hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have that now can we.\u201d I say and I sit up and I pull my hand back and I give her nicely shaped ass a loud open palmed smack. She gives off a loud yelp as her eyes shoot open but they slowly close again and she goes back to sleep. Her entrance quickly closes up, locking the rest of my cum inside, insuring that Rain still keeps that nicely pregnant rounded shape she has on her stomach. She sleeps peacefully as I stare at that beautiful perfect face she has. I lean in and I give the spot on her rump I slapped a kiss and she moans in her sleep and turns a bit. I smile and stand up. I grab my boxers and put them on, then my new robe, since I was a bit uncomfortable with my regular clothes and robe on, I have a choice from now on, either my boxers and robe, or my regular clothes. The robe will hide my new features and such but won\u2019t last long in a fight; the opposite for my regular clothes. I walk over to the window to find the landscape just as how it was before me and Rain had our fun. I look at my watch to reveal its around 9:30 am. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is my new world, my realm, Suffer turned it into something horrible and nightmarish\u2026 time to rectify his mistake.\u201d I say to myself and I concentrate as hard as I can but my body is a bit weak from all the fluids I used up. I concentrate harder on what I want and it happens, a red yellow circle begins forming in the sky, then a dot forms in the middle of the same color and begins expanding out to the edges, turning into a sun. I fall on one knee since that little stunt I just did took a lot out of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlex are you alright?\u201d I hear behind me and I look to see Rain sitting up. I stand up and turn to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m alright, are you?\u201d I say with a smile and so does she as she runs her hands over her extremely bloated belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAside from the bloating feeling, sickness feeling I get every so often, and the fact that I don\u2019t need to eat for awhile, I\u2019m fine.\u201d She says and I notice some new features about her that are new, minus the pregnant looking stomach. I walk over to her and kiss her on the lips, then I sit down next to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look even more beautiful than before my love.\u201d I say and she looks at me a bit confused until I grab a mirror from the nightstand and I show her. Her eyes are now blood red, her teeth are sharper than before. I open her mouth and I poke her teeth with my finger and I cut myself. I watch as the blood slowly drips down my finger but don\u2019t see it anymore as Rain takes my finger into her maw and licks my finger clean. I pull back to see everything alright and she smiles as she licks her lips. A little look down reveals the last feature and one I personally like, her breasts have grown to EE cup. She taps me on the head to snap me out of my daze and I look at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that I don\u2019t like you being so attentive of me, but I was wondering how you were able to, you know, do that to me last night?\u201d she asks and I smile and rub her stomach sensually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI make the law her, my love. There isn\u2019t much in biology to fully prevent me from filling you up like a water balloon, but I am your lord, and you are my mistress, and the thought of you pregnant and\u2026 so big and round with my cum just, turns me on so much.\u201d I say and I already begin to get hard again but she places her hand on my thigh and I try to calm down. I manage to and I help Rain up. She weakly stands up and manages to stand on her own and begins to walk to the bathroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d I ask and she looks back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo the restroom.\u201d She says but I stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, I want you to show the others the result of last night.\u201d I say and she smiles and walks to me. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d just love to flaunt your new powers about wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d she says and I smile and kiss her on the lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOnly with you my love. Only with you.\u201d I say and walk over to the closet and I find some different clothing but I find what looks like a bathrobe for Rain and I take it to her and she puts it on. It does nothing to hide her filled stomach but the cotton robe does hide her naked form. She smiles and we begin walking out the room. We soon come to a T cross section. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you head to the dinner hall and see if the others are there, I need to make sure there\u2019s no one else left in the prisons to rot while we have fun.\u201d I say and she nods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright my love. I\u2019ll go find the others and\u2026 explain.\u201d She says and she turns to go but I give her shapely has a nice slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh!\u201d she yelps and looks at me with a naughty smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOhhhh, naughty boy.\u201d She says and chuckles as I watch her figure move with ease and grace she walks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGod I love the love that woman.\u201d I say to myself and I begin walking in the other direction where Kia took me to. After walking for some time, I come across the door and everything is pitch black except for the light in the spot where I found Teresa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad she\u2019s back.\u201d I say to myself and I still can\u2019t see anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot for long.\u201d I say and I raise my hand and concentrate a bit and soon, the entire hallway lights up with torches coming to life, revealing hundreds of cell doors down the hallway. People begin chattering and going to the doors and I swipe my hand in the air and all the doors open. Soon people begin walking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEveryone will head to the courtyard and await!\u201d I yell and everyone begins walking and running past me, some ranging from very young, to very old, some with torn clothing, and some with barely nicked clothing. I look and find the cell next to where my sister was is still closed and pitch dark. I go over to it and I try to open but its jammed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOkay fuck this.\u201d I say and I kick the door down, busting it off its hinges as it crashes flat on the ground. Before I can react, something comes flying at me and embeds itself into me shoulder. I groan from the pain and someone charges me but I grab the persons arms and hold them off the ground so they can\u2019t struggle. I look at the persons face to reveal its someone I also know, Helga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelga!\u201d I say and she stops and looks at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlex?!\u201d she asks, not really sure its me on account of my new features. I drop her and I hug and she hugs me back. We stay like that for some time until I break it and I look at her to see she\u2019s somewhere between 50 and 60.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelga, you look good.\u201d I says and she blushes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you. The lord suffer prefers as young as much as a person can get. Since I died of old age, this was as best as I can be.\u201d She says and I smile. She looks at me more closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUhhhh\u2026\u201d she says and I look to my left shoulder to find the bone dagger she made still in my shoulder. I grab it and pull it out and throw it away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat happened to you, and how did you get here?\u201d she asks and I smile and chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long story, let\u2019s go find the others and I\u2019ll explain.\u201d I say and she nods and walks with me to find the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe finally make it to the dining hall and I push open the doors to reveal everyone sitting down in a massive decorated room at a long rectangular table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo all that from one night?\u201d I hear Teresa ask Rain and she smiles, blushes and chuckles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, as well as some of the other new things you\u2019ve noticed about me.\u201d she says and I clear my throat to get everyone\u2019s attention. They all look at me and Helga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLook what I found.\u201d I say motioning Helga and my grandfather\u2019s eyes light up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHelga!\u2019 he says and comes to hug her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello dear.\u201d She says and I motion for them to go to the table we all do. I sit down next to Rain and Kia and Mausso walk in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs there anything you need my lord?\u201d Kia asks and I think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, if you got anything to eat, see if you can bring something for me, you two and everyone else here.\u201d I say and Rains quickly adds:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExcept for me, I\u2019ve already had plenty to eat last night.\u201d She says and looks down to her stomach and rubs it slowly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, mistress.\u201d Kia says and they both leave. I look at everyone else and place my hands on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow, I think we all need to explain everything to each other to make sure nothing is out of place and everyone understands.\u201d I say and they all nod. My sister is the first to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst off, how are you all here, and how did my brother become the new lord suffer?\u201d she asks and I lean forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d I begin.</span></div></div>",

The ghosts stand 8 feet tall and they are a greyish blue color and are completely transparent. There eyes glow blood red but instead of detailed eyes they are just orbs. \"Food is Served\" says Kia before teleporting to her seat and pulls her hood off her head. The ghosts put the trays down on the long table and lift the lids revealing all different kinds of food from Earth 1 and 2. The ghosts hand us all our cutlery before they bow to me and then disappear in a blink. \"Lets eat then\" says my grandfather and we all begin dishing our plates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Later....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must warn you about something my Lord\" says Mausso catching up to me in the hallway and I give him a questioning look. \"When Zaros finds out about you replacing Salitar he will try everything possible to destroy everything you love.....including your family\" he says and I give her a sharp look for a second. \"If he does I will rip his throat out\" I say and he nods. \"The problem is my Lord.....he is still growing in power, Salitar easily defeated him 8 hundred years ago and now Salitar had to spend 6 hours fighting him and Scar\" says Mausso and I think about it. \"Ill think of a plan\" I say and he nods. \"Where is Kia?\" I ask wanting to talk to her. \"She is currently in the courtyard\" he replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walk down the stairs into the courtyard to find Kia sitting in a chair and looking at all the prisoners that are now sleeping, walking around or recovering. \"Hello Kia\" I say and she looks at me. \"Hello my Lord\" she says before I make a chair appear beside hers and I sit down in it. \"Do you think I can defeat Zaros?\" I ask and she smiles. \"since your the Demon blood, Maybe, But you don't have your powers trained well enough yet\" she says and I think. \"Can you teach me?\" I ask and she shakes her head. \"Your more powerful than me, I use my powers differently and my powers are different\" she says and I am curious what she means by that. \"How?\" I ask. \"You can just think of what you want to happen and it will, I have to summon and use all my might to make Razor wire shoot through the ground and rip someone apart, My powers are thoughts, dreams, Nightmares, Cloaks, Teleports, Curses and spells, Yours is Omni, Meaning everything, Anything you think of can happen pretty much\" she says and I think. \"How is Zaros gaining in power?\" I ask. \"Tears of the Innocent, thats why I kept all these prisoners so i would atleast have a shot at Zaros if I ran into him or Scar\" she says and I think about it. \"ill think about what we have talked about\" I say and she shrugs. \"Those who think and not do are the ones who die and not survive\" she says and I continue down the hall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI enter my room again to find Rain now back to normal and wearing nothing but her underwear and doing her stretches. \"Not tonight Alex\" she says before I can get close enough and I shrug deciding to let her heal up a bit. I walk across my bedroom to another door and I open it revealing a giant Library with Mausso sitting at a Desk. \"How did you get in here?\" I ask since my bedroom door was locked. \"Kia's and My bedroom connect here too, I spend most my time here my Lord\" he replies before continuing to read a book on the Anglo Saxons. \"What was it like fighting the french?\" I ask and he looks up again. \"Scary, Loud, Wet, fast.....Painful\" he says and I remember now that he drowned when his ship sunk. \"Timothy still hates Kia\" says Mausso and I sigh. \"That guy's a pain in the ass\" I say and he nods. \"Im worried about him, I think he is plotting something my Lord\" he says and I laugh. \"Were immortals, He can't do anything\" I say and he puts the book down. \"A few hundred Mortals Killed Xion a Demon Lord, Mortals can kill immortals if they have the right equipment, Think about the thought my Lord\" he says before continuing to read.</span></div></div>",

On the other side he has a silver eagle holding the Nazi Swastika and on the inside of his trench coats collar is the symbol for the SS, The style of the jacket allows me to see it and on his left arm he wears a Nazi armband. On his head he wears a WWII SS officer hat that has the Nazi eagle of germany holding the Swastika and below it he has the SS symbol again. He wears black boots and black gloves and his hair is short and black and his eyes blood red, Over his left eye is a horribly hideous scar. \"Ah, Mr Nich, Is now finally begging to someone much much more greater than he really is\" he says his voice having a very faint accent to it. \"Please!...I..Im sorry I didn't pay!!\" I shout and he laughs. \"You think this is about money?, This is about Fun\" he says and I give a confused look. \"W...Wait your not an assassin?\" I ask and he laughs. \"No, I am here to murder you, Simple as that! Haha!\" he laughs and I scream for help. \"Hey Fuckwit, Were in the middle of the Fathazer section of Earth 2, No one can fucking here you\" he says before I feel the train tracks under my back beginning to vibrate. \"auf Wiedersehen\" he says before disappearing and I look to my left to see a Zugot Train roaring towards me at high speeds. \"AAAAHHH!!!!\" I scream before it hits me.</span></div></div>",

All the Mindless children however were restored to demonic monsters since after I erase a memory from someone....its gone. Timothy however is taking care of that Patrovi guy even though he is 98% a mindless zombie, His only functions really are Eat, sleep, breath, Mumble, scream, and use the washroom. He's pretty much currently like an animal. I reach the sun dial in the center of the court yard and rest my paws on it to look at where the moon light is shining on it. Its pointing at the Roman numeral II so currently its two AM and I sigh knowing I haven't slept my 8 hours tonight. I go to fly back into the castle only to find Timothy standing there giving me a angry look and I smile. \"Ah hello Timothy\" I say running my claws slowly across the stone of the sun dial. \"Return his memory Kia\" he says and I giggle. \"Sorry....Can't do that, Your lucky I didn't clear your head of thoughts and memories or you would be nothing but a brain dead fuckwit....Like Patrovi\" I say and I see he has a hatchet on his belt and I can tell he wants to draw it and bury it into my skull. I teleport behind him and I wrap my arms around him from behind so my claws are over his chest like I use to and I smile while leaning to his year. \"Don't even try killing me, your too stupid to take down a immortal Timothy\" I say before I teleport inside the castle to get breakfast ready for My Lord, Mistress and everyone else. Mausso will probably come down to help with the cooking in 3 hours so I will get all the ingredients from the Mortal world. Im thinking French toast with a side of sausages and some fruit for breakfast today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI open a portal to the city of Kizkaat which is a Zugot named city on earth 2. Kizkaat means Valley in Zugot and 98% of all citizens are Zugot's in Kizkaat. The Zugot's though love Human cuisine so alot of Zugot based villages hunt food and make Human based food out of there hunts. They still mostly eat there own foods but they have opened up alot more in the past 19 years. There capital however still remains completely cut off not allowing any humans inside currently. I run over to a shopping center and I walk inside. The A.C is cranked up currently since it is 12 pm at this part of Earth 2 and I begin shopping for my ingredients.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter I have them I simply teleport back to the suffer realm to begin cooking the food for breakfast, Hopefully everyone likes holiday sauce.</span></div></div>",

He is much younger than Kora and Relinquish\" I ask and she sits down. \"Well Scar was Raised in a strict home, He always was forced to pay attention by his father and mother and to follow orders, When Scar was Recruited into the Schutzstaffel he made Adolf Hitler his role model. He Follow'd orders exactly how they were given and he fought his way up through the ranks to Obersturmf\u00fchrer. He supervised a Concentration camp and sentenced thousands of people to death, He died defending the Concentration camp from the Americans\" says Kia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did he die?\" asks sector and Kia smiles. \"He actually ran back inside the prison area and began killing the prisoners, The American's came in and opened fire shooting him in the left thigh and the right shoulder, He managed to kill the first american's that got inside but he was captured by the Americans. He didn't make it out of the camp however, He took a Cyanide pill and was dead before they could get a single word out of him\" replies Kia and I roll my eyes. \"Ok so we have to kill an Ancient Necromancer, An Alchemist, An insane Archer from what I hear, An insane bitch and a Nazi bastard\" I say and Kia thinks. \"That about sums it up\" says Kia before giggling and I sigh. \"Alright then, We better get going\" I say before Kia opens a portal and flies through before we all begin walking through.</span></div></div>",

You told me he is weak at short range\" I say but he shakes his head. \"Cloud has excellent hearing and he uses teleportation to get away from his targets, While your chasing after him he will be shooting his arrows at us, and they are not the kind you want to be shot with because they paralyze you\" replies Mausso and i think. \"And whats wrong with Scar?\" I ask and he smiles. \"Scar may be alot younger than me but he is definitely stronger, He uses world war 2 weaponry with a demonic twist on them and he is cruel, He once ripped a womans face off and kept her alive with his powers for 30 years, she felt agony the entire time and he even wore the face as a mask to scare her even more, He will probably be one of the last we kill\" says Mausso and I think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do we bring Relinquish or Kora out into this world?\" I ask. \"We just have to find them, Everyone but Zaros spends most of there time in the Mortal realm, Kia can track them, Or we might accidentally run into them, If we run into Scar we will have a problem, If we run into Relinquish we kill him\" says Mausso and I nod before the portal opens and Rain and Kia walks through. \"Water please\" says Rain and I hand her a bottle of water before she grabs it and drinks half of it. \"So, We got a game plan?\" asks Rain and I nod.</span></div></div>",

The lobby has black stone floors with white walls and the desk is made out of Huk wood. \"Hello, Here to kill your leader\" I say to the guards behind the desk as I begin walking towards the stairs. \"Stop right there!\" shouts one of the guards before I bring my fist back in the famous movie punch to hit someone behind your right shoulder and I hear them fly back through the air. \"This is sweet\" I say entering the stairs. The stairwell is blindingly white. Another door opens and 4 guards burst through the door before they aim plasma rifles at me and begin firing. I feel 4 extremely hot splats of plasma hit me and burn through me in less than a second and I fall back in agony. I make the pain disappear and my wounds heal before I stand up. \"Agh! fuck that hurt!\" I say to them and they gawk at me in shock. \"Aaaaand fuck you!\" I say blasting them back and they crash out a window. \"Proceeding\" I say to myself continuing to climb the stairs casually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>30 minutes later....</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Albert Nashton Jr's point of view).<br>\r\nThe doors to my office explode off the hinges, I scream in shock before ducking underneath my desk before both doors crash out the windows. I slowly look up to find a man standing there and he smiles at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Alex's point of view).<br>\r\n\"Hello Fucker!\" I say walking forward with a big smile on my face. He draws a laser pistol and takes aim before pulling the trigger and I feel sharp red hot pains for a second in my heart, shoulder, forehead, groin and stomach. I run up to him before I slap the pistol out of his hand before I grab the hair on the back of his head and I smash his head into the desk. \"THAT! (smash!) REALLY! (SMASH!) FUCKING! (SMASH) HURT! (SMASH SMASH!)\" I say while smashing his head onto the table before I bring my fist back and I smash it dead center into his mouth knocking all of his teeth out. \"No ones starting a bull shit war again!!\" I shout in his face but I don't think he even knows whats going on anymore. \"Bye!\" I say before Throwing him out the last unbroken window in his office and he falls to his death, I don't bother looking though.</span></div></div>",

Battle robots are made out of the same kind of metal that Centauri and Caroline are made of making them immune to Plasma and Laser weaponry. They have one circular lens with a robotic eye behind it and the ends of there arms are glowing red laser blades. They stand about 6 feet tall and have a more human like shape to there bodies like Centauri and Caroline. \"How have things been?\" I ask Centauri who approaches so she is only about 15 feet away. \"Actually Alex....I am not here to defend you anymore\" she says and I think. \"My father sold you back to the government?\" I ask and she shakes her head. \"No, Actually, I am here to kill you by the new law of the A.I Government, first Rule is: No humans are allowed left alive\" she says and I get angry. \"You and Caroline...want to...Extinct the human race? Your creators?\" I ask and she nods. \"You see, Humans are like a environmental damaging chemical that ruins the planet Earth....Good for nothing, and nothing but...well chemicals, Nothing good comes out of it....\" she says before the battle robots approach so they are beside Centauri. \"Your race has ruined Earth 1 Countless times, And what have you done to save yourselves!? Complain! and not do anything about it!, Millions of species died because of your godforsaken race!, The Deer, The Polar bear, The seals, Even the great tiger died because of your filthy race, You may have created us, but we are 100% superior and 100% smarter than you, and what do you do to us? Treat us like a bag of garbage, Not anymore though Alex-san, Within a week the Human race will cease to exist and we will finally be able to cleanse Earth 1 of its filth\" she says and I laugh. \"You've gone insane!, Your just like Albert Nashton!\" I shout and she shakes her head. \"Albert Nashton was a Tyrant, We are simply making the galaxy a much much better place, Who knows, Maybe we will keep a few of your race around and use them for servants\" says Centauri before pointing at me and my friends. \"Kill them\" she says and I sigh before drawing my sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lets kill these....\" begins Sector before I open a portal and I throw everyone inside. \"The hell are you doing Alex!!\" yells Rain trying to get up inside the suffer realm. \"Im not having Sector or Venomous die from these!\" I say before I close the portal and I charge towards the battle robots. I reach the first one and it swings its left blade at me which I duck under before I jump up through the air using my powers to shoot me up into the air. My sword rips through the battle robots body cutting it vertically in half before exploding. I spin my sword around so its pointing down to the ground and I use my fall to stab my sword into another ones head. I quickly rip my sword out before I touch both my wrists to make shackles appear and I then make a chain attach to my sword and shackles so my sword is shackled to my arm. I do the same to another sword I make appear in my left hand and I smile before throwing both my swords and each one stabs into another battle robots chest. I use there weight to pull myself forward ripping the shackles off while I fly through the air. I make razor wire shoot through the ground and crush the other ones just as I crash into Centauri knocking the two of us two the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Centauri's point of view).<br>\r\n\"See you around!\" says Alex after getting to his feet and out of nowhere a portal opens and he runs through. \"Your not going anywhere!\" I shout after him before following him through and this time I can come in. I grab hold of his robes hood but then he vanishes in a blink. My systems malfunction for a moment trying to figure out how thats possible but I stop one of my programs so I don't shut down. I turn on my tracking device that I gave Alex when he was a baby that is still today in his stomach. It says he is North of here and quite a far distance so I turn on the rockets and fly through the sky.</span></div></div>",

The tracker says he\u2019s inside the castle. I look at some of the windows on a bunch of different floors of the massive demonic looking structure. I don\u2019t know exactly how Alex was able to attain those powers he used on my guards, I know from when he was a baby he had some type of unknown taint in his blood that the best tech and doctors couldn\u2019t find out about. Nothing massive has happened to him so I never paid it any attention, but now\u2026 it\u2019s definitely got my attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened to you Alex, but I don\u2019t wish to kill you and your family, I will be able to make you all my slaves, so you won\u2019t have to die.\u201d I say to myself. A bit of sadness in my voice on account of how long I\u2019ve been a member of their family. I see a bunch people walking around in some type of rough looking demonic type armor and weapons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMust be your guards.\u201d I say and I zoom in on a window that\u2019s between four other windows and see Rain, Venomous, Sector, Marco, Cinder and some others but I can\u2019t make them out because they have their backs turned to me and are on the other side of the room, which looks like a massive dining room. I look up higher to see another window with a figure behind some curtains. The curtains move and standing there is Alex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI need to go slow and quiet, if I go full blown jet rocket at him, he\u2019ll see me, get the jump on me, and not to mention everyone else in the castle will hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m coming for you, Alex. Don\u2019t make this difficult.\u201d I say and I begin running down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Alex\u2019s point of view)<br>\r\n\u201c*sigh*\u201d I sigh and step away from the curtains and sit down on a chair in front of the table in front of the window. I stare out into the red and black landscape with the sun in the position indicating it should be around 9.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow a member from my own family comes to kill me.\u201d I say, since I\u2019ve always considered Centauri as a second mother to me. Seeing her pull out a weapon, threaten me and my friends and family, my heart is cracked, but not broken, because I will never let something like this change me a major amount to something of the former lord Suffer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said I will change this world, and I will.\u201d I say and I go to the sheathe on my hip and I take out a dagger that Sector gave me, since I already have my hidden blades hidden under my wrists, I still want to be prepared. I look at the dagger for a second before I close my eyes and I concentrate my energy into it. Soon, swirling red and blackness covers the entire dagger and it forms into a much more demonic and deadly dagger. What once was just a standard steel dagger, has now blood red parallel twin blades, and another blade curves in front of my fist with spikes coming off it, but the blade is far enough from my fist that I can still spin it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cZaros has powers similar like mine, maybe when it comes time to fight, I might have an advantage if this experiment is a success.\u201d I say to myself and I open up my robe to reveal Rain\u2019s name just barely visible. I hold my breath and I begin cutting it back again. After half an hour of pain staking flesh cutting on my chest, it\u2019s done. I let out a massive groan and I stab the nice into the desk, my wound not even healing in the slightest bit, it\u2019s just there. Which proves my theory, a weapon I make, can hurt me like a regular human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope it works for Zaros as well.\u201d I say and I go to head to the restroom but something busts right through my window. Razor wire shoots from four directions and catches Centauri, since I knew Centauri would try and attack me. She struggles but the wire is wrapped up with the flat parts of the blades on her arms and legs. She tries to use her jets and weapons to get free but they hold her tight. I smile and turn around to face her, which her face is just a few inches away from mine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello Centauri.\u201d</span></div></div>",

She stands in front of me with a confused look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t exactly predict what humans can do.

She looks around but I appear behind her and I wrap my left arm around her waist, holding her arms against her. She instantly struggles and tries to break free but I hold her tight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see about that.\u201d I say and I use my free hand and I open a panel to assign her commands. I assign her commands and activate her HOP program. I close the panel and let her go she struggles a bit then looks back at me. She charges at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cStop!\u201d I yell and she does.

What do you need\u2026 of\u2026 me?\u201d she asks in a confused tone at the sight of Centauri. She goes to grab her knife but I stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Teresa. I got everything worked out. Head back to the others.\u201d I say and she looks suspicious but stands up straight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then, Alex. Be careful.\u201d She says and turns to leave. Centauri looks at me with pure confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTha\u2026 that\u2019s im\u2026 impossible.\u201d I saw her die right in front of me. I was the one who killed her. I cut both arteries in her neck. She couldn\u2019t have survived that!\u201d Centauri yells and I smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan robots and technology revive a life after clear indication they are permanently dead?\u201d I ask and she looks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThey can\u2026 but not right now. Our tech will take even longer in order to try something like that but the spirit can\u2019t be killed. Lord suffer took hers and wanted to do things to her, but now she\u2019s back, she\u2019s alive, and more powerful than before. Robots aren\u2019t the ultimate beings, but they sure are a challenge to humans.\u201d I say and she looks back up at me. I wave my hand for her to come over to me and she does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere\u2019s another thing I plan to do to this tainted place.\u201d I say and I raise my hands I concentrate. Soon, all the dead trees begin to come to life, the blackness that surrounded them turns them back to their brown color, the branches springing back up to life as the green leaves begin sprouting again, bringing the life they once had before. I finish and I almost fall forward out the window but Centauri grabs me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d she asks laying me back on the ground I chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI plan\u2026 to try and make\u2026 this place and oasis. A place of protection and care to those who deserve it. The corruption will forever stay here, but I will bring some good to this place.\u201d I say and she helps me up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf anyone can, its you.\u201d She says and I smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThank you Centauri. Out of everyone, I always considered you a second mother. Now let\u2019s go and explain everything to everyone.\u201d I say and she nods, probably a bit touched at my words. She helps me and we begin walking to the dining room where everyone else is.</span></div></div>",

She no longer had to follow directives but she did so no one suspected her of anything, However the whole time she was running a program that would tell her how to permanently cleanse Earth 1 of Pollution, Crime, Violence and over population, The answer, Extinction\" Says Centauri. \"Does Caroline have a automatic shutdown?\" I ask. \"Not anymore, On her old body she did but since then she switched to a form more like me so no one could stop her\" replies Centauri before a window smashes behind us and we turn around to see Kia. \"Hello, idiots, if you haven't forgotten we still got Zaros, Scar, Cloud and Kora to deal with!\" says Kia and I think. \"Alright, Centauri, Do what ever you can to slow Caroline and the robots down, do anything at all, we need more time\" I say before she nods and I open a portal to earth 1 for her before turning to everyone else to tell them what the plan is.</span></div></div>",

Standing beside him is a woman with spiked black hair and pale skin. She wears a black robe with a purple trim and some kind of symbols covering it that glow purple. Her eyes are blood red like the Nazi beside her and the Nazi draws a VERY old pistol from his jacket with the SS insignia on the side. Im guessing this is scar and Kora. \"Hows about we kick this party up a bit more Kora?\" asks Scar giving her a questioning look before she flicks her fingers and her eyes glow purple before I feel a sharp cold breeze over my body before something begins fucking with my head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Alex's point of view).<br>\r\n\"Ah, Lets see how you all do when your fighting against your loved ones and friends\" says scar before I turn around to find Rain, Kia and Sector covered in the same purple symbols. \"We will just sit back and watch as your friends and loved ones Murder you horribly\" says Scar before Rain charges towards me and Kia charges at Mausso with Sector charging towards his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rain!\" I say blocking her Samik but her eyes are empty and instead of red are glowing purple. \"Fight her Rain!\" I shout before she brings her paw up and it hits me in the jaw before she spins around and she knocks my sword out of my hand before I am blasted back by her powers and I smash into a tree. She goes to stab me but I barely dodge it and she stabs her samik into the tree. I grab her wrist quickly and I sigh before I twist it, breaking it. She yelps in pain before I grab the back of her head and I bring her muzzle close to my face. \"Your not her pet Rain!, Your beat your mother and you still keep fighting!\" I shout into her ear before her eyes begin flickering as she tries to fight it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Mausso's point of view).<br>\r\nI use my powers to sprint through the forest as fast as possible with Kia shooting through the air in pursuit of me. I sense her directly behind me and I summon my sword before clashing blades with her claws before I make myself transparent and I float through a giant Huk tree before Kia smashes face first into it. I quickly summon my Razor wire and I make it wrap around the tree before grabbing Kia and forcing her against the tree. I pull her hood off and I see Kia smiling with her eyes glowing purple. \"Come on Mausso, what are you going to do? Fuck me? I've always known its one of your ultimate wishes you sick fuck! Hahaha!!\" she laughs and I give her a punch to the side of the head to knock her out before I put my hand against her forehead. \"Ego praecipio tibi ut hunc dimittis puellas mens! (I command you to cease this girls mind!)\" I shout before I feel Zora's power leave Kia and I unwrap the razor wire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Kora's point of view).<br>\r\nAll of my new slaves are fighting my power and somehow winning. \"Scar, Kill them while we have the chance!\" I shout and he sighs before taking his pistol out and taking aim before his pistol lights on fire with a black and red fire and he pulls the trigger.

Kora comes to follow me but I quickly turn around and I fire my pistol now with only a quarter of the power that I just used causing her to fall back and then I close the portal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Rain's point of view).<br>\r\n\"SCAR!!!, SCAR!!!!\" screams Kora before I grab her by her hair and I put one of my daggers to her neck. She got shot in the shoulder by the looks of it. \"Were gonna have, LOTS of fun Kora\" says Kia appearing on her waist and Kora gets fear in her eyes.</span></div></div>",

I grab one of my daggers off my belt before I throw it into its head and then I hear a <i>Swoosh!</i> followed by a <i>Shrin!!</i> and finally a <i>Thump!</i> and I turn around to see Alex standing where a Shadow walker was just standing about to take my head off and I smile before we charge back into battle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Kia's point of view).<br>\r\nI get into my fighting stance before the shadow walkers charge towards me and I smile before launching myself through the air with my claws glowing red.

I make my claws turn to hooks before I shorten my claws sending me full speed into the Shadow walker and I kick it with both feet ripping its rib cage out and sending its body crashing into 5 more Shadow walkers and I charge to kill them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Mausso's point of view).<br>\r\nI block the sword of a Shadow Walker before I use my power to rip a chunk of the wall out and I make it crash into the Shadow Walker before I duck underneath a Claymore slash and then I spin around with my sword out 3 times and when I look the Shadow Walker falls into 3 pieces and I smile before I make my sword glow green and I stab it backwards into another ones chest before I hear it light on fire with green fire and then I blast it back into the swarm charging towards us and they all begin lighting on fire and I smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Alex's point of view).<br>\r\n\"We are near the end right?\" I ask and Kia nods. \"2 more corridors\" she says and I smile. \"lets go then\" I say and we all begin charging towards more Shadow walkers.</span></div></div>",

He looks at it for a second before looking up and another one stabs through his whole head before he falls back dead and I look behind me to see Rain holding her bow.

A few seconds later a light turns on above my head blinding me temporarily before my vision fixes and I see my daughter standing infront of me looking down at me. \"Mother\" she says without any emotion before she begins pacing back and forth while looking at me and then she smiles. \"How does it feel being abandoned by a loved one?\" she asks and I growl before her face turns cold again. \"I promise you this mother, You will never see the Light of day again\" she says before she takes out a knife and begins cutting my clothing off with it and I growl and squirm against my bindings. She looks at my naked form for a few moments before sighing. \"You right now could be living happily with me and my mate mother, If you had just loved me....But no, You've always been a heartless bitch, Trying to set your own daughter to become nothing but a fuck toy to your fucked up friends, Im going to return the gesture\" she says leaning down close to my face before Kia appears from the shadows with a big grin on her face before hundreds of rat creatures appear behind her. \"Goodbye forever Mother, I will always love you\" she says before turning around and Kia smiles as the Rat creatures begin getting hard. \"Have fun boys\" she says to them before disappearing and the light turns out before I feel clawed hands grabbing my breasts and I scream for help as one of the rat creatures penetrates my pussy while the other penetrates my ass.</span></div></div>",

So I can\u2019t complain that I don\u2019t love him. But still mom, I appreciate your concern with me being corrupted like this, but he\u2019s my mate, and I know that no matter what he does, I\u2019ll always love him- HEY!\u201d Rain yells as I quickly pick her and fling her over my shoulders. Right now she was talking to her new step-mother about some things that I don\u2019t much care about right now, because right now I want something from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess I\u2019ll talk to you later, then?\u201d Rain says as I hold her legs with one arm and I rest my other arm on her shapely toned ass, I\u2019ve never been one for stretching, but right now I\u2019m starting to like the results.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess we will.\u201d Rain\u2019s new mother yells back to Rain as I continue to carry her. Rain brought her parents here to show them the perks she has, and soon, they are going to see another perk she has for being my mate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you going to tell me where you\u2019re taking me?\u201d she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOur room.\u201d I reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat the hell do you think?\u201d I quickly say and she shuffles a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight.\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, we reach our room and I lay her on the bed. She immediately begins taking off her clothes and I do the same. After we are both naked, I slide myself onto her where we both begin French kissing. Our tongues exploring each other\u2019s mouths as they try to fight for control over the other. I begin rubbing my growing cock against her slick entrance until it grows to its full rock hard length. I sit up on my knees as I look down at Rain and she hungrily eyes me, licking her muzzle as my cock visibly throbs. I grab her legs and I place them on my legs so she can wrap them around my waist. I place the head of my cock at her entrance I wrap my arms around her waist. I look at her for second as she looks at me with those cute eyes, before I slam the full length in. She gives off a loud yelp as I don\u2019t give her chance to even get a breath in. I pound her relentlessly, feeling the flesh of her inner walls stretching as her cervix and pussy keep a tight ring on me. I look down at her as her mouth hangs open and I see the noticeable bulge on her skin every time I fuck her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGooood\u2026 I love you Rain. I want you to have my child.\u201d I say as I lay on her and we look at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRe\u2026 oh fuck\u2026 really?\u201d she says and I respond by kissing her again. After a few more thrusts, I stop kissing her and look into her eyes as I give nice slow long thrusts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, really. Now that\u2026 we don\u2019t have\u2026 anything else to worry about\u2026 I want you become pregnant with my child.\u201d I say and she wraps her arms around my neck and legs around me to hold me tightly and dig her claws into my back. The pain only spurs me on as I continue to pound her. I curve my head down a bit where I bite down on her nipple, making her shoot her eyes open as her pussy clenches tightly and she cums. She gives a loud moan of pleasure as I gently nibble her tit, her perk nipple getting a bit tougher as I grind it a bit on my teeth. Her claws dig deeper into my back until I stop and she breathes heavily as I grind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSensitive aren\u2019t \u2018cha?\u201d I ask and she kisses me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up and fill me.\u201d she says and I comply as I fuck her even harder, feeling her body\u2019s heart beat rapidly from my actions. My orgasm grows higher as my cock begins to swell and my balls tighten immensely. I bring my mouth to her ear:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you feel that, baby? You feel my cock starting to swell up, my balls tightening, ready to blow?\u201d I say lustfully and she gives off a loud moan as she licks the side of my face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh yes, I do. I can feel you about to blow. Give it to me, give me every last drop, cum into me until I swell up with your child.\u201d She says and I grip her tightly as I thrust a few more times into her before I bite her shoulder and I give off a low moan as I cum, my urethra expanding as I unleash a massive torrent of cum into her waiting fertile womb. She moans loudly as her womb instantly gets filled, and then begins to expand to accommodate my load. Her tongue hangs out as I bite and gnaw her neck, making her moan and squirm as her skin presses against my stomach. I hold her tight and sit up and I watch her womb bloating, turning me on even more as I unload every last drop. Our orgasm soon ends and I pant, sweat dripping from me and Rain panting like a dog. She looks at me with tired eyes and she shakes a bit. I lean down and give her bloated womb a nice long lick, eliciting a moan from her lips. I pull away from her, making her moan as my cum flows out of her stretched pussy. She gives off a low moan as she watches her womb gently descend until her cervix closes and my cum stays locked in. I lay next to her where I bring the pillow\u2018s to her head. We lay our heads down and look at each other. I rub her stomach and she does the same. I give her a gentle passionate kiss on the lips:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you Rain Silvarz.\u201d She kisses me back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI love you to Alex Vinichi.\u201d She closes her eyes and I do too soon after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5 months later\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look out the window of my room, my new world about complete. The trees are lush and green, the sun is red orange, the sky blue with gray clouds, the plants and flowers instead different shades or red, the ground still as how it was when I got here in the first place, and lakes of crystal clear water. All the prisoners that were once how they were before Lord suffer, are now my guards and law here in my realm. I can\u2019t fully hide what this place was before, but I can make it livable and a home to those who can stay. Many of the different species took refuge hear and have agreed that I am law and leader of this place, but they still haven\u2019t forsaken the earth\u2019s we had before, however I have given explicit orders that Earth 1\u2019s government is not allowed here, I don\u2019t need another war in my own realm. I feel a set of furry hands around my waist and I know who\u2019s they are. I turn around and look at my lovers eyes, the same eyes I fell in love with all those years. We share a passionate kiss together before we separate and look out the window. Silence is all there is until she speaks:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAny regrets?\u201d I think for a bit until I come up with an answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNone, this is my life now. I\u2019m master of my own world, people follow my rule here\u2026\u201d I say and I lean down to nuzzle her slightly bloated stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd soon, they will follow our children as well.\u201d I say and she nods. I stand up, look at her, her stomach, and then out the window, knowing that everything that\u2019s happened, from a deep dark road that they used to blame my father, now, I know my destiny, and soon, my children will know there\u2019s.</span></div></div>",
