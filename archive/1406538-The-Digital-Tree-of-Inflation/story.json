As she flew she looked out over the Digital World\u2019s horizons.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoy, she thought things sure have been looking up since Owikawa restored the Digital World to the way it was before Malomyotismon\u2019s takeover.  She smiled at the thought.  As she continued to fly, Biyomon\u2019s pink, feather-covered belly began to growl.  She looked down at it and blushed lightly.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBoy, it sure doesn\u2019t take long for a womon to get hungry nowadays.\u201d She chirped.  She angled towards the ground and flared as she brought her taloned feet to rest on the ground.  Resting a feather-covered hand on her still-growling stomach, she began looking around searching for some bushes or trees that would hopefully have something to eat on them.  She didn\u2019t see any so she began walking, hoping to run into Agumon or one of her other friends who would know where to get something to eat.  She ran into something, but it wasn\u2019t one of her friends.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had been so busy looking around she didn\u2019t see the tree that was in front of her until she smacked into it.  She stumbled back, her feathered hands massaging her beak.  \u201cThat was stupid of me.\u201d she said, giggling at her clumsiness.  She then looked up to see what kind of tree she had run into.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had a thick base and several long limbs that reached almost to the ground.  And hanging from those branches was a strange fruit she had never seen before.  It was round and pinkish colored.  She walked up to one branch and plucked one of the pieces of fruit off.  Holding the fruit in her hands, she poked it and squeezed it.  It was smooth and had a tight feeling, and it squeaked like a mouse when she squeezed it.  It almost felt like a small balloon.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The flavor itself was feeling quite estatic with her taste buds, and her mental consideration of thought went haywire with passion over the loving fruit.  Her body went into manifested symptoms of it as her heart raced in pumping, and her lungs filled with gasping and panting over it.  Her eyes skimmed the fruit again as she took another bite, feeling the same bodily response, and cooing out in a form of rolling manifested passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"mmmm... this fruit tastes so YUMMY!\" she Giggled out, her beak munching the fruit on up, and giving every bite a savoring chew as she did.  The tasty meal was just so filling to her, as her body started to tingle at the belly and bulge out from that one puffy fruit she just ate.  After licking her fingers clean she took a look over at her middle, and how swollen it was came into quite a fill of a wide eyed stare and a pumping at her heart from the sight of it.  Her hands gave gentle shaking as she rubs her feathery appendage over the growth of her belly.  \"Man...did I eat that much?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head and eyes shifted over to the direction of when a thump and tumble came into audible reach, and the sight of another fruit came up in her vision beside the tree.  She didn't know if she should keep eating the fruit, but her belly gave off a slow and growly moan that sent her pattern of thoughts into the consideration of having another, and maybe even two more.  What she can't do is really decide upon what she wants, and what she doesn't want right now.  So what is she to do?</span></div></div>",

Biyomon giggles a little as eventually finishes off the last bit of the fruit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looks her body over a bit to find that she's almost to the point where only her head, feet, and wings would be sticking out. Oddly enough, her wings are still not puffy, which gives Biyomon the appearance of an overstuffed bird. \"Oh my, I've made quite a turkey of myself...\" she thinks as she giggles to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiyomon begins to wonder if she should share the fruits with her friends, but then a funny feeling comes over her...namely, she feels like she wants to stick around and keep eating the fruits. \"Well, I said one more wouldn't hurt...so maybe a few more won't hurt either...\"</span></div></div>",

She takes one of her talon-like fingers and tries to cut the fruit with it. Expecting it to burst, she instead finds that it cuts open like a piece of foam rubber. \"Oh, good, I guess we can share it after all.\" says Biyomon, as she hands Gatomon half of the fruit. Gatomon takes it gratefully, and the two of them start to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm...this is so tasty...but I can't quite place a flavor on it...\" says Biyomon before taking another bite out of the fruit.

Despite being slightly bloated, they convince Palmon to take a look at the tree, under the assumption that's she's going along with them to see if the tree poses any danger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalmon looks up at the tree as Gatomon and Biyomon lead her to it. \"Well...there doesn't seem to be anything too strange about the tree other than the fruits...\" Palmon says, as she unknowingly walking onto an indentation in the ground in front of the tree. Because of her plant-like nature, she doesn't even need to eat the fruit to have the tree make her her to do things. The tree makes her want to suddenly lay out roots, and she begins doing so without thinking twice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact...this seems like as good as any place for a plant like me to relax.\" Palmon says, obeying the natural-sounding desire to spread out her roots. As she does this, her roots bind with those of the tree, and she starts to swell up where she stands. Gatomon and Biyomon, still under the influence of the fruit, feel no need to do anything other than watch, which is fine by Palmon since she seems to actually be enjoying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe doesn't even notice that the tree is starting to fuse with her when her body starts to push against it, though it's more like the tree is being absorbed into her, all except for it's branches, which are sticking out of her swollen body like multiple sets of additional limbs. Her own arms have grown with her, giving her the appearance of a big, green ball with a couple of appendages that are as long as the tree trunk used to be and twice as wide. Palmon giggles. \"Mmm...I feel like a whole new plant...\" Palmon says, as she pats Gatomon and Biyomon on the head. \"Hehe, thanks for the help.\" she says, unclear as to whether the tree is talking or Palmon herself is talking.</span></div></div>",

As her figure filled, she felt herself getting gassy before letting out a rather rude- \"BRRRAAAP!\"  \"Whoop, scuse me.\" She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalmon just giggled and patted a vine on her head.  \"Oh don't be.  you should be happy that you're all full and happy right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what's this about filling up girl digimon?\" Gatomon interjected<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPalmon just brought Gatomon over with a stretched out finger vine and snug beside Biyomons big belly before passing her a fruit too.  \"Just eat up and enjoy ok kitty cat?\" She giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGatomon just blushes a bit as she took a bite of the fruit, feeling a rather filling embrace take her belly as she does and seemed to be compelled to keep eating more of it as she did.
