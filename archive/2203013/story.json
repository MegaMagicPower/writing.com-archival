You try pulling up your map the way the manual described, but nothing happens. Your head drops as you sigh in annoyance. \"Can't even figure that out.

Suddenly you're standing on the outskirts of a small town with a larger one visible far in the distance, and directly in front of you is an odd... thing. One second it looks like a boy from the country, the next it's a aged old woman, then a sharp dressed businesswoman, and then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I on the ground?\" should have been your first thought. Instead, your only thought is how much you DON'T want to think about what you saw. If you had to describe it, you wouldn't. Couldn't. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou open your eyes to see the old woman, now JUST the old woman, offering you her hand. You hesitate, and she answers with a chuckle \"I'm sorry out of newcomer. We test everyone when they first enter the server to see how well they handle certain brands of horror. You may wish to try another server until you're more acclimated to the game. Excessive blood and gore is rare in this server, but experiences that can scar the unprepared mind are common.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer speech and movements are too robotic and practiced to be human, but you not actually scary. You accept her help up and brush yourself off. \"Oh, you're one of those NPC thingies. Thank you for the warning, but I have a friend in here that I really need to talk to. Can you point me towards Marie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman freezes for a second, then replies \"There are currently 327 registered players whose username's include the word 'Marie', and many more with variations on it. Please use your member search to narrow the results\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get sheepish, not wanting to admit you can't figure out how do anything like that. \"Oh, I'm, uh, avoiding using game tools as much as possible. For, umm... Immersion! Yes, so the game's more immersive. I guess I'll just have to go looking.\" You look towards the quiet town that still manages to be foreboding, \"So... how do things work here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe NPC perks up, \"This server has 2 unique features. First, there is no leveling. Instead you get better by doing. Work as a detective, and clues will start to become more visible over time. Fight, and you'll get stronger. Drive recklessly, and you'll drive better. At least when you're not in jail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a small sigh of relief, \"Oh thank god, no complicated game mechanics. I can handle that. What's the other feature?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hint of maliciousness appears on her face, \"Your sanity. As you experience fear, extreme confusion, and things that just shouldn't be, your perceptions will change. Starting with small harmless hallucinations and nervous tics, up to debilitating delusions and uncontrollable phobias or obsessions. These will be related to whatever cause the mental trauma, so being scared by spiders may make you feel ones crawling on you occasionally that aren't there, or you may become obsessed with checking every inch of your surroundings trying to find your 'friends'. Don't worry, these effects wear off slowly while logged off or transformed, so that the game doesn't become unplayable. They can continue to be exacerbated whole transformed though, and it's not unheard of for a player to develop a neurosis where they won't voluntarily 'let go' and log off. Remember that players are auto-transformed back after a set time, and this particular neurosis is fully cleared at that time. Also note that players will often not \"defeat\" other players immediately, but instead try to reshape their mind to suit their needs before shaping their body\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. So it's literally a mind game... okay, I guess I'll start looking. Should probably...</span></div></div>",

Melissa was an attractive woman around the same age as you. You remember her showing you the character she created once, a megalomaniac in the world of super proportions, a curvy mad scientist with a transformation ray. She had defeated hero after hero, changing them all into some sort of embarrassing object, whether it be paint on her right toe, or a piercing for her nipple she had no mercy for those who dared oppose her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Thinking that an ally that strong would be useful, you opened the door, and walked through to find a booming metropolis, with ordinary citizen NPC's walking down the sidewalk, and cars filling all the space on the street. You were thoroughly impressed by the detail with every single person, as if you didn't know better this was a city like any other. That was until a girl with breasts barely covered by a leotard flew overhead, all the NPC's clapping for their heroine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Shaking your head, you walked into the first building you saw, with a grand lobby and only a single receptionist working. She was obviously an NPC, and had a ponytail holding her golden hair behind her pantsuit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Hello, welcome to the selection center. I will assist you in your persona development here in the comic world. Now, please tell us what kind of character you'd like to start as.

Our first two are quite interesting if I do say so myself however.\" She spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Sure, tell me about them.\" You say to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Well our first option is a classic.

You will be able to stretch your body in any way possible, stopping bad girls in the process.

Heroic music started to play as the light eventually blinded you, and you were lifted into the air. Your body felt strange as the transformation into the persona that you decided upon took over you. The music crescendoed as the light vanished, and you were standing in front of the receptionist with a clear view once again. Only now, your entire body was a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  You had golden blonde hair which flowed to your shoulders, which were exposed from the new outfit. You were wearing an all white leotard, riding up your ass and crotch, but lacking straps and instead clinging to your body by squishing against your greatly enhanced breasts. Golden gloves covered your hands now, along with golden boots on your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"I feel like a new woman!\" You exclaimed to the receptionist, who giggled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n  \"You are new woman! Go out there and save the city! But be warned, there are women who would love to add you to their wardrobe, or worse, so watch your back.\" She responded. You smiled harder than you ever had before as you walked out the door into the city, with civilians all giving you a look of awe now. You took in the admiration, before deciding that you had to try your new powers. Flight was something that at least everyone had thought about, and now supposedly you possessed the capability to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  Taking great strides, you ran as fast as you could, and with all your focus you took the leap, and to your surprise you lifted into the sky. You flew higher and higher, looking down at the people who were stuck on the ground. Grinning at the skyscrapers as you flew past them, you had to decide what you would do first, and that was</span></div></div>",

And while being all stretchy sounded interesting, it also sounded like you'd just be inviting anyone to imagine what shape they could twist you into. \"What other choices are there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe receptionist continued to cheerfully smile, \"Well, any you can think of really. Is there a powerset you're thinking of, or are you new to things like comic books and gaming?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blush a little and let out an embarrassed awkward laugh, which she was apparently programmed to recognize. \"No worries, everyone starts that way afterall! If you're just starting out and worried about survivability, you could start as a 'human tank'.\" Your eyes go wide and you start to back up, unsure if maybe there was another 'defeated by NPC' tutorial coming. Thankfully, she continued to clarify, \"Not an actual literal tank of course. Even a max level player being defeated couldn't be made into something that complicated, and only a high level morphing powerset could do it to themselves. I mean super strong defense, and hard for others to stop once they start moving. And since they're all about defense, they're also really resistant to elemental attacks. Your subscription bonus will make you even tougher and well insulated. All you'd really be able to do for fighting is hit things really hard though. Protip for these powers: Avoid going through wide open areas until you're able to put points into raising your agility. Some players have described feeling like they're trying to run underwater with how slow they start off\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's not really your thing, you could also go for a support powerset that is useful to everyone so they want you on their side. Power sets that let you heal and improve the abilities of allies will make you popular with just about anyone, especially the people who do the direct fighting since you let them keep doing it longer. You'd also get abilities to weaken enemies, so fights are less dangerous for whoever you side with. Your subscription bonus would give passive regeneration, or a chance of debuffing enemies on hit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pondered them, thinking both sounded pretty safe since you'd either be your own protection or have other players protecting you. It's a shame you hadn't read through you subscription beyond the immediate benefits, or you'd know the bonuses she told you were what boosts would be added to whatever you were made into when defeated. Most equipment for physical melee characters were made from tanks, although the elemental defenses were also popular both to shore up weaknesses, or players looking for more comfort in extreme heat or cold. Of course some of the meaner players liked to choose ones that made their victim's experience more \"memorable\", such constantly moving liquid chestpiece to resist fire, or superheated boots just for the laugh. And support players really were popular, but not just as partners. Who wouldn't want to take down someone who would be forced to constantly heal them, or weaken anyone who attacks them?</span></div></div>",

She took a while to process your request, but finally, she replied in that a jarring, upbeat tone: \"Of course! Melissa is the top player in our server.

        "created":1570997820,
        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">You're Amber, a young woman who finally gave in and bought the new MMO SelfCraft that all your friends are raving about. It uses new technology that essentially uploads you into the game, so players basically upload their minds into the game and experience it with all 5 senses. This one sets itself apart from the rest by having a crafting system where defeated players can be crafted into usable ingame items. Stats are randomly generated based on the kind of item the victor chooses, but the players are free to design them however they want. This is advertised as not only making the game economy player driven (literally), but provides a punishment for being defeated to make players be more careful. It's actually a big part of why you decided to play, since the equipment to take screenshots is extremely expensive, but your friends wanted to show off what they'd made. A couple were actually making decent money designing fashionable armor and clothing. One was a (VERY) amateur tattoo artist, who was in high demand despite the poor quality of her work, because she was the only player so far who had figured out how to craft players into semi-permanent stat boosting tattoos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlayers who are crafted get a little XP while they're used, as long as they stay logged in. Most log out and wait out the 1 hour respawn time, but some stay on so they get the free XP. Some voluntarily stay crafted until their owner is defeated or logs off and their forced to be respawned, so they can watch and learn from their owner. And some just want to see if they can try to distract and demoralize their temporary owner to make them lose... And, well, some people stay logged in because they think itkinky. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou paid extra for one of SelfCraft's subscriptions that makes it so players can't be made into certain items, but the ones they can have higher stats and give their owner bonus XP too. Its seen by the playerbase as one of the best forms of aPy-To-Win in gaming, since it benefits everyone. A lot of people though, including you, think it's worth the price to not experience being consumed. You should be able to log out as soon as you're crafted, but your friends have mentioned the game still has some rare weird connection issues. Considering the tutorial has a part that unavoidably has players defeated and crafted into a random indestructible and reusable item by an NPC, with a randomized respawn timer that can be as little as a week or as long as multiple month. It's meant as an overly dramatic joke, since its scripted for another NPC to show up and defeat their captor to free them. You didn't even want to risk RNG making you a healing item though. After that, you should be able to avoid most PvP zones, and immediately log out if you accidentally walk into one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould be able to. As soon as you're crafted in the tutorial (just a necklace, thankfully. You hadn't expected the ingame characters to feel fully human, down to realistic sweat) there is a message that in response to rampant player violations of the Terms Of Service regarding inappropriate behavior,  the game will be temporarily shut down as they divide players into gender exclusive servers. You're relieved the game will be letting you avoid even this transformation, but when the servers go down, you find yourself in pure darkness for a moment, then the world reloads. You think this is weird, but wait out the other NPC saving you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat you don't know when you respawn is that a glitch as the servers went down has trapped your mind inside, with all the conditions of the tutorial quest active. You only have access to local chat. You don't have a map. You don't even have the friends list, so you'll have to try to find your friends by wandering the world. Or have to try to convince another player you're not some elaborate hidden quest NPC, and to not attack you for the easy gear and XP. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst though, your a level 1 character who isn't even good at games, stuck with a permanently on PvP flag, surrounded by women who are either overjoyed, furious, or indifferent to having a game with no men. And with a respawn timer that guarantees if you're crafted, you'll be stuck as whatever they make you. All your senses helplessly experiencing being worn or used by characters rendered so realistically, they're indistinguishable from real people. You'll have no choice but to wait for them to lose a fight, or log off. And that last part, well, hopefully there's no women who are trapped ingame like you who decide they'd absolutely love owning a truly one of a kind piece of gear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRULES:<br>\r\n- Nothing related to scat or watersports. The developers may have wanted to make characters as realistic as possible, but even they have things they don't want to program.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- No consumable items means no single use ones. She can end up as longer lasting stat boosting items, with her ending up as the part of her user's body related to what is buffed, ex. hands for strength boosting, feet for agility boosting, chest for armor boosts. When the duration runs out, she will respawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- The servers will stay gender exclusive. You can use whatever excuse you want for it, like it makes the game run better since its loading similar models, or the developers keeping just 2 that way so players have the option (with the main character's server always being one of them).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Player models don't visually show any damage. The developers were worried about how the media would react to seeing what looks like real people beating and slashing each other \"to death\" for fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-- Other than that, go crazy. I'll give gift points for chapters or ideas I like, and randomly just for additions that are longer than one sentence \"Does this happen, or something else?\". </td>",
