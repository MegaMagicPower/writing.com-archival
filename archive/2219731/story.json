The last time they went was back when Zoe was only 9, and her brother was 10. Three years later and their parents managed to scrape up enough money to have a comfortable vacation. Zoe didn't know about her family, but she was ecstatic! She had been saving money all summer for souvenirs, fake weapons, and maybe a modest dress.  She wanted to meet the Fair's king, watch a jousting tournament, enjoy fashioned food, and camp on the grounds for a week!</span></div></div>",

Maybe her brother or her parents found it? Trying not to think about it, she puts on a yellow dress and runs to the car where everyone was waiting for her, after all, she wouldn't need clothes when her whole costume was in the bag.

She could see different costumes such as peasants, knights, a few wearing noble clothes, and even some wizards. \"This is awesome!\" The 13 year old exclaims. \"Right, Scott?\" She couldn't wait to wear her costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it's nice.\" Her brother replies, he wasn't as excited as her. While his sister prepared a more common costume, he was dressed as a plague doctor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, kids.\" Their father says. \"I know that you want to take a look around, so here's some money for food and if you want to buy a little souvenir. And don't forget, we will meet at the king's election in two hours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two kids nodded and ran towards some of the stands of the fair. Zoe stood in front of one that was selling fake swords and shields, she looks at Scott and both knew what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On guard, doctor.\" She lifts her recently bought sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zoe, wait.\" Scott replies. \"We could hurt someone around here.\" He glances at the woods behind the stands. \"Our fight must take place there.\" The brother and sister go and start their duel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott was defending with a shield while Zoe attacks him with her sword. Yet, none of them noticed that Zoe's dress was being torn apart with some near branches, as it was made from a fragile cloth. Still playing, both start to walk away from the fair. \"I'll defeat you with this.\" Zoe swings her sword and sticks the straps of her dress in a tree, she forces it and finally ripped the only thing that was holding her dress. She reveals her rather small breasts and hairless pussy to her older brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\" She crouches to cover herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Zoe, why aren't you wearing underwear?\" Scott asks bewildered, quickly looking around at other directions to assure that they were alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry! I didn't think I'd need to!.\" She responds. \"But don't worry, I have my costume.\" She grabs the bag and takes out the leather vest. However, it was the only thing inside the bag. \"What!? Where is the rest?\" She checks inside the bag, nothing. \"No way. I wanted to be in the costume contest.\" Thinking more about her fun than her modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea. I can go and buy you a dress.\" Scott says. \"Give me a moment and I'll come back.\" He runs, but he returns in a few seconds. \"Zoe, I think we have a problem.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned \"What is it?\" </span></div></div>",

Now close your eyes and lift my dress.\" Scott only does one thing and takes another look at Zoe's naked body. \"Do you mind?\" She yells at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, hurry and put it on.\" He closes his eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe blushed and ties her straps. The end result was good enough for her. \"So, how does it look?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The straps look nice, but, there a lot of holes in your dress.\" Scott sees one showing her left breast. \"And there is an opening here.\" He lifts the damaged cloth, exposing her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it!\" She put her hands to close it. \"Anything else?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott goes behind her. \"Yeah, part of the back is missing. I can see your butt clearly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe sighs. \"You know what? Forget it.\" She takes off the dress and holds in front of her. \"We finally came back to the fair and I found a way to ruin it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott sees his sister was about to cry. \"Hey, Zoe, don't be like that.\" He grabs her vest. \"How about you try your costume?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZoe nods and wears it, the vest covered her breasts, but with any movement from her would make one of her nipples to peek out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't use that dress anymore, maybe I can make you a loincloth.\" Scott tries to find any possible way to cheer his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Zoe sobs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott holds the dress to see how he could make it work and.....</span></div></div>",

Zoe gave a little yelp and quickly hid behind a tree. Scott jumped up defensively. They both peered forward into the trees, looking for a source of the sound. After two or three minutes of nothing, they were ready to relax again when a voice scared them out of their socks (or skin in Zoe's case).<br>\r\n   \"Why are you naked?\" asked a small boy with brilliantly bright orange hair.<br>\r\n    Zoe would have guessed he was maybe two years younger than her, so around 11 years old. But she was more concerned about being seen than how old the boy was.<br>\r\n   Scott came to her rescue \"It was an accident, please go away.\" <br>\r\n   The boy, looking confused, as if he had idea he was making them both extremely uncomfortable, took a few steps toward Zoe, who hid deeper behind the tree and squealed out:<br>\r\n   \"Stop please!\"<br>\r\n   The boy looked at her and Scott for a second, then turned around and shouted, to the siblings horror: \"Hey guys! come see this!\"<br>\r\n   Zoe gasped and Scott ran up to block Zoe from view as three more kids ran up to the first boy. Two of them were other boys with matching red hair and the last was a girl dressed in a medieval dress. The girl has dark brown hair and looked unrelated to the boys,  and looked to be older then the boys, but younger still than Zoe. <br>\r\n   The Girl spoke up first, as everyone was staring at Scott: \"Why'd ya call us ova here for? We wos having fun at tha stocks!\"<br>\r\n  She had a rather thick accent. <br>\r\n   \"There's a naked girl hiding behind that boy!\" The boy exclaimed excitedly. <br>\r\n   \"Back off you little shits\" Scott growled menacingly, as he tried his best to hide a bright red Zoe.<br>\r\n  Clearly appalled by his language, the girl stepped forwards and simply said \"Ya shouldn't talk ta us like that.\"<br>\r\n   The girl eyed Scott's doctor mask next to a brown bag of the ground. Suddenly she ran up and snatched it and the bag from the ground.<br>\r\n   Zoe gave a little yelp of desperation, her dress and vest was in that bag. Scott made to step forward to get it back, but was stopped as Zoe grabbed his shirt. She didn't want to lose any cover. The girl stuck out her tongue, then looked over to the boys, who were all watching curiously. She told them they were heading back to the stocks, and then left with her new mask and bag.<br>\r\n   Scott was fuming at the girl, his mask was expensive. Scott turned to Zoe, gave an apologetic look, and suddenly took off after the group of kids. <br>\r\n    <b>What does Zoe do?</b></span></div></div>",

Zoe carefully peeks through her bushes and sees people taking photos in the stocks, she looks around and is able to get a glimpse of Scott chasing the little girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do?\" Zoe thinks, at this point, she could only catch up with Scott if she runs through the stocks and gets seen by all the people there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she sees some leaves and a couple of fallen branches, maybe it could be enough to cover her body. \"Okay, I can do this.\" She blushes. \"I can't stay hidden forever and let Scott do all the work.\" <br>\r\n<b>Zoe stands up and</b></span></div></div>",
