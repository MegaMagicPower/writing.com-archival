He was lying down of a piece of furniture, there was an odd feeling at his chest, along with an empty feeling where his penis would be, and that he was wearing clothes other than his shoes (which felt different) and gloves. He opened his eyes, seeing that he was inside a house, then he looked down, and instead of seeing his red sneakers, he saw that he was wearing red boots that both had a white line going up on them, along with a red dress and bracelets that looked like gold rings, also, he was pink instead of blue and had breasts. He felt his head, noting that there was a wierd feeling of something pressing down on his quills, putting them into a different hairstyle, and felt a hairband. Sonic ran to the mirror, noting that he couldn't run anywhere near as fast as usual, and saw his reflection, only it wasn't his, he say Amy's body looking back at him with a horrified look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Tail's was working on a new device, while Sonic was waiting for Tails to complete the new invention. \"Come on Tails, what's this new invention suppose to do any way?\" \" \"I'm not exactly sure, after all we did take these parts and the blue prints from Eggman's lair. I want to rebuild it to see what it was suppose to be. We might be able to turn it against Eggman, once we figure out what it is.\" said Tails as he finished the device. \"Sonic! I've finished it now all we need to do is power it up.\" then Tails plugged it in to his computer for power, unfortunately it was accidentally connected to the Globe Posts, which were used to access other worlds. The Globe Ports did give the mysterious device power, but too much power! There was a huge power surge in the lab and a bolt of energy hit Sonic. Then Sonic laid unconscious on the ground.<br>\r\n_________________________________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile in Blaze's home dimension, Blaze was with her friend Marine the Raccoon. Suddenly a bolt of energy identical to the one that hit Sonic hit Blaze, and she was knocked out as well.<br>\r\n___________________________________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails helped his friend Sonic into his bedroom, and rested him on his bed. About an hour later, Tails noticed Sonic's eye open up, but his eyes were yellow. \"Sonic, are you okay?\" \"You you're a friend of Sonic, what are you doing here? Where's Marine?\" \"Uhh, Sonic I think the bolt really messed with your head.\" \"Why do you keep calling me Sonic...\" That's when Sonic looked into to the mirror, but it wasn't Sonic, it was Blaze the cat inside Sonic's body. Once Blaze realized this she wondered if she should tell Sonic's friend about this switch, and if she was in Sonic's body with his friend then what about Sonic and Marie?   <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But no food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Misty, but I forgot to stock up on food when we left, but maybe we can find a river or something nearby.\" Ash suggests as he rubs his stomach showing he is also hungry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but once we do, I'm going to eat first since I'm the lady around here.\" Misty says rather arrogantly for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Ash and Misty walk farther down the road, before suddenly, Ash is wacked in the face by a flying newspaper. Ash quickly takes the newspaper off of his face and then spies an interesting article.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Misty, check this out!\" Ash calls and Misty runs over to see a strange blacked out picture of a strange creature, possibly due to the shot being taken at night as shown by the cresset moon in the picture. \"It says that there is something called 'the Prince of the Sea' that has been seen in a nearby lake. Hmm maybe I could catch it and have it become my new Poke-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heck with that! I'm the future water Pokemon Master! If it's the Prince of the Sea, then it means I'll be the one to capture it!\" Misty cheers and runs into the woods with Ash quickly following, leaving the newspaper behind. As the newspaper falls to the ground, the rest of the article is bathed in sunlight, revealing the rest of the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is unknown what all this Pokemon can do exactly, but people have claimed to have temporarily had their body switched. Until more is known about this Pokemon, it is advised to keep your distance to prevent anything from happening to you.\" As the newspaper flies away in the wind, Ash and Misty have arrived at the lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa this lake is so...so...\" Ash stutters for words as he sees before him a beautiful lake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beautiful!\" Misty says, finishing Ash's sentence. \"No wonder a Pokemon called the Prince of the Sea would come here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then...\" Ash removes his shirt and pants before he runs head first into the lake and begins to search for the mysterious Pokemon from the newspaper with Pikachu staying on ground to avoid shocking him because of the fact that water conducts electricity. Misty soon joins suit though stays in the shallow parts so that she can make sure nothing happens to their stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes of searching, Misty decides to give up and get out of the water and begins to make a fire so as to warm up. She lights one and begins to sit by it with Pikachu, all the while wondering if this so called \u2018Prince of the Sea\u2019 actually exists. And for that matter she hasn\u2019t seen Ash in forever since he dived down into the lake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh no.\u201d Misty gasps upon realization. She has developed a crush on Ash, although she herself has yet to realize it. \u201cWhat if he drowned? No! No! No!\u201d Misty begins to panic, and then runs back towards the lake, but stops soon when she sees something surface with something even smaller in its arms. \u201cAsh!\u201d Misty calls, almost in a cry, as she wipes the tears from her eyes. Ash comes to shore and then shows Misty what he found.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Misty look what I got!\u201d Ash calls as he warms up against the fire with something sleeping in his arms possibly a Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIs that\u2026?\u201d Misty begins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes it is Misty! I know it is!\u201d Ash replies as the small creature in his arms begins to rouse. The creature is surprised to be out of water, and to be in the arms of a stranger, so it panics and begins to scream. Ash and Misty cover their ears, making Ash drop the Pokemon. The Pokemon continues to cry and then the two tentacle-like appendages on its head glow with a red aura that sends out a beam of light that bathes Misty and Ash in a glow. The two run away in fear, in order to get what they would think would be a safe distance away, unknowing of what just happened to them as a pink heart comes out of both and goes into the other as the Pokemon flies away, neither trainer knowing what happened exactly.</span></div></div>",

Things have gone relatively uneventful for the group in the past few days, with Brock constantly hitting on Nurse Joy, causing Max to have to pull him away several times. There are still a couple days before the contest, and May is planning to practice some more the next day, but unfortunately, she can't get to sleep this night. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater at around one in the morning, May who has been tossing and turning in her bed, got out of bed. Something is really bugging her, but she put her finger on what it is. She decides to go outside to get some air as she quickly and quietly exits the room then goes out the front door. As May exits the Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon Center she sees the moon shining in the sky, and admires the beauty of the night. She sits down on a chair and relaxes, then realizes that she feels something brushing against the side of her pouch. She reaches her right hand into the pouch and pulls out something familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait isn't this...\" The thing in her pocket is that of something she didn't realize that she still had. \"...the wish maker I got from back when we met we met Jirachi!\" May remembers how she got it back when they were trying to defeat that false Groudon that Jirachi was forced to make, and how she missed her chance to make her wish the final time in the confusion. \"Oh, what the heck, I'll make the wish anyway.\" She thinks of Ash. May blushes at the thought; she has secretly developed feelings for Ash, though she has never told him, as she was afraid of rejection, she was considering pretending to have a crush on another boy, possibly that boy, Drew, who she met not all that long ago, in order to make him jealous so that she could see how he feels about her, and hopefully become her boyfriend. May folds in the last piece of the wish maker in and holds it close to her heart, closing her eyes as she makes the wish. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI wish Ash and I would be together forever\u2026\u201d May says her wish quietly. What she doesn't see since her eyes are closed is the Millennium Comet, which has been knocked out of its usual path because it collided with another comet, and is visible for just five minutes, during which she made the wish, before correcting its orbit, thus not to be seen again for 1000 years. May then goes back inside and begins to fall asleep, not noticing the comet that is now almost out of view. As she falls asleep, a light descends upon Ash and May. A blue figure that looks like Ash rises out of his body, as does a Pink one that looks like May from her body. Both float over to the other body and land in it. The wish granting powers had decided that switching their bodies would be the best way to keep them together, because neither of them were the kind who would get with their normal gender, or to get with the gender of the body they were in, so the only people they could get with would be someone else who was in the wrong gendered body, which not counting temporary cases like Manaphy, would only apply to those two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning...</span></div></div>",

He looked into the mirror and saw May's face looking back at him, he then turned around to see nobody behind him, then turned look back to the mirror, and realized he was in May's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh let out a gasp of shock, before realizing she still needed to go pee. She lowered the pajama pants to see panties, and took off them to see a vagina where her penis would normally be. She sat on the toilet to relieve herself, to felt liquid going down her body, after that, she grabbed some toilet paper to wipe herself clean. She took off the pajama jacket to see BB cup breasts sticking out off her chest. She smelled herself, and finds that she stinks. Regardless of it being an invasion of privacy of May's body, she needs to get rid of the stench of the sweat. Ash grabbed out May's usual clothing of a red bra, red tight shirt, blue panties,and blue short shirts and about to take a shower.</span></div></div>",

She eventually finds a cave, and decided to take off her top to see CC cup breasts, she groped her new breasts to feel a little bit of pleasure going through her body. She started to massage her breasts, to feel more pleasure going through her body. She then takes off her pajama bottoms and panties to see her new vagina. She then puts two fingers rapidly into her vagina and removed them to then repeat the process. She did this for five minutes until she reached an organism. What happens next?</span></div></div>",

It had been so long since he had seen her and wanted to see her once more. He had run into a fellow Legendary, Lugia, who knew the boy that Manaphy considered his father, Ash, from a previous adventure a few years ago. Lugia informed him that he'd heard rumors of Ash being in the Sinnoh region, so Manaphy had decided to head for the strange region known to the humans as Sinnoh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Manaphy arrived he saw many sights, all while trying to stay away from other people as he was rather shy. Whenever he saw a human he didn't know, he simply hid, and then continued with his search when the human left. He eventually found another legendary, this time known as Darkrai. Darkrai told him that he had last seen Ash a few weeks before and then told Manaphy to head off for the next gym over. Manaphy thanked Darkrai, and then rushed off towards the next gym, but ended up getting lost. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nManaphy ended up wandering the woods for some time before he found another Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, known as Shaymin, who helped him with his search by taking him directly to where Ash and co. were, since they had just parted ways only an hour before. Manaphy waved goodbye and Shaymin told him to say hi for him. Manaphy nodded and hopped along towards the campfire in the distance. The first thing he saw was Ash, although he had changed a small amount from the last time he had seen him, but that mattered not as Manaphy let out a happy cheer as he jumped into Ash's surprised arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dada! Dada!\" Manaphy cheered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh and Brock were stunned, not only had they thought they'd never see Manaphy again, but so far away from when they last met as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Manaphy what...? What are you doing here?\" Ash asked as he picked up Manaphy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy! Happy! Dada!\" Manaphy cheered. \"Mama? Where Mama?\" Manaphy asked as Ash sat him down? Manaphy looked around only to see Ash, Brock and some new girl with blue hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Manaphy! This is Dawn.\" Brock said introducing Manaphy to their traveling companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you!\" Dawn said with a smile as she reached out for a hand shake. Manaphy shook her hand and then cheered again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Happy! Happy! Dawn!\" After a few minutes Manaphy asked again. \"Where Mama?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh looked at Manaphy and told him as gently as he could \"May isn't traveling with us anymore.\" She's probably back in-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Ash could continue Manaphy began to cry, and rather loudly I might add. \"Wah! Mama no here!\" He cried. \"I want Mama!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Manaphy! Calm down!\" Ash says, trying to comfort Manaphy by cradling him in his arms like that of when May did it long ago. Ash tried his best, but Manaphy continued to cry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dada*sob* and Mama*sob* no together*big sob* anymore.\" Manaphy cried as Dawn tried to help, but the second she touched Manaphy, he accidently used Heart Swap on the two without realizing because of how upset he was, switching their bodies. Manaphy then jumped from Dawn (who was now in Ash's body)'s arms and ran away crying in the night, eventually getting too far away from them for them to switch back after a set period of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next...</span></div></div>",

You two had us worried sick. Selphie had to leave about 10 minutes ago.\" Riku asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm fine. How long have we been out?\" Sora asked, but he noticed that his voice sounded weird, in fact, it sounded like Kairi's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You've been out for about...\" Riku looked at his watch, \"3 hours, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What! Where's Kairi? Why does my voice sound so weird? Where's the TV?\" Sora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! Calm down, Kairi.\" Riku said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, did you just call me Kairi?\" Sora asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSora jumped up and ran to Kairi's bathroom. When he looked in the mirror, he screamed. What he saw was that he was, in fact, Kairi. She had auburn hair hanging to her shoulders, her eyes were a shade darker than usual, and she had on the clothes that Kairi was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I must be dreaming.' She thought. 'When I close my eyes and count to ten, I'll wake up in my room, and I won't be Kairi.' She closed her eyes.'1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8...9...10.' When she opened her eyes, she was still in Kairi's bathroom. The only difference now was that Riku was standing next to her. Sora didn't even want to know what Riku was thinking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong, Kairi?\" Riku asked. \" I mean, you've been in here for like 5 minutes already.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Riku, it's only been 20 seconds, and yes, there is something wrong! What's wrong is that I'm not Kairi. I'm Sora.\" Sora replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You expect me to believe that? How about if you prove it by saying something you swore not to tell anyone, Sora, if that's really you?\" Riku asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, fine. You stole that skirt on your darkness suit from your mom's closet.\" Sora replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I need more than that.\" Riku said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, you snuck into this house one night and made out with Kairi's mom, and you failed your driving test 389 times, but you're telling everyone you only failed once. Want more?\" Sora asked as she crossed her arms, but she accidentally pressed against her new breasts while doing it, which caused her to blush and quickly reposition where her arms were crossed so that they were right under her breasts instead of on them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy then, Riku was convinced. \"Okay, I believe you! Just stop making me relive those moments! Please!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then help us get back into our bodies!\" Sora shouted in frustration, then she looked into her shirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, the next lightning storm isn't for another 6 months, so you'll be stuck like that for at least half a year. There are some heartless and nobodies that could reverse it, but that would be too risky, seeing how I can't control them anymore.\" Riku replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, maybe Kairi has some ideas. Is she awake?\" Sora asked hopefully while looking into her shirt again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't think so. Sora, why do you keep looking into your shirt? I don't think Kairi's going to like that.\" Riku replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just trying to get used to this! Give me a break!\" Sora exclaimed. By then they were back in Kairi's backyard. They saw Sora's body on the ground by the TV.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll just have to wait until she wakes up. In the meantime, why don't you tell me what it's like?\" Riku asked. \"Oh yeah, aren't you Namine's counterpart, now? It must be different not to hear Roxas in your head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I haven't heard anyone.\" Sora replied to Riku's question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder why.\" Riku wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Man, Kairi still isn't awake! This is gonna take a while.' Sora thought to herself. All they could do now was wait. In fact, they waited so long that Sora fell asleep again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

He closed the door and then he went to pull down his pants, but instead he was wearing a dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened my pants and why am I wearing a dress!\" Sora exclaimed. \"Wait this isn't my voice, it's, it's Kairi's!\" Sora ran to the restroom mirror and looked at himself, but it was not himself that he was looking at. It was Kairi. \"What?\" She looked down to see breasts covered by a pink dress, she then grabbed them. \"These are really not mine. Man I really need to use the restroom.\" Then she adjusted the dress so that she could sit on the toilet. She then felt some water go down her new vagina. After she was done, she readjusted the dress and washed her, or Kairi's, hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kairi! Where are you?!\" Riku asked from outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That must be Riku. I need to tell him about this.\" Sora said, then halted. \"Or maybe he doesn't need to know yet.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It had been a long day at school for Kazuto, and he couldn't wait to get home. It wasn't exactly a secret to anyone, but Kazuto didn't find the real world that interesting. He lived in the age of virtual reality, something that allowed everyone to explore worlds unlike what was possible in regular reality. Upon getting home he burst through the door, \"I'm home!\" He said to no one in particular. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome home, Onii-chan~!\" A girl's voice replied. Suguha, his younger sister, ran down stairs to greet him, dressed in her school uniform. Kazuto, also known as Kirito in the realm of virtual reality, wasn't actually Suguha's biological older brother, they were cousins. His aunt took him in after both his parents passed away and they've all been a family ever since. Suguha had a bright smile on her face. \"So, you joining our party in game today?\" She asked. \"We're going to take on the new dungeon that was just added!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you even have to ask?\" Kazuto asked with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll meet you in there! I'm just going to get changed and hop online.\" She said, running back upstairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I best do the same...' He thought to himself, running upstairs. Entering his room, he quickly dumped his school bag to the side of the room, got changed into more comfortable clothing, and jumped onto his bed, setting the Nervgear on his head. The old piece of tech was a constant reminder of the horror of the events of Sword Art Online, but there hadn't been an issue with the technology since. He took a deep breath and then activated the headset's functions. \"LINK START!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe menus rushed passed his eyes like normal, before he eventually got to the log-in screen. While the screen usually logged him in normally, the screen froze up on the log-in menu. Before Kazuto had a chance to question what was going wrong, the menu appeared to glitch out before rushing passed. It was odd, but the log-in function continued as normal as his vision went blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he opened his eyes for the first time in the virtual world, he found himself standing in the middle of a city. It was currently night time in game and the buildings around him now glowing with an emerald light. He recognised this place, it was Swilvane, the city of the Slyphs, located in the far south-west corner of the continent of Alfheim. The reason this was odd was simply because he didn't log off in the location, rather he had logged off at Yggdrasil City after grinding for materials with his girlfriend Asuna. He remembered the malfunctioning log-in screen only moments earlier, and guessed that it must have scrambled his avatar's location data.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided if he wanted to meet up with everyone, he'd best start flying towards the capital city now. It kind of sucked that even after rushing home, something as vexing as a bug was keeping him from playing for even longer. As he looked up to the sky, he found a bit of his vision obstructed golden blonde hair. Confused, he grabbed the bit of hair only to be made aware of how different his hands looked. They were smaller and dainty, with long slender fingers. Additionally, a white sleeve now covered his arm up to his wrist, where gold bracelets now sat. As his outfit was always all black he knew something was seriously wrong, had someone hacked his character? Looking down, he was met with the answer to his question. He was wearing a white and green fantasy style dress, which now hugged his new body's dimensions, most notably, the rather large breasts sitting on his chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe spotted a mirror on a nearby wall, and marched briskly over to it to get a better look, although with some trouble due to balance issues. His fears were confirmed when he saw that what was reflected in the mirror was not the image of the black swordsman Kirito, but Leafa, Suguha's avatar. The girl's green outfit, her long blonde hair, her top heavy figure, she now possessed these as the girl in the mirror matched each and every movement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-how is this possible?\" She wondered out loud, a woman's voice speaking for her. She figured that if this happened, then most likely, Suguha was unable log-in as her account was being played. Maybe she should just log out and log back in? It was a simplistic approach, but it worked when most games had these issues. On the other hand, maybe he should make his way to Yggdrasil City, and meet everyone else. It was unlikely he was the only victim of this glitch, and perhaps someone had heard about how to fix this.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Leafa opened the menu, and looked for the log out option, and upon seeing, it she was immediately relieved. It was a little silly, but ever since she had been trapped in Sword Art Online, she was a little paranoid every time she needed to log out of a VRMMORPG. And considering how equally ridiculous the current situation was, she couldn't be blamed for thinking that such a thing might have happened. Leaving those thoughts behind, she clicked the log out option as the world blacked out around her. Before being booted out, she was thankful that the same glitches that occurred during log-in weren't present at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as Kazuto opened her eyes in real life once again, he was greeted with the white ceiling. He lifted the visor of an Amusphere off of his head, without considering the changed peripheral on his head, and sat up. While his sloppy mind didn't notice that the device on his head had changed, sitting up hit him with a whole slew of different sensations that he hadn't felt before. His entire body's center of gravity was different due, to him being notably top heavy, a large weight being on his chest. A bit of black hair fell into view, and while his hair was indeed this colour, it had never been nearly as long for it to fall in his range of vision. Looking down she was wearing a rather tight fitting red tracksuit jacket that constricted her large bosom. She didn't know how but his new assets were notably larger that Suguha's avatar. Additionally, on her lower body were a pair of blue shorts, and while this item of clothing was nothing new to her, it was a lot shorter than what she would normally wear, leaving most of her now slender and hairless legs bare. The feeling of her inner thighs rubbing together, and the tightness of the shorts all but confirmed to her that the proof of her manhood was now absent. Steadying herself as she rose to her feet, she walked to the full length mirror in the room, and confirmed that she had indeed somehow become her younger sister. Kazuto was now Kirigaya Suguha, a young woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe ran to her own room, her steps unsteady, due to being unfamiliar with the body, and opened the door. She was greeted with the sight of her own body lying on the bed, with the NervGear on his head. The NervGear was clearly operational as evidenced by the greet flashing light on the machine. This could only really mean one thing, she and Suguha must have exchanged places. This meant that Suguha was now in Alfheim in control of her avatar. She could either jump back in the game and try and meet up with him, or wait it out in the real world for her to finish playing the game.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Given her current situation, Kazuto decided it would probably be best to wait until Suguha returned to the real world. She'd never heard of such a bug happening from any of the message boards before, and it would be rather risky logging back in and trying to fix it herself. It was a better idea to send in a bug report and hope for a fix. She sighed looking at her unconscious body lying on the bed. It was a rather surreal experience. As she stared she started to feel a little strange. Did her body always look so handsome? Trying not to linger on this thought she shook her head and left the room, heading to Suguha's room, \"Or my own room now I guess...\" she muttered to herself, taking in the feminine voice escaping from her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she walked through the house she couldn't help but note how different her sisters body felt. They way her long hair teased the back of her neck was distracting, and with each step her took she could feel the subtle way her breasts bounced. Even the way she walked felt completely different, unable to stop her hips from swinging side to side which each step. On top of that, her loss of height in this body, whilst subtle, made her feel much smaller than she was normally. With every little off detail, she was reminded every second that she wasn't as she should normally be. Entering the room of the body she now inhabited, she was now at a loss of what to do. A couple of books stacked neatly on the desk in the room caught her eye. \"Well.... I guess I can do some of her homework while waiting...\" She thought to herself. Making her way to the desk, she sat down and started to go through her sisters homework. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn hour or so passed and Kazuto was completely engrossed in the schoolwork, forgetting the odd situation she was in. Suddenly, the sound of her rooms door opening snapped her out of her focused state. She turned her head and was met with the sight of her old body standing in the doorway. \"Oh, Sugu, you're back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're me and I'm you...\" The young man in the doorway said, almost as if talking to himself. \"Do you know how to fix it?\" He asked, scratching his head a little bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuto thought for a bit before shaking her head. \"I think the best way to deal with this is to send a bug report through the game.\" She replied. \"I don't think anything this weird has happened before using VR technology...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuguha nodded. \"That's a good idea! In the meantime I think it'd probably be a good idea to keep up appearances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKazuto raised an eyebrow. \"Asuna didn't notice anything off?\" She asked, a little skeptical that her little sister could pull off being her for a whole online play session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not really\" He replied. \"I hang around the two of you enough that I know how you act around each other. Acting like a couple with her was weird though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter their exchange they both decided to go to sleep. Kazuto squirmed a little in her bed trying to get comfortable. The different shape of her body made it difficult to simple get to sleep, but after enough time the fatigue of the day took over and she drifted into sleep.</span></div></div>",

After all the hard work that had been put in, finally it was paying off as the talent agency that you worked for was finally bringing in a lot of work. You were skeptical at first as to whether it was possible to make the idols at the agency successful, but it seems as though your doubts were incorrect. That being said the workload at this current moment was unbearable, and there was barely anytime to take a break as there was so many things to do between promotion, training, scheduling etc. It all just seemed like a little too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the stack of paperwork on your desk, files upon files about the girls working as idols for your agency a thought had passed through your mind. You worked with them, but you didn't really know much about them. Sure, you felt like you connect with them on some level but in the end this was a work relationship. It was a shame too, as you felt as though understanding them better might make your job a little easier as you'd better be able to adapt their schedules based on their aspirations. No good, the fatigue is starting to settle over you. As you began to dose off, one of the girls sprung to mind. If only you could understand what it was like for them. And then... sleep took over...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich girl where you thinking of?</span></div></div>",

She initially acted rather polite and sweet towards you, but as you worked with her, it became clear that she was merely a two-faced girl that was a little spoiled by her upbringing. And it was to be expected considering her family's rather wealthy background. She could have been anything she wanted to, as her family would clearly be able to pay the fee to get her the life she wanted, but it was clear she wanted to be an idol. The fact that she craved so much attention probably pointed to this. As sleep took you over you, you could only wonder how life was like for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what felt like a couple minutes you opened your eyes, oddly finding yourself in another room. In fact you knew it, it was a common room in your agency's building where the girls and other staff often spent free time when they didn't have much else to do. This was odd, as you remember working from home that day, and yet, here you were. Pushing that detail aside, you stood up, and looked around the room, brushing aside a lock of brown hair that fell into view. Wait, that was odd, your hair was never that long. Coming to this realization, you take stock of yourself, looking down only to be greeted by a rather odd sight. Your body was now wearing an embarrassingly pink dress with a black petticoat. It had a rose pattern and pink and white lines on it, and strangely, it appeared to fit you perfectly. This wasn't right, so in an effort to confirm your fears, you decided to head to the next room to inspect yourself in a mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walked to the next room you became acutely aware of how different everything felt. The way your brown long hair tickled the back of your neck, the way the dresses' material fluttered a bit with every step, even the odd detail that you were clearly a little shorter than usual, being unable to see the top of a shelf in the room as you walked passed. As you stepped in front of the mirror you were greeted with what you were almost too afraid to admit you expected. A young girl stood in place of your reflection, wearing a pink dress and black mary jane shoes. She had long brown hair that grew well past her shoulders, pulled back by a black hairband with a bow on it, a single band curling around to frame her face. There was no doubt, by some strange occrance you had become Minase Iori, the young idol that worked for the agency. You wanted to understand her, but this wasn't what you wanted.</span></div></div>",

It'd been a long day as usual, with ridiculous antics ensuing, due to the rather erratic personalities around him. Whether it be keeping his fake relationship with Chitoge from being discovered, fending off Marika's advancements, escaping death after misunderstandings with Tsugumi, or whatever else, there was never a dull moment... or a peaceful one. As he lay there as his classmates filtered out of the classroom he was approached by a friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hoho, not doing so well today Raku?\" The voice of his friend chimed in. He looked up to face his friend Shuu not saying a word out of pure fatigue, \"Well, probably not the best time for this but, I got something for you!\" He said, holding up a rather odd looking object. It was something like a coin hung by a rather old looking string, to be honest it didn't really look like it was worth a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And... what exactly is this piece of junk...\" Raku muttered, not exactly sure what he was looking at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a charm! The lady that sold it to me said it was meant to help you better understand your loved ones.\" Shuu was grinning widely. \"And I figured a lot of your strife is caused by your bad luck and misunderstandings so... here you go!\" He dropped the trinket on the desk and took his leave, leaving Raku on his own in the classroom. After a few moments of silence alone he finally decided to head home, absentmindedly pocketing the trinket as he left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night Raku was just finishing up studying, clearing up his desks before getting ready for bed. After brushing his teeth and putting on more comfortable clothes he walked back into his room ready to sleep. As he walked towards his bed the trinket he was gifted earlier that day caught his eye. He picked it up and lied down on the bed examining it. \"Heh... a magic charm... really...?\" He said, chuckling a little at how ridiculous Shuu's gift was. Though he did have to admit, he felt like he didn't really know a lot of the people in his life right now. Maybe if this charm this was actually real he'd be able to understand ________ a bit better.</span></div></div>",

He was flattered by her advancements, and she was of course a precious friend from his childhood, but some of the ridiculous antics she's performed since coming back into his life had only served to complicate his already complicated life. Maybe if he had a little better understanding of what she was thinking, why she was so infatuated with him, something... maybe he'd become better at dealing with her. As he held the charm he failed to notice the faint warm glow emanating from it as he drifted off to sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, the sun shining through the window disturbed his sleep in an attempt to wake him. Turning to his side, he felt some hair brush across his cheek, a foreign feeling to him, but not one that he was concerned with due to his drowsiness. However as he squirmed in bed he couldn't get comfortable for some reason, and after a while, decided to just wake up. As he sat up and rubbed his eyes, several things took his notice, most notably the fact that he wasn't in his room. No, it wasn't the Japanese style house he lived in, but a rather modern looking room, with a large window to one side of the room, and a queen size bed he was now sitting up in, as opposed to the futon he usually slept in on the ground. Looking around and noting other details, such as the pink pillows and the table with stuffed animals displayed on it, it was clear this was a girls room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow did I get...\" He began, before quickly clasping his hands over his mouth in shock at the soft, demure voice that came from his lips. Looking down, he was greeted quickly with an unfamiliar sight. He was now wearing some kind of pink nightgown, but more than that, his figure fit the attire as he possessed the curves of a young woman from the hourglass shape, to the rather large assets attached to his chest. He grabbed at lock of orange hair that dropped form his head, and took note of his rather delicate and lady-like hands, before jumping out of the bed with the intent to examine himself in the nearby mirror. As he leapt to his feet, he had to quickly catch himself, as his balance and centre of gravity felt completely different to what he was used to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClumsily waddling across the room, he finally reached the mirror, only to be greeted with what he feared. What looked back at him was a young lady, with bright orange hair, dressed in a pink nightgown. The girl's face was one he knew, but rather than a coy or mischievous look on her face as he was use to, she wore a look of shock and disbelief. Somehow, he had become his classmate and childhood friend Tachibana Marika! Trying to calm herself after this rather upsetting revelation, she realized what had happened, \"This has to be that charm Shuu gave me!\" She muttered, the soft feminine voice still quite jarring for her to hear. If there was any way to fix this situation it would be to get the charm that should still be at her house.</span></div></div>",

She minced over to the wardrobe, trying to ignore the  feminine way her body moved, then pulled out Marika's uniform, and a set of underwear. \"I'm... sorry...\" She said, quickly stripping off the nightgown. Seeing the site of a naked girl gave brought a blush to her face. Shaking her head to stop the thoughts rushing through it, she slipped on the panties and put on her bra rather easily, almost instinctively. Continuing to dress herself, she put on the white sailor uniform shift with the yellow cravat and the long black pleated skirt completing her look. She picked up the Marigold hair clip on her vanity and put it on, remembering when she first gifted it to Marika. Now dressed, she left her house for...</span></div></div>",

Since coming back from the real world as Flamemon he had found his scanning process to take a slight bit longer than usual, especially around female digimon. As he got to his feet, he decided to go for a little walk. The group had camped in a forest right next to a beach, which he started walking down the beach. Suddenly he heard a great splash and turned to see that, surprise of suprises, Ranamon had emerged from the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just my luck, what are you doing here Ranamon?\" He asked, taking out his D-Tector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRanamon laughed \"Isn't it obvious, ya'll a spirit of a fire, I'm a spirit of water and we're fighting on a beach with no chance of you getting reinforcements, this is an ambush!\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya growled in frustration \"I'm not going down without a fight!\" He said, materializing the fractal code around his hand. However, this time instead of being white-ish, it was golden. \"What the heck?\" Takuya wondered out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If ya'll think I'm scared of a little gold data, you got another thing coming!\" Ranamon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use the code to scan her!\" A voice, very much like Takuya's, shouted to Takuya in his mind. Deciding to take the advice of the voice he shouted \"Fractal code, scan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must have lost yah marbles, my fractal code...\" Ranamon started, then noticed a simmilar band of gold code had appeared around her \"What?!\" She shouted as the gold data flowed towards Takuya, connecting with the data on his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice job Takuya!\" The voice from before said, appearing before him as Flamemon in spirit form. \"You have just officially obtained control of her mind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\" Takuya asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Lobomon and I always thought that we may need back up to defeat these guys, so we tried making a new way of scanning for you and Koji.\" Flamemon replied, now changing his image to look like Agunimon. \"Koji will get his soon enough, but there are two downsides: It doesn't work on Digimon who are already at Mega level, and it only works on female digimon/spirits. Otherwise, you have full control of that Digimon's mind, so have fun.\" Agunimon said, starting to go inside the D-Tector. \"And do remember to tell the others that she's on our side now.\" He added at the last minute before fading into the D-Tector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTakuya looked at the stunned Ranamon, what is he going to do?</span></div></div>",

Lately he had been experiencing strange, foreign feelings, particularly towards Ranamon and the female wind spirit user. He had tried approaching Mercurymon, the only remaining male Digimon in the group aside from Cherubimon himself, but Mercurymon had quickly pointed out that while he used a male voice and mannerisms, he was actually genderless. So Duskmon had resorted to pacing around his area, trying to figure out what these feelings were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, many of you out there may ask why he isn't going to see Cherubimon, the answer is that he feels that it will be a waste of Cherubimon's time. \"Lord Cherubimon has many other things to worry about at the moment, he doesn't need to hear my worries.\" Duskmon muttered as he paced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If your effectiveness in battle is going to be affected, Lord Cherubimon should know.\" A voice, most likely a servant of Cherubimon's that he had killed but not absorbed, said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuskmon, underneath his faceplate, frowned. He hadn't thought that these feelings might affect him in battle but it made sense. Sighing in defeat he walked up to Cherubimon's throne room, finding that his lord was awaiting his arrival \"Duskmon, Mercurymon tells me that you have been having some... troubles lately\" Cherubimon said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Lord Cherubimon, but it only occurs when I am around female Digimon or the wind spirit user\" Duskmon replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCherubimon chuckled slightly \"I never thought that this would happen, usually a Digimon knows these feelings instinctively, but then again your no ordinary Digimon.\" He rumbled \"What you are experiencing is the emergence of your mating instinct, although in this case I think the human term of puberty will suffice. It means that you are getting ready to take another Digimon as your mate.\" Cherubimon continued, then extended a finger to Duskmon's forehead. \"This should explain everything.\" He said, as information rushed into Duskmon's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuskmon grinned as he snuck around into Ranamon's area. It was true that Cherubimon had explained everything, but he had explained a little to much information, including one of his more subtle powers. It ends up that Duskmon's essence, whether it be blood or otherwise, could corrupt a Digimon's data and bind it to his will. Ranamon's area was more of a large cave lake than anything else, but Duskmon found this perfect for his own purposes. Not entirely willing to pierce his own skin, he detached his groin plate and started jacking off, thinking of the image of a completely submissive Ranamon. Soon enough he came, but instead of white cum, dark purple cum with dark data bits rushed out, into the water. This was Duskmon's saving grace, because of the cave lighting, the data he was dispersing wouldn't be visible to the naked eye. Quickly reattaching the plate, he covered himself in a veil of darkness to observe the effects.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Duskmon sat on the darkest side of the lake, using the viel of darkness to its fullest potential so that the chance of Ranamon seeing him was slim to none. Still, he couldn't help the fact that part of him, in the back of his head, thought that this was wrong, but he shook that off and continued to wait for the water spirit to arrive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout one hour later, just as Duskmon was about to nod off, he heard a door slam somewhere within the castle, followed by a shout of \"Ah can't believe it, she beat me again!\" Duskmon sighed, Ranamon was back. The cave entrance slided off to the side. Ranamon then shouted backwards as she entered. \"No one disturbs my time in here, not unless ya'll have a message from Cherubimon himself!\" She shouted, then she slammed the cave shut. \"Moon lighting on!\" She announced, a pillar of blue moonlight shining down from the center of the roof of the cave. Now if Ranamon had looked closely, she would have noticed a very faint purple/black mist floating around the top of the lake, but given how angry Ranamon was, she didn't notice any change at all. Ranamon quickly dived into the lake, preparing to swim off her frustration, but when she resurfaced, to both her own and Duskmon's surprise, the water had changed to the same color as Duskmon's cum. \"What tha heck is goin' on? Ranamon questioned. \"This is...\" She started, but then a dark purple light had surrounded her form, which occasionally caused her body to shake in pleasure. Unfortunately for Duskmon, this light exposed his viel of darkness, dispersing it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duskmon! What did you do to mah lake?!\" Ranamon hollered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuskmon chuckled. \"I'm fufilling my own needs.\" He simply said, but before Ranamon could question this, she felt her body snap into attention, with her chest being thrust forward and and her head leaning backward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Slide evolving!\" She realized, as the original cum started to soak into Ranamon's skin, returning the water to normal, but raising Ranamon into the air. Ranamon's cosutume was the first to change, with the entire thing changing from its regular blue to the same reddish purple as Duskmon's armor. The curls at the end of her helmet and arm armor changed into spikes, with each piece gaining an eye like Duskmon's many eyes. Her fingers were then covered in a latex-like material and each arm was shown to be able to extend and retract a Duskmon sword, but smaller. Her skin was the last to change, changing from its usual green to a darker green. \"Dusk Ranamon.\" The newly transformed Digimon said senually as she floated down onto the floor and toward Duskmon. \"So what do you wish to do master?\" Dusk Ranamon asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuskmon grinned. then said...</span></div></div>",

The idea was to build towers of chakra from his foot to the ground to stay in the air. He wasn't doing so well if the laughs from the Vixen inside his head was anything to go by. Jiraiya's drunken laughter wasn't helping much either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrr. WHY CAN'T I GET THIS?!\" He screamed into the air, thrashing his hands on the ground. In his anger, he hit the ground and sent a wave of Kyuubi's Chakra through the ground, not only destroying several trees and causing many natural disasters on the other side of the world, but attracting several items of spiritual power towards him, one of which was The Ring Of Chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bolt of light hit Naruto and sent him flying. Jiraiya, fearing that his student was injured, rushed over to see him standing up, completely unharmed, the only thing that was different about him infact was that he was now wearing a black ring with pulsating red runes covering it. Jiraiya, being a seal master like his pupil, knew exactly what that ring could do. it could bend any girl to do the will of the wearer, even if it wasn't physically possible. The possibilities alone made him go hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Naruto.\" He said in what he hoped was a kind voice. \"That ring on you looks dangerous, why don't you let me take a look at it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh... sure, why not?\" Naruto said as he began to take of his ring, only to be stopped by a large booming voice in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T DO IT KIT! THAT RING HAS INCREDIBLE POWER! YOU CAN USE IT TO MAKE ANY GIRL DO ANYTHING YOU WANT!!!\" Roared Kyuubi's voice<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this Naruto lost a little self-control and yelled at Jiraiya \"YOU *Censored*!\" Naruto then hit him with a Rasengan, which blasted him high into the sky, and right into the women's bath, where said women began to beat him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving Jiraiya to his punishment, Naruto decided to go try the ring out on a girl, but who should he choose?</span></div></div>",

She'll know what it'll mean and do what she asks upon doing so until I arrive, do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Naruto-sama.\"  The girls complied as they got up to head towards Naurto's apartment.  Shortly after Ayame came back and gave him is meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your ramen Naruto-sama.\"  Ayame presented.  Naruto thanked her and ate all ten bowls happily.  He was still a bit hungry but he was eager to see his slaves so it'll do for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Ayame, now close the shop and head to my apartment and enter the building, when you see Tsunade tell her you want the uniform and then do what she asks until I arrive, do you understand?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Naruto-sama.\"  Ayame complied with the order, she waited for Naruto to leave the store, closed the shop up and went to his apartment.  Naruto grinned like mad as he too went towards his apartment slightly after Ayame and couldn't wait to see his order in fruition. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Since paperwork was at the forefront of Tsunade's psyche, those thoughts were the first to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A ring that makes you forget about work?\"  Tsunade leaned back in her chair, keeping her focus on the ring.  \"Thanks, Naruto, I needed this,\" she said in a dreamy voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll get even better in a minute,\" Naruto replied.  He had expected the ring to work much more quickly, but with Tsunade already in a trance, he figured there was nothing to worry about.  \"Just relax and enjoy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...Relax...Enjoy...\" Tsunade echoed.  Naruto's words bounced around in the empty space that was filling her mind.

While fighting this two powerful enemies, Sonic and Blaze formed a brief, but powerful friendship. Before they could learn about each other more though, Blaze had to return to her home dimension. Blaze did promise to return before she left, and she did find a way to return to his dimension. In her world there was a powerful gem that had the power to teleport anywhere the user wanted  to go to. So once she found this gem she used it's powers to return to Sonic's home world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, she had picked a bad time. Sonic had just defeated Eggman once again, but this time it was a really important victory. Eggman had managed to create a mind control gun that he could have used to control any female for an unlimited amount of time, and was trying to make it so he could make it work on anyone. Luckily he stopped him and took the gun before he had the chance to test it, but Blaze wasn't so lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she appeared in Sonic's dimension, a bright flash filled the room, temporarily blinding Sonic. He was also startled by her sudden appearance, and accidentally fired the mind control gun. He couldn't see what he had hit, but the beam had definitely hit Blaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlaze felt strange, at first it felt like a headache, but it got worse quickly.

Soon she submitted to the voices, and saw that Sonic was the holder of the gun, making him her new master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Sonic could see again, he saw Blaze with a black stare in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blaze, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did...Did you just call me...master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you are the one who fired ray, and now I am your humble and loyal servant forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSonic couldn't believe what he had heard. Blaze the tough and powerful hero of her world was now his slave? Sonic wasn't sure how to respond, part of him wanted to return her to normal, but part of him like the idea of being able to control her.

With intent she approached him ready to call him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Enzio Capelli, I presume? So you're responsible for the theft of your own jewels.\"  She started, the man in question didn't looked fazed as he took his watch out and began swinging it in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are very much mistaken aren't you my child?\"  He asked in fake Italian accent, what many people didn't know was his watch was magical and seized control of a person's mind upon viewing it for a while, his act of being a hypnotist was just that, an act.  He was no hypnotist, he stumbled upon this powerful item by chance and has been using it for his personal gain ever since, he mostly used it to have people steal for him but this girl was damn sexy, he had other intentions in mind for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I'm very much mistaken.\"  She agreed falling under his control, but with small resistance she said \"hold on.\"  Alas it was no use, she found herself slipping more and more under his control from the power of his watch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are very much mistaken, and now you are so very, very tired, aren't you?\"  He asked again.  She found herself nodding at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I'm very, very tired.\"  She yawned a bit for emphasis that his control was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now you're going to do exactly as I tell you aren't you?\"  He asked adding that last part for his own amusement as he rang the bell.  When he did she was fully under his control, her eyes glazed and obedient to his every command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am going to do exactly as you tell me to.\"  She agreed in a monotone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are a sexy thing aren't you mate?\"  He asked dropping his fake accent for his real British one. \"We're going to have a lot of fun you and I.\"  He grinned, once he ensnared someone they were his until he got bored and released them from his control, and he planned on keeping her for quite some time.  \"You'll follow me to my apartment won't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I'll follow you to your apartment.\"  She obeyed, as she followed him while he was leading her to his apartment.  Enzio grinned as they arrived at his apartment a half an hour later, eager to get this started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now then why don't you take your clothes off, you want to be naked for me don't you?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I want to be naked for you.\"  She agreed and slowly took her clothes off in front of him, he felt himself get hard as her clothing came off leaving her in her underwear, soon that came off too and she was naked before him.  He enjoyed the sight.  Stripping himself he grinned and told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now the fun can begin.\"  He grinned, eager to get this started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>This chapter was not created by me, I found it on the Internet, but the place I found it in was just insulting it, and I don't know where they got it from. If the original author sees it and wants it taken off then I will, but they must prove they are the one who created it. I have modified it a little. This chapter is from Link's point of view, but future ones don't have to be. I actually don't know what a couple of the words in this chapter mean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedli and I were in the Earth Temple. It was quite obvious that making our way through the temple was going to require the two of us making the most of our abilities. I had the arsenal, while Medli had the wings, and many puzzles required two people in two places at once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was one problem though. Medli was not exactly a tactical thinker, nor was she very experienced in the art of dungeon crawling. And with many situations involving long distances, communication would be a bit of an issue, but lucky for me, I had the Wind Waker! This was definitely going to be the key to getting that treasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMedli stood facing the series of large pillars, one of them holding the switch that would allow us to get further into the temple. \"Okay Link, I'm ready.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was my cue. I took out the Wind Waker and performed the Command Melody. All of the sudden, everything started to go black. When I opened my eyes I felt an odd sensation, like something was different. I held my hand to my face to find it pale white and covered in feathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuccess!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had transferred my consciousness into Medli's body. It was incredible! This was definitely a lot better than when I possessed those bouncing statue things in the Tower. I spread my wings\u2014my wings, it was great! I started flapping and began to lift off the ground. I was flying! I knew what I was in for long before this happened because Medli was telling me earlier about it, but I never imagined it'd be this awesome! After a few minutes of playing around with my new found power, I focused on the job at hand. I flew up to one of the pillars, making my way from one to the next using as much strength as I could. I got to the switch and promptly stomped it. Following was that old familiar music to my ears: the sound of the bars in front of the door lowering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy mission was complete, but then I realized something: I didn't want to leave this body just yet. I held the mirror in my hand up to myself and surveyed the incredible, gorgeous, womanly form I had taken on. I had always admired Medli's knockout body during my travels: her slender shoulders, her long, curvaceous legs holding up her robust hips, her jaw-droppingly majestic wings, those supple, bouncy breasts (well, supple anyway; you can bet your rear end those things are gonna be lively in a couple years), and her beak! So shiny and elegant and sexy! And have I mentioned the way her lovely hair blew in the wind? What a truly wonderful product of nature, and now that body was mine! This time around, I had control over more than just which direction her hair was blowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI slid my hand down my side, along the curvature of my hips, then caressed my breasts, getting a feel for my new found female Rito body. I then put my hands up my skirt and felt... my vagina! I HAD A VAGINA! Words could not even begin to describe how amazing this was. As I looked at myself in the mirror I began to stroke my hand back and forth within my pussy. My feminine hormones began to rush as I felt waves of pleasure run through my woman self. The next thing I knew I was moaning in ecstasy!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the erotic euphoria continued to rise, I suddenly saw a vision of the first pillar. Wondering what exactly that was about, I realized that it was coming from my eyes! My other eyes, the ones attached to my original body. I turned over to see myself\u2014my separate, original male elf self\u2014still in the Command Melody state of trance, except this time \"I\" was sporting an erection!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the problems with the Command Melody was that I could only occupy one body at a time, leaving my own self dormant. As it turned out, through sexual pleasure I could release even more power, enough to control two bodies at once: my own and the one I was possessing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then when I stumbled upon a fantastic realization: I could use the Command Melody to gently caress myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI flew off the pillar and landed next to myself. I began to put my Rito arms around my elf body, caressing myself. I started to kiss my elf lips with my Rito beak as my feathery Rito hand reached down my elf pants, caressing my penis as I removed the pants adorning my original self. With the penis in hand I put my beak to it and began to suck at the massive, erect member. I felt the tingling sensation come back, my hormones now racing harder than before. I suddenly felt the sensation of having another set of limbs, eyes, and ears; I was beginning to regain control of my original body, yet still maintaining possession of Medli! Taking a moment to adjust to this new found ability that was controlling two bodies at once, I held my Rito body in my original arms and inserted my penis into my vagina. Back and forth I thrusts, sheer bursts of ecstasy racing through both of my bodies as I continued to gently caress, overcome with the erotic euphoria of having myself inside of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't really sure if it was possible for a Rito to be impregnated by an elf, but I didn't want to take any chances so I released myself before withdrawal. I held myself tightly, gently moving my original hands across my Rito body as I kissed Rito body. Slowly I moved my beak down my face, down my neck, down my chest, down my stomach, to my dick. I sucked furiously yet passionately, the waves of erotic pleasure growing stronger and stronger until I finally climaxed. I quickly pulled my penis out of my beak as I shot my elf load all over my beautiful, Rito girl face. Then I attempted to turn back to normal, but I didn't realize that what I did messed with the effects of the Command Melody. </span></div></div>",

However, before he left, he noticed that the elder that used the spell to allow Link to transfer his soul to the Dopples hadn't taken the spell off of him. When he went to the elder, he saw that he was asleep. Link thought that leaving with the spell still active wouldn't cause any trouble, so he left the room without waking the elder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink had never left the special room with the soul spell still active. His body felt different than it usually did. Link decided to experiment and tried to transfer his soul into one of the Dopples' bodies, but when he did, his soul didn't immediately go to another Dopple's body. Instead, Link just left his body and had full control over where he wanted to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was initially confused, but then had an idea. What would happen if he entered someone else's body while he was a spirit like with the Dopples? This sounded like an interesting idea to him, and so Link decided to try and see if he could possess someone. But he couldn't decide who to possess. To help, he narrowed down his choices to just girls, since a female body would be more foreign and more interesting for him to inhabit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut which girl in Hytopia would Link possess?</span></div></div>",

He tried flying through the walls of the castle to get to Styla's room faster. Unsurprisingly, it worked. He's able to pass through solid objects in this form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne he arrived in Styla's room, he saw her staring at herself and posing in the mirror, happy to have the curse lifted off of her. Since she wasn't busy, and wasn't surrounded by anyone else, Link saw this as the perfect opportunity to see if he's able to possess her. With a stroke of confidence, Link immediately darted his soul into Styla's body, until he phased into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStyla's body froze up. After about a second of staying still, she blinked, and then immediately looked at the mirror. In reality, this was Link in Styla's body. It had worked. He had complete control over Styla's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Incredible!\" Link said to herself, now with Styla's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink took off her gloves and ran her hands through her now long, gorgeous blonde hair, before touching the giant flower on top of it, and the purple earrings she had below her now round ears. Afterwards, she slowly moved her hands down the sides of her body, feeling the curves and feminine figure of a girl's body near her waste, and then she held her hands onto her chest. She felt boobs. Soft, but still firm. Putting her hand onto her crotch, it felt empty. A feeling unfamiliar to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't believe this is happening! I'm really Princess Styla!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink was extremely happy that the possession technique worked, but then came to the realization, \"What if Styla will remember being possessed?\" Link was immediately concerned about this, and decided to test if she would. In order to put her into a setting she wasn't in before, Link took off her dress, now seeing a bra and women's underwear. Link felt her breasts and crotch again, before climbing into Styla's bed and tucking herself in. She then exited Styla's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he exited her body, Styla looked around, confused. \"W-what happened?!\" Styla exclaimed. \"Wasn't I just in front of my mirror, <i>wearing</i> my dress?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't remember being possessed. This immediately made Link excited. He could possess people and do whatever he wants to them without them even knowing. The one problem with this though is that it would leave a gap in their memory, but it wasn't that big of a concern. Link waited for Styla to put her dress back on, and then possessed her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do now, then? Styla has a lot of beautiful outfits I can try on, but I can also sneak outside the castle and explore the town as Styla, or maybe I can just stay at the castle right now and try to convince everyone I'm her? Besides, if I'm going to be in her body for a bit, I might as well get acquainted with it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLink didn't know which idea she should follow? What will she do?</span></div></div>",

Then its happen.....................<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAhh Konoha, the sun was shining, birds were chirping and peoples were just doing their things. Yup it's sure was a great day....besides bunch of angry women wearing only a towel were chasing Naruto and Jiraiya in the streets of Konoha. There were nose bleeding from the men of Konoha and some of the male shinobis who were currently enjoying their sight of seeing running women while wearing only a towel. Some of them went unconscious because losing too much of blood.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do they chase us?\" asked Naruto while still running from the women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well they won't be chasing us if YOU don't have a big mouth !! \" answered Jiraiya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it was you who peeping these women in the hot spring !!\" said Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was not peeping them !!! I just wanted to study their body while they're taking a bath in a hot spring !!\" replied Jiraiya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"IT WAS THE SAME THING !!!\" shouted Naruto getting angry .<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever. Important thing is we need to get our butt safe from these women.\" replied Jiraiya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" I got an idea ! Multiple Shadow Clone Jutsu !\" shouted Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a smoke appeared . After the smoke cleared, there were a massive amount of Naruto's clone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good idea Naruto!\" commented Jiraiya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter noticing Naruto's clone managed to catch attention of the women, Jiraiya quickly ran on a different road. Jiraiya looking behind just to make sure that he not being chased by the angry women anymore. However Jiraiya not looking in front of him had got him selves to bump into something... soft.. .Moving his hand to this 'thing' and started to rub it to know what was this 'thing' he bumped to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is this? It's soft. A pillow?\" thought Jiraiya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, this is not a pillow it has a nice smell. Wait a minute could it be...\" looking up he saw Tsunade's face glaring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a third person view, yes Jiraiya's head was on Tsunade's large breast. The passer by who saw this thought the same thing in their head. \" He's so dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oopss..\" said Jiraiya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade face were all red right now. Any passer by could felt the death aura produced by the Fifth Hokage. Tsunade obviously mad to Jiraiya for bumping his head to her breast not to mention used his hand to rub it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"JIIIRAAAIIIYAAAAA !!!!!!!\" screamed the Fifth Hokage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade collected her chakra to her hand and punched Jiraiya in the face. Due to her strength, her punch sending Jiraiya high in the sky and hit the Third Hokage's face on the hill thus breaking the nose. Jiraiya then fell to the hard ground cracking his skull a bit. What worse the angry women who chased him before saw him laying on the ground. \" Oh shit...\" cursed Jiraiya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, after the women beat him up, he walked his way to his house. He entered it and closed the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\" Sigh. What a day. First I got caught peeping and being chased then bumped to Tsunade's breast and got punched by her. Then the women who chased me had beaten me to a pulp. I guessed my luck just not good today.\" said Jiraiya while reminding things happened to him today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, a ring smashed through his window and hit him on the forehead \"Ow..\" then his body dropped to the floor laying unconscious since his body already gotten tired from the events happened to him. An hour later, he woke up. Looking around he tried to find the thing that hit him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gasped when he found the ring. \"Could it be?!! This is The Ring of Chaos !!!\". Jiraiya who had traveled many places and had many experiences knew what the ring's power is. It lets the user to possess any girl's body. With this in mind he had a perverted thought on how to 'properly' used this ring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon gaining this ring, its make Jiraiya felt the event happened before was worth it. With this ring he finally can do his \"work\" in peace. Stepping out of his house he wondered, which girl he should choose?</div></span></div></div>",

If you want to see the mind control version, then look under the mind control section, I've put it up there with a few changes. Notice how Darkwrite called the Kyuubi a Vixen, meaning a female fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhhh.\" Groaned Naruto as he was hit with another blast from a failed attempt at air walking. the idea was to build towers of chakra from his foot to the ground to stay in the air. he wasn't doing so well if the laughs from the Vixen inside his head was anything to go by. Jiraiya's drunken laughter wasn't helping much either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Grrrr. WHY CAN'T I GET THIS!\" He screamed into the air, thrashing his hands on the ground. in his anger, he hit the ground and sent a wave of Kyuubi's Chakra through the ground, not only destroying several trees and causing many natural disasters on the other side of the world, but attracting several items of spiritual power towards him, one of which was The Ring Of Chaos. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA bolt of light hit Naruto and sent him flying. Jiraiya, fearing that his student was injured, rushed over to see him standing up, completely unharmed, the only thing that was different about him infact was that he was now wearing a black ring with pulsating red runes covering it. Jiraiya, being a seal master like his pupil, knew exactly what that ring could do. It could allow the wearer to possess any girl's body, and make them do what ever the wearer wanted. The possibilities alone made him go hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Naruto,\" He said in what he hoped was a kind voice. \"That ring on you looks dangerous, why don't you let me take a look at it.\"<br>\r\n\"Uh... sure, why not?\" Naruto said as he began to take of his ring, only to be stopped by a large booming voice in his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T DO IT KIT! THAT RING HAS INCREDIBLE POWER! YOU CAN USE IT POSSESS ANY GIRL YOU WANT AND MAKE THEM DO ANYTHING YOU WANT THEM TO!!!\" Roared Kyuubi's voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, Naruto lost a little self-control and yelled at Jiraiya \"YOU *Censored*! Naruto hit him with a Rasengan, knocking him up really high, before he crashed into the women's bath, where he was beaten by the women.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving Jiraiya  to his punishment, Naruto decided to go try the ring out on a girl, but which one should he choose?</span></div></div>",

I FIGURED THAT YOU WOULD HAVE A HUMAN FORM OF SOME KIND, SO I FORCIBLY TURNED YOU INTO THAT FORM.\" Came a response from her own mouth, with her own voice, but with the kind of tone that Naruto would use, which made since, since Naruto was the one saying it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KIT GET OUT OF ME!\" Kyuubi shouted in rage as she continued to struggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO WAY!\" Naruto replied, just as Kyuubi's body turned completely into human form. She still had all nine of her tails, and she had fox ears, but other than that, she was completely human, and one that Jiraiya would want to put in his books because of how huge her chest was, despite the fact that her body was about the same age as Naruto's. Her hair was blood red, as was the dress she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get out!\" Kyuubi shouted, but her voice was no longer booming like before since she was in human form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\" Naruto shouted. \"You're not making this easy for me, so I'll just have to do this!\" Naruto took control of Kyuubi's arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you going to do?\" Kyuubi asked in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This!\" Naruto shouted as he began to take off Kyuubi's dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No! Stop you pervert!\" Kyuubi shouted, but that caused her to lose her focus, so Naruto easily removed the dress. Naruto then made a mirror appear since it was his mind and he could control what was in there. \"What are you doing now?\" Kyuubi asked, not liking where this was going. Naruto then began doing several humiliating poses. \"No stop it!\" Naruto then brought Kyuubi's hands to her breast and began squeezing, causing the body to moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes Naruto, squeeze them harder!\" Naruto made Kyuubi's voice moan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What?! Stop making me say stuff like that and get out of my body!' Kyuubi shouted, but realized she didn't didn't say it out loud, it was in her head, she realized that she was about to lose all control, and that thought was the last one she had before she blacked out, however, since she was in Naruto's mind, something unusual happened, and her mind was destroyed, giving Naruto all of her chakra, and her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh.\" Naruto chuckled as she gained complete control of her new body. \"Now for some fun.\"</span></div></div>",

While practicing with his Shadow Clone, he accidentally creates a version that can allow the smoke a clone leaves behind after being dispelled by damage to enter a girl's body, and take over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. Naruto accidentally creates a technique that allows him to send his chakra into a girl, and turn her mentally into him, with both of their memories. How quickly or slowly she becomes him mentally depends on how much chakra he puts in her, and her own chakra level and willpower to resist. It is possible to fight it off if her willpower and chakra are strong enough, but any change won't be reversed. If a girl knows he is doing this, she can use her chakra to help speed it up if she wants to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. He gains the ability to turn into a slug-like creature. He can enter a girl's body through her vagina, and once he takes control, he automatically absorbs her mind and memories. If he leaves her body, she will be an empty shell, unmoving and unresponsive, unless he or a Shadow Clone of his is inside of her, piloting her. Any Shadow Clone inside of a girl will not disperse while in there. He won't know about the absorption of a girl's mind, and the turning her into an empty shell, until leaving her body, but the transformation will alter him to enjoy it. If he were to, say, do this to someone like Hinata, he would feel guilty about doing this to her if she didn't know and give her approval, since she has been kind to him, but the feeling he gets would keep him from feeling regretful enough not to take advantage.</span></div></div>",

In order to try to figure out more about Squishy, Clemont uses it to try to connect Ash and Squishy's minds telepathically, but things go wrong, and Ash absorbs Squishy, although no one but Ash realizes (Ash keeps it a secret) as no one can see it happen through the smoke of the invention's explosion. Ash remains himself in body and mind for the most part, but is aged over the next 6 hours to be 16, has the Pok\u00e9mon desire to mate (ramped up by the fact that he's raced passed puberty, and is feeling it all of the sudden), and also seeks to have all 49 of the Zygarde Cells under his domain possess girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh can either control cells and girls directly in the traditional way for possession, or separate his mind enough from them to give them some independence, but they will be loyal to him, and see themselves as extensions of Ash. At first he won't have their memories, but he can access their minds whether controlling them directly or having them be drones, but he'd have to go through them individually. Any human girl possessed will, over the course of an hour per year become Ash's age, and can't be unpossessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Zygarde core that is the counterpart to Squishy is will also be connected to him due to his strong aura, and won't be able to be controlled by others without Ash being under control, but it doesn't seek to possess others with its cells. As Serena and Bonnie are nearby, Ash sends two of his cells into them that night when they are in their tents (as in, one for Serena and Bonnie, and one for Ash and Clemont), with everyone but Ash asleep. The cells can enter a girls body to control them through any openings, but he naturally feels the desire to insert the cells into the girls mouths or vaginas, the mouths because of simplicity, and the vaginas because he is in direct control upon entering, and will feel the aftermath of any pleasure he induces.</span></div></div>",

The group had been travelling through this forest for what seemed like forever and the scenery was starting to blend together.  Ash, Dawn and himself were travelling near Canalave, hoping to catch a boat as Ash had wanted to head back to Kanto for a little while.  Brock noticed they were low on food and excused himself, under the guise of hopefully being able to find some berries or other fruit to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked by himself, an odd rock caught his attention, however.  Bending down, Brock noticed that it bore a passing resemblence to the Soul Badge that Koga and his sister gave out to trainers, only a dark gray.  Finding it interesting, he picked it up.  As soon as he did that, however, the rock began to glow!  Brock, shocked, began to feel lightheaded.  In fact... he felt light in general.  Looking down, he couldn't believe his eyes: he was floating!  Surprised, he reached to grab a tree to steady himself, only to find his arm go right through it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealizing quickly that it must be because of the stone he found, Brock looked down and saw it was nowhere to be found.  Giving up, Brock decided to float through the forest for a bit.  It wasn't long before he spotted somebody not too far from where Ash and Dawn were.  Getting closer, his heart stopped: it was a pretty girl. In fact, he recognized her as Gardenia, the Eterna City Gym Leader they had run into some time back.  She was a little far from her Gym, though Brock figured that maybe she was on the lookout for any new Grass Pokemon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock floated down in front of her, trying to get her attention though she seemed to not be able to notice him.  Reaching his hand out to her, he suddenly felt himself get sucked forward.  Coming to, he felt different.  He felt shorter and lighter.  His hair was still short but he noticed two long, auburn bangs hanging down the side.  And he was wearing... a green shawl?  It dawned on him: that rock had somehow turned him into a spirit, capable of possessing others and right now, that \"other\" was Gardenia!.  Thinking, he tried exiting Gardenia's but nothing happened.  He felt something in her pocket, though, and reaching in, he pulled out the stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt must've travelled with him somehow, he realized.  Thinking, the stone began to glow and he soon found himself floating over Gardenia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, what happened?\" she asked herself, shaking her head.  \"Did I black out or something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock realized that this could be quite useful indeed.  As he pondered how he could finally get as close to any girl as he wanted, he heard Ash and Dawn nearby, calling out for him.  Brock was left with a dilemna: take over Gardenia's body again and explain what happened, possess Dawn, waiting until he could find a better body, or he could take over Gardenia's body again, but live her life for a while instead of telling Ash and Dawn.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Brock figured that Gardenia wasn't going to want to stray too far from Sinnoh so he'd \"hitch a ride\" with Dawn for the time being until he could find a better body. Wasting little time, he shot towards Dawn, flying straight into her body. Coming to, he felt the shoulder-length blue hair, hat, skirt, and pink boots that made up the girl's usual outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Dawn, you alright?\" Ash asked, \"You stopped for a second there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, yeah, I'm fine.\" Brock said, noticing just how high-pitched her voice was, \"I just, uh, thought I heard a noise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A noise?\" Ash asked, stopping to hear a rustling sound. \"Now that you mention it, I think I hear something too. C'mon, let's see what it is.\" he said, running off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock followed behind him. Dawn was weaker than she was so she was finding it hard to keep up with Ash. That, and the constant breeze against her legs was a big distraction. Brock also bemoaned the fact that Dawn was just plain undeveloped. She would be very pretty once she grew-up but \"grow-up\" was the operative phrase: she was still just a kid. Brock couldn't wait until she found somebody a little more... developed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Ash said, coming to a stop a short time later, \"I thought this is where that noise was coming from but I don't see anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"KIIIIYAAAAAH!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cry filled the air as a woman leapt down from the trees, striking Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OW!  What'd ya do that for?!\" He cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oops, sorry. I didn't recognize you at first.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey Gardenia! What's up?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just about to ask you the same question.\" Came the reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well we were heading over to Canalave City. I wanted to try to catch a boat to Kanto since I haven't been in a while.\" Ash answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see!\" Gardenia replied excitedly, \"I'd love to visit there myself, actually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would?\" Brock replied, her interest suddenly piqued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGardenia nodded, \"Uh-huh. I heard that there's a grass-type Gym Leader over there, too. I'd love to meet her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you must be talking about Erika.\" Ash said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Gardenia, would you like to come with us?\" Brock asked the Gym Leader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing! Just hold on a second.\" No sooner had she said that than a Nuzleaf appeared in front of her. \"Nuzleaf, deliver this message to the other trainers in my Gym. It tells them that I'm going on a trip and I'm going to need somebody to fill in for me, okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nuzleaf nodded and ran off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Gardenia said, \"let's go!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, Brock still hasn't come back yet.\" Ash stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrock shook her head, the long hair moving felt weird to her. \"Don't worry about him, I have a feeling he'll show up when we get to Canalave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, the trio headed out towards the city. About two hours later, they arrived in Canalave and made their way to the harbor. As they arrived, they were stopped by a voice from behind, turning to see that it was Johanna, Dawn's mother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dawn, I heard you were heading towards a whole 'nother continent! Is that true?\" She asked after reaching the group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it is, mom.\" Brock stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I just wanted to tell you goodbye, then, and I hope you come back in one piece.\" She replied, hugging Brock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yeah, th-thanks mom.\" Brock said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWatching her, she realized that she was having a hard time finding a potential candidate. Thus, Johanna seemed like as good a one as any. Suddenly, somebody caught her attention. A blonde wearing a dark blue tank top and short white skirt, with a dynamite body that filled it perfectly. She was a real beauty and would've made a great host. Then again, Johanna wasn't a bad choice at all.

She had been searching for Tidus, but hadn't been able to find him. She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where are you...\" Yuna wondered out loud while thinking about Tidus. She heard footsteps and turned to see the fayth of Bahamut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Yuna.\" The fayth greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?\" Yuna asked in surprise. \"I thought that the fayth disappeared after I performed the sending on Sin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I came back, but not for long.\" The fayth replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you come back for?\" Yuna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard you talking about missing Tidus, we can bring him back...\" The fayth began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please! Do it!\" Yuna begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on and let me finish.\" The fayth said. \"We can't restore his body, we fayth are too weak at the moment, our energy is being drained. We can only bring him back if we put him in someone else's body, when we are back to normal we can bring his body back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use mine!\" Yuna replied quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" The fayth asked in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't want him walking around in someone else's body, first of all it would mean he would take over their life, and I don't want someone else to be controlled like that, besides it would be like I was in a relationship with them.\" Yuna explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You realize that he is still a teenage male.\" The fayth replied. \"He'd probably look at your body at the very least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's fine with me.\" Yuna replied. \"I love him and want to marry him anyway. If we'd get married, then he'd get to look anyway. Besides, if he looked, it would mean that he would find my body beautiful enough to look at.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" The fayth replied. \"If we put him in your body, he'll be able to access your memories so he could pretend to be you, however when we manage to bring his body back, part of him will likely be stuck inside of you, he may end up in both your body and his own, or you may end up as his slave, with your mind under his control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do it!\" Yuna begged. \"I can't stand to be without him.\" The fayth sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured this would happen.\" The fayth said. \"It will take a while, he should possess your body while you are asleep.\" The fayth disappeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that night<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuna was sleeping peacefully in her room. She knew that this might be the last night that she was ever herself, but she was glad that Tidus would be back. All of the sudden Tidus appeared in Yuna's room, but he was see-through. Tidus walked to Yuna's bed and sat down on it, he adjusted his legs so that they they were in the same spot as Yuna's legs. His legs disappeared as they entered Yuna's legs, which were now his legs.

She sat up on her bed and looked at her body, but it was not Yuna in control, it was Tidus's body now, but she still had Yuna's brain working properly.

Everything seems to be in order,\" Robin said after going over all the supplies they had in the storage room. The room was filled to the brim with weapons, tomes, Elixirs, and other items of the sort. As Robin exited the room, however, he saw a tome he didn't recognize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this tome doing here?\" Robin didn't know what this tome was, or what it did, even less. Robin decided to take a quick glance at what this tome does, and saw that, apparently, it's a possession spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Imagine someone's image in your mind as you say the incantation, and you will immediately take over their body. They will have no recollection of what happened to them while they were controlled,\" the tome says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting...\" Robin was amused by what he could see and do using this tome. He decided to use it. For his first \"victim\", he planned to go with a girl, since being in a girl's body would be an interesting thing to try out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut who will Robin possess?</span></div></div>",

He thought she was beautiful, but hasn't acted on asking her out yet. Robin took the tome back to his room, locked his door, and sat down on his bed. He then pictured Lucina in his mind and recited the words to the spell. After he did this, he blacked out, and Robin's body fell backwards onto his bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRobin was suddenly inside Lucina's room. He immediately looked down, and noticed he was wearing Lucina's armor, and that long, dark blue hair was falling from his head. \"Oh gods! It worked!\" Robin screamed in Lucina's beautiful voice. Robin looked at a mirror hanging by Lucina's bed, and saw Lucina staring back at her, copying each and every one of her movements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is amazing! I'm Lucina! I'm a girl!\" Robin was excited beyond her own belief. She felt that wearing armor wasn't right, especially at the end of dusk, so she looked through Lucina's clothes, and changed into a nice, dark blue dress in order to get a better look at herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm beautiful...\" Robin muttered as she blushed looking at her new reflection. Upon looking down at herself, she grabbed her new breasts. Lucina's boobs weren't small like her armor led everyone to believe, but they certainly weren't big either. It seemed like they were normal size. Robin also felt her crotch. It was weird for there to not be something there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What should I do now?\" Robin wondered, staring at her reflection.</span></div></div>",

Corrin took this tome back to his room, and sat down on his bed and began to familiarize himself with the instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long, Corrin chanted the spell, with his mind fixated on one person.

But his body felt different. He felt reactions from his body in places he never felt before. For a second, Corrin just aimlessly stared. He knew that the spell did something, otherwise he wouldn't be in a lake right now. After snapping out of it, he looked down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter looking down, Corrin saw that his body was now that of a woman's. Not only that, but she was naked as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin saw as her new feminine body was standing under water, with only her shoulders and above outside of it. She saw feminine curves in her sides, alongside hips bigger than she was used to. She saw long hair, colored light blue, falling into the water around her face. She saw breasts, appearing to be what seemed to be standard size, floating upwards on her chest. Corrin felt urged to touch them, but realized that now was not the time. While she could not see it, she felt water touching her crotch, now feeling emptier than it once was. Corrin took deep breaths before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, gods...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin recognized that voice as Azura's. Despite the fact she activated the spell herself, the fact that she was now suddenly in what appears to be Azura's body, naked in a lake not too far from her inter-dimensional castle, was a lot for her to take in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about half a minute of calming down, Corrin moved closer towards where the light was reflecting on the water, hoping to see a reflection of her face to confirm that she is Azura. As she walked closer to it, still in the water, she felt the water pushing her breasts towards her chest, alongside the water moving towards parts of her body she wasn't familiar with. After reaching the light, she saw a reflection of Azura's face on the water's surface, staring back at her with her yellow eyes. As Corrin made facial expressions, Azura's reflection would immediately repeat them all back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It...it worked. I'm Azura...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin still couldn't believe she was talking with Azura's voice, but even more so that she actually used a spell that allowed her to take over Azura's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why is she naked out here? Was she bathing?\" Corrin knew that some of the others would occasionally go to nearby lakes and rivers to bathe, but never expected to actually be bathing in one of them, more so in a woman's body. \"Would Azura kill me for using this spell on her while she was bathing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCorrin then remembered what the spell boom said. Azura, or anyone for that matter, would not remember <i>anything</i> that happened while they were possessed. And that Corrin can return to her body any time she wanted to merely by concentrating her mind on it. Corrin realized she was safe, as Azura would never have to know about this. Corrin let out a sigh in relief, before she had an epiphany:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could do whatever she wanted to in Azura's body, and she would never know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA devious smile formed on Azura's face, now controlled by Corrin. This was an opportunity of a lifetime. She could use this to pull pranks on others and avoid being caught. She could fondle Azura's body all she wanted, from as little as just simply touching it, or as far as things she would rather not say. She could make Azura look beautiful, as this was a very beautiful and attractive body, by trying on different outfits or doing things with her hair. If Azura didn't have outfits, she could simply go buy some. 'It would be interesting to go shopping in a woman's body.' She thought. She could try out Azura's special powers of manipulating water, or even sing with her beautiful voice. There were so many possibilities, that she wasn't sure what to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat should Corrin do?</span></div></div>",

He had been experimenting in recreating the technology shown in one of the movies he had recently seen...  They were right, spirit containment must be possible, and King Boom Boo's ghost minions were still at large...  And who knows if Knuckles had actually destroyed the creature?  Could a spirit really be destroyed?  He had succeeded in containing one when there was a short in the wires...  He went to fix it, but...  There had been a bright flash of light, and he passed out.  That's all he could remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt...  Odd now...  Strangely light...  The containment box had been destroyed, and the ghost was gone...  He frowned, going to go pick up some of his tools, yet...  He couldn't.  His hand went right through.  It was partially transparent now, too!  That accident, did it...  Kill him?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Don't be an idiot, your body just absorbed me.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe heard a voice come from nowhere.  What the heck was going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I thought you were supposed to be a genius or something...  You're not dead, you're just part me now.  Its cool having a body, but I'm not in control.  Come on, let's go have some fun.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a mental tug coming from the voice as he frowned...  He wasn't dead?  Interesting...  But that would mean...  He concentrated on becoming solid once again, and found himself capable of grabbing the tools once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n[i]Boring.  You're being boring!  Come on!

Yes, this would be fun, wouldn't it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Amy...  Don't scream...\"  He whispered to her as he dove into her body, finding himself in a representation of her mind...  There were pictures of Sonic everywhere, and Amy was huddled in a corner, black and faded...  Likely where she retreats when she's afraid...  She wasn't facing him as he approached her.  <i>Its her consciousness...  Take it, become it.</i>  He only nodded, chuckling as he slid a finger down her back as she gasped, eyes wide as a hole appeared and he began easing himself into her very soul...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe woke up, moaning to herself and lying on the ground.  Amy looked at her hands, wriggling her fingers as if testing them as she blinked, getting up and stumbling a bit.  Amy remembered hearing a voice that sounded like Tails...  But he wasn't anywhere to be seen...  Then a tingly sensation came over her whole body and she felt like something invaded her...  Then she woke up...  What was going...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit her, she remembered...  She wasn't really Amy, but Tails had put himself so deeply into her that she believed it for a moment.  She grinned a bit at that, blushing as she got up.  \"Well, this is a new experience.  What now?\"</i></span></div></div>",

The first is that either blaze or rouge had saved tails. Personally I would prefer blaze because I could explain her ability to see him because of her being from a different dime toon and all and she saved him using her abilities. While on the other hand rouge being a bat and all and having experience with Hal's emeralds may have a few tricks up her sleeves when it comes to seeing ghosts and swooped down to catch tails. <br>\r\nOr the story could take an entirely different route as the ghost managed to form a semi physical body out side of tails long enough to slow his fall and allow tails to become incorporeal </span></div></div>",

His team had just gotten back from their first attempt to get Sasuke, which turned out badly as he nearly killed Naruto again. As he walked back to his apartment his mind focused on other issues. He first thought of his teammate and crush, Sakura. Since he returned, Naruto noticed how well she'd developed, both physically and in her skill, in the time he was gone. Her beauty make him want to be with her even more. Naruto also thought about Ino. when he first saw her after the time he was gone, he was astonished. Like Sakura, Ino had defiantly improved. Naruto shook his head, getting the perverted images of both girls out of his head as he reached his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he arrived, he noticed a small box at his door. Curious, he opened the box to find a crystal pendant and a small book inside. the title of the book was, <i>How To Hypnotize Girls.</i> Naruto read through the book and grinned perversely, as images of a hypnotized Sakura and Ino went through his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis mind made up he said out loud, \"I am going to hypnotize both of them!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What shall I have them do once I've hypnotized them?\" He wondered out loud.</span></div></div>",

Upon entering, he found Sakura, Ino, Hinata and Tenten with a fearful look on their face, with Tsunade's death glare likely causing it. She then looked at Naruto, as did the other 4, and handed him a box. \"I found this in your fathers will. it said to give it to you should you had lost all your family. Seeing how you've turned 18, I trust you. So, Naruto - enjoy your new house?\" She asked, seemingly calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, yes I am.\" Naruto said. The four sighed relief, but Tsunade quickly snapped them back into fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You four shouldn't be so calm. You know what you did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe they do, but I don't.\" Naruto claimed. What could of they have done to get her this angry? Sure, he's been yelled at by her like this, but he's Naruto - he's ALWAYS pissing off Tsunade. These four rarely do that to anyone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, these four decided to NOT INFORM US of the fact that at least 2 of Orochimaru's guards are still alive.\" Naruto glanced over, and saw the girls look ashamed. Hinata was crying into Tenten's shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Tsunade, I know there's a reason for it. I don't know what reason, but there is one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto?\" The girls asked. Naruto walked over and embraced Hinata, as she needed it the most.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Regardless of reason, punishment is needed. You four should be blessed that he showed up, as treason normally results in jail time. But I'll give you some opinions.\" Tsunade stopped to think about possible punishments. Naruto seemed to calm her down when he's around. \"Well, you four will be relieved of your Ninja Duties for the month, and can only fight in a time of crisis. during that month, you could spend it in jail.\" The four knew that wasn't an opinion. \"Or you could be under house arrest.\" Not much better. \"Or you could go work in another village.\" Urg, the Sand and Leaf villages were nothing compared to home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah man, this sucks.\" Ino blurred. Tsunade took it as well as one would think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"DON'T PUSH ME! YOU ARE ON THIN ICE, LADIES!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could take them in.\" All the girls in the room turned their heads to see the opinion came from Naruto, who had distanced himself by now. The moment he made that option, Hinata ran to his side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that's a choice, I guess. You could work for Naruto in his new house for that time. But there's only going to be one answer for all of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you girls some time. Naruto said, walking out the door for a few.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata walked over to the other 3. \"So, what do you think?\" Sakura asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm not leaving this village.\" Ino declared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jail is out.\" Tenten added<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Naruto it is?\" Hinata asked. The others really thought about it. \"Look girls, We have a chance to live a life. We were going to be thrown in jail with damaged records. Naruto has risked his life for us for how many years? And we have don what to repay him? Tsunade tends to be nicer when he's involved. Plus, we just live with him as servants - we aren't under complete arrest - just limited rights; which we kind of deserve.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls all agreed to this after Hinata's mini-speech. \"Ok, you four are to help Naruto with anything he wants, got it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n_-_-_-_-_-_-_- What Naruto was doing during all that_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the door, Naruto is looking through the box he got. It was from his dad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear son, <br>\r\n          If you have received this, than our clan is all but dead, and you are our last hope. I really hope this Justu will come in handy. Sorry, but is short, and I am needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n                                                                                                                                                         - The Yellow Flash AKA Minato\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked inside and found a scroll. \"Hypnosis Justu - hypnotize any amount of girls with this awesome technique!\" Naruto Smiled, realizing the great fun he could have. Right on cue, the four come out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we are at your command.\" Sakura said. Naruto preformed the hand signs, and yelled out \"Hypnosis Justu.\" Then, the four's eyes glazed over, and then they all said \"We are at your command, Naruto-sama.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool! this actually works. Okay, I need you four to head home and get some clothes. Also, I need some things. A Bikini for each of you, a nurse custom from Sakura, a Maid outfit from Ino, a plush doll of me from Hinata, and a coin/string from Tenten. You will then head to my house and sit on my couch, waiting for further instructions.\" Naruto then snapped his fingers, and the four ran off. Naruto walked in, and saw Tsunade. \"Hey, they told me teir choice. Just had the go get ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AH, okay. If they don't cause anymore trouble, I might let them off. Anyway, I hope you didn't bite off more than you can chew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Naruto said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Yugi grabbed one of Tea's boobs, releasing a moan from the beautiful brunette.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, that feels so good.\" Yugi then took one of her nipples in his mouth while twisting the other one, earning more moans from his longtime crush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about 5 minutes, Yugi stopped, much to Tea's disappointment.

He takes the time to admire the sheer beauty of the still landscape when he sees a strange looking fairy in the distance. \"What's that?\" He asks as he wills it to move closer. It has no effect and he's baffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yoo-hoo,\" the fairy cries out from a distance. It flies closer and before long, it's right in front of Tails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy giggles, \"I'm the mystical hypno-fairy of course!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTails just looks on blankly. \"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fairy beeps Tails' nose. \"You sir, are a powerful sleeper. The way you control this dream is perfect. I have selected you to help spread the joy of sleepiness throughout the land!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you,\" it laughs some more, \"when you awaken, you'll be granted super-hypno powers that you can use to do... well, whatever you want with really.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll... uh, take your word for it.\" And with that, Tails wakes up.

Her occasional negative side really makes you want to support her even more. Hence,it was no surprise that little by little,you harbor affection to the special type destroyer. However,despite all the time you have spent with this girl,you have not found the courage to ask her out. But with this.. Maybe... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\" Fubuki.

And as a manifestation of your elation,you promptly pulled your shipgirl into a tight hug,as she responds in kind,whilst being confused and also embarrassed at the same time. \"M-master..? W-what's wrong..?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Nothing.. It's just that... I love you,Fubuki.\" You whisper those words of confession after long last.

Not much he could do, if he so much as tried to peep on any of the girls then Adelaide would smack him silly. Deciding to do what he liked best, he went to the library to study demonology. He was the \"Demon King\" after all, kinda sorta... well, not really, but he liked studying them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the demonology books in the library when he found one that he had never read before. <i>Hypnos: The Mental Demon</i> was its name. \"Hypnos? I've never heard of him,\" he mused as he took it off the shelf and began to read it. It read,  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hypnos was a demon who possessed a mysterious power that let him influence the minds of those he wished. While mentally powerful, he was physically weak and it eventually led to his downfall.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He seems pretty neat,\" Val\u00e8rio remarked as he turned the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>He was known as a lecherous demon, using his powers to enslave the minds and bodies of beautiful maidens for his harem</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't that be nice?\" He mused as he turned the page. His eyes widened as he saw what was there. It was an image of his harem and boy was it marvelous! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGirls of all sorts were present in all kinds of outfits and in the middle was Hypnos himself. He sat on a throne as a busty fox girl with brown hair and fur danced for him in a revealing dancer's outfit. At his feet was a slender squirrel girl whose face was to the floor as she kissed and worshipped his feet.  To his sides was a pair of nubile cat girls, twins most likely, wearing nothing but a loin cloth around their waists and a rag around their ample chests fanning him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were other girls too. Some were watching the dance, some were admiring him, and some were in deep lust other slaves; kissing and fondling each other to their heart's content. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne thing was constant though; the sheer wonder on the girls' faces. Each one was completely and totally enthralled by this demon, and it showed. They were each so happy, or mystified, or just so glad to be his slaves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, that was pretty hot,\" he remarked as he turned the page again, \"What the?!\" He asked as blood spilled from his nose. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was another image of Hypnos, this time in a large bath surrounded by naked beauties washing his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to learn more about this guy,\" he said as he frantically turned the page, looking for more info.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Upon his defeat, he was sealed into a locket of some sort with the hopes that his power would never be abused again.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" He asked angrily. Those were the last words of the book. \"This can't be!\" He threw the book against the wall in anger. After he cooled down, he decided to look at those images again. \"Ehh, she can't do anything about my fantasies,\" he mused, referring to Adelaide.  When he picked up the book, a small sheet of paper fell from its bindings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" He asked as he picked it up. Written on it was:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The power of Hypnos can be found within the next book</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Next book? Next book?\" He asked as pondered what that meant. \"Wait, it probably meant the book right next to this one,\" he mumbled as he went back to where he got the book from. He grabbed both books next to it and opened them up. One of them was hollowed out and contained a tiny wooden box. Opening the box, he saw,</span></div></div>",

He turned back to the box and saw a sheet of paper in there. \"More instructions?\" He wondered as he looked it over. There were no words on it, just a series of images.

The night before, Naruto was tricked into stealing a forbidden scroll, and learned two jutsu from it, the Shadow Clone Jutsu, and a jutsu known as Puppet Strings Jutsu, which he hadn't tested out yet. Naruto went to talk to Sakura so he could try to get closer to her so that she'd be nicer to him since they were on a team, and he was in love with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Sakura!\" Naruto shouted as he came up to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Sakura shouted while punching him into a wall. \"Why don't you leave me alone you loser, Sasuke is way better than you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you treat me like this Sakura?\" Naruto asked. \"I love you and have done everything I can for you, yet you hate me and love Sasuke, who can't stand you!\" Sakura hit him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shut up, you don't love me, you're just a dead last who wants to cause me trouble, and Sasuke does love me, he's just too shy to admit it.\" Sakura replied in a snobbish tone, enjoying how much she was making Naruto hurt inside. Sakura began to leave, and Naruto was very depressed at that point. He walked a little bit away so that nobody would see him, and then he began to practice doing the hand signs for the Puppet Strings Jutsu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Puppet Strings Jutsu!\" Naruto shouted, still depressed about what Sakura said, but he wasn't going to let that interfere with practicing his jutsu. Suddenly a wind blew and the strings went flying off into another direction, right into Sakura, who gasped as she was suddenly turned into a living puppet, who's mind and body were completely under Naruto's control forever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 1: Sakura is the only one who was hit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChoice 2: Hinata was also hit by the strings, but since she already loved Naruto to the point where she'd do anything for him, she kept control of her mind, but became more confident and his loyal slave.</span></div></div>",

Iruka-sensei, no I\u2019ve already caused him enough trouble. Ji-san, no I already lied to him by telling him I only learned to make Shadow Clones from the forbidden scroll. Plus there is a chance who ever I tell will take Sakura away from me and put her in some lab.\u2019<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked over at Sakura, \u201cYou have to do whatever I say right?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat is correct master.\u201d Sakura replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok then, but please stop talking in monotone.\" Naruto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright master.\" Sakura replied in a joyful tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your body is still the same, right?\" Naruto asked. \"You're still a human even though you are now a puppet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right!\" Sakura replied cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto smiled at her, \u2018The forbidden scroll was where I got that jutsu from so maybe it holds the answer of how to undo it as well. But how am I gonna get my hands on it, no doubt Ji-san is gonna have beefed up security.\u2019 <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto tried to think up a plan when he thought he heard something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was\u2026</span></div></div>",

Being the prankster that he was Naruto instantly knew of all the different ways he could use this technique to spread his personal brand of chaos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe best thing about the jutsu was that he could make it so that the girl could act on her own, as if she wasn't a puppet, but still following all of the orders of the caster. Plus the jutsu was also created a link between Naruto and his target so he could think the command, and the girl would do it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he knew just who his first victim would be, his pink haired classmate Sakura Haruno.

Sasuke) in the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce the bell sounded for recess our blond hero shot out the door and hid in a tree, all he had to do was wait for Sasuke-teme to wonder by, no doubt with his fan club in tow, and he could take control of Sakura and then the fun could begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn\u2019t have long to wait as soon enough the Uchiha appeared, being pursued by his fan girls.

And Hinata would shoot glances at Naruto without him knowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's attention meanwhile was focus on In who was having currently having round 299 of her glaring match with Sakura, Naruto let out a chuckle, the two of them would be getting along soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school day went by and for our blond haired hero it couldn't come soon enough. As soon as the bell signalling the end of the day was sounded Naruto reactivated the jutu forming the chakra strings that connected himself to Ino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as the strings were attached Ino's eyes became dull and the autopilot personality that she was using vanished, leaving her as little more than Naruto's plaything. With a simple tug on one of the strings she followed her master out of the classroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow what should happen?</span></div></div>",

Not long ago he had used his Mangekyo Sharingan on his brother Sasuke and had come straight to where he had stored him mother\u2019s body, the apartment of 7 year old Naruto Uzumaki. Said child was currently lying on his bed, Itachi having placed him and his mother in a deep slumber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(AN yes I have checked this, the Uchiha massacre happened 8 years after the Kyuubi attack and three months before Naruto's 8th birthday making him 7) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Madara has clearly gone mad over the years, if you truly are the Yondaime's legacy then you may be the only one who can stop him. But to do that you will need someone who can help you and you will need someone to protect you until then. I know doing this will deprive Sasuke of mother however you are far more deserving of her.' He thought, then he quickly started stripping his mother down to her underwear and placed her onto the bed beside the sleeping Uzumaki boy. He then took out a kunai and drew some of Naruto's blood which he then used to drawn symbols on his mother\u2019s body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese seals would create unbreakable bonds between Naruto and his mother leaving her as little more then a doll or puppet subservient to Naruto's will with a deep seated desire to protect him until he could do so himself. He was also able to transfer some of his own energy into her, giving her the Sharingan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis task done Itachi quietly slipped out of the apartment and made to leave the village to start his new life as nuke nin, he had no doubt he would be labelled as a criminal wanted throughout the elemental nations, however if it meant the safety of Konoha, then he would endure it.</span></div></div>",

You can't be suggesting that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong with you using the Living Puppet seal to allow Hinata to continue her regular life here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because it won't be her regular life! She'll have to stay with me and forcibly obey me! I don't want her to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Naruto...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto turned to Hinata as she said, \"I already know what this means for me...and I don't mind. I know you'll take good care of me. Please, don't say no!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The choice is yours, Naruto,\" Sarutobi said. \"Do you grant the lady her wish or leave her to be sold as a slave?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either way she's going to be a slave. What kind of choice is that?\" Naruto weakly argued, though it came out as a whisper. As Sarutobi, Hinata, Hiashi and the Hyuga attendants continued to stare at the Uzumaki, he suddenly screamed, \"DAMMIT!!!!\" He then cut his index finger and began to draw the seal on Hinata's exposed skin. The one part he left out was the seal that sealed her memories. With a bright flash, Hinata slumped forward, only to be caught by Naruto. After a while, Hinata looked up to Naruto, who tearfully asked, \"Are you okay, Hinata?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smile, Hinata answered, \"I...I think so, Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I know this isn't some sort of prank by the child to deceive me?\" Hiashi said. He knew some sort of jutsu was used, but he didn't sense that big a change in his daughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, would you offer a demonstration for him?\" Sarutobi asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Naruto said, \"Hinata, punch your father in the stomach for making me do this to you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout hesitation, Hinata answered, \"Right away, Master,\" and ran over to carry out her deed. The attendants were too slow to stop the girl from landing a hard hit on Hiashi's gut, causing him to cough and stumble to one knee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bastard!\" the attendants yelled. \"We're gonna kill you for tha...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Hiashi yelled, lifting himself up to stare at Naruto. \"Lay a finger on him and you'll answer to the Hokage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the attendants uneasily stepped back in line, Sarutobi looked at Naruto and Hinata and said, \"You two are dismissed. No doubt you have a lot to talk about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure. Come on, Hinata; let me take you to my home. We can talk along the way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata blushed as she answered, \"A...As you wish, Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the two children left, Sarutobi looked at Hiashi and said, \"...be honest; you wanted that to happen, didn't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiashi gave a faint smile as he said, \"That girl needs someone who will encourage her more than I can. The elders of my clan expect excellence from the clan head's heir and Hanabi is already starting to show great progress. Being with Naruto will allow Hinata the chance to grow without having to be scrutinized by my clan's elders.\"</span></div></div>",

She had just begun when ANBU arrived to take Naruto to the Hokage's office for an important matter. It had been an hour since he left, but she knew she could relax since the Hokage's ANBU would make sure he wasn't injured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the front door opened, Mikoto practically danced over to the doorway, saying, \"Welcome home, Master? What did the Hoka...\" Her welcome was cut short when she noticed a girl about Naruto's age finish opening the girl, then bowing while she said, \"Welcome home, Master.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girl, after welcoming Naruto home, looked at Mikoto and blushed, asking, \"M...Master...who is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, what happened in the Hokage's office?\" Mikoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto brought the girl over and said, \"Mikoto, this is Hinata, and she'll be living with us for a while. Hinata, this is Mikoto. I told you about her during out walk here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough still confused about the situation, Hinata held out her hand and said, \"Um...nice to meet you, Miss Mikoto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikoto accepted the handshake and said, \"Likewise, Hinata, though please just call me Mikoto. From the sound of it, we're both in the same position as Master's slaves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, don't call yourselves that!\" Naruto said. \"As far as I'm concerned, we're all friends now! I don't want to see you as slaves!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikoto bowed as she said, \"Forgive me for using that word, Master!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Mikoto,\" Naruto said. He then sniffed and said, \"Is that dinner?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikoto smiled and said, \"Yes! I just need to set the table and we'll be able to eat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need any help, Mikoto?\" Hinata asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, would you mind putting the plates on the table?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata grabbed the plates and went to the table. She then set the plates down, then looked confused. \"Um...how do I do this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have you never set a table before?\" Mikoto asked, keeping her tone neutral.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I...um...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikoto, Hinata came from a clan that had servants. She's probably never done this before,\" Naruto said as he walked over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry; I didn't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, Mikoto,\" Hinata said as she turned away from Naruto, feeling her face redden from her being defended by Naruto. Mikoto noticed and smirked to herself. \"Oh, dear. Master's got himself an admirer,\" she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Mikoto finished setting the table, everyone sat down and ate dinner. Afterwards, Naruto said, \"Mikoto and Hinata, you two get in the bathroom and get cleaned up. You can sleep in my bed tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hinata's blush deepened, Mikoto asked, \"But what about you, Master? Where will you sleep?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll sleep on the couch, and I don't want to hear any argument from you. Hinata, your Dad said he'll send over your clothes and other belongings over here tonight, so I'll take care of it when it gets here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master,\" Mikoto and Hinata said in unison. After dinner, Mikoto taught Hinata how to dry dishes while she washed them. They then left for the bathroom while Naruto sat on the couch, waiting for Hinata's things.</span></div></div>",

Sitting on a stool next to her was another woman who had to obey Naruto's orders, whom she instantly felt a connection with even though it was their first time meeting. She eventually worked up the courage to ask, \"Um...Miss Mikoto?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikoto turned to Hinata and, with a kind smile, said, \"I already told you; you can just call me Mikoto. What do you want, Hinata?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, sorry. Um, when did you start serving Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe it or not, just this morning, although the seal was applied to me sometime last night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last night...when the Uchiha clan was murdered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...so you've heard about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kind of hard not to. Everyone I saw on the street today wouldn't stop talking about it, and even the attendants at my old home were talking about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know all about it, then? Well, what are your thoughts about it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I don't think I like this Itachi person. I mean, killing his whole family just to test his power...I didn't think anyone would be capable of doing that. How did he turn out that way? Was he not loved enough?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I LOVED HIM LIKE I DID SASUKE! I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY HE DIDN'T THINK OF ANY OTHER...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikoto quit her tirade before it became too big as she revealed a little too much information. She looked at the Hyuga girl, who just stared and said, \"You're a survivor of the Uchiha Massacre, aren't you? That's why your being alive has been kept secret from the rest of the village.\" There was no hint of excitement or surprise in Hinata's voice, which troubled Mikoto a little.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikoto sighed as she said, \"Technically, I'm dead. Itachi substituted me with a woman who looked just like me and killed her in my stead. His plans for me were to help Master grow, so he placed the Living Puppet seal on me in order to give him someone he could see as family. This essentially robbed Sasuke of his mother, and me of my only family left in the village.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata sank into the tub as she softly cried, \"I'm sorry, Miss Mikoto. I...I didn't mean to hurt your feelings...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata was surprised, however, when Mikoto entered the tub and wrapped the girl in a hug. \"You have nothing to apologize for, Hinata. I'm just scared of this new life I have to live. Luckily, it seems Master wants to help us be as comfortable as possible, so I'm thankful to serve him. I imagine it's the same, or more, for you, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata blushed as she admitted, \"Y...yes. He protected me from bullies a few years ago. Even though we didn't know each other then, Master came to my rescue and treated me like I, Hinata, mattered. That's...all I ever wanted from everyone!\" Hinata finished her last sentence by crying into Mikoto's shoulder. Mikoto kept hugging her, letting the girl let out her emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata continued as she lessened her crying. \"Ma...Master rarely puts himself above others and he just wants people to love him. None of his pranks were dangerous, so I don't know why people get upset at him. Why do people ignore Master and treat him like an outcast? I don't understand, Mikoto!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know the answer to that, myself,\" Mikoto said. She then put her chin under Hinata's chin, lifting it to make the Hyuga girl look her in the eye. \"However, let's not dwell on what we don't know and focus on what we do know. We are forever bound to Master, eager to do anything to make him happy. I have to stay indoors as much as possible, so my role is limited. Since you don't need to keep your identity a secret, you can go almost anywhere with Master and assist him however he can. It's an important task that can only be entrusted to you. Consider it your thanks to him for standing up for you when no one else could.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata blushed heavily, but ultimately gave Mikoto a military-like salute and said, \"I will do the best I can, Mikoto!\"</span></div></div>",

Well, I'm heading to bed. Good night!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls heard Naruto's footsteps walk away from the bathroom door. Mikoto got up and got the things while Hinata dried off. \"Here, Hinata,\" Mikoto said as she handed her the clothes left for her. She then put on her own clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikoto now wore a black nightie with a matching robe while Hinata wore pink pajamas with bunnies on them. Mikoto chuckled at how cute Hinata looked while Hinata blushed at how seductive Mikoto looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikoto and Hinata then snuck a peek at Naruto, who had thrown a blanket over himself on the couch and was now snoring loudly. Nervously, Hinata walked over and adjusted the blanket to cover more of him, then gave him a light kiss on his forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she returned to Naruto's bedroom, where she and Mikoto would be sleeping, Hinata heard Mikoto ask, \"What was that about?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata blushed as she said, \"I...I didn't want Master to be cold in the night. I was trying to keep him warm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that the reason for the kiss as well?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...I, um...that was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikoto chuckled and said, \"Don't get so flustered, Hinata. Master's a very sweet, kind person; I can understand why you'd feel that way about him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Mikoto...could you not tell...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your secret's safe with me, Hinata. If anyone should tell Master about your feelings, it ought to be you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks,\" Hinata muttered before she yawned and collapsed on the bed. Mikoto set herself down on the bed herself before she heard the light snores from the young girl. Mikoto felt her smile grow wider as she tucked herself and Hinata under the covers, thinking, \"I guess I'm in for quite the experience from now on. I wonder how Master and Hinata will get along from now on.\"</span></div></div>",

Naruto ate his rather quickly, but gagged when he felt all the vegetables go down his throat. \"Ugh, why are there vegetables in here?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe because you need a more balanced diet,\" Hinata politely suggested. \"You do need to keep up a healthy lifestyle if you're going to perform at your best.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto groaned more, but ultimately said, \"Yeah, you're probably right.

This is my favorite!!\" Tenten told Naruto as she picked up the bowl and started wolfing down the contents. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything for a friend!\" Naruto said with a smile, while Hinata nodded silently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(2 hours later)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?

Hanabi had shown tremendous progress since her youth, while Hinata seemed to become weaker in the elder's eyes. I knew Hinata was still growing, but Hanabi was a prodigy, on par with their cousin Neji.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Never met this Neji guy,\" Naruto said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's a year older than us, Master; I'm not surprised,\" Hinata told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, the elders convinced themselves that Hanabi was more worthy to take over the Hyuga clan and demanded I place the Caged Bird seal on Hinata.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It marks me as a member of a Branch Family,\" Hinata commented. \"I would have to be subservient to the Main House for the rest of my life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's cruel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree,\" Hiashi said. \"I didn't want to go through with it, and the elders thought that even being a branch family member was too good for Hinata, since they were stronger in the elders' eyes. Therefore, they demanded I sell her off as a slave.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those bastards!\" Naruto growled. \"I'm going to get them back for this!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, please don't get upset!\" Hinata said, placing a hand on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they disowned you and placed a seal on you to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually I never placed the seal on Hinata,\" Hiashi said, catching Naruto by surprise. \"The elders' plans for her were too much for me to agree with completely, but it is against the Clan's laws to go against a decision by the elders. I quickly whisked Hinata away before they discovered my failure to mark her with the seal. I then went to Lord Hokage to announce the Clan Elders' intentions to make Hinata a slave because I knew he'd find the happiest solution for her. As luck would have it, you came into focus and you know what happened by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto looked at Hinata and gripped the hand on his shoulder tightly. Hinata, meanwhile, was amazed that Hiashi went so far to make her happy. \"What if the elders...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told them that you were a slave to the Uzumaki boy, whom they already despise. They seemed content, thinking it was a fate befitting an ill-performing child of the Clan's Head.\" As Naruto glared at him, Hiashi added, \"However, I came here to tell you I do not share their opinion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I want what I feel is best for my daughter, and I can tell that she's already grown a little since I left her in your care. I want her to continue her studies as a shinobi, and being with you will give her more confidence in herself and a better life than she would have otherwise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and Hinata then stared in awe as Hiashi set his tea down and bowed to them. \"I know my explaining things probably won't excuse what I have done, but please forgive me. I do want what is best for Hinata, and I pray my leaving her in your care was a wise choice on my part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto continued to stare, but Hinata went up and hugged Hiashi. \"Thank you for everything, and don't worry; I am happier than I have ever been...Father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiashi hugged Hinata back and said, \"Thank you, Hinata.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto then stood and said, \"I guess if Hinata forgives you, I can't hold a grudge. Thanks for explaining everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiashi nodded and said, \"I felt you at least deserved to know why I did what I did. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other matters to attend to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hiashi stood to leave, Hinata said, \"Father, could you please visit me again sometime?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHiashi smiled and said, \"Of course. I'll be looking forward to it.\" And with that, he left.</span></div></div>",

Ever since Hinata was taken in by Naruto, both she and Mikoto had enjoyed their time together at night where they could just talk without having to worry about Naruto interrupting them too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it was. To know my father still loves me and wants me to do better...it makes me happy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, your father's not alone. Master and I feel the same way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but if you had been there and seen how he acted in front of Lord Hokage, you'd understand how I felt when he acknowledged he didn't want to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, new topic!\" Mikoto said suddenly after a moment of silence. \"How do you feel about Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata blushed a little and said, \"You know I love him! He saved me when I was...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know that, but when are you going to make the move?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What move?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean, saving you when he didn't even know you, taking you in to prevent you from being sold off, defending you when he felt your honor was being tarnished...I would have thrown myself at Master right away! Why haven't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata's blush deepened as she said, \"I...well, um...it's not that I don't want to, but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is there to be embarrassed about? I'm sure he'd return your feelings for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But we're still kids! What if I don't really love him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't we let time be the judge of that? Right now, I think you're being foolish for not letting him in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, the two girls finished the bath and went to get dressed for the evening. As they got dressed, Hinata thought about Mikoto's words and started to wonder if she should talk to Naruto about her feelings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto knocked on the door and said, \"Good night, Mikoto, Hinata!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night, Master,\" Mikoto answered back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, wait!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it, Hinata?\" Naruto asked, now peeking his head into the bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata gained a blush as she asked, \"Um...could you...please sleep with us?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was aghast at Hinata's question, unprepared for it. \"Well, I thought you two would want your privacy, being girls and all, so...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...I...I just feel like you should,\" Hinata stuttered. \"After all, this is your bed and we're...well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Hinata is saying she wouldn't mind if you sleep with us, Master,\" Mikoto said. \"And honestly, neither do I. No matter what you might claim, we are still technically your property. You should do with us as you please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto stood for a moment, unsure of what he should do. \"Well...if you really don't mind...then maybe for tonight I wouldn't mind...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Master!\" Hint screamed, jumping on him and hugging him tightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was surprised at first, but then hugged Hinata back. Mikoto then escorted Hinata and Naruto to the bed and laid them down. She laid down next to Naruto and threw the blanket over her and the two children. \"It looks like there's room enough for all three of us, Master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But what about when Hinata and I get older?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's for you to decide, Master, but let's worry about that later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto nodded, then drifted off to sleep. Hinata quickly went to sleep as well, cuddling close to Naruto as she did. Mikoto stared at the two for a while before getting to sleep herself. The last conscious thought to pass through her mind was, \"I wonder what the future holds for us.\"</span></div></div>",

You must have some reaction to his saving you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata simply shook her head as she thought about what happened the other night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Flashback*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto and HInata hid behind a few trees as Mizuki and Iruka faced each other. Irk had been injured trying to protect Naruto from one of Mizuki's shuriken. \"You saw his eyes earlier, didn't you? He's gonna use that scroll for something terrible, I'm sure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...you're right...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata could see the hurt that appeared in Naruto's eyes. She knew that besides her, Mikoto and Lord Homage, Iruka was one of the few people he had come to trust. She was about to fight on his behalf when she heard the rest of Iruka's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...the Nine-Tailed Fox would do that...but Naruto's different. He's one of my most excellent students. True, he's not the hardest worker, very clumsy, and few people accept him, but he already knows to feel pain deep in his heart. He's not the Nine-Tailed Fox! He's a member of the Hidden Leaf; Naruto Uzumaki!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto's eyes swelled up with tears as a smile started to appear on his face. Hinata smiled as well, knowing the person she was bound to for the rest of her life was happy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever!\" Mizuki said, drawing everyone's attention to him. \"I was gonna finish you later, but now I've changed my mind. Prepare to die!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto panicked and said, \"Hinata, try fighting him off, I need more time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master!\" Hinata said as she ran to stop Mizuki's advance. As soon as she got between Mizuki and Iruka, she assumed her clan's signature stance and struck Mizuki in the stomach and shoulder, blocking his chakra flow to those areas. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizuki glared at Hinata, then chuckled and said, \"Oh, well, I can always get Naruto later. For now, why don't I help myself to the whore who's been led astray by his wicked lies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You take that back!\" Hinata yelled. \"I won't have you insult him any further!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He won't for much longer!\" Naruto said as he appeared on a tree branch. He held the scroll to his side and sported a look that promised payback if Mizuki harmed Iruka or Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMizuki, however, laughed and said, \"Perfect! Now I don't have to hunt you down! I don't care if this bitch blocked my chakra, I can still take you down in one shot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Try it!\" Naruto said as he put his hands in a cross shape, and shouted, \"Shadow Clone jutsu!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt once, the area was filled with over a hundred clones of Naruto. Iruka and Hinata were surprised at the success of the jutsu, while Mizuki was now afraid of his chances.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Didn't you say you could take me down in one shot?\" Naruto asked before he and his clones started to beat Mizuki up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*End Flashback*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd still rather not talk about it,\" Hinata told the classmate who had asked her about that night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore the classmate could pressure her further, Iruka walked in and said, \"Okay, everyone, get to your seats and settle down.\" As Hinata made her way to her seat next to Naruto, Iruka announced, \"I just want to say how proud I am of all of you for graduating. Now, you will be put into your three-man cells. First, let's get to Team 7: Naruto Uzumaki, Hinata Hyuga and...\"</span></div></div>",

I can't tell you how excited I am!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But how? Didn't you graduate before us?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, but hanging out with you two was so much fun I wanted to wait for you to graduate. Besides, Lord Hokage insisted that I be with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, Team 7. I've received word that your Jonin instructor is waiting for you at Training Ground 8.

If I was his age, I'd throw myself at him without a second thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata turned to a mirror in the living room and sighed, \"I guess I'll never get Master's attention...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was surprised when Mikoto reached around Hinata and started cupping her breasts. \"That's because you're not confident enough in what you've got to offer. Let these girls out for fresh air and maybe Master will want you and only you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mikoto; cut it out!\" Hinata shouted as she pushed the older woman off. \"I...I'm not pretty enough for...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cut the crap, HInata; I've seen you grow up, remember? I know a beauty when I see one. Besides, I'm not saying there aren't other qualities about you Master will like.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...what else could he like about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you've got a gentle nature, one that enjoys helping people. Knowing Master, he might find that to be the most attractive quality in a girlfriend. You also have a good sense of right and wrong, as well as a determination to accomplish whatever you set your mind to. Keep that; and Master will be falling for you before you know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata once again looked in the mirror before saying, \"Well, I suppose I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! Now, why don't we go shopping before Master gets back?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because I'm serious about showing off your body, if only a little. Guys might not always be attracted to looks, but it's best to work with what you've got, and you've got plenty to work with.\"</span></div></div>",

When asked about it, those that were killing claimed to have had no memory of the incident. However, at night, they'd start yelling out for bloodlust and kill again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten thought over what was explained and said, \"You think someone else has access to a puppet jutsu like the one Naruto used?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's entirely possible, but given the sketchy details, we can't know for certain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it's not certain what the danger is, shouldn't we wait things out?\" Mikoto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm afraid there's no time. The leader of this village as issued a state of emergency; no regular citizen remains in the village except for those that have had these fits of madness. I want you to investigate these instances and make sure things don't get any more out of hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, sir!\" Naruto, Mikoto, Tenten and Hinata said before leaving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(At the village)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter splitting up to cover more ground, Naruto walked down the town square and looked at the empty houses lining the area. \"Man, this place gives me the creeps!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are still people here; they're just holed up in an underground shelter,\" Hinata stated, deactivating her Byakugan. \"I guess nobody wanted to take any chances by staying above ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a sound idea, but also foolish,\" Mikoto said as she dropped down to Naruto and Hinata's location from the rooftops. \"If my hunch is correct, there's a jutsu that causing these people to go blood hungry. If everyone's in the same place, that makes them a prime target, and there'll be no escaping them this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto thought about it, then said, \"Hinata, check again to see if there's any suspicious activity going on down there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Master,\" Hinata silently said as she reactivated her Byakugan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Hinata was checking up on the people below ground, Naruto couldn't help but stare at the way she had begun to dress. She currently wore a shirt that expose a little cleavage and hugged her form, yet was still slightly baggy. Her pants had gotten a little tighter, showing off her curves on her lower body. He couldn't help but blush at how beautiful she looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See something you like, Master?\" Mikoto whispered, causing Naruto to gasp at the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...I wasn't...I mean...I think Hinata looks pretty, but I don't understand why she'd suddenly change her wardrobe like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe there's someone she's trying to impress,\" Mikoto suggested. \"Someone whom she loves with all her heart and wants to spend the rest of her life with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Naruto could respond, he was pushed back by Mikoto. A flurry of shuriken embedded themselves in the ground where Naruto was standing. \"Master, are you alright?\" Hinata shouted as she ran to Naruto's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine,\" Naruto said as he looked up at where the shuriken came from.

Naruto's glare deepened as he asked, \"Are you responsible for what's going on here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who can say?\" the man said, the smile never leaving his face. \"I wanted to test some new seals, but the only one that seems to work is the one to turn others into killing machines. Not that it hasn't provided me with entertainment, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bastard!\"Naruto yelled as he drew a kana from his pouch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't do that if I were you,\" the man said. He then had two of the citizens walk forward, showing a tied-up and bruised Tenten behind them. \"I wouldn't want anything bad to happen to this pretty little thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tenten!\" Hinata cried as she went to Naruto's side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, so that's her name, is it? That makes this more fun!\" The man then jumped down and pressed his hand on her back. He then grinned and said, \"In 30 minutes she'll wake up, but she'll be under my seal's control. She'll want nothing but death and destruction. Leave now if you value your lives. Once I return, I'll destroy anyone who stands in my way.\" With that, the man and the mind-controlled citizens left, leaving Tenten behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" Naruto yelled as he started to run after him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, wait!\" Mikoto shouted after him. \"We need to do something about Tenten first!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto, though cursing this turn of events, produced a Shadow Clone to follow the villain, then went to Tenten's side. He saw where the man had placed his hand, and again cursed as he saw some writing beginning to spread over his teammate's body. \"How can we stop this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" Mikoto answered. \"I never had much experience with seals. I can't seem to find any way to dispel it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'd better think of something fast,\" Hinata said, aiming her Byakugan at Tenten. \"It looks like her chakra is being overridden by that man's chakra. If it continues like this, she won't be in control of her chakra and actions anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto spent some time thinking, but ultimately said, \"What if another seal was placed over it? Would the new seal be enough to cancel the old?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikoto looked up at Naruto and asked, \"Master, are you sure you want to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're out of options here,\" Naruto said, preparing to cut his finger with the kunai he drew. \"If I don't do something, I could never live with myself.\" He then started writing the Living Puppet Seal over Tenten's body, which started to glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, the villain returned and saw...</span></div></div>",

Naruto, Hinata, Mikoto and Tenten all took their battle stands to oppose them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready to get your revenge on this asshole Tenten?\"  Naruto asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it Master.\"  Tenten replied with a blush as she wasn't quite use to calling him that just yet, but she figured she'll have all the time in the world as she too was now bound to him by the Living Puppet Seal.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's get him.\"  Naruto led the charge.  Naruto, Mikoto, Hinata and Tenten all rushed in to attack with the villain and his controlled slaves opposing them.  Naruto and his group did their best to neutralize the controlled civilians one by one without causing too much damage.  Eventually the villain was all on his own with nowhere to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait please, let's talk about this!\"  The villain begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May I Master?\"  Tenten asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be my guest.\"  Naruto gave her permission as he motioned to the scum bag.  Tenten smirked as she cracked her knuckles approaching the cur, the dastardly man gulped in fear as she came closer to him.   She punched him repeatedly, and added a few kicks for good measure, making sure he felt every blow. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she was done beating him up, she finally decided to end this guys' life, and slit his throat.  It wasn't long before the guards of the city came to round up the controlled civilians.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you cure them?\"  Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, we'll try, but if we can't we'll have no choice but to grant them merciful deaths.\"  One of the guards said somberly as they took them in to get help.  Naruto then turned to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's head back and report to the Hokage.\"  He mentioned, earning a nod from the girls.  Once they got back, they reported everything that happened to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I congratulate you all on a job well done.\"  Hiruzen commented before turning his attention towards Tenten  \"How are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honestly I'm conflicted, I understand why my Master did what he did, and I appreciate him for sparing me from a worse off fate, but at the same time I'm not sure how I feel about being submissive.\"  Tenten gave a sigh \"Though I don't really have a choice anymore now do I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tenten, I already told you I don't want that kind of a relationship, I just want you to be yourself.\"  Naruto assured.  This immediately perked her up and she gave him a hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Master that means so much to me!\"  She praised.  Mikoto and Hinata smiled and went in to hug him as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still need you to make sure I don't become what I hate, like that man we killed.\"  Naruto commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Master, I'll do my best to see you'll never fall down that path.\"  Tenten promised<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That goes for me as well Master.\"  Mikoto added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I too will help you with that Master.\"  Hinata also added.  Naruto smiled at all three of them.  Before it got any further the Hokage fake coughed to grab their attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that out of the way I now dismiss you, feel free to go home and rest, you've earned it.\"   Naruto and his girls bowed in respect and left his office.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So shall we head on home, or is there anywhere you girls would like to go?\"  Naruto asked.</span></div></div>",

As Tenten and Mikoto both calmed down, Naruto said, \"I'm more than happy to spend time with you, but I don't want you two getting at each other's throats.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Master; I guess I just got too used to teasing,\" Tenten said, hanging her head down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, as well, Master; I should've had more control of my emotions,\" Mikoto said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine.

The were both blushing like mad while Mikoto grabbed Tenten by the arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's enough out of you.\"  She scolded as she dragged the laughing brunette out of the room.

Her motherly instincts were telling her she was still young but she pushed them aside, it was her choice after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man, wonder if Master will go for it.\"  Tenten wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, she's an attractive girl, and Master is very caring.\"  The older woman assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is, she'll probably undress him.\"  Tenten started<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then kiss him passionately.\"  Mikoto continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take his clothes off slowly.\"  The younger girl mentioned,   unaware her hand was traveling down to her crotch<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeing his muscular body.\"  Mikoto added, unaware her own hand was traveling at the same area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caressing him all over.\"  Tenten moaned as her hand reached her destination and began rubbing, unaware of what she's doing, too lost in her fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going to touch his penis.\"  Mikoto was too lost in her fantasy moaning a bit while her hand relentlessly worked her womanhood in between her panties, also unaware Tenten was doing the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Caressing it softly.\"  The younger girl moaned as her fingering went faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Putting it in her mouth.\"  The older woman also moaned as her own ministrations went faster.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finally she would...\"  Tenten panted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ask for him to put it in....\"  Mikoto also panted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And...and...\"  and that point they both nearly shouted as their climax hit.  When their wits came about they were blushing furiously at their actions<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha...what did we just...\"  Mikoto looked ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did we just...\"  Tenten was also ashamed.  They didn't look at one another for a moment before they decided to talk about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So....what does this mean?\"  Tenten asked not sure how to proceed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we already know.\"  Mikoto said somberly.  Tenten sighed <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had my suspicions I was falling for Master, but I kept it hidden for Hinata's sake.\"  She admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am in the same boat, I kept denying it to myself due to our age difference and kept telling myself he would never be interested in an older woman like me.\"  Mikoto sighed<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's like you said, don't let fear deny you of what your heart wants.\"  Tenten quoted her college from earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but there's a problem.\"  She mentioned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata.\"  Tenten agreed, \"Maybe she'll let us have this one time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless of her reaction, we need to discuss this.\"  Mikoto advised.  Tenten nodded sadly, and the two women went to confront them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata meanwhile was still naked in front of Naruto awaiting his answer.  Before the other two women came in and grabbed their attention, Hinata immediately turned beat red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here?!\"  Hinata shrieked in embarrassment and anger, nearly covering herself but didn't want to deny her Master of anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We came to talk Hinata.\"  Mikoto explained and addressed the situation.  Both her and Tenten presented their cases, with Hinata listening in with an unreadable expression, Naruto meanwhile was baffled that this was happening.  Hinata was surprisingly calm and diplomatic despite the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So let me get this straight, you both fell in love with Master.\"  She began earning two nods, \"And you want to participate in my special night.\"  Earning two sad nods<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll understand if you refuse Hinata but we just wanted to....\"  Tenten sadly started before she interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a condition.\"  Hinata unexpectedly started.  This perked the two girls to listen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't like the idea of sharing him, I still don't....but.\"  Hinata paused a bit before continuing \"I can't deny you were a great help in setting up Master and I so, I guess as my way of saying thanks I'll allow this, besides Master doesn't want us to fight and I don't want to upset him, however!!!\"  She paused again and she went to him and lightly grabbed Naruto's manhood with her hand, earning a groan from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is mine and mine alone, I don't care what else you two do with him but this only enters me, got it!!\"  Her tone indicated this was non-negotiable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"These are acceptable terms Hinata.\"  Mikoto abide with her wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm okay with that too.\"  Tenten added.  Naruto was really flustered and beat red from all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...wait a minute...\"  Naruto stuttered earning giggles from all three girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we broke him.\"  Tenten teased.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata couldn't help but smile and kissed him, \"I trust you're okay with this Master?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.....\"  Naruto didn't know how to respond to this, \"If you're all absolutely sure about this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are Master.\"  The three girls responded in unison.  Naruto gulped a bit then nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I guess, it's official.\"  He mentioned, wondering just what he got himself into.  This earned another giggle from the three girls and gave him a kiss each which caused him to blush even harder.  \"So, do you want to go one at a time, or I can use my Shadow Clones to ensure you all have a good time at once.\"</span></div></div>",

Once he was stable, he slowly got back up with Hinata supporting him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Hinata.\"  He groaned \"Mikoto, during our fight she told me stuff about my father, and how you and the others were keeping this a secret from me, is this true?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down in shame \"I'm sorry Master.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, don't worry I understand.\"  He mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  She asked, expecting him to hate her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't get me wrong I want to find out about my heritage more than anything, but if fighting her taught me anything is that I need to be stronger to make sure I protect these secrets myself.  If you feel that I'm not ready to know about it yet then I'll trust your wisdom, just promise when I am ready you'll tell me everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikoto beamed at that and rushed to hug him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Master, I swear when I get the okay from the Hokage I'll tell you everything you want to know!.\"  She promised as she kissed him.  Naruto groaned in pain causing her to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Master, I forgot.\"  She apologized as she let go of him.  Tenten being wiser about her teasing decided to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what do we do about her?\"  She pointed to their fallen foe.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, Master what exactly happened?\"  Mikoto asked <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure, one minute I was at my last rope with her about to kill me and the next that.\" He pointed to the paper in Mikoto's hand \"Fell onto her causing her to shout in pain and then collapse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm.\" Mikoto pondered as she looked at the paper once more, noticed a worn out drawing of what use to be a seal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would seem that whoever created this seal left one of them on to the paper itself as a defense mechanism, causing whoever touches it to be caught in the trap and effected by the seal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it wrong to say I'm glad she got to it first?\"  Tenten wondered<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the more important question is, what exactly does that seal do?\"  Hinata asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody knows, whatever it does she is now influenced by it.\"  Mikoto explained.  At that moment the fallen girl groaned a bit as she started to move once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like sleeping beauty is awake.\"  Tenten remarked. Mikoto nodded and drew a kunai of her own, she walked towards the fallen girl and pointed it at her as she awoke.  When she awoke something was not quite right, she looked frightened terrified even as she saw the weapon looming over her, pointed directly at her.  Panic was clear in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't move.\"  Mikoto warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"P...please don't hurt me miss kidnapper, I'll give you anything you want.\"  Kurostsuchi fearfully said.  Mikoto was confused by her remark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're not kidnappers, you attacked us!\"  Tenten growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did?\"  Kurostsuchi asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes you did, what's wrong with you?!\"  Tenten asked.  Causing the other girl to panic some more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S..sorry, please don't hurt me.\"  She begged.  Tenten was baffled, what was going on with her.  Mikoto was in thought for a moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know what's wrong.\"  Mikoto began  as she turned to the frightened girl.  \"What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My..my name?\"  She began \"I...I don't know, I don't remember, I don't remember anything!!\"  She began panicking \"Who am I, what am I doing here, why did you kidnap me?!\"  Mikoto sadly nodded as she activated her Sharingan and looked in the frightened girls eyes.  It didn't take long for the girl to be captivated by them and then fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I thought, this is what the seal did to her.\"  She explained  as she deactivated her bloodline, \"From the looks of it, it seemed to be some Memory Wiping Seal, causing the victim to have their memory erased.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N..no way.\"  Tenten exclaimed, now she was extra glad they didn't find that first, that could've been one of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case we got the paper that has how to make this seal now, time to head back.\"  Mikoto's voice sounding somber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about her?\"  Hinata pointed to the sleeping girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have to take her with us, and figure it out from there.\"  Mikoto mentioned as she picked her up.  With the jutsu in hand and an unconscious amnesiac in Mikoto's hands the group went back to Konoha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they were back they reported to the Hokage about what happened, Kurostsuchi was looking nervous wondering what they'll do to her.</span></div></div>",

Their pace quickened as their panting grew louder, sensing their climaxes are at their peek.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they hit their limit as all three teens climaxed at the same time.  All three panting hard as Hinata got of Naruto's face to cuddle on his left side, while Tenten slid herself off his rod to cuddle his right side.  Naruto smiled at the both of them and gave them a kiss each which they smiled back as he did.  Naruto took the time to enjoy both of his girlfriends' breasts pressing on him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can see why you wanted his penis to yourself Hinata.\"  Tenten breathed heavily a bit while still fully recovering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I'm willing to share with with you and Mikoto now.\"  Hinata replied with a smile, both women to turn to see their Master fully asleep earning a giggle from both of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So much for a second round.\"  Tenten teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I so wanted to see you ride him again.\"  Hinata teased back, Tenten blinked in surprised as Hinata giggled. \"I blame you for corrupting me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll take that as a compliment then.\"  The brunette coyly said  \"Think it's okay to sleep here with our guest?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't see why not, Mikoto mostly likely has figured out what we did and will make sure to keep her occupied to avoid an awkward moment.\"  Hinata shrugged  \"Besides, leaving Master after that doesn't feel right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know what you mean, well  good night then.\"  Tenten said as she rested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good night.\"  Hinata replied back as she rested herself, both girls falling asleep shortly after.</span></div></div>",

They were going to get ready to change before a voice interrupted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guys Mikoto said breakfast was...\"   Kurotsuchi began before seeing their state of undress, blushed and turned away. \"I saw nothing, I saw nothing, I saw nothing.\"  She muttered as she headed downstairs.  The three teens blushed in embarrassment from that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonder if that was Mikoto's punishment for not being involved in our fun.\"  Tenten muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wouldn't put it past her.\"  Hinata also muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In any case let's get changed and go eat.\"  Naruto mentioned as they did just that.

Once more she grabbed to read it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It seems the Hokage wants us to go meet someone in his office.\"  Mikoto read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if it's my grandfather.\"  Kurotsuchi pondered \"I don't remember him at all, so maybe seeing him will jog something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, only one way to find out.\"  She mentioned as the four of them went to the Hokage's office.  Upon arrival the Hokage greeted them with a warm smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you're all here, there is someone that wishes to see you.\"  He stated and allowed the visitor to have the floor.</span></div></div>",

But why?\" Tenten asked, with Hinata shooting a questioning look Mikoto's way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think about it; this is the Tsuchikage's granddaughter.

Lord Hokage gave his assurance that no harm or ill would befall Kurotsuchi, and it's up to us to ensure that doesn't happen. Even if it means we have to deny her...more intimate feelings toward Master to do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTenten and Hinata were about to interject when Kurotsuchi said, \"Actually, what you're saying makes perfect sense. Relationships are already hard enough, but one with two different villages...that's a political nightmare waiting to happen, especially under these circumstances.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMikoto then put a hand on Kurotsuchi's shoulder and said, \"I'm not saying you can never have a romantic relationship with Master.

Naturally none of the members even landed a scratch on their instructions but the point wasn't to win, the point was to grow and grow they have.  Once Jiraiya had a better understanding on what he was working with he began his instructions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tenten it's clear you're skilled in weapon training but simply throwing them isn't sufficient enough you'll need a weapon to master for close range combat.  Fortunately there's someone within Konoha that can help you with that, his name is Hayate, I'll contact him and he should be more than happy to help you hone in on your skills.\"  This earned a nod from the brunette still panting a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, I'm going to really need to work with you, the village did a poor job handling your training but you have the key ingredient to learn many times faster than any other ninja.\"  He told him, which earned a confused look from the blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your shadow clones, you've simply been using them to rush in there and hope for the best but they can be used for so much more.\"  The older instruction began.  \"For example, create a shadow clone for me.\"  The blonde nodded and did just that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I'll bring your clone far away and tell him something, once you've seen me finish talking with him I want you to dispel it and tell me what I said to it.\"  The older man advised.  With that he brought the clone far away and told him something, Naruto upon seeing this dismissed the clone as the Sannin approached him.  \"Now, what did I say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said the apples only bloom twice.\"  Naruto recited then his eyes widened at this.  \"N..no way.\"  This earned a smile from the older man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As you can see your shadow clones obtain the memory of everything that happens, and when you dismiss them you learn what they learn.  You can use this for training purposes too, this would normally be dangerous as both the overflow of knowledge and the amount of Chakra used could kill a person but with your reserves you can pull it off.\"  This explanation left Naruto stunned, he never considered this before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess I have work to do then.\"  The blonde mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That you do, once you're brought up to speed I'll give you some new techniques to go along with it.  How would you like to summon toads?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, that would be awesome!\"  Naruto happily exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I'll teach you that once you're ready, then after you master that I'll teach you a technique the fourth Hokage taught me!\"  The older man smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is awesome, I'll be Hokage in no time!\"  He said happily before reeling himself in, looking a bit flushed.  Both Tenten and Mikoto couldn't help but giggle at this, Jiraiya was also chuckling at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad you like it, I'll give you the rest of the day off.  Come back tomorrow for your training, Tenten I'll have you meet up with Hayate for your training at the training grounds, don't be late.\"  He instructed, earning two nods from the teens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Hinata was equally panting heavily, facing her father and holding her arm a bit.  Hiashi looked at her before stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think that's enough for today, we don't want to over exert yourself.\" He mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes sensei.\"  She mentioned before relaxing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're not there yet, but with time and practice I'll see to it that you will get there.\"  Her father mentioned. \"I'm proud of the good job you did so far regardless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you sensei.\"  Hinata replied, earning an eye smile from her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I not only speak to you not only as your sensei but as your father as well.\"  Hiashi mentioned.  \"Now I wish speak to you as your father for this conversion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\"  She asked, Hiashi looked at her for a moment before starting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and Naruto, you consummated your relationship haven't you?\"  He asked, earning a blush from Hinata and her to look away from him.  \"I thought as much.\"  He sighed a bit before continuing \"All I ask is for you to be careful and make the right decisions and do not do anything you feel you're not ready for.\"  This earned a smile from his daughter, she knew him well enough that this was his way of approving of their relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you father.\"  She happily exclaimed, before this went further he gave a fake cough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now with that out of the way, we shall pick up where we left off tomorrow.  Until then.\"  He mentioned, earning a nod from her daughter.  Team seven caught up to one another and went to their apartment to rest up.</span></div></div>",

I didn't regard anyone's feelings, thought it wasn't worth the effort, then you showed me otherwise, so thank you for helping me change for the better.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was all you, all I did was be there for you when you needed it.\"  He replied humbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't give yourself enough credit, there's just something about you that makes people want to put all their faith in and believe in, you have the power to change people whether you realize it or not, which is why I hope you never become what they claim you are.\"  She mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't, promise of a life time.\"  He swore \"And when I promise something I keep it for life.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A rare trait, but a good one.\"  She smiled warmly.  They chatted and enjoyed each other's company for a while longer before they paid for <br>\r\ntheir meal and headed back to the apartment.  As they were walking Kurotsuchi began talking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say...Naruto?\"  She began blushing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"  He answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was hoping....we can....kiss?\"  She blushed harder ask she asked that.  \"I already asked your girlfriends if I could and they gave me permission, but if you don't want to...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would be more than happy to.\"  He replied happily.  She smiled back at him, as the two leaned in to kiss one another.  The kiss lasted a bit before they backed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That...was wonderful.\"  She sighed happily \"It was also my first one, I could think of no better person to give my first kiss to than you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I'm flattered.\" He replied with his own blush.  \"Come on, let's head back.\"  He extended his arm, which she happily wrapped hers around and held him close with a content look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two walked back with peaceful looks on their faces to their apartment.  Upon arrival they were greeted by the other three who had nothing but smiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems like you two had fun.\"  Tenten teased a bit.  Earning blushes from the two in question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Glad to see you see you two are back, we were just about to try on some....outfits you'd might like for our date.\"  Mikoto said with a wink.  \"We'll let you two rest while we head upstairs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See you soon Master.\"  Hinata coyly added as the three head up, leaving the two teens to themselves.</span></div></div>",

Opening his door she was delighted to see him glued to her figure and liking what he saw.  She was satisfied that she can get this reaction out of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm here Master.\"  She cooed with joy before slowly approaching him, once she was near him she lightly scratched his chin and had a seductive look on her face.  The blonde smiled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look beautiful Mikoto.\"  He complimented, earning a blush from the older woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Master, but I think you'll like my new attire even better.\" She smirked and began undressing in front of him very slowly and swaying her hips to make this enjoyable.  Naruto couldn't take his eyes away as one of his three girlfriends gave him a spectacle as she was becoming naked for him.  Soon enough her nightgown and underwear came off and Naruto appreciated the beautiful nude form of one of the three girls he loves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're right, I do like it better.\"  He said coyly, this caused Mikoto to purr at him and crawl towards him on top of his bed and kissed him which he happily returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clothes, off.\"  She instructed and Naruto was all to happy to obey her.   He slowly removed his own attire until he became just as naked as her.  Mikoto had a look of appreciation at this.  \"Much better.\"  She kissed him once more as she lightly grabbed his manhood and began lightly rubbing it.  This earned him a groan as he went for her breasts to return the favour, this caused the older woman to coo in appreciation happily receiving treatment from the one she loves. </span></div></div>",

The two sat in silence before she began again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto...back when I still had no memory I accidentally found this scroll that said Living Puppet Seal.\"  She began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry for not mentioning it sooner, it's not something we'd like to talk about.\"  Naruto apologized but she waved it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I was a stranger and an ex enemy and people finding out about it would be really bad.\"  She smiled once more \"I just want to know...what's it like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's something you'll have to ask the others but from what they told me they seem fine with it, believe me if there was a way to undo it I would, they are my future wives, my most precious people.\"  He stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It must be hard to resist the temptation of controlling them.\" She wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not as hard as you think, I swore I'd never do that and I kept that promise.\"  He mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doesn't surprise me.\"  She praised, earning a smile from him.  \"Say...Naruto.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"  He asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that I'm going to be your wife, I was wondering.\"</span></div></div>",

Upon arrival they took a gander at all the teams were there, there were groups they didn't recognize and of course their fellow Konoha ninjas.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTeam seven narually went to chat with who they recognized as supposed to the ones they didn't however Naruto had the feeling someone was watching him, turning to where he sensed it he noticed a red haired boy with an kanji on the left side of his head glared at him with interest, for some reason this caused him to go on edge.  There was just something about him that screamed trouble.  Shrugging it off for now he chatted with his friends Kiba and Shikamaru while Tenten and Hinata and Tenten were beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn Naruto, I heard the Hokage inducted you into the CRA but I didn't know you worked that fast!\"  Kiba chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiba!\"  Hinata warned with a glare silencing him.

Take care.\"  He said with a creepy smile and left.

Beside her is a boy with green spandix and black hair with a grin on his face and the other had a deep scowl. He had black hair and the same clear white eyes Hinata has, making him a Hyuga.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ami.\"  Yakumo spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suggest you give up now weak girl, your genjutsu tricks are useless against me and you know it.\"  Ami scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yosh, there is no need for rudeness.\"  The boy in green mentioned \"I am Lee, proud student of Might Guy, may the flames of youth burn in all of you!\"  He added that last part with a 'nice guy' pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile the Hyuga boy was glaring at Hinata, but she wouldn't cower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neji.\" She began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So the failure exile is here, fate has granted me the opportunity to deal with you.\"  He began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not your enemy, my clan wants nothing to do with me anymore.  Stop this pointless hatred.\"  She begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your current status means to me, fate has decreed you answer for what has transpired.\"  He spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't my fault, I was three years old, what was I supposed to do?!\"  She yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I care nothing for excuses, if fate is kind to you, you will not encounter me.\"  He scoffed and said no more.  Hinata looked sadden by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go, I rather not catch loser.\" Ami chuckled, Lee looked saddened himself but left dejectedly with his teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bitch.\"  Tenten muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neji.\"  Hinata somberly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata, if you'd like to talk about it.\"  Naruto offered but she shook her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, but I need to handle this myself.\"  She assured him, he looked unsure but respected her wishes and nodded.

The boy in question gave no reaction but kept staring at Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, he sounds dangerous.\" Ch\u014dji admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saskue can crush him easily, right Saskue?!\"  Sakura gushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up Sakura.\"  Saskue ignored her and she looked crestfallen at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you know these are legit, is there anyone else you want to know about?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That blonde haired boy, tell me about him.\"  Gaara said in an eerie tone, pointing at Naruto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can ask me yourself.\"  Naruto told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can misinform me, I want to know everything.\"  He mentioned, Naruto wasn't sure how to feel about that but he wasn't wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourself.\"  Naruto replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well.\"  Kabuto began and pulled out another card.  He told most of the general knowledge about him but not everything that was S ranked like him having the Kyuubi, the Living Puppet Seal or about Mikoto.  He did state about his current marital status though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in the CRA, impossible!\"  Ino exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is, that I'm in the CRA or that I have future wives?\"  Naruto warned her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Choose your next words carefully Ino.\" Shikamaru advised, luckily she seemed to have a brain right now and said no more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that is all I'll be on my way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so fast!\"  A gruff voice stated, Kabuto turned to find three ninjas glaring at him.  One was wrapped in bandages and was hard to make him out, one had black hair and black eyes with a beige shirt with kanji's on them and the third member was a woman with black hair and black eyes.  All of them wore a headband with a music note on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\"  Kabuto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Dosu, I'm the leader of this team, this is Zaku and Kin.\"  He introduced \"We don't appreciate leaf scum like you giving out information like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now I'm sure we can...\"  Kabuto started but got no further as Zaku 'attacked' him, and he went flying back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Those three mean business.\"  Kiba mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let that be a warning to the rest of you, approach us at your own risk.\"  Dosu warned as him Zaku and Kin went back to where they were.  At that point a man wearing headgear on his skull with scars on his face and black eyes appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Attention, my name is Ibiki and I'll be your first proctor for the Chunin exam, you will all head to the room where you'll begin your first test.  That is all.\"  He said and went back to where the class room was.  They didn't need to be told twice as they all went to where the classroom is.</span></div></div>",

If they were caught cheating they automatically fail, of course that was the hidden meaning behind this test, to cheat without getting caught.  Most of them got kicked out due to cheating but the rest managed to find ways to do so.  Naruto having very few means to cheat was figuring out how to do this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Hmm, nothing I do is subtle enough and Hinata and Tenten are too far away to help without it being obvious.</i>  This was probably done on purpose but he saw them using their own means to cheat so they were fine.  He saw a man wearing makeup, he insisted it was warpaint excuse himself to go to the bathroom, and he caught Ino attempting to use her Mind Transfer Jutsu on Sakura.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I could trap Ino in my own mind and force her to cooperate provided you cooperate furball</i>  He mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>A waste of my time, but.....I don't have anything better to do and the idea of tormenting that mind walker amuses me.</i>  He heard Kyuubi chuckle, while they don't have a great relationship they don't have a terrible one either.  His tenant will help out when needed and in return Naruto will give it freedom and not draw any power without its consent.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a mutual understanding they had and nothing more and while Naruto wanted that to turn into friendship one day for now it'll have to do.  Another option he had was to 'use the bathroom' himself and have his shadow clones transform into people that can get him the info easily.  His final option was to wait it out and see what happens, it was risky but Naruto dared to take risks.  He thought about it for a while before making up his mind.</span></div></div>",

His timing was good too as she was just finishing possessing Sakura to see what she answered which made sense as the pink haired girl was deemed the smartest kunoichi in class and to her credit she backed it up on more than one occasion.  Naruto knew that he had to induct himself as just as smart if not smarted, cause her to doubt Sakura's answer and go with his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this in mind he went to write his exam and make it look like it was the easiest thing in the word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This test is easier than I thought, Chunin here I come.\" Naruto 'boasted' as he kept writing.  Ino with everyone else caught that, most of them ignored him but Ino was flabbergasted and turned to face him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>That's right Ino, take the bait.</i> Naruto inwardly chuckled as he kept his act up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno didn't know what to think, first she found out he was in the CRA and now this.  This was a different Naruto, leagues from the one from the academy, she didn't know what to think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>No, this can't be true he's an idiot, a loser, nothing compared to Saskue.</i>  Ino began musing. <i>He can't know the test, but....what if he does?</i>  Ino kept her inner monologue.  <i>Maybe....maybe I'll check just to prove to him and everyone else he'll never be anything other than a dead last....yeah, that's what I'll do.</i>  With her mind made up she began her signature Jutsu and started to transfer her mind into him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto felt her presence and began his plan and allowed himself to enter his mind before she took over.  Inside his mind he walked calmly and smugly towards his destination, upon arrival he did found what he hoped a terrified Ino eye to eye with his tenant, 'growling' at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W...what is that?!\"  Ino shrieked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My defense, a conjure of my mind to keep you here.\"  Naruto said behind her, with that the Kyuubi had her wrapped up with its tail and glowed, she tried to leave his mind but she couldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"L...let me go.\"  Ino cowered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relax I will....provided you tell me exactly what I want to know, the answers to the test.  Give them to me.\"  Naruto warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way.\"  Ino spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, stay here forever then, go my summon devour her.\"  Naruto ordered and went to leave.  Ino paled and shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait...okay I'll talk.\"  Ino pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good girl, now remember no lying to me or else.\"  Naruto cautioned.  Ino did just that telling him the truthful answers he wanted. Once he was satisfied he nodded \"Good, now I can do that test for real.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you mean you were faking?\"  Ino gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you fell for it, this is the life of a ninja Ino, keep up or be left behind.\"  Naruto advised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am skilled in my own right, you managing to trick me doesn't change that.\"  Ino spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, but it does mean you need a lot of work, rather than train and make yourself useful you diet, worry about trivial things and fawn over Saskue over everything else.  While I don't care what you do or who you have a crush on this effects your over all performance.\"  He explained.  Ino seemed to take that into consideration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you'd like I can help you, despite your personal feelings to me I'm willing to let you shine.\"  He offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, after everything I said and did.\"  Ino, asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's who I am Ino, I help my precious people no matter what.\"  He said without hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you're one of the good ones Naruto.  Never lose that.\" Ino smiled \"Thank you, and sorry about everything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Use to it, as long as people get to see the real me and then judge accordingly I'm all good.  Also I'm sorry about this as well, I hope you understand it's nothing personal.\"  The Kyuubi released her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, it's like you said we do what we have to do.  I look forward to our training session when the time presents it self.\"  Ino mentioned before leaving his mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Save your thanks brat, I did this because I was bored.\"  Kyuubi mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you insist.\"  Naruto commented before leaving.  Kyuubi had a small smile on its face when he left. <i>Your plan may work after all Minato.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in the real word, Naruto began writing the test for real now that he had the answers.</span></div></div>",

The point of it as it turned out was to carry on the mission no matter what, which is the soul purpose of any ninja.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot everyone can be an infiltrator or information gatherer but a true ninja never abandons the mission, even if it means death.  With that revelation he brought it over to the second portion of the exam which introduced them to their next proctor Anko, a purple haired woman wearing some type of chain shirt.  She smiled with glee as she brought them to the Forest of Death and promised to cut the participants in half.  She grinned maliciously at them before starting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright brats listen up, this part of the exam is simple each team has one scroll either the Earth Scroll or the Heaven Scroll.  You're job is to get the opposing scroll you don't have and bring it to the designated building, do not open your scrolls until you reach the area or you'll fail.  Inside the forest anything goes and there will be a lot of nasty surprises waiting for you,  with that I will have you all sign a waver stating we are not responsible for anything that occurs inside the forest, up to and including death.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is killing allowed?\"  Gaara asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said anything goes, killing included which reminds me, if one of your teammates dies your team fails so either you all pass or you all don't, this is where you really get to put your teamwork into action, if this terrifies you feel free to drop out now.\"  Anko smirked.  Some of the people did but most stuck around, Naruto was looking bored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, yeah, can we get on with this?\"  Naruto asked, Anko smirked and went behind him with a kunai drawn to his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cheeky brat aren't you, it's people like you that die first.\"  She licked his cheek and pressed her weapon close to him to cut him finding it to poof out of existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe.\"  He started as she felt his weapon on her cheek \"But I welcome the challenge, and I don't plan to lose.\"  Anko laughed at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like you brat, what's your name?\"  She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, nice to meet you Anko sensei.\"  He introduced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just Anko, the sensei life isn't for me, you have a promising future kid, but.\"  She melted into a pile of snakes as he found himself in her headlock with her weapon drawn to him \"Don't let it get to your head.\"  She winked at him and let him go.  She turned to the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright brats we'll start in a few minutes once you signed your wavers make any necessary preparations you can, you'll need everything you can think of.\"  She started.  All of them nodded as they began their preparations and signed their wavers.  Naruto, Hinata and Tenten got themselves ready and saw they had the Earth Scroll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was that necessary Master?\"  Hinata quietly asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not, but you know me.\"  Naruto admitted, Tenten  looked amused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Always need to make a spectacle, let's hope it doesn't draw unwanted attention.\"  Tenten smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be fine if one of them has the Heaven Scroll.\"  Naruto assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I just hope that red head doesn't find us.\"  Hinata sounded worried \"He seems interested in you, and not in the good way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, but I have the feeling if anyone can handle him, I can.\"  Naruto replied \"At least I hope.\"  As though if it was on cue said read head was there and glaring at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I help you?\" Naruto asked.  Gaara smirked with killing intent in mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother wants your blood.\"  He stated and left.  Naruto couldn't help but shiver at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If our brother has you in his sights you're a dead man.\"  Naruto turned to that voice to find the makeup wearing man from earlier and a blonde busty woman carrying a fan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Word of advice, run from our brother.\"  She warned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about introducing yourselves before taunting us?\"  Naruto demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Temari, this is Kankuro and this isn't a taunt it's a warning, one I really advice you to heed.\"  She mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How kind of you, but we'll be fine.\" Tenten growled at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suit yourselves, but when he kills you, don't come crying to me.\"  She scoffed as she left with her brother.  They didn't have time to ponder on that as Anko started again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright brats, the next part of the Exam begins....now!\"  She started and everyone entered the forest determined to pass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Naruto glared at him for that insult he was so lucky Mikoto was his mother or he'd kill him for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see reasoning is beyond you, guess I'm going to have to stop you the hard way.\"  Naruto mentioned<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need help?\"  Tenten asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he's mine, even if he didn't insult you this is between him and me.\"  He mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You think a dead last loser like you can beat me, don't make me laugh!\"  He spat and charged him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sasuke!\"  Sakura groaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you still defending him, after he threw a kunai at you?\"  Shikamaru asked as he bandaged her arm up to stop the bleeding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He...he's not himself, that man....Orochimaru he did this to him when he showed up, defeated us and bit his neck giving him a mark.\"  She explained<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're unbelievable, this is who he truly is, it's time to accept that.\"  He mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N...no.\" Sakura muttered, and got up \"He'll listen to me, I know he will.\"  She rushed to stop him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Troublesome woman.\" He muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Naruto and Saskue were fighting, both evenly matched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give up yet teme?\"  Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck you dobe, you are not my equal, you are beneath me, like everyone else is!\"  He shouted and charged him again.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Saskue stop please!\"  Sakura begged and stood in their way, Naruto stopped and Saskue too briefly. \"I know you're in there somewhere, you don't want to...guh!!\"  She said no more as she felt herself get stabbed once more this time in the chest, Sakura coughed up a bit of blood and fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sakura, no!\"  Ino controlling Kin shouted and undid her Jutsu, Ino in her own body rushed to her and healed her as best as she could.  Kin meanwhile woke up but didn't move as Shikamaru grabbed her with his Shadow Possession technique.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You make me sick Saskue, if only your parents would see you now.\"  Naruto sighed, knowing Mikoto won't like hearing this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not talk about my family you worthless orphan!!\" He growled \"A loser with no family cannot possibly understand how I feel!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I pity you, I really do.\"  Naruto sighed once more. \"Time to wake you up to reality.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Words along can't express my regret and I hope we can be friends again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you even need to ask, plus I did the same thing so if you forgive me as well we can call it even.\"  Ino smiled causing her to smile back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, I didn't even hate you, not really.  I wanted to impress Sasuke and mom said you were a demon and I needed to stay away from you, I can see she's wrong.\"  She mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did she now?\"  Naruto glared at that \"Sakura how would you like to live with us for a while?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, why?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mother broke a very serious law, one that will most likely get her killed.\"  He confessed, her eyes widened a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't understand, is there no way around this?\"  She begged not wanting her to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll do my best to appeal imprisonment but regardless of what happens to her she has a crime she needs to answer for.\"  He assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did she do?\"  She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is something I'll explain later, for right now though will you take me up on my offer, at least until this gets settled?\"  He asked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't understand but you saved my life and helped me when you didn't need to, I'll trust you on this.  Besides it gives me a chance to truly get to know you and hopefully we have a good relationship this time.\" She replied with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good.\" He replied, he turned to his girlfriends \"Sorry about this but.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine, I understand.\"  Hinata assured with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll need to explain this to Naomi as well, and more.\" Tenten added looking at Sasuke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At any rate we need to bring him to the Hokage, her too.\"  Naruto commented pointing to Kin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, follow me.\"  Shikamaru mentioned as he walked with his time, Kin being forced to follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good luck passing.\"  Hinata shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You too.\"  Ino replied as they left sight, Sai got up and smiled his creepy smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I woke up in time to assess the situation, I'll take Sasuke and deliver him to the Hokage.\"  He promised, Sakura weakly got up but managed to keep up with them leaving team seven to themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come, we have an Exam to pass.\" Naruto mentioned, the two nodded and they went to go to their destination.</span></div></div>",

She was told everything too, she was proud of her Master for taking care of Sakura and understood why he invited her in, she was disgusted and saddened by her son's actions and she was angry at the arrival of Orochimaru.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First in regards to Orochimaru, I want you all to leave him to me and focus on the Exam tell no one of what you reported.\"  Hiruzen started \"In the regards of Sakura's mother, I'm afraid she does indeed have to answer for her crime by breaking my law however I'll give her a lighter sentence per Naruto's request.\"  He paused, this earned a sigh of relief from Sakura who was doing better now but still felt the pain of Sasuke's stab, both figuratively and literally.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I also approve of Sakura living with Team Seven for the time being and depending on what happens this might be a permanent thing.  Should Mrs. Haruno behave herself and remember to respect my wishes then I'll let her go, if not she'll stay longer but should she seek revenge, I'm afraid her death is certain.\"  He said with a sigh, Sakura look a bit sad at that but nodded, she was told everything by Naruto per his request and now she understood everyone's treatment for him, this made her sick to her stomach that she treated him so poorly and practically begged for his forgiveness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMuch to her surprise, he waved it off, but she refused to let it end like that and vowed to him she'll make up for everything and took no for an answer.

The contestants that were left drew numbers to see who they were going to fight one month from now in the bigger stadium where there will be many people watching them.  Naruto recalled all the fights that happened as he was heading to the interrogation room and who drew what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShino fought Neji and after a hard fought match, Neji prevailed.  Temari made short work of Ino, Ch\u014dji was mismatched against Yakumo and succumed to her powerful Genjutsu's, Shikamaru made quick work of one of Kabuto's teammates trapping him in his shadow possession technique while knocking him out.  The other one fared worse and had a draw with his opponent eliminating them both.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce they drew numbers the matches were as followed, Naruto was fighting Gaara, Hinata has to fight her own cousin Neji, Tenten had the task of trying to deal with Temari and her long range combat and Shikamaru had to fight Yakumo.  He sighed at knowing he'll deal with the red head sooner rather than later, but he had a month to prepare and he'll use that time wisely.  In the meantime he headed towards the interrogation room where Ibiki was waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Hokage told me you were coming.\"  He mentioned letting him in \"I don't know how you plan to make her crack when I couldn't get a word out of her but good luck.\"  He nodded as he entered the room as Ibiki closed the door.  Kin was there with a neutral expression, chained up and her chakra sealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't care how many you leaf scum send, I won't say a damn thing.\"  Kin spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you resist?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What you plan to do to me is nothing compared to what Lord Orochimaru would have in store if he found out i squealed.\"  She mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You honestly think he cares, he'd of rescued you by now wouldn't he?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Spare me your lies, he'll come, I'm valuable to him.\"  Kin insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your failure to cooperate will put you in a position you won't like.\"  He warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do your worst, I was trained to resist all types of torture and interrogation tactics, ask your friend outside.\"  Kin scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not what I had in mind.\"  He began. \"Are you familiar with the Living Puppet Seal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Orochimaru mentioned that, he wanted his hands on it but couldn't find it.  Why do you.\"  She trailed and her eyes widened \"No, you couldn't have!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did, and I have.\"  He mentioned \"I know that technique and I will not hesitate to apply it on you if I have to, but you can be spared of this fate if you tell me exactly what I need to know.  Your choice.\"  Kin weighed her options before answering.</span></div></div>",

His eyes widened, he knew Suna and Konoha were allies for a long time, predating the third war.  For them to betray the leaf was surreal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, why betray us?!\"  he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They are unhappy with your village taking all the missions and profit, leaving them with nothing.\"  She told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was your role?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All I was told after that was to test Sasuke's power, I don't know much else, he didn't trust that information to my team and I in case we got caught.\"  She admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So he used you for as a guinea pig, didn't even sound like he cared if you died.\"  He shook his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's the life of the ninja, we live and die for our village.\"  She mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like tools?\"  He brought up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose you can use that term, yes.\"  She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It doesn't make it right.\"  His eyes narrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe not, but it is what it is.\"  Kin answered \"So what becomes of me now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll live with me, now that your bound to me you're a non threat and gramps will grant your release, I can convince him to do so.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, I should die.\"  Kin was baffled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not my style, you were doing your job no need to kill you for that.\"  He explained she blinked a few times before smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're weird, but you have a good heart.\"  Kin said \"What's your name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Naruto, yours?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kin, it's nice to meet you Master.\"  She replied, her eyes widened at the last part \"You weren't kidding about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, but you'll get use to it.\"  He told her \"Come, I'll go inform gramps of my intention then I'll introduce you to the others.\"  He untied her and undid her chakra suppression devise and held his hand out.

She was surprised but was grateful at their generosity and made herself at home and found herself forming friendships with the others, Sasuke was still in the ward being assessed to with no signs of change as of yet but Mikoto was still hopeful.  Sakura officially moved in with Naruto as her mother was still behind bars for her crimes, refusing to see Naruto anything else but a demon, she sighed sadly at this.  She missed father too but Naruto wasn't to blame for that, maybe one day she'll see it too.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was happily cleaning his apartment with Kurotsuchi, both of them in maid outfits, Kin thought about joining them, but Naruto talked her out of it with a heavy blush earning giggles from his future wives, Sakura and Kin herself revealing her jest to him.  Of course none of them were idle, they trained hard to prepare for their opponents and now here they were in the arena outside.  Waiting for the proctor to show up, however it wasn't Hayate but someone else.  He wore a bandanna like hedgear and had brown eyes and matching hair, in his mouth is a toothpick which he took out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello everyone, I'm Genma Shiranui, I'll take over for Hayate from hear on out.\"  He mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to Hayate?\"  Tenten asked, and he looked saddened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He was found dead this morning, killed by an unknown assailant.\"  He mentioned, a chilled silence filled the room.  Tenten was in tears and Naruto comforted her as best he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nooooo!\"  Y\u016bgao cried out as she started to burst into tears, she was helped up and escorted to a private room where she could mourn in peace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such as the life of a ninja, but we must carry on, after the Exam a funeral will be held for him.\"  Genma sadly mentioned, everyone present nodded somberly as this was the life they chose.  Mikoto in the stands went to find Y\u016bgao to see if she can help, knowing the pain of losing a loved one herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's do our best to not think about it, and focus on the Exam, Lord Hokage and Suna's Kazekage are watching as well as others, you're goal isn't to win but to impress and show you have what it takes to be Chunin.\"  Genma mentioned. \"You all know who you're facing so let's begin.  First up, Tenten vs Temari.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tenten?\"  Naruto asked, she flashed him an assuring smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be fine, I'll win this, for Hayate's sake!\"  She said determined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha, what a joke, if he trained you then you must be just as easy to take down if he died like a bitch.\"  Temari scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck did you say?!\"  Tenten growled  the rest of Konoha glared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tenten, she's trying to get under your skin.\"  Hinata mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's working, I'm going to tear her limb through limb!\"  She growled at took her spot, Temari looked unimpressed taking her spot<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How boring, time to be a disappointment for that worthless trash heap of a corpse.\"  She laughed taking a battle stance herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I see why your brother Gaara is messed up, he has an uncaring heartless bitch of a sister!\"  Tenten snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemari's eyes widened at that and growled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have no idea what he goes through.\"  She warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you care, I bet you were right there with them inflicting him with whatever he went through.\"  Tenten mentioned.

Temari made the motion to surrender, only to do a cheap shot and blow her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You cheating bitch!\"  Tenten snarled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're ninja's, the fight is never over until the opponent dies, you think your enemy will want to be captured, don't make me laugh.\"  Temari scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile on the rooftop Hiruzen and the 'Kazekage'  'Rasa' watched on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Temari has a point wouldn't you agree?\" 'Rasa' asked <i>Soon, it's only a matter of time</i> he thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't argue with that, many ninja fight to the death or kill themselves.\"  Hiruzen agreed <i>Thanks to Naruto's report I'm on to you, once you make your move I'll make mine.</i>  He thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile back tot he fight Temari had the advantage again, but Tenten with quick thinking had an idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me, how often do you beat up Garra?\"  She asked, Temari growled an sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\"  She yelled.  \"How dare you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, it's a legit question, with how cold you are you must of abused him, or stood by and did nothing, which is worse.\"  Tenten mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.\"  She paused \"I tried to be there for him, but the villagers.\"  She muttered.  Tenten now understood what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was he treated like a demon?\" She asked, Temari's eyes widened again but nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thought so, my future husband knows that all too well.\"  She mentioned glaring at the audience when saying that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\" Temari chuckled \"Can your future husband save him?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If anyone can do it, he can.\"  Tenten assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doubt it, but it's worth a shot.\"  Temari mentioned \"Anything to save my brother.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell him to do that then. not that I need to, he'd do it anyways.\"  Tenten assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Temari said \"Sorry about what I said earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apology accepted, I'm sorry too.\"  Tenten said back, \"Shall we keep going?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that won't be necessary, I lost already, I just didn't realize it yet.\"  Temari admitted \"proctor I forfeit.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Got it, Winner Tenten.\"  Genma shouted, the two of them nodded and went back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGaara looked angry at her but she didn't care, she just hoped when the invasion happened Tenten can keep true to her word.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With that match out of the way I'll call the next set of fighters.  Hinata, Neji you're up.\"  Genma called out<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fate has finally granted me this fight.\" Neji snarled, Hinata said nothing and arrived in the arena as Neji did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give up now, fate has declared you'll lose.\"  Neji spat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still filled with unnecessary hatred, your father's death wasn't my fault.\"  Hinata said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough of your lies, it's your fault he's dead and now you'll pay!!\" Neji growled not interested in what she has to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was trying to make things better for you but you insist on thinking you're bound to this mystical force and can't change things, but I see words will not sway you.\"  Hinata got into her battle pose. \"So action will have to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fate is on my side, you will not win, I will have my revenge.\"  Neji spat and got into his battle stance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready?\"  Genma asked \"Begin!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ash, Brock, and Dawn were ready to part ways, Ash to Pallet Town, Brock to become a Pok'mon doctor, and Dawn to prepare for becoming a Pok'mon fashion designer. Piplup had really taken it hard, as he and Pikachu had formed a bond during their trainers' journeys, and saw each other as brothers, not to say that the trainers wanted to actually part ways. Piplup and Pikachu were in a forest with Ash, the two Pok'mon playing a game before they'd have to part, when Piplup tripped over something and face-planted. Piplup got up and dusted himself off, then checked the ground to see what he tripped over. He saw something partially buried underground, and began trying to dig it up. Ash and Pikachu came over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What'cha got there, Piplup?\" Ash asked as he and Pikachu helped dig it up. The object turned out to be a box with something inside. Ash opened the box to see... \"Dolls? Darn, I was hoping it would be something neat.\" He said as he took out one of the dolls. Even for people who liked dolls, there would probably be a similar response, as these dolls were completely blank, no faces, whether bad or not, or clothes, just pure white. The box was filled with them, and strangely, even though he took one out, it still looked completely filled up. Suddenly the three heard someone coming and turned around. Dawn stepped into the clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are, I've been looking for you guys.\" Dawn said, before noticing that Ash was holding something. \"What's that?\" She motioned towards the doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just some doll I found.\" Ash replied, holding it up. \"There's nothing special... about...it.\" Ash continued, but was surprised by the end of it, since as soon as Dawn made eye contact with where the face of the doll would be, she got a faraway look on her face, and the doll shifted to look exactly like her, clothes and all. Dawn fell to the ground on her back, strangely not even making so much as a thud as she hit the ground. She just lied there, not moving an inch, not even appearing to breathe, as she stared up, her eyes blank. \"Dawn!\" Ash cried out as he and the Pok'mon ran towards her. Ash lifted her to a sitting position, noting that she felt next to weightless. \"Come on Dawn, snap out of it!\" Ash called out as he began shaking her. He dropped the doll, which landed on Dawn's leg, and to the surprise of Ash and the two Pok'mon, the doll sunk into Dawn's body. Dawn's eyes cleared up as she began blinking. \"Dawn! Are you alright!?\" Ash asked. Dawn turned to him and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No need to worry, master!\" She replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good, I was...\" Ash began before his eyes went wide. \"Did you just call me master?\" Dawn gave a cheerful nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, since I'm your doll now, that makes you my owner, would you like me to call you something else?\" Dawn replied, a happy smile still on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, my doll? What's going on?\" Ash asked, tilting his head in confusion. \"Also, just call me Ash, like usual.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Ash, I'll explain. That box you found is an ancient and magical artifact.\" Dawn begins. \"It creates an infinite supply of blank dolls. The first male to touch the box is the owner. If the owner holds up a blank doll to a girl and has her make eye contact with the spot its face should be, the doll turns into a likeness of the girl, and the girl's body becomes a lifeless doll. However, if the doll is placed on the girl's body, the girl regains life, as the doll of the owner of the box.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, how do you know this?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The spell of the dolls gives the girl transformed into a doll all of this knowledge.\" Dawn replied simply. \"Moving on, as a doll, all I can want on my own is for my owner, I.E. you, to play with me, otherwise, I can't want anything unless you want me to want it. Also, I no longer have bones or any of my non-reproductive organs, my status as a doll means that I don't need them, and my knowledge isn't contained in my brain anymore, but in my whole body, which is lucky since I don't a brain is one of the organs that I no longer have. I also don't need to eat, can make myself as heavy or light as needed, and be posed in any position that you want me to be posed in. Everyone who wasn't with you when you became owner of the box will see any girl being your doll as normal, and anyone who knew one of your old dolls will automatically know that they are a doll. I don't feel pain, and you can put me in a \"sleep mode,\" which makes it so that my consciousness shuts down, and I will be unaware of anything you do, or of any amount of time passing. You can also communicate with any of your living dolls mentally, so you don't have to speak your commands if you don't want to. Also, you can keep me from being pregnant if you want, and you can have me age at the same rate as you or not age at all if you want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a lot.\" Ash said in awe, the box's magic giving him all of the knowledge of terms used in the description that he didn't know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's one more thing, you can directly take over one of your living dolls, controlling it as if it is your own.\" Dawn explained. \"The only sign of this is that their eye color is replaced with yours, for example, if you took over my body, my eyes would go from blue to brown while you would be in control.\" One thing hidden from Dawn so that she couldn't prepare Ash for it is that the owner would suddenly have the subconscious desire to increase his collection of dolls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Dawn, what are you going to do about being a fashion designer?\" Ash asked, curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As I have no desires of my own, I have no interest in it, and only wish to accompany you.\" Dawn said simply. \"If you'll allow it, that is.\" Ash nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I will, I'll be glad to have you come along with me!\" Ash said excitedly. Dawn gave a joyful expression at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

After all that, the students were looking forward was looking forward to some quiet time before the hustle and bustle of school life began again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that very moment Jaden was seated under a tree near the Slifer dorm. He had just returned from the island's card shop and used a lot of the DP he'd earned during the GX tournament to purchase a dozen booster packs, Industrial Illusions had recently released a new line of Elemental Heroes and he was eager to pick them up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWasting no time he cracked them open and began going over what he had acquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ok let's see, got...got...need...got...need...got...got...got...need...Ohh Elemental Hero Gaia...' He thought. This went on for a few minutes, and he finally the last packet and was inspecting the cards when one of them caught his eye, picking it up he found it was a spell card called The Doll Maker. From what he could gather the card could take control of an opponent and allow him to use them in conjunction with his Elemental Hero's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Take control of my opponent? Must be a typo.' Jaden thought, however if he could take control of his opponent's monsters and use them in conjunction with his Elemental Hero's, then this card might come in real handy so he slipped it into his deck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jaden!\" Hearing his name, Jaden looked round and saw Alexis heading towards him<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Alexis, how's it going?\" The hero duelist asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'm glad that the tournament and that the whole thing with the Society of Light is over. I'm looking forward to some peace and quiet for a while.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess.\" Jaden replied, just then a thought occurred to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will Jaden do?</span></div></div>",

Neither one of them was going easy on the other. Soon they were both down to their last 500 lifepoints Alexis had her Cyber Prima on their field and Jaden his Flame Wingman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden made to drew his next card, if this wasn't a good one then the duel would be over. Seeing what he'd picked up and to his suprise he found it was his new Doll Maker spell card.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweet.\" Jaden said as he slid it into a slot of his spell/trap zone, \"Alexis you get to be the first to see my new spell card in action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon activation a demonic looking creature wearing a tool belt appeared on the field along with a block of wood, without wasting a second it got to work shaping the wooden block with its tools it it was left with a humaniode female like shape (although its purportions were pretty fantastical with its extreme hour glass figure with a tiny waist and huge ass and boobs).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe creature then snapped its fingers and a red aura appeared around Alexis which then flew over to the wooden figure which took on Alexi's features and her hair appeared on its head. Looking satisfied the demon reached into its tool belt and took out a large-ish key which it plugged into a slot into the wooden figures back and gave it a few turns before vanishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" Jaden said in suprise, just then he noticed a second monster card on his duel disk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElemental Doll Alexis<br>\r\nATK: 600/DEF: 600/Level: 2/Attribute: Fire/Type:Warrior/Effect<br>\r\nThis card may be used as tribute material when used in a fusion summon to create a fusion monster with \"Elemental Hero\" in its title. A fuison monster summoned using this card as fusion material gains 600 ATK points.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Wow that weird.' Jaden thought, he then took the Polymerization in his hand and fused his 2 monsters together to create E-Hero Shining Flare Wingman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA single blast from the shining hero brought the duel to an end resulting in the brunette's victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthe holograms vanished and Jaden was about to talk to Alexis when he discovered that she was standing there stiffly staring at him and not moving and her eyes were blank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJaden ran over to her and to his horror he found a key sticking out of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat will he do next?</span></div></div>",

That was the world that Rangiku Matsumoto lived in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite being the Lieutenant of one of the Gotei 13 she was not immune to serving a tour in the 'World of the Living', she'd dispatched along with another Shinigami, Rukia Kuchiki, to eliminate this town of Hollows however she had lost contact with her some time ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting back to the story Rangiku had just dispatched of another Hollow when the sound of applause caught her attention, \u201cBravo, bravo. Quite the show.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over his shoulder and saw a figure dressed in a long white cloak and a hat. \u201cWho the heck are you?\u201d she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not important, just think of me as a fan.\u201d The person replied, \u201cAnd I must say my dear that was quite a wonderful display.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe figure then flicked his wrist and from his large sleeve a long staff emerged from it, \u201cHowever let\u2019s sees how you fair against me, I\u2019m curious to see how I fair against a Shinigami.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHa, you\u2019re pretty cocky. I don\u2019t know what you are but this will be a very short fight.\u201d Rangiku replied as she readied her zanpakto.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them clashed, the figure using his staff to block each of Rangiku\u2019s attacks as well as us it to cast various spells.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWha..what the hell are you?\u201d Rangiku demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh me, I believe the tongue of this world I am a chaos mage.\u201d The person replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA chaos what?\u201d Rangiku asked a confused tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut enough about me, I believe it\u2019s time we brought this contest to an end.\u201d The figure replied, \u201cYou\u2019ve been a fine opponent, however, victory is mine.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Rangiku shot back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mage pointed his staff at the buxom Shinigami and it began giving a strange looking glow whilst at the same time he was saying some kind of chant. Just then a strange bolt of energy struck Rangiku in the chest which knocked her to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she lay there a burning sensation spread across Rangiku\u2019s body. When she tried to move, she found that she couldn\u2019t. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 These were Rangiku\u2019s final thoughts, it was getting harder for her to think, and no matter how hard she tried, she couldn\u2019t get her body to move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mage looked over her, \u201cI hope you like your new life, albeit you really have no say in the matter. I\u2019m sure the guy who finds you will take care of you.\u201d With that, he walked off. \u201cSeriously, the things I do to get these damn plots started.\u201d He said before vanishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few seconds later two people arrived on the scene, the pair being none other than Rukia Kuchki and the human turned substitute Shinigami Ichigo Kurosaki.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe're here, so where\u2019s the damn Hollow?\u201d Ichigo asked his companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t seem to pick up any kind a trace of it.\u201d Rukia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then\u2026</span></div></div>",

She reaches inside herself trying to find what is causing this, but she can't grab anything and can't find anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh decides to have a little fun before moving all the way in. He starts to massage Misty's clit with the water, and he moves in and out, fucking her with the water. She starts to swim to the shore, hoping that getting out of the water might stop this, but before she can make it, she is overcome by pleasure from Ash. Ash continues to fuck Misty with the water. By now, she has given up trying to grab him, and all she can do is ride the waves of pleasure, floating helplessly. Just as she is orgasming, Ash shoves himself all the way in, giving Misty explosive pleasure, and the most amazing orgasm ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh begins to take hold of Misty's body, gaining control, and enjoying the afterglow of the orgasm. She then starts to swim back to shore, realizing how different it feels to be a girl rather than a boy. She also notices something weird between her legs, and when she reaches down, she realizes that she (the liquid her) accidentally pulled the bottom piece of Misty's suit into her. Ash walks up out of the water, and on the shore, she squats down, and pulls the half exposed suit out of her. The pleasure of the sensation of the fabric sliding out of her is too much. Ash collapses with pleasure, and enjoys another orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Choice 1: Ash decides to keep Misty's body and have some fun with it, or do something else with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Choice 2: The pleasure overcomes Ash, and the orgasm forces part of him out. Ash can reform himself with that part, making him in Misty's body and in his.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"You sure about this? Something seems kinda off about this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuji looked across at his fellow deliveryman \"Look, the shipping manifest says we deliver it here, so we deliver it here. I don't see what's so complicated about that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuji sighed. Of all the people he could get saddled with, it had to be Masahiro; the guy was the least popular person in the entire company and completely anal about going by the book. From the moment he'd read the shipping manifest, he knew that even if he had questions Masahiro would disregard any possible problems that might keep him from making the delivery as specified. The man was a colossal prick!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing again, he helped his friend unload the larger boxes which contained fertilizer and potting soil and a few other things as well as the strange wooden crate that was to be delivered to the Koryou High School Gardening Club.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter asking a few students for directions, they finally ended up at the greenhouse. Upon entering, they were greeted by a young student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you a member of the Gardening Club of Koryou High?\" Mashiro asked formally. Suji sighed; this guy was always on the clock, always no-nonsense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure am! I guess these are the supplies we ordered?\" he asked, looking over the sheet at the items being delivered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what the manifest says, that's what's there\" Masahiro replied, drawing a sharp look from his colleague at his complete lack of social skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenichi blinked for a moment before flicking through the manifest to make sure everything was accounted for. He stopped at the final entry. \"What's with this plant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMasahiro, once again the master of tact, replied \"I don't know; I just deliver what's on the manifest. Maybe someone else in your club ordered it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKenichi shrugged. '<i>Maybe Izumi put an order in for it and didn't tell me?</i>' he wondered. '<i>Hope it doesn't affect the club's budget too much, it's stretched thin as it is!</i>'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was going to be coming later, so he'd ask her then. Not that it was a problem or anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the deliverymen left he began arranging and sorting out everything, putting the potting soil along with the others by the wall in the shade and the fertilizer in the locked room at the back. When everything was done he moved on to the strange looking wooden box. Using a nearby trowel he levered the box open and peered inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't sure what to expect, but not this. The plant seemed to be a group of stems that extended from a raised bulbous base covered in very long, fine hairs. Though the flowers were unusual, they looked almost like an open shark's mouth with petals coloured in a pattern of blues, purples and yellows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed a note enclosed with the plant in the box. Simple instructions, the plant seemed to be pretty adaptable; all it needed was simple repotting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNearly half an hour later the potting was done, but he couldn't help but stare searchingly at the plant. He couldn't explain it, but it just seemed so...interesting!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leaned in close to look at the flower, it seemed so attractive suddenly. Absently he reached his hand out to brush the hairs on the bulbous base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo sooner had he touched them than the flowers moved, almost as if they were rearing away from him...only to reel back as the plant fired a cloud of...pollen?...straight into his face. Coughing, he quickly began wiping at his face. He remembered that there was a shower in one of the rooms in back of the place, it being a converted building.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuffing in frustration he quickly walked towards the shower as he silently groused over yet another thing going wrong today: Ragnarok's goons hunting him, forgetting his bento box with Miu's delicious cooking in it, falling asleep during an important lesson and now this. Not to mention that the shower only had cold water...he shuddered at that thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning on the water he stepped under the stream of water and shivered at the temperature as it hit his skin. But he realised quickly it wasn't just the temperature of the water; he felt his skin prickle, and he felt oddly...warm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe decided he'd rinsed enough to get the 'pollen' off and exited the shower. As he was toweling off, he felt his vision become hazy for a moment and he became unsteady on his feet. Regaining his equilibrium he finished drying himself and went to dress himself in his spare PE uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still felt tired, and wondered if he should visit the nurse or go straight back to Ryouzanpaku.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich option did he choose?</span></div></div>",

If you were a demon,but for the prinnies, the poor damned souls of men forced into servitude to their thankless masters. Being that they no longer have bodies of their own anymore, they are sown into bodies that resemble rag doll like penguin with bat wings and peg legs. Made to work hard while the demons lazy about and are barely paid for their efforts, if at all. It is a sad life to be a Prinny...... Until now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithin the Castle of the Demon Lord Etna, a Prinny was carrying a basket full of recently cleaned clothes. His main job here was to make sure that Lady Etna's laundry nice and clean for his mistress. He was walking down a corridor to take these clean cloths to get iron and fold, by another group of prinnies, we hears a boom yell of pure anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WWWWHHHHEEERRRREEEE AAAAARRRREEE YYYYYYOOOOOUUUU!!!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a chill down his spine as he turns to see Etna racing down the corridor with a massive axe and a face twisted in rage! She addressed the Prinny, \" YYYYOOOUUUU!!!!!! DON'T YOU DARE MOVE!\" The Prinny stops in his tricks, now breaking out in a cold sweat as Etna stops infront of him, with a look on her face they would make even death scared. \" W-w-what can I d-do for you, my lady..... Dood.\" Etna thrust a pair of pink panties in front of him. \" Tell me Prinny........ What. Are. These?\" The Prinny is nearly mute with fear, but still answers. \" I think......they're panties.... \" Etna quickly cuts him off, \" YES! MY PANTIES! CARE TO GUESS WHERE I FOUND THEM!!!!!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point the Prinny know he was dead. She had found his secret stash that he had hidden. He had to say something, something. \"Aw-well, mistress, I, um, it's my job to do, eh, the laundry... So...... Um, dood, um.....OH PLEASE FORGIVE ME, LADY ETNA!\" He couldn't think of anything beyond begging for his life, maybe by some Miracle she would be merciful, when the netherworld freezes over. He dropped down, bowing over the basket of clothes with his head down, asking for forgiveness, for mercy! Eyes closed tight to hold back the tears, awaiting whatever fate she came up with. \" Mercy? Alright, I will be merciful. You go..... \" The Prinny nearly couldn't believe this, was she seriously doing this. He started to lifted his head up, teary eyed, ready to thank her from the bottom of his heart. \" Oh thank you lady et-\" his words were cut off, as everything went black. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext thing he knows, everything was black. He felt strange, stranger than usual. He could not really tell were he was, but it felt like he was felt..... Buried and crushed. \" Oh lord dood! Have I been buried in the ground, did she bury me? Oh lord dood, am I DEAD! ......Oh wait, I am already dead, but what happened?!\" As he tried to move around he couldn't even do that. He then felt a sudden shock and hears the sound of an explosion. Above him he hears a faint chuckle,  \" Yeah, you can go.... Through a wall. Dang, pervert prinny.\" That was the voice of Lady Etna..... And that pervert was him..... But wait, he was okay. He wasn't hit into a wall nor did he explode. So what happened to him. He then heard Etna's muffled groan, \"That stupid prinny's explosion got my outfit dirty. Great......... Atleast he had some clean clothes ready.\" The Prinny start to feel himself shuffled around, as off whatever t<br>\r\nWas burying him was being moved around. Then, a blinding light as he felt himself left upward, to facing Etna. \" Hmmm, I guess this will do.\" With that he know exactly what had happened. She had hit with her axe, in fact she hit him so hard that his soul had been knocked out of his body and into the basket of clothes. \" OMDG dood. I am in clothes!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich outfit is he in?</span></div></div>",

However...\" Omega trailed off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Megaman asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Its kind of like an enhanced brotherband, which relies on Luna's love. Plus side: she wont fall out of love with you, even as Geo, but on here's the bad side: Ophiuca and her will both be affected.\" Omega-Xis explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How would we explain that to our parents without blowing the whole thing up in our faces!\" Megaman shouted. When he noticed the odd look given to him by Omega-Xis he added. \"I mean without revealing you and my identity as Megaman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say that you found Luna on the street after the disturbance and it was a strange after effect.\" Omega-Xis suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaman face-faulted. \"That has to be one of the worst cover stories I've ever heard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You got any better ideas?\" Omega-Xis asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegaman sighed. \"Fine, how long will it take?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got it ready now.\" Omega-Xis replied, glowing gold \"Fire away.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\" Megaman said, aiming at Queen Ophiuca. \"Bondlinkband go!\" Both himself and Omega-Xis shouted in unison, firing off a continuous gold stream. As it hit Queen Ophiuca, both Megaman and Queen Ophiuca glowed gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the gold faded away, Queenn Ophiuca shook her head. \"What was that Megaman?\" Luna asked, before gasping in shock. \"Hey wait, how am I in control, that snake lady should be fighting me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My idea.\" Omega-Xis said. \"We'll explain later, first we should get out of here.\" He pointed out, the Satella police arriving on the scene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat do they do?</span></div></div>",

It was currently night time. Iris was asleep on a tree branch, with Axew sleeping in her hair, Cilan was sleeping in his sleeping bag, and Ash was awake in his sleeping bag, looking at the stars, with Pikachu sleeping on his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I miss them.\" Ash said to himself with a sigh. \"Brock is working on being a Pokemon Doctor, Max is studying under his father, and Tracey is enjoying working for Professor Oak, but I wish my female friends could still be with us. Misty is only stuck at her and her sisters' Gym since her sisters are so irresponsible, May is currently doing some contests, and Unova has no contests, and last I heard, Dawn was designing fashion clothes for Pokemon. I just wish they would be back, and that we could travel together forever...\" Ash said as he fell asleep. Unknown to Ash, however, his wish had been heard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Millennium Comet had been hit by a meteor, and knocked off course, returning to the view of the Pokemon World. Jirachi had been checking on his friends while the comet was there, and heard Ash's wish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ash has saved this world several times, he deserves some help with this.' Jirachi thought, before sending out a telepathic message to some other Legendaries who he believed could help. Before long, the Mew from the first movie, the Manaphy that saw May as his mother, as well as Azelf, Uxie, and Mespirit, were in a telepathic conversation with Jirachi, who had explained the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ash has saved the world several times, and went on to save Mewtwo from Giovanni.' Mew thought to the others, remember the help Ash brought to her son (the Mew from that movie seemed like a girl, and in the games, it says that Mew gave birth to Mewtwo).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I want Dada and Mama to be together again.' Manaphy thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Poor Ash... always having to part way with his friends.' Mespirit said, getting very emotional.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'We have to help him out.' Azelf said determinately, wishing to help out his chosen one. With them all in agreement, they set to work. Azelf, Mespirit, and Uxie created three sets of Red Chains, Mew created some jewels with her psychic powers, one red, one blue, and one pink, and unknown to Jirachi, made them able to teleport off of the girls and able to appear near other girls an hour after the change is permanent, which would take exactly 24 hours. The Red Chains and jewels were put together to make three necklaces. Manaphy used his heart based powers to make the necklaces connected to Ash's heart, so that the wearers would desire to serve Ash upon putting them on, wouldn't want to take them off until it was permanent, and that they would be able to track Ash down, no matter where he was, or how far away from him the wearers were. They also made it so only girls can be affected. The Millennium Comet was almost out of distance for Jirachi to communicate with the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wish you luck!' Jirachi thought, before the psychic link was cut off. Mew then proceeded to teleport the necklaces to Misty, May, and Dawn. Misty would get the one with the blue jewel since she loves the water, May the one with the red jewel because of her fondness for the color red (she had changed back into her original outfit not long after leaving Ash's group in Sinnoh), and Dawn got the pink one do to how girly she is.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty was sitting bored at the Cerulean Gym, waiting for challengers, and wishing her sisters were more responsible so that she could return to Ash and not worry about the Gym's reputation being ruined again. Unknown to Misty, Jirachi heard that thought before the comet was out of range, and told Mew about it. Suddenly, the necklace mentioned before appeared in Misty's hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? That's odd.\" She said, before feeling an overwhelming desire to wear the necklace. She put it on, and her green eyes became glazed over, the pupils vanishing altogether, as a single sentence repeatedly went through her head, drowning out all other coherent thought. 'Must find and serve Ash. Must find and serve Ash.' She thought repeatedly, her body going on autopilot as she stood up and went to get some Pokemon to take with her to go find Ash. She took Staryu, Corsola, and Gyarados's Poke Balls and put them in her bag, unknown to her, Psyduck's Poke Ball rolled into it as well. She picked up Azurill to carry it like she normally does. She heads out of her room and towards the door to leave, when her sisters show up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty, where are you going?\" Daisy asked. None of them saw how Misty's eyes were glazed over since the necklaces were made so that only girls who were affected, and Ash when he finds out about it, would be able to notice it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to find Ash to travel with him again.\" Misty said in a monotone voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about the Gym?\" Violet asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your Gym, why don't you take some responsibility for it?\" Misty said in an angry tone. \"In fact, why don't you take any responsibly for your actions for once in your lives!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now come on Misty, that's not fair.\" Lily replied, about to poorly try to defend their actions, but suddenly, their eyes glazed over, just like Misty's. Mew had decided that these three were causing too much trouble, and after having a memory of Mewtwo brainwashing a Nurse Joy, did the same to Misty's sisters, causing them to do just what Misty told them. They moved out of Misty's way as she ran out, she was stopped by Georgio.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Misty, let's have another battle, and if I beat you, you'll agree to go on a date with me!\" Georgio challenged her, once again trying to get a date from her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My sisters are taking over the Gym again, so I don't have to accept any challenges, now move so I can return to the guy I love.\" Misty said in an annoyed tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on, what does whoever it is have that I don't?\" Georgio asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Move or I'll hit you with my mallet.\" Misty warned him, pulling said mallet out of hammer space. Georgio refused to move, believing she was bluffing, and got hit by her mallet knocking him out of the way. Misty put away the mallet, and rushed to Vermillion City in order to head out to Unova. Since the only thought going through her head was 'Must find and serve Ash,' she wasn't able to even wonder how she knew he was in Unova.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMay was in a Pokemon Center, getting back her Pokemon from Nurse Joy. She had her Blaziken, Beautifly, Skitty, Blastoise (Wartortle evolved), Venusaur, and Glaceon with her. Drew was nearby, hoping to ask May for a date. The necklace sent to May appeared in her hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Where did this come from?\" May wondered, before, as like Misty, she felt the overwhelming desire to wear it. She put it on, and like Misty, her blue eyes glazed over, losing their pupils. 'Must find and serve Ash. Must find and serve Ash.' May thought repeatedly. She took her Poke Balls, and ran out the door. She almost ran into Drew, but she stopped in time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"May, good to see you? Want to go out with me?\" Drew asked, believing that she would.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, now get out of my way so I can find Ash.\" May replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh come on!\" Drew replied. \"I thought you came to Johto, and now to Sinnoh since we've competed in the Johto Grand Festival in order to be with me!\" He said, putting his hands on her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, you're just my rival, and I'm thinking of taking a break from contests, and thinking of challenging Gyms.\" She said, because subconsciously, she knew there were no contests in Unova. \"Now let go of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? You can't be serious! You love contests!\" He replied, not listening to the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I warned you.\" May said, before punching him in the gut, forcing him to let go and step back as he bent over a little. May then performed a spinning jump kick to his head, knocking him out. Nobody did anything to her, since she warned him, and he made unwanted advances on her. She then left to find a large body of water in order to use her Blastoise to ride to Unova.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDawn was traveling in Johto, her team consisting of Piplup, Buneary, Pachirisu, Quilava, and, Togekiss (Mamoswine had been sent to Professor Rowan) when the necklace made for her fell to the ground in front of her. She looked at it, before feeling a desire familiar to those reading this chapter. She put it on, and like the two previously mentioned girls, her blue eyes glazed over with her pupils vanishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Must find and serve Ash. Must find and serve Ash.' She thought, before running towards a body of water. Kenny got in her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dawn! How about a date?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No way, I'm heading off to find and join Ash.\" She replied. He then made the same mistake that Drew did with May about asking why she liked Ash, while putting his hands on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get your hands off of me, Kenny!\" She demanded in an angry tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now come on Dawn.\" Kenny said. \"You know you like me.\" The poor boy was in denial, Dawn got out of his grasp, slapped him, and then kicked him in the gut as she continued on. Meanwhile, Mew had been doing the same thing she did to Misty's sisters to May and Dawn's families to stop them from getting in May and Dawn's ways.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>-a random cave-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the three girls were traveling to find as, Misty by her Gyrados, May by her Blastoise, and Dawn by Togekiss, a certain clone who Ash befriended years ago after helping him realize that not all humans are bad, otherwise known as Mewtwo was keeping track of what was going on. As Ash is his friend, and seeing as the young trainer seems to attract danger like food attracts a Snorlax, Mewtwo has been keeping track of him, ready to get involved if Ash ever bites off more that he can chew. There have been a few close calls, but thankfully, Mewtwo hasn't had to get involved. Mewtwo noticed something coming up behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What is it you want Deoxys?' Mewtwo questioned two Deoxys who had come to see him, who just so happened to be the two who Ash saved while in Hoenn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Arceus has called for many of us to meet him at the Spear Pillar.' One of the Deoxys replied, the voice indicating that it was a male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'It has to do with your \"mother,\" and a few of her friends.' The second Deoxys, a female one, added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Very well, let's go.' All three legendaries teleported away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Spear Pillar-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Mewtwo arrived, he saw that in addition to him, the two Deoxys, and Arceus, that also present were: The legendary bird trio from the Orange Islands, the Lugia who declared Ash his chosen one, the Ho-oh Ash keeps seeing, the Suicune that teamed up with Ash to save the Celebi he met in Johto, Rayquaza, Groudon, Kyogre, the Mew who met Ash during the Lucario movie, the Darkrai from the first Sinnoh movie, Dialga, Palkia, Giratina, the Celebi from the Zoruark movie, and Victini were all there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am glad you were all able to make it.\" Arceus said. \"Now, we have to decide what to do about the Pokemon who brainwashed those girls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I figured this would come up.\" Mewtwo replied out loud due to Darkrai being immune to psychic powers. \"And I have good arguments for why we should leave them alone.\" All eyes turned to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pray tell, what would those be?\" Lugia asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"First let me ask you all this, who here hasn't been saved by Ash personally?\" Only Groudon and Kyogre made any indication otherwise. \"Now add to that the fact that he has saved all our butts collectively many times due to stopping the world from being destroyed. We owe him several times over, and would never be able to repay him for it, plus I think he's been wronged by a legendary in some way that he hasn't been compensated for in any way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why is that?\" Arceus asked, curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have been watching over him ever since the time he saved my life, which was a few years ago, and he has yet to age past 10 years old and any long term traveling companion has stopped aging after joining up with him, as have the girls who gained crushes on him, and in this newest adventure, his intelligence has been dropped, he's forgotten his whole counter-shield technique, and like most of the humans on this planet, he seems to now believe that Pokemon can only know four attacks at a time, which if he'd think about it, in the past some of his Pokemon knew more than four attacks at a time. Now, in order to protect us and others, or just the world in general, along with stopping evil organizations, he puts himself in life threatening situations, and I'm sure he will continue to save our if he lives long enough. Having more traveling companions will allow him to have the back up necessary to raise his chances of living, plus all three girls wanted an excuse to travel with him again, due to their crushes on him, but had other things that would have stopped them from ever joining him long term otherwise. You also can't deny that the sisters of the one called Misty needed to get their priorities straight, and not just pile up their duties on her since she is responsible, and the fact that the bumblers of Team Rocket have gotten competent enough to almost win a few times, I think some back up would be needed, since I'm trying not to get involved unless I absolutely need to.\" Every legendary was in shock about the points Mewtwo brought up, but agreed and decided they'd also work on fixing whatever stunted the growth, physically and mentally, of Ash and his companions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-On the sea, on the way to Unova-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty was still on her Gyrados, mindlessly, except for the mantra she kept repeating in her head, waiting until she'd reach shore so she could track down Ash, when she heard something else heading in the same direction, she looked to the side, seeing May pull up closer. If she could think that much, she'd wonder what May was doing there, and vice versa, but when they locked eyes, they each realized that the other was a fellow servant to Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello May, good to see you again.\" Misty said with a small smile, acting on autopilot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here.\" May replied with a grin. \"So, I guess this means that the two of us are both searching for Ash in order to serve him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm glad it's you that I'll share that honor with, and not someone who I dislike, like that Macy girl.\" Misty replied, faking annoyance at the mention of the girl she mentioned, as she was currently unable to even truly feel annoyance at that moment. Suddenly they saw a shadow on the water. They looked up to see Dawn's Togekiss. \"That looks a little like a Togepi or a Togetic.\" Misty said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a Togekiss, a Pokemon in the Sinnoh Pokedex.\" May replied. \"It's the evolved form of Togetic.\" She narrowed her eyes, trying to make out the figure on the Togekiss. \"Is that... Dawn!\" May called out upon seeing her friend from Sinnoh, trying to get her attention, said girl heard May, looked down, and had Togekiss fly her closer. On the way down, she connected eyes with Misty and May.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you are a part of this as well May?\" Dawn asked May, who nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you?\" Misty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty, this is Dawn, the girl who traveled with Ash in Sinnoh, and Dawn, this is Misty, the girl Ash originally used to travel with.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you!\" Dawn said politely. \"You must really be important to Ash, considering how protective he was of that lure he has that looks like you.\" Misty blushed at that. The three girls eventually got to Nuvema Town and recalled their Pokemon. They made a stop at Professor Juniper's lab so that they could get upgraded Pokedex, and so that May could be registered for the Unova league. Professor Oak, who hadn't returned to Pallet Town yet was surprised to see the three of them all there. The three quickly took off. The moment they were out of site from anyone in the town, they were teleported to right outside of Striaton City. As they were mostly stripped of their minds at the moment, they couldn't wonder how they got there so fast. After a Gym battle that May won, the three went to the Pokemon center, as it had become night time again. Minutes after all three had fallen asleep, the necklaces teleported to the next people to wear them.</span></div></div>",

During the time since Ash had left, she had learned how to speak like a human while in human form. She had also been training her nephews and niece (The two Latios and the Latias shown flying around at the end of Pokemon Heroes) to be able to protect Altomare. She had finished teaching them a long time ago, but she has had no idea where Ash was. She gave a sigh, and then the pink necklace appeared above her and landed on her head and bounced off of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow.\" She said, rubbing her head. She looked down and saw the necklace. \"What's this?\" She picked up the necklace, and got the urge to put it on. However, since she's a legendary, she was able to resist the urge. \"This has that one Mew and her friends' names written all over it.\" Mew appeared in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hello Latias!' Mew greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Alright Mew, what's going on?' Latias asked mentally, crossing her arms and tapping her foot on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well you see, it's like this...' Mew began to explain about Ash wanting to travel with his friends forever, and how Mew and her friends decided that the easiest way to do that would be to make the necklaces, and explained what they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'So, this means that if I put this on, I will be able to find Ash and travel with him forever, but I'll be completely under his command?' Latias asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes.' Mew replied. 'If you want, I can take it away from you so you don't have to worry about falling under its power accidentally.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No, I think I'll go with the choice that lets me be with Ash.' Latias replied, putting on the necklace. Her eyes glazed over. 'Must find and serve Ash. Must find and serve Ash.' Latias took off running, with Mew barely getting over her shock in time to chase her down, making sure to stay out of sight. Latias went to a pier that if she flew straight from it, would take her directly to Unova eventually. She turned back into her true form and took off like a jet, not noticing that a small human boy saw her transform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Mahogany Town-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMacy was sitting down on her bed in her house, wondering just what to do, she has no clue where Ash (A.K.A. in her mind, her boyfriend) is. Last she heard he had lost to that powerful trainer Tobias, and had done much better than the opponent Tobias creamed in the final round, meaning he deserves second place. Macy sighed, then noticed the red necklace in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" She wondered, picking it up. She felt the urge to wear it, and she did so, having the same reaction mentioned four times now. 'Must find and serve Ash. Must find and serve Ash.' She stood up, grabbed the Poke Balls containing her Ninetails (Vulpix evolved), Typhlosion (same with Quilava), Magcargo, Electabuzz, and Starmie. She ran out the door after leaving a note to her parents telling them that she was heading to Unova. As soon as she ran out of the house she bumped into a guy about her age wearing winter gear despite it not being winter, or cold at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, my dear.\" The boy greeted trying to be romantic. Macy rolled her eyes, which was impressive considering that they were glazed over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the last time Ice, I don't like you, so stop trying. You're just a guy who gets on my nerves\" Macy said, before beginning to walk away. The newly named \"Ice\" got in her way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wound me my dear, only you can affect my frozen heart.\" Ice replied, Macy began getting out a Poke Ball. \"Why don't we-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Starmie, Hypnosis.\" Macy said simply, calling out her Pokemon, who did as instructed, putting Ice to sleep. \"He's so annoying.\" She walks away and goes to the nearest body of water, after which, she gets on her Starmie and takes off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Arrowroot Town-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the mansion in Arrowroot Town, Princess Salvia was sitting in her room, thinking about the time she switched places with Dawn, and entered a Pokemon Contest. She wished she could get out again, but has no excuse to do so that she knew her butler wouldn't shoot down. While this was happening, the blue necklace was searching for the next person to wear it. It found Salvia, and the consciousness allowing it to act on its own realized that she wasn't affected. It mistook her for Dawn, leaving confusion considering that it saw her with Misty and May, but it went ahead and teleported into her room, right on her lap. She looked at it carefully, before a familiar urge overtook her, and she put on the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Must find and serve Ash. Must find and serve Ash.' She thought, standing up. She began to heading to the exit of her mansion, when her butler stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My lady, where are you going?\" The butler asked her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am going to another region to travel, I must be able to understand the common people if I'm to rule.\" She said simply. \"And with going to another region I can hide my identity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely not!\" The butler declared. \"I don't know where this absurd idea came from, but I shall not allow it! You will... be allowed to do as you wish...\" The butler finished in a monotone as Mew used her abilities on him just like she did Misty, May, and Dawn's family. Salvia went to a store, bought clothes like the ones she wore when pretending to be Dawn, and took a private boat that her family had to head to Unova.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Meanwhile, back in Altomare-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But mommy, I really did see a girl turn into Latias!\" The boy mentioned earlier said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now son, you shouldn't make up things like that, no one will take you seriously when you're telling the truth if you do.\" The boy's mom replied. Bianca walked by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's her mommy!\" The boy exclaimed running up to Bianca. \"Latias! I'm happy to meet you!\" Bianca stopped and looked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\" Bianca questioned, nervous. \"I'm not Latias, my name's Bianca.\" The boy's mother grabbed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, my son claims he saw a girl turn into Latias, and then said it was you that did it.\" The boy's mother apologized. \"Kids have such active imaginations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem, he just surprised me, but he should be careful saying things like that.\" Bianca replied. 'And Latias should have been more careful, I'll have to talk to her about this.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Spear Pillar-<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe legendaries from last chapter were gathered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, we have to do something, this is getting out of hand really quick.\" Arceus said, starting the meeting. \"Latias, a fellow legendary is among the affected.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, I've kept my eyes on my \"mother\".\" Mewtwo replied, still having issues with calling her that. \"And I saw her explain to Latias what would happen. Latias chose this, and that Macy girl wished to travel with Ash and would have done anything for him anyway, so the only issue is Salvia, to which I'll point out it seems she was chosen because the consciousness of the necklace mistook her for that girl, Dawn, meaning it was only doing what the wish stated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, the fact that you can argue cases for why this is ok really scares me.\" Ho-oh replied, looking at Mewtwo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, I'll let this go, but we have to get this situation under control, and stop girls from falling under the necklaces powers.\" Arceus replied in an annoyed tone, before dismissing the meeting.</span></div></div>",

She sighed, as no challenger had actually managed to give her a decent battle, let alone defeat her since a certain trainer from Pallet Town that she developed a crush on. She wished she could have gone with him, but she was unable to due to not having anyone to take over. The red necklace appeared out of nowhere and landed right in her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" She wondered aloud, before getting the urge to put it on, which she did. 'Must find and serve Ash. Must find and serve Ash.' She thought, standing up. She grabbed the Poke Balls containing her Espeon, Alakazam, and Metagross, and then headed to the door, only for Scott to come in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, Anabel, just who I wanted to see.\" Scott greeted her. \"The Battle Frontier is temporarily closing, as there has been a decline in decent trainers taking part. I'm sorry if this inconveinces you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry, I actually wanted to leave to find and travel with Ash, and now I have the chance.\" Anabel replied, not telling him she was going to go and find him anyway, even if that the Battle Frontier wasn't closing temporarily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left the building and used her Alakazam to teleport to the nearest ship heading to Unova.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngie was getting ready for a day of working at her parents' daycare in Solaceon Town, when the blue necklace appeared out of nowhere, and landed at her feet. She bent down to look at it, and got the urge to put it on, which she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Must find and serve Ash. Must find and serve Ash.' She picked up Luxio's Poke Ball (her Shinx evolved), and left her house to find Ash, not even bothering to tell her parents, luckily, Mew took care of any problems from that, before teleporting her to the same place Anabel went to get on a ship to Unova, out of site, of course. Seeing as she couldn't think, she didn't wonder how that even happened. Both girls borded the ship at about the same time after getting tickets. They were given the same room. Anabel found it first, followed by Angie. The two locked eyes, and both knew that the other was a fellow servant to Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, my name's Angie.\" Angie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Anabel.\" Anabel replied. \"So, you're heading off to serve Ash too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am, how do you know him?\" Angie asked. With that, the two girls pretending to know what they are doing currently, despite not being able to think, started talking about how they met Ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLyra was walking around New Bark Town. She sighed thinking about Ash. She got a crush on him while they were traveling together, and considered calling and asking her father if she could continue traveling with Ash and friends, but then Khoury impressed her so much that she started crushing on him, and since she knew that Dawn also liked Ash, she went back to Johto with Khoury, however, Khoury didn't like her like that, only wanting to be friends, and the crush didn't last too long, with them just being friends, as Khoury didn't even realize Lyra had had romantic feelings for him. She then became depressed that she left Ash's group, although she didn't show it. She was so lost in thought that she didn't see the pink necklace appear, and fall to the ground in front of her until she tripped over it and fell to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow, what was that?\" Lyra wondered as she turned to look. She say the necklace, which she got the urge to put on. Like all the other girls she did. 'Must find and serve Ash. Must find and serve Ash.' She took off, with her Marill, having the Poke Balls containing Girafarig and Chikorita with her. Everybody who may try to stop her had a little mental visit from Mew to keep them from doing so. Lyra got to a body of water and took off on Marill, island hoping to keep it from getting exhausted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Legendaries from before were gathered again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Mewtwo, what are you going to say in favor of what's happened this time?\" Arceus asked, knowing he's going to have something up his non-existant sleeve.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The situation is the same as in the first set of girls.\" Mewtwo replied. \"By the way, I don't see why you care, as you don't care for most humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple, I don't want this to be on a group of Legendary Pokemon's head, as that could cause all sorts of problems if this goes too far.\" Arceus answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then don't worry, it soon won't be on a group of Legendarys' heads, as I've got plans set into motion to make it so that Ash is the one who would choose what happens, meaning that other Legendarys won't be able to complain to us.\" Mewtwo replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\" Arceus asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Once he has the necklaces, they will be his responsibilities, and with the whole saving the world several times thing, there's nothing other Legendary Pokemon could complain about.\" Mewtwo replied, crossing his arms as he effectively ended the discussion, as the others couldn't counter that.</span></div></div>",

Went through her head, instead of the previous version, since Ash was right there with her. The mantra faded away, since she was with him, but the power still held.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Iris, are you ok?\" Ash asked. \"You seemed to blank out for a moment there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine.\" Iris replied. \"There was no reason to be worried, I was just wondering where this necklace came from.\" She lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, let's hurry on!

Ash, Cilan, Pikachu, and Axew all looked at her in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was too easy.\" Ash said suspiciously. \"With all the times I've tried to get you to stop, why would you listen now? What are you up to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing, I'm just in a really good mood.\" Iris lied, subconsciously trying to deflect suspicion away from the necklace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBianca was running towards Nimbasa Town, hoping to compete in the tournament, another hope was that she would get to see a certain trainer, minus most of his clothes, again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I sure hope Ash will be there.' Bianca thought. 'I'm surprised that no one has figured out that I keep knocking Ash into water on purpose, I mean, it would be next to impossible for me to have done so every single time that we meet.' At this thought, she tripped over the blue necklace, which had appeared in front of her. \"Owww.\" Bianca moaned, she then turned around to see what she tripped on. She picked it up, and began to put it on before even getting the urge. 'Must find and serve Ash. Must find and serve Ash.' She got up, and ran off in the direction she had been going, since she could tell that he was heading that way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia was sitting down at a table in Nimbasa Town, eating a meal. Suddenly the red necklace dropped right on top of her head, bouncing off of her hat, and landing on her table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow. What was that?\" Georgia wondered, rubbing her head. She then saw that it was a necklace and picked it up. \"Where did this come from?\" The she got the urge and put on the necklace. 'Must find and serve Ash. Must find and serve Ash.' Georgia then began to stand up to run to find Ash, only to realize that he was heading in her direction, and that it would be easier to just wait for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>24 hours later</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh's group walked into Nimbasa Town, excited about the tournament, when they heard a familiar voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Out of the way, out of the way, out of the way!\" Bianca's voice called out as she came running towards the group, crashing right into Ash, and sending him right into the water. Bianca and Iris locked eyes and both instantly realized that they both were in the same boat. Ash got out of the water.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy do you keep running into me, Bianca?\u201d Ash asked, frustrated. Bianca looked at him, and, like Iris, the fog cleared from her mind since she had met up with her new master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, isn\u2019t this an interesting situation.\u201d A familiar voice said, as everyone turned to see Georgia walking towards them, her mind clearing up. Iris and Bianca locked eyes with her, and Iris became enraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo! Why you too!\u201d Iris said loudly in an angry tone. \u201cWhy do I have to serve alongside a little kid like you!?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019d say that temper tantrum makes you more of a kid than you claim I am.\u201d Georgia replied with a smirk that made Iris even more angered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think she meant by serve?\u201d Luke asked, looking at Ash and Cilan in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI have no idea.\u201d Cilan replied. \u201cThe mysterious taste has gotten even stronger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you think, Bianca?\u201d Ash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe was referring to serving our new master.\u201d Bianca answered, causing everyone but the arguing girls to look at her in confusion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mea-\u201d Ash began, before being cut off as he was glomped from behind by Dawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsh!\u201d Dawn exclaimed in joy as Misty and May followed behind her, all three of their minds clearing up. \u201cWe finally caught up with you!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you three doing here?\u201d Ash asked in surprise. May and Dawn pouted and Misty looked annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe come all this way to be with you, and this is the greeting we get!?\u201d Misty said in an angry tone, hiding how hurt Ash\u2019s response made her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that!\u201d Ash explained in a hurry, not wanting Misty to be upset with him. \u201cI\u2019m really glad to see all three of you; in fact, I wanted to travel with you three again, I\u2019m just surprised to see you.\u201d The three girls\u2019 expressions cheered up at that, as all three blushed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsh, shouldn\u2019t you stop those two?\u201d Bianca asked, pointing towards the still arguing Iris and Georgia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow can I stop them?\u201d Ash asked. \u201cThere\u2019s no way they\u2019d listen to me with how much they argue.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTrust me, they\u2019ll stop if you tell them to.\u201d Bianca replied. Cilan raised an eyebrow at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, ok.\u201d Ash replied. \u201cIris! Georgia!\u201d Both girls turned to look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Both asked, sending each other glares out of the corners of their eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease stop fighting.\u201d Ash replied, hoping for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth shot each other a glare, before saying \u201cFine.\u201d At the exact same time, turning away from each other with sour looks on their faces. Ash, Cilan, and Pikachu looked on in shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsh!\u201d A female voice familiar to Ash and Misty shouted, causing both to turn towards it, Misty gritting her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018Oh please no, not her.\u2019 Misty thinks in frustration, as Macy ran up, and like Dawn, glomped Ash, but from the front. Misty locked eyes with her, and got a look of anger as she saw that her fears were correct as Macy\u2019s mind cleared up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMacy?\u201d Ash asked in surprise. \u201cWhy does it seem that the girls that I\u2019ve met are all coming here?\u201d He wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsh!\u201d Another voice exclaimed, as everyone turned to look in its direction, and a figure that Ash and Misty recognized grabbed onto his right arm, hugging it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBianca?\u201d Both asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes? What is it? And how to you know my name?\u201d Bianca asked, directing the last part to Misty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot you.\u201d Ash replied. \u201cThis girl\u2019s also named Bianca.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot quite.\u201d Latias replied. \u201cAlthough I can understand why you made that mistake, since I couldn\u2019t speak your language the last time we saw each other.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLatias!?\u201d Ash and Misty shouted in surprise at this new information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou might want to be quiet about that.\u201d Latias responded as her mind cleared up. \u201cImagine what would happen if the wrong person found out since I don\u2019t have a trainer.\u201d She locked eyes with the other girls<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWould somebody please explain what\u2019s going-\u201d Cilan began, before another voice cut him off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSir Ash!\u201d Salvia shouted as she ran up to him, her mind clearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnother Dawn?\u201d May asked in confusion as Salvia locked eyes with the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot quite.\u201d Dawn replied. \u201cThis is our friend, Princess Salvia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cA princess!?\u201d Everyone who didn\u2019t know exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere are they all coming from?\u201d Luke wondered aloud as two more figures ran up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsh!\u201d Angie and Anabel shouted, causing everyone to look towards them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAngie and Anabel? You\u2019re here too?\u201d Ash asked in surprise as the two\u2019s minds cleared up, before another voice called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAsh!\u201d Lyra shouted as she ran up and hugged Ash\u2019s left arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLyra?\u201d Ash and Dawn said in surprise as said girl\u2019s mind cleared up. All of the girls locked eyes, and Lyra got a confused look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy are there two Danes?\u201d Lyra asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFirst off, it\u2019s Dawn, not Dane!\u201d Dawn replied. \u201cSecond, that\u2019s actually princess Salvia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Ash wondered aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018I can explain.\u2019 Mewtwo replied telepathically as he teleported in.</span></div></div>",

Mewtwo responded telepathically with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's that Pokemon?\" Dawn wondered aloud as she used her Pokedex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mewtwo, the Genetic Pokemon. Mewtwo is said to be a clone of the Legendary Pokemon Mew.\" Dawn's Pokedex informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'... How that device had any information at all on me is something I'm going to have to look into later.' Mewtwo commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Such a mysterious Pokemon, I feel an intense taste from this!\" Cilan declared, before going on a rant about how amazing Mewtwo seems, before crying out in pain as Misty pulled on his ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, that's starting to get annoying.\" Misty stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you!\" Iris said with a sigh. \"He gets so annoying sometimes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway, Mewtwo, didn't you say you could explain what's going on?\" Ash asked, trying to get them back on task.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, that's why I'm here.' Mewtwo replied. 'Ash, a couple nights ago, do you remember the wish you made before going to sleep?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but how do you know about that?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I've been keeping an eye on you for the most part since our last encounter, just in case you need help, since you seem to attract danger like food attracts a Snorlax.' Mewtwo replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, that's true.\" Misty deadpanned as Ash sweat dropped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was this wish?\" May asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ash was depressed about not being able to travel with you, along with Misty and Dawn, and he wished that he could travel with the three of you forever.' Mewtwo replied. 'Little did he know that the Millennium Comet had been hit by a meteor and knocked off course. Jirachi heard the request, and contacted the Mew I was cloned from, along with the Manaphy that sees you as his mom, Azelf, Uxie, and Mespirit.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What could they do?\" Dawn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I want you all to draw your attention to the necklaces that Iris, Bianca, and Georgia are wearing.' Mewtwo replied. They all did so, with the girls mentioning putting on necklaces that looked like those necklaces, to which Mewtwo revealed the necklaces abilities.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, the reason that they came to find me, and that they will do what I say is because they have been forced to, with absolutely no say in the matter...\" Ash said in a depressed tone. A couple of the girls moved to comfort him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be ok Ash, no need to worry.\" Dawn replied softly. Ash sighed in sadness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I know that the reason you said that isn't because the necklace made you say it?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Simple.\" Latias began, causing everyone to look towards her. \"Did you tell her to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\" Ash replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're only forced to do things if you order us to do so.\" Latias explained. \"Since you didn't order that girl to comfort you, that means she did it on her own. Also, I chose to do enslave myself to you.\" With the exception of Mewtwo, everyone's eyes went wide as they turned their heads to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What?\" Angie voiced the confusion they were all feeling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I'm a legendary Psychic type; do you really think I'd fall under a spell by Mew's power that easily?' Latias asked. 'Any powerful psychic, whether they are a Pokemon or human would be able to resist the urge to put on the necklace, although only a legendary psychic could resist the power of the necklace upon wearing it, unless they were weakened enough. I willingly put on the necklace after Mew told me what it does, and I allowed the necklace to bind me to your will.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'But why?' Ash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wanted to join you, but I had no idea where you were. The necklace allows anyone under its power to track you down at any point in time in order to serve you.' Latias explained. Ash opened his mouth to speak. 'Also, I was planning on becoming your Pokemon in order to keep anyone else from catching me anyway, so I really saw no reason to refuse giving up my ability to say no to your orders.' She finished with a shrug as Ash closed his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Yes, and with the exception of Georgia and Princess Salvia, every girl here has romantic feelings, and wanted to travel with you anyway, but either had reasons keeping them from being able to do so, or didn't know where you were.' Mewtwo added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why were we involved?\" Georgia asked, crossing her arms, an annoyed expression on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'The princess because she looks like Dawn.' Mewtwo began explaining. 'The necklaces have a consciousness, and the one that enslaved her mistook her for Dawn, so it was just doing its duty. You, on the other hand, were targeted since I directed the necklaces to Unova in order for Ash to obtain them.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, but why me?\" Georgia asked. \"Why not someone else in Unova?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That was just the necklace choosing someone from Unova at random.' Mewtwo replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great, so this means I'm bound to someone I don't love.\" Georgia muttered. \"There goes my chance at a love life.\" Ash looked depressed, while Iris silently seethed, her earlier order preventing her from throwing some biting words at Georgia for hurting her previously secret crush emotionally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not quite.' Mewtwo replied, to which everyone turned towards him. 'The necklaces connect your hearts to Ash's, which means that you're going to start falling for Ash. How long it takes isn't set in stone, as it will greatly depend on his actions.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quick question.\" Lyra interupted, everyone's attention turning to her. \"What happens if a relative of Ash's puts on one of the necklaces?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That person shall be enslaved, but will not gain romantic feelings for him.' Mewtwo replied. He was about to continue his previous explanation, when he was cut off<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute!\" Anabel exclaimed with a panicked look. \"Shouldn't we do something about the necklaces before they teleport again, and we have more girls in this situation!?\" Iris, Bianca, and Georgia, began to hurry to get the necklaces off, before being stopped by Mewtwo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hold on. Now that Ash has been informed about the situation, everything that happens with the necklaces is his choice, so long as he doesn't lose them, as him having them in his possession is the only way to stop them from teleporting.' Mewtwo explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then let's hurry and give them to Ash!\" Iris said quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I have a suggestion for Ash about how to use the necklaces though.' Mewtwo replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would I want to do this to more girls?\" Ash asked. \"It's not fair to them!\" Unknown to him, that concern about what happens to the girls accelerated the process of Georgia and Salvia falling for him, as both got light blushes on their faces while looking at him, however, Georgia realized this and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'No! This is just the necklace causing me to fall for him!' Georgia thought to herself. \"I have to keep my mind clear, I can't think about how hansom he looks. No! Snap out of it!'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You've run into many female criminals.' Mewtwo began. 'The world is literally better off with them being your slaves, instead of commiting crimes.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I remember.\" Ash replied. \"I'll agree to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n 'One more thing.' Mewtwo said, eyes glowing, as he flicked his right wrist. Everyone suddenly shook their heads as knowledge passed through their minds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?\" Misty asked afterwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Something has been wrong lately.' Mewtwo replied. 'something caused every human on the planet to suddenly believe that Pokemon can only know four moves at a time. Also, Ash's knowledge keeps resetting to an earlier point a little after coming to a new region. I've fixed those, along with from some help of reality bending, courtesy of the other legendaries, I've made it so that the girls won't get pregnant unless you both want them to, since you are a male with many slaves who will do anything you tell them to, so long as it doesn't bring intentional harm to you, or alter who controls them, this will probably be needed eventually.' Several girls blushed. Misty walked off, tears in her eyes, but Ash was the only one to see. He followed her.<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty, what's wrong?\" Ash asked, coming up to Misty, who was crying outside a Pokemon Center. \"This is because of having to serve me, isn't it?\" Misty shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm glad I can be with you forever.\" She replied through her sobs. \"It's just, now you're going to have all those girls with you, so much prettier than me, who will do anything you want them to... where will that leave me? I'll just end up pushed to the side.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who says you aren't pretty?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's true, my entire life, I've always been told that I'm ugly, and that I can never be as beautiful.\" Misty replied. \"I became a tomboy because I knew there was no hope of me becoming as beautiful as them, so I figured I shouldn't even bother trying to get someone to fall for me, but I fell in love anyway! What's worse, you obviously don't love me, since I spent so much time fighting with you during our travels!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Misty!\" Ash said. \"Most of what you fought with me about was my fault, and you're wrong.\" Ash kissed her on the lips. \"I do love you. Don't get me wrong, but I wouldn't be against you acting more girly to me in some things, but I prefer you as a tomboy. From now on, don't hide the truth from me, act on your desires.\"</span></div></div>",

Technically, there were 14, but since Latias was in human form, he counted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, here are the keys to the rooms.\" Nurse Joy replied, handing him four keys since there are four beds per room. Ash, Misty, and Pikachu headed to one of the rooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAsh and Misty arrived at one of the rooms, entered, then closed the door behind them and sat on a bed, facing each other. \u201cSo\u2026how are things at the gym?\u201d Ash chokes out, unable to figure out what to do first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh umm good I guess. Though I\u2019m really much happier here.\u201d Misty explains casually, her face turning red. She quickly gets embarrassed, and would have normally fled or covered up what she wanted due to shyness deep down, before Ash's command to act on her desires took hold, and she got a gleem in her eye. Pikachu seeing this took this moment to quietly exit the room and give Ash a small \u2018good luck\u2019 before finally leaving. Upon Pikachu leaving Misty began leaning in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, Misty!\u201c Ash called out, making Misty pause due to him telling her to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it Ash?\" She asked in frustration, feeling a dampness in between her legs as her desires continue coming forth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\" Ash asked. \"This seems really sudden.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI'm doing what you ordered be earlier, <i>master.</i>\" Misty said slipping a hand beneath his pants and rubbing is penis to get it hard all the while, which was working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't remember ordering any of this.\" Ash replied, confused, with a blush on his face. \"And I know I didn't order you to call me master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You ordered me to act on my desires, and these are them.\" Misty replied. \"And deep down I've always had a desire to roleplay master and slave with you during sex, with me being the slave. That's why I was so hard on you, I was trying to hide it from myself and get you to try to have your way with me.\" Before Ash could comment Misty used a loophole to the wait command due to the fact that she had waited this long, and closed the distance between them, and locked lips with the wayward hero, and a sudden shock expression grew on his face. Yet instead of pulling away Ash continued to lock lips with Misty and soon the two began exchanging tongues.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore long the two had to break for air and Ash weakly rolls off of Misty, unaware that he now was holding Misty\u2019s hand in his. A moment of silence past as the two caught their breath before then Ash turned his head to face Misty. The two looked each other in the eye when suddenly the duo stood up and began to strip. They no longer had control of themselves, natural instinct had taken over and in a matter of seconds the two would share one of the most wondrous things about being human.</span></div></div>",

However within seconds Ash feels himself close to ejacualating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMisty I\u2019m gonna-\u201c but before Ash can get the final word out, he blasts a load right into Misty\u2019s face, much to her shock. For a moment Ash doesn\u2019t move, the pleasure of his first ejaculation is a little much on him, but he quickly recovers and apologizes. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Misty it\u2019s just it felt so good and-\u201c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s so warm\u2026\u201d Misty whimpers still a bit shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMisty I\u2019m sorry I tried to say something!\u201d Ash tries to explain but Misty doesn\u2019t seem to listen as she begins to wipe her face with her hand. For a moment, Misty looks at her now cum covered hand, and a thought occurs to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2018This is Ash\u2019s cum, his semon. I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s so warm.\u2019 Misty thinks as she flexes her cum covered fingers, examining the strange white liquid substance as it drips to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMisty? Are you okay\u201d Ash asked a bit concerned? Misty quickly snapped out of her trance and looked Ash in the eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh sorry must\u2019ve spaced out for a moment\u201d Misty apologizes, before quickly standing up and running to the bathroom in order to wash off her face as well as her hand unaware that Ash has followed right after.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay Misty?\u201d Ash asks, still rather concerned for his long time companion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m fine it\u2019s just this is my first time and well\u2026\u201d Misty seems like she is recalling some sort of painful memory, possibly one of her sisters calling her ugly. Thinking of this Ash quickly grabs Misty and wrapped her in a romantic hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMisty\u2026\u201d Ash begins as Misty begins to sniffle \u201c\u2026don\u2019t listen to those people. You\u2019re the one I\u2019m having sex with right now. And you\u2019re the one I\u2019m giving my virginity to! So forget what those people say!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment, the two stand like this, just still. Feeling each other\u2019s body heat as their individual heart beats seemingly harmonize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaster...\u201d Misty begins, only for Ash to shush her and take her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome with me.\u201d Ash whispers as he leads Misty out of the bathroom and onto one of the beds. Misty looks at Ash as he leans in closer, Misty closes her eyes and puckers her lips, expecting another kiss only to receive a sudden jolt of pleasure from her vagina region. Misty flashes her eyes open and looks down to find that Ash is kneeling down, with his tongue licking the moist lips of her vagina. Misty lets out a purr of pleasure as Ash continues to prod Misty's wet pussy with his tongue, causing Misty to go over the edge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHHHH!\" Misty shrieked rather loudly, but luckily, the walls of the Pokemon Center managed to block most of the sound. However, that didn't stop Ash from receiving a knock on his door. Ash slowly gets up and looks towards Misty, who nods as she covers herself with a blanket, and he puts his pants and undershirt on (leaving off his jacket and underwear) and after wiping his face of Misty's bodily juices, Ash headed for the door. Ash opened slowly opened the door...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho was it?</span></div></div>",

Ash opened the door a little more to reveal Misty who was still covered with a blanket. Thankfully it was dark enough for Salvia to not notice that Misty still had a tiny bit of cum still left on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Salvia.\" Misty hesitantly said giving a faint wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Misty, are you okay?\" Salvia asked concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I am, just had a bad dream and Ash was just trying to comfort me.\" Misty lied, though Salvia nodded accepting Misty's response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay well than I guess I'll just head back to the others.\" Salvia replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hold on a minute, would you like me to escort you?\" Ash offered, hoping that his offer would be rejected. Salvia smiled but shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No thank you Ash, my room is only across the hall. Thank you though.\" Salvia replied, her heart now growing a bit closer towards Ash's due to this offer of chivalry, as she quickly curtsied and walked away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a moment of watching Salvia walk back away, Ash made sure the coast was clear and then re-entered the bedroom, making sure to both lock the door and put a do not disturb sign on the outside of the door before finally returning to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow\u2026\u201d Ash began as he slowly uncovered Misty \u201c\u2026where were we?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMisty smiled a lustful grin as she spreaded her legs, revealing her still soaking wet vagina. Ash smiled a devious, yet lustful smile as he quickly removed his clothing, revealing his now fully erect penis. Ash gently laid Misty down on the bed, making sure to keep her legs spread as he moved over her so that his dick was about an inch from Misty\u2019s pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReady?\u201d Ash asked, looking Misty in the eye. Misty looked concerned for a moment, but upon looking Ash in the eye she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes master, I\u2019m ready.\u201d She said still a bit worried but that was quickly over shadowed by the intense pleasure of Ash shoving his erect dick into her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAHHHH!\u201d Misty gasped loudly but luckily Ash anticipated this and quickly covered her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSsshhh try to keep it down, Misty.\u201d Ash said to Misty who seemed not to be listening, her face was flushed full red and she had an expression of pure ecstasy plastered on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh master! Do it again! Thrust your warm dick into my naughty pussy!\u201d Misty exclaimed seemingly crazed as she tightly hugged Ash so he couldn\u2019t escape.  Ash was a bit shocked to see Misty like this but he wasn\u2019t about to retreat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright then, here you go!\u201d Ash growled as he began to slam his dick into Misty\u2019s soaking wet vagina as Misty continued to grow more and more crazed with ecstasy. Again and again Ash thrust his dick into Misty\u2019s pussy as Ash\u2019s dick seemingly got bigger as time progressed. After solid three minutes Ash was finally reaching his limit and his dick was about to burst!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMisty, I\u2019m gonna cum!\u201d Ash grunted as he continued to thrust deeper and deeper into Misty\u2019s vaginal region. Misty gasped and panted like some sort of dog in heat and when she spoke she had to gasp every few seconds for air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome*pant* inside me*pant*!\u201d Misty gasped, this had to be the most intense four minutes of her life! Ash gasped and continued to thrust when suddenly he felt himself penetrate something even deeper inside Misty, her womb! Misty had tears in her eyes, it hurt but she was too lost in ecstasy to care!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMisty! I\u2019m cumming!\u201d Ash exclaimed as he suddenly shot his load straight into Misty\u2019s womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m cumming, oh my god! I\u2019m cumming too!\u201d Misty cried insanely as she orgasmed before shortly orgasming again once Ash had finished cumming inside her womb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was quite for a long time as Iris, who had watched this entire thing, continued to peak through the window all the while playing with herself. She had snuck inside in order to find out where the two were, and found out where their room was, and went back outside and to the window to spy on the two. She really didn\u2019t mean to but, it happened and she couldn\u2019t help herself. Now that their hearts were connected she could barely hold back the desire to have Ash have sex with her as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Ash...\u201d She gasped lustfully as she rubbed her clit while simultaneously fingering herself. \u201cI guess you aren\u2019t such a kid after all.\u201d Iris carefully watched to see if anything else would happen. Thankfully no one had caught her yet, after all she was quite good at hiding in shrubs and trees, good thing there was a shrub right next to the window. A little convenient but Iris didn\u2019t mind nor care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAxew\u2026\u201d Groaned Axew, who was still in Iris\u2019s hair while this whole event was transpiring, luckily Axew was sleeping quietly up until now. Iris quickly stopped her dirty deed and, after wiping off her hands on her pants, she quickly lolled Axew back to sleep before it could completely wake up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

Pikachu jump onto his shoulder. Ash headed for the front desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello there.\u201d Nurse Joy said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHello\u201c Ash greeted back in a whispered tone. Nurse Joy yawned, and Ash, being the nice guy that he was, asked \u201cAre you okay?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh why yes I\u2019m just a little tired. So many trainers came in last night and today wanting their pokemon healed, and I haven't had much time to rest.\u201d Nurse Joy explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh I see, sorry, I wish I could do something to help.\u201d Ash replied sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell you can watch the pokemon center while I catch a few more Z\u2019s.\u201d Nurse Joy yawned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure no problem!\u201d Ash replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbout two hours later Nurse Joy, returned from her room to find Ash right in the middle of taking care of some young trainer\u2019s Patrat. The girls, excluding Misty, but including Hunter J, Domino, and Mars were helping him out, although the latter three seemed to be upset about something, but it was being hidden so well that someone would have to look closely to tell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou see we were playing in our garden, and then suddenly this Venipede came out of nowhere and hit Patrat with a Poison Sting!\u201d The young trainer explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see, well this should help.\u201d Ash explained pulling out a spray bottle from bellow the counter. \u201cNow where did the Venipede sting you?\u201d Ash asked the Patrat. The Patrat groaned as it pointed at its left arm. Ash gently took the Patrat\u2019s hand, and with his other hand, he sprayed the wound where the Poison Sting originated. Patrat grunted in pain for a second before sighing in relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThere you go, that wasn't so bad, now for a bandage.\u201d May said as she reached into her pouch and pulled out a small piece of white fabric, before gently wrapping it around Patrat\u2019s wound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank you all so much!\u201d The young trainer exclaimed happily only for Ash to quietly shush her. \u201cOh right sorry. Thanks!\u201d the young trainer whispered before leaving with her Patrat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNice job.\u201d Nurse Joy said, stepping out from around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Nurse Joy, you\u2019re up.\u201d Ash replied a little shocked to see her up already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah good as new, thanks for watching the Pokemon Center for me.\u201d Nurse Joy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHeh no problem it was actually really easy, especially with my friends helping.\u201d Ash replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh why\u2019s that? There weren't very many trainers this close to the time for the tournament, were there?\u201d Nurse Joy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell actually\u2026\u201d Ash began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow I can\u2019t believe you managed all that in only two hours.\u201d Nurse Joy exclaimed in shock. Ash had told her that as soon as she went to sleep, at least a dozen trainers showed up. Ash had told her that it only took him a half hour to solve all their problems and send them on their way. About a fourth of the way through, his girls came in, with the criminal girls being upset about having to follow Ash's orders (Domino's memories were restored upon being enslaved), although he didn't tell her that part. After that only a few trainers came in, and once again, it only took Ash a little bit to solve their problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I learned a lot of what I did from my friend Brock. He used to be a traveling companion of mine, but we parted way a while back.\u201d Ash explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour friend taught you all that?\u201d Nurse Joy asked. \u201cI mean what kind of person can get a Krockerock to calm down long enough for you to give it a shot while also wrapping its arm in a cast?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh well I suddenly remembered his phone number and gave him a call, he was a little shocked to hear from me after so long but after a little talk he walked me through some of the more difficult stuff.\u201d Ash explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow that\u2019s amazing!\u201d Nurse Joy exclaimed honestly shocked to see someone so fluent in pokemon physiology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s become one heck of a pokemon doctor as of late.\u201d Ash explained smiling a wide grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI see well I guess I\u2019ll have to give him a call if I ever am in a bind again.\u201d Nurse Joy repied. Ash nods and writes down Brock\u2019s number and tells her that if he asks, just say that Ash gave her the number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsewhere at this exact moment in time, a brown haired dark skinned pokemon doctor suddenly got a weird urge. He suddenly shot up on his desk and shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!\u201d As all the other staff of the hospital he worked at gave him a weird look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in Unova, Ash had finished up at the Pokemon Center and was on his way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens now</span></div></div>",

Ash patted Latias once more on the head before gently falling back on the ground with Latias in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two laid there for about a minute before Latias spoke<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash, er um, master?\" Latias began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm? Latias, you know you don't have to call me master if you don't want to, right?\" Ash explained. He still hadn't gotten used to the whole Master-Servant thing, I mean there was last night with Misty but that was also sex. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... well... I... Latias blushed which Ash admitted made her look cute. Ash blushed and tried to change the subject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... so how was the trip to Unova? It wasn't bad, was it?\" Ash asked \"You didn't run into any trouble?\" Latias shook her head and merely smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The flight was fine, I mean I think it was fine. I was on autopilot through most of it. Though I assume I flew over Johto on the way here.\" Latias explained. \"Oh, umm, do you think we could go to Johto someday?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well actually, I've already been to Johto, Latias.\" Ash replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, umm, well... do you think maybe... you could take me there sometime? Or maybe tell me about it?\" Latias asked, curious about said region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well let's see... hmm...\" Ash tried to recall, thankfully Mewtwo, with the help from the other legendaries, had helped restore his memories. Only problem was that the human brain could only remember so much at one time and Johto was so very long ago.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Ash closed his eyes, trying his best to sort out his memories over the past few years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Ash, if it's too much trouble then-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh n-no it's alright, it's just been a while. Umm just give me a minute...\" Ash explained trying his best to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two stood there in silence for a good few minutes as Pikachu and the rest of Ash's pokemon laid napping against a tree, Oshawatt looked especially happy seeing as how he was blushing with a huge snot bubble coming out of his nose. Another minute passed by before Ash finally spoke up however before Ash could say anything a loud voice shouted out towards him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ASH! Hey Ash, where are you?\" A familiar voice called.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm?\" Ash and Bianca stood up and looked around, quickly noticing Cilan coming down the path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Cilan, over here!\" Ash called out giving him a wave. Cilan quickly ran up to the two, clealry having been running as he was sweating profusely. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*pant* Ash *pant*\" Cilan panted trying to get his breath back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Cilan? Did soemthign happen?\" Ash asked concerned about his friend<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y- *pant* you're *pant* late.\" Cilan explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment for Ash to process what Cilan ment and when it finally hit him Ash quickly bolted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AW NO! I'M GONNA BE LATE!!!\" Ash shouted as he ran towards the stadium like a Pikachu using Volt Tackle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh...\" Latias chuckled as she watched her master run as if his life depended on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh *pant* well, I'm glad I found him.\" Cilain gasped. It was at this time that Pikachu and the rest of Ash's pokemon had awoken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika pi?\" Pikachu asked, rubbing sand out of his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't worry, Ash just went for a run.\" Latias said with a giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika pika?\" Pikachu asked in what one could guess was a deadpan tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh heh, yeah, he sure did. He's on his way there now.\" Latias explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pika.\" Pikachu nodded and stood up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Registration closing!\" Nurse Joy called out with a megaphone. Nurse Joy turned to her partner Audino and let out a sigh of relief. \"Well guess that's it. Time to close up Audino.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audino~!\" Audino said with a nod. However, before Nurse Joy could even blink an eye, a loud cry came through the air as a young boy came barreling towards her from about two yards away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Hey wait a minute!\" the boy cried out as a huge dust cloud followed after him. The boy quickly jumped through the air, making a seemingly inhuman jump towards Nurse Joy, before stopping just short of the table Nurse Joy and Audino were standing at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, hello.\" Nurse Joy said, quickly dusting off her dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry *pant* I'm late. *pant*\" the boy gasped, seeming to have been running for miles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, it\"s okay. Anyway you wanted to register?\" Nurse Joy asked quickly picking up the clipboard and a pen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! Of course! My name's Luke, and this is my partner.\" The boy quickly explains in one breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eheh, right.\" Nurse Joy quickly scribbled the info down, not realizing she was holding the pen the wrong way. \"There we go, all set.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\" Luke asked surprised \"That was fast.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See for yourself.\" Nurse Joy explained quickly flipping the clipboard around to show Luke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm... Nurse Joy?\"  Luke began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" Nurse Joy replied, smiling that one kind of smile that just shouted please go away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kinda\u2026 blank.\" Luke explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...?\" Nurse Joy said flat as a baritone.  She quickly flipped the clipboard around and facepalmed as she saw her error as clear as day. Nurse Joy's patience had reached her wits end, and one could swear a volcano had just exploded behind her. Audino quickly snatched the clipboard out of Nurse Joy's hand and quickly scribbled down Luke's information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um you kinda spelled-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AUDI!\" Audino growled like a houndoom ready to pounce and rip Luke a new one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, right, sorry. Thank you.\" Luke quickly bowed and ran for it, not wanting to meet the wrath of an angry Nurse Joy and Audino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as Luke was out of sight Nurse Joy plopped back in her chair, letting hair fall down as it had come undone when her rage reached its peak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audino.\" Audino said handing a bottle of water to Nurse Joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"*sigh* *glug glug* That sure was stressful...\" Nurse Joy explained, letting out a sigh of much needed relief. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audino.\" Audino said giving a much agreed nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAAAAAAIIIIIIITTTT!!!\" Cried another voice. Nurse Joy quickly turned her head to see another large dust cloud, this one nearly twice as big as the one that boy Luke made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! Not again! Quick Audino use Protect!\" Nurse Joy called out to her partner in nursing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Audino!\" Audino quickly nodded before rapidly erecting a barrier around the table, and not a moment too soon, as the huge dust cloud caught them, and a loud silhouetted object hit the barrier. A little bit later the dust finally cleared and the silhouetted object was revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A-Ash?\" Nurse Joy stuttered out, her hair a mess and her expression in a comical shock.. Audino quickly lowered the barrier causing Ash to comedically fall to the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow~!\" Ash groaned as Nurse Joy quickly peeled him off the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I hope you're not hurt.\" Nurse Joy prayed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow~! I'm okay. Umm am I too late to register?\" Ash asked, still in quite a bit of pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh umm... well, you see...\" Nurse Joy began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WHAT?! I'M ALREADY REGISTERED?\" Ash shouted causing the entire city to shake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm yes eh heh heh.\" Nurse Joy explained a bit embarrassed. \"I recalled that you wanted to enter the tournament, and went ahead and registered you. Furthermore, many of your friends have checked in with me in order to register you as well, you've been registered since 9 A.M.\" Nurse Joy explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"9 A.M.?!\" Ash gasped in surprise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh well, yes. I'd been meaning to tell you, but a lot of trainers came to register today, not to mention that one trainer that registered at the last minute.\" Nurse Joy explained, saying that last part with a low tone and a glare to the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? That makes sense.\" Ash said with a nod, lightly pounding his fist into his open palm. \"Anyway thanks Nurse Joy. I really appreciate it.\" Ash said giving a bow. Nurse Joy let out a cute chuckle<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't mention it. After all, you scratched my back, so I scratched yours as the old saying goes\" Nurse Joy explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still, thank you so much.\" Ash explained shaking Nurse Joy's hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again don't mention it. Anyway, the tournament is being put off for a day due to the sudden influx of eager trainers.\" Nurse Joy explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh heh. Guess that means more challenge. Heh heh. Mind if I see the roster?\" Ash asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, here you go.\" Nurse Joy replied, handing Ash the roster.  Ash quickly scanned through each name, and soon saw why the tournament was postponed for a day. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Ash softly exclaimed as he continued down the list \"... Everyone registered. Heh heh. Guess it's gonna be even more fun.\" Ash quickly smiled and handed back the roster. \"Thanks Nurse Joy. I can't wait for tomorrow!\" Ash cheered before quickly running off towards the Pok\u00e9mon Center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That boy, heh heh, he sure is something.\"  Nurse Joy chuckled, before turning to Audino to resuming packing up.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Later that night, after Ash had told Nurse Joy which three Pok\u00e9mon he'd be using, Ash had found himself in his room, with Misty cuddling up beside him in her under garments. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Ash muttered aloud as he looked up at the ceiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something wrong?\" Misty asked, concerned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh no, I'm fine.\" Ash explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thinking about the tournament?\" Misty asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How'd you know?\" Ash asked, a little surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ash Ketchum, after all this time, do you really think I don't know when you're getting antsy over an upcoming battle?\" Misty laughed, gently poking Ash in the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow. Eh heh guess I can't hide anything from you, can I?\" Ash asked, giving a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, now shut up and kiss me, master.\" Misty said with a lustful smirk, before quickly locking lips with her true love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral hours later, Ash was lying absolutely naked, with an equally naked Misty lying on top of him. Ash and Misty had just had a wonderful night of rekindling, especially since both of them were drenched with sweat. Misty looked especially happy what with the amount of vivid fluid that somewhat coated her mouth and vaginal region.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah~! I love you Ash...\" Misty mumbled in her sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmm...I love you too Misty...\" Ash mumbled back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two slept soundly for another few minutes, before the door to their room mysteriously opened. A shadowy figure entered the room quietly, almost as if it was floating in the air. The figure approached the bed of the two lovers, and smiled before gently lifting Misty up, before turning around. The figure gently laid Misty on the bed, carefully tucked her in, and then turned back to Ash. The figure let out a small giggle before approaching Ash, and gently placing him on it's back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Time for some alone time at last!' The figure mentally cheered, jumping a little in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mmmm...?\" Ash mumbled as one of his eyes slowly opened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh no! Umm... quick, think fast!' The figure thought, before quickly realizing what it had to do. The figure quickly flipped Ash around and began to rock him in it's arms while also singing a gentle lullaby in order to lull Ash back to sleep. Ash's eyes soon closed once more after mentioning something about his mother. Perhaps he was remembering something from back before his Pok\u00e9mon journey even began? The figured wondered as it slowly left the room, being sure to close the door on it's way out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA unknown amount of time later, Ash laid up against a tree in the middle of a forest, still snoozing away, but for some reason, he was wearing his jacket and pants. It was a little chilly at this late hour, so perhaps that was the reason? Of course it was. I mean the being who abducted Ash didn't want him to freeze now did it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Ash began to waken and upon opening his eyes he saw...</span></div></div>",

He was thinking about the upcoming Chunin exam and how Pervy-Sage had been working him to the bone.

For some reason she had requested himself and Shikamaru to come to her office because of some top secret thing, but it had interrupted his ramen time. Shikamaru was in a similar mind set, but his interrupted time was that of his favorite activity, cloud watching. As the two entered the Hokage's office, they both knew something was going on. It wasn't just the fact that Jiraiya was there as well as the 5th Hokage, but the fact that they both spotted a body that they both recognized<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why the heck did you call us here to look at a dead sound ninja body Grandma!?\" Naruto shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade sighed when Naruto used his nickname of her, but let it slide. \"Why I called you two here, is because of a certain reason that involves this body.\" She replied. \"I know you both probably recognize it, but this is the body of the kunoichi of the Sound Five, the flute user.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why did you bring us here to look at that troublesome Tayuya's body?\" Shikamaru asked, slightly intrigued as to the fact that Tayuya's body showed no sign of injury.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's why I'm here.\" Jiraiya said. \"Recently I managed to stumble across a jutsu that allows us to turn bodies of the departed into suits, allowing a person to where that suit and take on that persona, the perfect disguise as long as no one realises that the person is dead.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this helps us how?\" Naruto asked. \"I'm pretty sure that snake jerk knows she's dead right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru nodded. \"Naruto's right, aren't those seals supposed to link them to... him.\" He said, then widened his eyes in realization. \"I see, you want to observe the cursed seal without Orochimaru knowing, so you want one of us to enter the Tayuya suit and observe it's effects, and because she's dead it's no longer connected to him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Close Shikamaru, but not quite.\" Tsunade said. \"We want Naruto to try it out for two reasons. The first is that he probably has a better ear for music than you do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru groaned. \"Oh yeah, almost forgot about that.\" He conceeded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya struggled to stop himself from drooling as he said \"Also, Naruto has more experience as a women with his Sexy Jutsu.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto groaned. \"Of course you would find a way to drag that into this Pervy Sage!\" He grumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I told you not to call me that!\" Jiraiya shouted back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade sighed. \"As disgusting as it is, Naruto, he speaks the truth. So will you try out this experiment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed as well. \"Sure, but only if I get something out of this.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How does ramen paid for life at Ichiraku's sound?\" Tsunade suggested with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, I agree!\" Naruto shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShikamaru sighed, \"It's troublesome, but I might as well, too troublesome otherwise.\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jiraiya, start the jutsu!\" Tsunade commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJiraiya sighed as he approached the body. \"This will take a few minutes, Necrosuit jutsu!\" He shouted after quickly going through several hand signs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the way Lady Hokage\" Shikamaru began. \"Why has her body been cleaned up, does it make much of a difference?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually it does.\" A new voice, that of Sakura's, said as said kunoichi appeared from a connecting room. \"The body has to be completely clean and undamaged in the skin for the jutsu to work, so Lady Tsunade had to take precautions fixing her up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTsunade grinned. \"It's good to know that you're studying these things Sakura, have you got the extra things prepared for Naruto?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura nodded, then whispered to Naruto. \"She means a few changes of clothing for any long term experiments, as well as a spare headband, to complete the disguise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later Jiraiya smiled as a small cloud of smoke appeared over Tayuya's body, which then became flat, as if, and rather realistically, all the bones had been removed. \"So when am I supposed to try this thing on?\" Naruto asked.</span></div></div>",

What is it?\"  She asked, obviously having read the caller ID.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, no, its Amy!  Tails wanted me to ask you if you wanted to come help him test something that'd help preserve your beauty.  I just tried it out, and he wants a larger sample size or whatever that means.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge paused lightly, 'hmm'ing as she thought about it.  \"I'll stop by in a bit, but I'm gonna want more details when I get there...\"  She said as she hung up.  At that, Amy looked back into the mirror, smirking again as she stretched.  \"Oh, Tails, I'm so glad you crawled into me...  I'm sure Rouge is gonna love it, too.\"  She said to herself, the fox inside of her enjoying being able to animate her mind with his thoughts.  It felt less like controlling her directly, and more like having her on auto-pilot...  Though she still followed his exact orders, spoke his words and moved the way he wanted to, she did it in her own way.  Like her mind was still active, but was completely under his control.  Or was it that he was in full control and she was influencing his actions...?  She couldn't really tell, but it was fun either way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge soon arrived at Tails' workshop, Amy becoming giddy with excitement at having Rouge as a suit as she welcomed her in.  \"Tails had to leave, but he showed me how to work the thing, its dead simple.  Just a press of the button.\"  She said, grabbing her hand and practically dragging her over to the chamber as Rouge went wide-eyed, lurching forward as the pink hedgehog began dragging her to the machine.  \"Just hang on a second, pinkie!  What exactly is this thing gonna do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blinked, smiling lightly.  \"Oh, Tails said that was a trade secret, but that its a formula he designed himself...  He said it was like, uhhhh...  You know, he said a lot of things that went over my head, actually...\"  She grinned, posing.  \"But here I am, cute as ever!\"  She blew a kiss, smiling.  Tails had to let Amy's personality go on by itself for a while, he couldn't bear saying these next few words...  Amy wouldn't have a choice in the matter but to stop chasing his best friend...  The very thought creeped him out a bit.  \"My darling Sonic won't be able to resist me once I get a couple more treatments, I bet!\"</span></div></div>",

The nanites began to flow inside as Rouge began feeling her extremities go numb and...  Hollow.  \"What the... What's...  Going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes went extremely wide as she saw Amy began wriggling her fingers beneath her chin, pulling her face up...  To reveal Tails.  He blinked lightly at the sudden change in his thought patterns snapped back to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool invention, huh, Rouge?\"  He chuckled as he let Amy's head dangle behind her back.  He took a step forward as Rouge's arms entirely deflated.  She continued struggling.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tails, you little bastard!\"  She called out in anger as he laughed.  \"Amy seems to like it just fine.  She likes having my brain inside hers.  I'm sure you will, too, Rouge.  Though, we may need to get you a change in occupation.  I'm not sure I'll be comfortable being a jewel thief...  Though your brain might make it so I change my mind.  Hmmm...  I guess that requires some further study.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRouge couldn't get a word in edgewise as her head deflated, her body falling to the floor, empty and hollow as he grinned, sliding the rest of Amy's body off of him as he went to retrieve Rouge's body and began to slip it on as well.  It was much different from putting Amy on, her more adult body more apparent as he slid into her slowly, feeling the familiar tingle of the nanites linking her into him.  Once his legs were in, he gave a gasp as he felt Rouge's skintight bodysuit rub against his new, sensitive and decidedly feminine skin in ways that Amy's dress simply didn't for her.  Already, he nearly buckled over at the newfound sensations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gotta...  Gotta get her on...  So her mind can...  Buffer some of this...  Ohhh...\"  He blushed, pulling her torso up as his tails were vanished into the suit by the nanites once more, their mass going to fill...  Other assets as Rouge's wings began to flap...  Tails buckling over again as her breasts became his.  He took Rouge's hands, brushing them lightly as he blushed.  \"I...  I've gotta...  Finish this...  Ohhhh...\"  He grabbed Rouge's head like a hood, sliding it over his as the final changes began...</span></div></div>",

Tails pushed Rouge's autopilot back into the background for now, feeling a little disoriented at the change to being in direct control rather than influencing a simulation of her mind as she pleasured herself, finishing what putting on her skin had started.

As a Huntsman in Training, he was one of many students working toward becoming warriors to face the forces of darkness known as Grimm. It was dangerous work, but it was a dangerous world. Unlike the other students, Jaune did not have prior training. He forged his way into Beacon through fake transcripts. It was only dumb luck that he passed initiation. That and his partner saving his butt. Still, being the weakest student there meant he lost in Combat Classes all the time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason he was walking around the grounds was because of his recent loss and he wanted to cool off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kept losing to Cardin, a huge bully, and it frustrated him. Pyrrha, his partner, helped train him and he was improving, just not fast enough. He at least could last several minutes in a fight now instead of being one-sidedly overpowered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething shiny gleamed on the ground and drew his attention away his depression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d He thought and picked it up. It kind of looked like a simple remote with two main buttons. One green and one Red. He had no idea what this was, but it felt important. Like he knew he shouldn\u2019t just ignore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJaune!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomeone had snuck up on him and he turned around in shock. His finger slipped and hit the red button. A thin beam of light hit the girl and she began to deflate like a balloon losing all its air.

He stuck a hand down her mouth and saw the throat and chest expand. Quickly taking it out, he held her up. The skin skipped out of the clothes and Jaune got a full view. Ruby had always been cute, but the suit was far from it. The only thing that still resembled her was the hair. Looking at her back, there was a hole. He set her down and used both hands to see if it stretched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe realized he could actually get in there if he wanted.

He read the sheet, which read \"Congratulations, you are the owner of a Bgun, otherwise known as a bimbofication gun. This gun can turn any girl you shoot with it into a bimbo. It will only work with men and because it will recognise similar DNA, doesn't work on closely related family members.

Mimi moaned as she felt her lips grow fuller, her breasts grow to at least a 36 E cup, and her butt expand likewise.

Zola sighed. 'Maybe that skill requires a non-light influenced shadow to work.' She reasoned, when suddenly a reddish/pinkish glow surrounded her, which was closely followed by a long string of curses, most of which haven't been discovered by humanity despite being said in several languages. As the glow intensified, Zola's breasts started to expand to several cup sizes larger than even Bouquet's massive mammaries, with her bum expanding slightly larger so that it wouldn't look entirely out of place. Also her lips started to swell slightly and turned into a crimsonish color. Zola groaned. \"Oh great, this is like, the worst part.\" She said, then covered her mouth in shock as she felt her wits start to disappear. Unfortunately for the darkness this meant that, due to the strong connection that it had with Zola, its power started to weaken. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo complete the transformation, the wits that Zola had lost were replaced with a complete devotion to Shu. \"Like, sorry for all of this destruction Master Shu.\" She giggled out, her voice sounding out of place with her words (Note: For those of you who don't know, Zola's demonic form has an extremely deep and demonic voice\").<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master?\" The other shadow wielders shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShu scratched the back of his head. \"Uh yeah, should've remembered that part.\" Shu muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like hell you didn't remember that part, that's a seriously perverted technique!\" Kluke shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It wasn't his fault, I encouraged him to use it.\" Blue Dragon pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Either way, know we can go and stop the darkness, it should be weakened now.\" Shu pointed out, then turned to Zola. \"Zola, can you help with that in anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat is her answer?</span></div></div>",

Zola floated down besides Shu and shouted. \"Like, I've got enough dark stuff stored and ready.\" Zola giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEach of the seven other shadow wielders started concentrating their energy on sealing the darkness, but due to the combined effect of the power stolen by Zola and the power reduction due to Zola's bimboisation, this didn't take too long. As each person went on their separate ways, Shu turned to Zola who had returned to her human form. Zola's changes remained the same, except she also had purple eye shadow on her eyes.\"So, what should we do now?\" Shu asked.</span></div></div>",

Note: If a girl doesn't have an emotion, then the mirror won't work on her if the boy tries to unleash the emotion, for example, Larxene from the Organization in Kingdom Hearts is immune since she has no emotions, she only pretends to, and if someone doesn't have a reflection, the mirror won't work on them at all.</span></div></div>",

Upon looking into the scroll, the first Jutsu he saw was the Shadow Clone Jutsu.  He was never any good at clones but it was worth trying out. He practiced a lot, before finally mastering it. Hearing footsteps approaching him, he knew he had to hurry. Before he saw more Jutsu he saw a weird looking seal hidden rather well, which he unlocked, causing a jewel to fall out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" He asked himself, picking it up. It immediately lodged itself onto its head before disappearing, like it was never there. He groaned in pain as he felt himself turn spiritual. \"Wh, what?\" He asked focusing a bit before becoming solid again.  He blinked in confusion. Trying again he turned into a spirit again, this time he saw his own body standing there. He went back in it gaining full control, then he focused one more time and turned spiritual again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, I have ghost powers.\" He grinned. \"I'll be a ninja for sure.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are!\" Iruka shouted.\"Do you have any idea what you've done?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look! Iruka sensei! I passed the test by doing what Mizuki sensei asked, am I a ninja now?!\" He asked. Iruka was confused before the man in question arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good work demon, I'll be taking the scroll now.\" Mizuki grinned evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mizuki, what is the meaning of this?!\" Iruka shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm using this demon to gain power, what does it look like?\" He cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop calling me that!\" Naruto shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's what you are, and you want to know why?\" Mizuki smirked evilly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, it's forbidden!\" Iruka pleaded but it fell on deaf ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are the Kyuubi! After the Fourth Hokage sealed you in your new body, you became a demon!\"  He shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Naruto was confused. \"Iruka, is this true?\" He looked away in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You had the Kyuubi sealed in you... but you are not the fox.\" Iruka told him firmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lying to him will get you nowhere!\" Mizuki cackled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave him alone! I don't care what you say, I'm no demon!\" Naruto shouted as he went into his battle pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever helps you sleep at night demon, prepare to die!\" Mizuki shouted charging at him.</span></div></div>",

Teuchi was gave a horrified look towards his daughter, not knowing what to say or think.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know, I saw a light in her and I felt the urge to grab it, when I did I absorbed it.\" Naruto began, \"Next thing I knew, she was like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Naruto can do so much with this...</i> Hinata thought, imagining Naruto taking control of her, able to make her do anything he wanted, no matter how embarrassing or perverted, causing her to get damp down below again as her legs began clenching together repeatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Ayame I didn't mean to...\"  Hinata heard Ayame begin, snapping her out of it, as she saw the waitress looking confused at the sound of her voice and looking around. \"Ayame you're okay!\" The obviously possessed girl said, before she paused for a second. \"Why are you copying what I'm saying?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, Naruto?\" Iruka said, getting her attention, and pointed to the mirror behind her, confused, Naruto turned around and saw Ayame's reflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ayame?\" She said, and began performing different actions, ending with putting a hand to her face, all of which her refection did as well. \"What?\" After Naruto came to terms with having possessed Ayame, the waitress's eyes widened. \"I even know everything she knows!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Hinata imagined herself in the waitress's position, Naruto, not only being able to order her to do anything, but be able to take over her and make her do as he wished, or use her to do anything he wished without her having any say in the matter, without anyone knowing he was involved, and being able to know every little secret she might have, and able to exploit them. She quickly snapped herself out of it, before her imagination could get even more carried away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ayame, follow us.\" Naruto ordered as they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Master.\"  She obeyed, mindlessly following them to the Hokage, Hinata stealthily following behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had arrived at the Hokage's office, and Naruto and Iruka had filled the village leader on everything that happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see, to think a powerful gem like that went unnoticed, as though you were meant to have it.\" He mused. \"From what I can tell the light you stole was her soul, I'd heard rumors of such a thing was possible but I disregarded it as mere hearsay, though now I wish I'd payed more attention.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can she be fixed?\" Teuchi pleaded. Hiruzen looked saddened, before revealing that all the stories he'd heard said otherwise, making Naruto more depressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"However, there might be a loophole, you said she obeys your every command correct?\" The Hokage began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, why?\" Naruto wondered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if you were to order her to act like she has a soul?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That might work, give it a try Naruto.\" Iruka urged on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, Ayame act like you have a soul.\" Naruto ordered, and she blinked as emotion returned to her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My goodness, that was a nap.\" Ayame said as she stretched. She then turned around and bowed to Naruto. \"Hello Master, did you bring me here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It worked!\" Teuchi cheered. \"She still obeys him, but I'll take it at this point.\" Ayame blinked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, so I do, it's alright father, I don't mind.\" She shrugged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, she acts like she has a soul, but she still doesn't have one...\" Iruka mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's better than nothing.\" Teuchi said. \"So what now?\" He asked, to which Hiruzen mentioned it needed to be kept private, but then Naruto decided to get something important off his chest, showing his anger about being continuously lied to with things covered up, before leaving the office in anger after finding out that the Hokage was still hiding things that would be important to Naruto from him and wouldn't tell him what they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait for me Master!\" Ayame ran to catch up to him. Hinata was hidden well enough that they didn't notice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Naruto...</i> The heiress thought in depression, wanting to go after him, but the constant verbal abuse from her clan including being called a failure by everyone in the clan especially by her father, had left a mark on her psyche, leaving her with no self-esteem, or self-worth. <i>What can I do, I'm worthless, everyone tells me that all the time... but even if don't have any worth, maybe my body can. I'm sure Naruto can use my body to do great things!</i> Hinata gave a slight nod to show her determination to her plan, before heading off to find her body's future owner.</span></div></div>",

With that decision made she followed the two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Naruto seething in rage paid no attention to anything until a voice called to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master.\" Ayame panted as she caught up to him, Naruto turned to her as she hugged him. \"I'm here for you Master.\" Naruto sighed, it's his fault she's like this, that the old Ayame is gone forever and in her place is this shell of a body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Ayame.\" He sadly muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong Master?\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I made you like this, I'm sorry.\" He said with regret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine Master, I know I'm in great care.\" Ayame assured.

Naruto seemed to perk up a bit,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have to call me Master?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wish me to stop, then I will.\" Ayame told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish it, I don't want slaves.\" He sighed, since she was his forever he may as well have her be as normal as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well Naruto.\" She obeyed. Naruto gave a sad smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I can't undo this but I'll take care of you, I promise.\" He swore, Ayame nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Naruto.\" She replied and gave him another kiss, he smiled at this, maybe this won't be so bad after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\" A voice interrupted as Ino caught up to them, and got it front of them. \"You're not leaving that easy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away Ino, I'm not in the mood.\" Naruto brushed her off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if, I heard her call you Master.\" Ino responded pointed to Ayame. \"I want to know why.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must've misheard me Ino.\" Ayame defended her Master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pretty sure I didn't.\" Ino insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's on a need to know basis, as in you don't need to know.\" Naruto told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you say that, now I do.\" Ino would not relent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you even care, you hate me, remember?\" Naruto spat. \"Oh let me guess you want to 'save' her from my corruption, Kami forbid I have people that like me, go to hell Ino!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno was flabbergasted at Naruto's attitude, not once did she hear him talk like that, her eyes narrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what crawled up your ass Naruto but I'm not leaving until you tell me.\" Ino demanded<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop pretending you care.\" Naruto growled \"Why is this such a concern to you, to fulfill your gossiping needs?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Ino began unable to defend that, she hated being caught.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I thought, now go chase your precious Uchiha like a good little lap dog, I have better things to do.\" Naruto snorted as he walked by her, Ayame following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How, how dare you?!\" She growled, wanting to take a page out of Sakura's book she went to punch him, but Naruto, not in the mood, caught the attack, all the while he saw her soul like he did with Ayame's. The urge to grab it came back, but this time, he ignored it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not anyone's punching bag anymore, if you see Sakura, tell her the same thing, her days of hitting me are over.\" He snarled and threw her across the street as she landed on her ass. He glared at her some more before walking away again, Ayame in tow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIno slowly got up, now really mad, as she yelled and charged him. Naruto sighed and readied to defend himself. He dodged another of her attacks, then another, before hitting her in the stomach causing her to double over and gasp for air. He really wrenched it in there for added effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop now, or I will show you no mercy.\" He warned, but little did he know, his hand was near her soul, when he looked down, he realized his error. <i>Shit no!</i>  He tried to pull away, but it was too late, the soul went towards his hand like a fly to a light, and he couldn't pull away until after it was absorbed, Ino stood there motionless no longer concerned about being attacked her eyes were blank and she nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Master I will stop.\" She mentioned in a monotone voice as she stood there in a stopped motion, awaiting her next order.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, no!\" Naruto cursed. \"If my hand goes anywhere near the soul I absorb it?! Damn it to hell!\" He spat and cursed. Ayame took the time to soothe his rage. This had the desired effect as he calmed down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks Ayame, damn it, now I have to tell Inoichi and his wife.\" He cursed \"Can't do anything about it though, Ino act like you have a soul.\" Ino blinked and bowed to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Master, how are you today?\" Ino asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't call me Master first of all.\" He ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well Naruto.\" Ino complied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well can't be help, we're going to have to pay a visit to Ino's parents first, let's go.\" He told them with Ayame and Ino following him. Little did they know Hinata was following in the shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Naruto, I hope you'll do this to me next, I want my body to be of great use to you.</i> She thought, as she continued following him.</span></div></div>",

Upon saying this, he sat on his bed, took off his sandals, and tossed them to the side. As this was going on, 'Ino' began to sashay towards him, causing 'Naruto' to not be able to take his eyes off of her as he watched her widely swaying hips. When she reached him, she sat down facing him on his lap, with her vagina on top of the crotch area of his pants, laying on her knees on the bed with her legs around his waist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kiss me.\" 'Ino' said, to which 'Naruto' nodded, leaning in, and making contact with her lips, upon which they quickly opened their mouths, and began having their tongues dance around each other. While this was going on, 'Ino' had brought her right hand to the zipper of 'Naruto's' jacket, and her left hand down into his pants to rest on his penis, which she wrapped the hand in question around, while 'Naruto' placed his right hand on her cheek and his left onto her thigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Ino' pulled the zipper down, and tossed the jacket to the side, which slowly rubbing his penis sensually, causing it to stand at attention, while he began to caress her face and thigh, before he moved that down into her vagina, and, using the memory of where he found it before, began fingering her clit. This caused both to moan into each other's mouths, as 'Ino's' vagina got wetter, and her nipples became erect. They pulled away, panting heavily, as their faces were flushed with lustful expressions on them as 'Ino' removed 'Naruto's' undershirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Naruto' leaned in and began peppering 'Ino' with kisses, going from her breasts, grazing her still erect nipples, all the way up to her neck, causing her to moan repeatedly, before putting both of this hands on her cheeks, and leaning back in to once again take her lips, while rolling around so that her back was to the bed, after which, he pushed forward a little, guiding her down until her back was on the bed. At that point, their lips parted, and he move his hands to her breasts, which he began to caress, while rolling her nipples between his thumb and forefinger as she removed his pants and underwear. 'Naruto' then nibbled on 'Ino's' super erect and sensitive nipples, causing 'Ino' to feel a feeling go through her body that she could only describe as a jolt from her breasts down to her vagina as she cried out in ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two spun around again, so that 'Ino' was on top, then they sat up with 'Ino's' knees on the ground this time, and then 'Ino' leaned down to face 'Naruto's' penis. It was a surreal experience, because that penis was attached to her all of her life when she was in that body, but she leaned in, and began kissing it, as she began massaging it with her right hand, and the balls with her left, causing 'Naruto' to moan this time, before 'Ino' leaned in, and took it into her mouth, licking it all over as she sucked it and moved in and out repeatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress! I'm gonna cum!\" 'Naruto' cried out, ready to remove his erect member.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>It's alright, I'm ready to try it.</i> 'Ino' sent to him mentally, using connection between them due to the gem to convey her thoughts. After receiving that message, 'Naruto' grabbed the back of 'Ino's' head, and thrusted forwards, shoving his penis into the back of her throat, and holding her head there, as he unloaded, and shot his cum down her throat. He was still cumming when he pulled out, and which resulted in his juices running down 'Ino's' mouth as if she was drooling cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, it's time, take me!\" 'Ino' said in a tone that would brook no argument if her partner would be able to refuse as she got back on his lap, and got in the position she was in when he had his clothes on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mistress!\" 'Naruto' obeyed, aligning his penis with her vagina. They both thrust forwards, sheathing 'Naruto's' sword deep inside of 'Ino's' womb, and tearing her hymen, which caused her to cry out in pain, which was muffled by 'Naruto' placing his open mouth over hers and making out with her again as he began massaging and caressing her slowly to ease the pain. When 'Ino' had adjusted to the feeling with the pain subsiding, she pulled back, ending the kiss and removing her vagina from her partner's penis, although she noted to herself that she felt a longing down there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, I'm ready to continue.\" 'Ino said.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Forgive me, Mistress, but I don't understand.\" 'Naruto' began. \"Why would you do that yourself, why didn't you just leave her body to feel the pain, and then just go back afterwards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I took everything that made the real Ino away from her.\" 'Ino' began. \"I only find it fair that I take on that pain for them. Now, let's continue.\" They adjusted positions so that 'Ino' was laying back, partially hanging over the bed, only not falling off due to 'Naruto' having a firm grip on her arms, just below the shoulders. Her legs spread wide, and her knees were bent in and pulled up against her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Naruto' adjusted her legs so that when she extended them, they were hanging over his shoulders, aligned his penis with her vagina, and thrust in quickly and repeatedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes! Yes! Yes!\" 'Ino' shouted, lost in ecstasy. \"Faster! Harder! Fill me with your seed!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mistress! With pleasure!\" 'Naruto' cried out in pleasure, speeded up and going rougher. This continued for a while until... \"Mistress, I'm going to cum again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let it out inside me! Paint my womb with your seed to the point I'd get pregnant if I didn't use the jutsu!\" 'Ino' cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Mistress!\" 'Naruto' cried out as he gave one final thrust, his penis bulging as he deposited his load directly into her womb, causing both to cry out as they collapsed on the bed, 'Ino's' legs leaving their perches, and wrapping her arms around 'Naruto,' who did the same, with 'Ino' snuggling her head sideways into the crook of 'Naruto's' neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Hinata was flushed a deep red, her Byakugan activated, having heard them as they began, and wanting give Naruto some time to do the deed with one of his new bodies. Fortunately, as no one wanted to live next to the 'demon brat,' their lovemaking went otherwise unnoticed. Hinata had used her Byakugan to see through the wall, and imagining it was her body Naruto was using instead of Ino's. Seeing them stop, and collapse on the bed, she raised her hand to knock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n*Knock, knock, knock!*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two were jolted to alertness, at the sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hold on a minute!\" 'Naruto' shouted, getting up, and helping 'Ino' to her feet, only to find that she was too drained of energy to be able to stand, and only stayed upright due to 'Naruto' gripping her. Naruto then left Ino's body and returned to his own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, I hope you enjoyed thhaattt.\" Ino moaned, drawing out the final word as he lied her down on the bed, and covered her up with a blanket before getting dressed in his pants and undershirt, foregoing the rest for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did indeed, now, I just need to go and check on who's here.\" He responded, leaning down, and giving a caste kiss to the lips of the body he was just using, and going to his living room, where he opened the door, and saw the Hyuga Heiress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"H-Hello, Naruto.\" Hinata greeted with a stutter.</span></div></div>",

He repossessed her and began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, Naruto, get ready to claim me!\" 'Hinata' commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At once, Mistress!\" 'Naruto' obeyed as 'he' went to 'her' and kissed 'her.' The two continued to kiss as 'Naruto' began running 'his' hands down 'Hinata's' body until they got to the bottom of 'her' shirt, and lifted it up as 'Hinata' unzipped 'Naruto's' jacket, they broke the kiss just long enough to get 'Hinata's' shirt over 'her' head, and toss it to the side, leaving 'her' breasts to only be covered by a bra. They got back to kissing, as 'Naruto' reached 'his' hand to 'Hinata's' back, and started fiddling with 'her' bra, eventually unclasping it, and throwing it to the side. They pulled back a little, and 'Naruto' stared at 'Hinata's' breasts, which were rising and falling with every breath. 'Naruto' pulled 'his' hands up, with them in a grasping position, looking as if 'he' longed to grab ahold of them, but holding 'himself' back. 'Hinata' saw this, then gave a sly smile, cupped them from underneath, and lifted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's ok, these are the property of Naruto Uzumaki.\" 'She' said. \"You can touch these to your heart's content at any point.\" 'Naruto' finally placed 'his' hands where 'Hinata' had put 'hers', as 'she' took them away, their hands touching briefly. 'Naruto' caressed and kneaded them, causing 'Hinata' to get between 'her' legs, as 'she' unzipped 'Naruto's' pants, and began giving 'him' a hand job as 'he' stepped out of them. 'Naruto' eventually quit enjoying 'himself' with the two orbs, and, instead, snaked 'his' hand down below to slip it inside 'her' pants and into 'her' vagina, which 'he' started playing with as 'he' began removing 'her' pants and underwear, with help from 'her,' after she removed 'her' hands from 'his' penis to assist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of them began kissing more, before 'Hinata' went on the ground and watched as 'Naruto' guided 'his' member into 'her.'  With one thrust, 'Hinata' groaned in pain again. They waited for a while, to make sure the pain went away, and when it did, 'he' began to thrust into 'her.' The two of them found a steady rhythm as they went faster moaning as they did.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually their climax was building as 'Hinata' readied an Anti Pregnancy Jutsu and used it.  After a few more minutes their climax hit and both of them cried out in bliss. They regained their senses as they kissed once more, before Naruto left Hinata, and entered his body once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, Master.\" Hinata cooed. Naruto smiled and looked at Ayame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your turn now.\" He purred as he approached her.</span></div></div>",

Anko's hand found his erection and began to stroke it while Naruto went to her womanhood and began using his fingers to pump them into her.  Both of them cried out in joy as they felt each other pleasure one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnko used her other hand to travel to her breasts and worked them, Naruto helped her out with his own hand, she smiled at this as they began to work each other faster.  After a while of ministrations she stopped and got on top of him with a smirk of mischief.  Taking a hold of his member she guided it into herself and slammed hard and fast moaning in joy at the contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going easy is for wimps, I like it hard and fast.\"  She cooed as she rode him in that speed, using an Anti Pregnancy Jutsu in the process.  She rode him faster and faster, and guided his hands to her breasts and he began to work them, she grinned hard as he did so and she rewarded him by going even faster.  After a few minutes of riding him and moaning, she finally came as did he, she felt such pleasure when she felt his cum go inside her.  Getting off him she kissed him hard and winked at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was great Master.\"  She praised \"Rest up, I believe Sakura is just about finished cleaning your apartment and wants a turn now.\"  Naruto smirked at that and went to check up on her, not caring at all about his nudity. </span></div></div>",

It wasn't long before 'she' stood naked before 'him' and the two began making out once more. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Naruto' took this time to pleasure 'her' womanhood as 'she' moaned at this, getting use to this by now.  Eventually the two wrestled to the ground with 'his' erection positioned to 'her' vulva.  With a nod 'he' slowly inserted himself inside 'her' and with a thrust ended 'her' maidenhood.  Once the pain went away, the two began humping one another and 'her' legs wrapped around 'his' waist, both of them had a steady pace while 'she' used the Anti Pregnancy Jutsu.  The two of them went faster and faster before finally they climaxed together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of them were panting, and Naruto took this time to re enter his body, Sakura gazed upon him with a look of approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I never felt more complete.\"  Sakura sighed \"So much time wasted on Sasuke, when I could've had this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you have it now, and you'll get more later, speaking of the teme we have to set up a scenario where you renounce him.\"  He told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With pleasure Master, I'm over him now.\"  She smiled as they kissed some more. </span></div></div>",

All the while Kurenai was watching them head to his apartment with a glare, completely unaware of what transpired earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't let you have anyone else pervert!\"  She growled and went to make her move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Meanwhile</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe 'enemy' ninja returned to ROOT headquarters and bowed to Danzo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's done.\"  He told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excellent, now she'll warm her way into his heart and by proxy I'll earn his trust as I was the one that saved her, it's only a matter of time.\"  He smiled that his plan was coming together.</span></div></div>",

He watched it get absorbed before saying \"Kurenai, act like you have a soul.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sprung to life and bowed her head at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for showing me mercy Master.\"  She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me Master in private.\"  He ordered before turning to Hiruzen \"Lord Hokage, I haven't forgiven you yet, but I'll give you a chance to make it up to me, just give me time and we'll talk.\"  Hiruzen smiled a bit and nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No problem.\"  He said as he and the rest of the ANBU disappeared, Asuma stayed behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Take care of her.\"  He mentioned before vanishing himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then, let's head back.\"  He told them.  The girls nodded and followed him back to the apartment, Sarada still holding on to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess we both serve him now.\"  Kurenai mentioned walking with Anko.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do and we don't, he doesn't abuse his power and gives us what we want since our souls are with him now, his desires are ours and vice versa.\"  Anko explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\"  Kurenai mentioned, she figured he'll have fun with her at some point, as she found herself wanting it. <i>I wonder what it's like.</i>  She hoped he'll do it with her when the get back, as they continued walking to his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He turned his attention back to Sarada \"Shall we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't wait Master.\"  She cooed and went up to kiss him, the two of them slowly undressed one another until both of them were naked. Sarada blushed at seeing him and he in turn liked what he saw too, for some reason she reminded him of a young Sakura mixed with Sasuke but that's probably just his imagination.  Turning into a spirit and leaving his body, he flew in to possess her, 'Sarada' sprung to life and grinned at 'her' body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to get to work 'Naruto.'\"  'Sarada' grinned at him, as 'she' removed 'her' glasses and put them on the table where they'll be safe.  'She' found her vision to be a bit blurry but not unmanageable.  'She' did find it weird 'her' memories were blurry save for what 'she' already told them, maybe the poor girl was suffering from traumatic memory loss due to the incident and her kidnapping, maybe 'she'll' get Ino or her father to check this later, right now though he wanted to have some fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course Mistress.\" 'Naruto' complied as 'he' went up to 'her' and kissed 'her.'

After the pain was gone, 'he' brought 'her' up and down his' lap, as their crotches connected in a thrusting motion, they moaned in bliss from this, 'she' took this time to fondle 'her' breasts liking how they feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't know the Anti Pregnancy Jutsu, get ready to pull out.\"  'She' told 'him' as she felt her getting close, 'he' nodded at this and allowed her to get off in order to go on 'her' knees and blow 'him' off to finish while 'she' fingered 'herself.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis contiuned for a while until their climaxes hit and 'she' felt 'his' cum enter 'her' mouth as 'she' swallowed.  When they were done he left her body and smiled at her which she returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that was wonderful.\"  She beamed and kissed him.  \"I can't wait for more.\"  She went to go put her glasses back on and her clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good to hear, now go talk with the others, I have Kurenai to attend to.\"  He told her as he went to where she is.  He found her moaning happily as she was stark naked with the Naruto clones massaging her body, focusing on her breasts and vagina, two of them had their erections out and she was taking care of one of them with her hand and the other with her mouth.  The clones stopped to see their boss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're just in time, she's ready.\"  One of them said as they disappeared, Naruto felt the backlash of their actions and was horny because of it.  <i>Huh I felt what they experienced, good to know.</i>  Naruto mused having an idea of how he can train using his shadow clones, but right now he walked towards smiling Kurenai, a sultry look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have me all hot and bothered Master, I hope you'll take responsibility.\"  She purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I intend to.\"  He smiled as he possessed her the same way he did Sarada.

After about a half an hour they came across a strange puddle on the middle of the road, they were a bit confused by this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Odd, it isn't raining.\"  Ino was puzzled, they didn't know what to think before Anko sensed an enemy come from behind him and struck her, the object Anko was standing turned into a pile of snakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Missed.\"  The man grunted as another one appeared looking similar to his ally having a chain in his hand, the other one taking out his chain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like we have to kill the brats first G\u014dzu.\"  The man said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it Meizu.\"  The other man agreed as they charged Naruto, Ino and Hinata.  Thanks to Anko' training they managed to hold their own just fine, Naruto taking out Meizu while Hinata and Ino were handling G\u014dzu.  Hinata disabled his chakra with her strikes and bloodline active while Ino used her family's Jutsu to twist his body in an uncomfortable manner, Naruto meanwhile used his Shadow Clones to attack and distract him while the real one knocked him out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well done!\" Anko said appearing, she grabbed their chains and used it to bind them together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You could've helped.\"  Ino glared at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I knew you could handle it, but the demon brothers being here poses a problem.\"  She glared at Tazuna who was sweating. \"Care to explain?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I have a very powerful man named Gato wanting to kill me, if I finish the bridge his grip on Wave will fall, so he hired very powerful ninja to kill me.\"  He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Meaning this is an A ranked mission, and yet you filed it as C.\"  Anko growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I had no choice, I couldn't afford an A ranked, I needed some protection, anything to help me reach Wave and finish that bridge, please you must help me, I'm sorry I lied but I need your help, please!\"  He begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is beyond our talents, if the demon brothers are here than their leader Zabuza Momochi can't be far behind.\"  Anko mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't abandon them though.\"  Naruto mentioned \"I say we do it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here.\"  Ino agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\"  Hinata agreed as well.  Anko sighed but nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but stay close, even if I trained you for months you're nowhere near ready for Zabuza, those guys you only handled because they were arrogant and went easy on you, Zabuza won't make that mistake.\" Anko warned, the others nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thank you, I swear I'll reward you for this.\"  Tazuna assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No sense staying, let's get going.\"  Anko told them as they continued their journey to Wave with Tazuna still in tow.</span></div></div>",

They were exhausted and Anko was licking her wounds.  Upon the way they thought they heard movement causing Naruto to throw a kunai at the bushes, only to discover a rabbit, they were aghast at first until they realized it was a snow rabbit.  At that point a sword struck them and they got out of the way in time, mist soon covered the feel and Zabuza made his presence known.  He tried intimidation tactics but dealing with Anko they withstood them, Anko fought him alone and was managing until he trapped her in a water bubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis caused the team to deal with him and his clone, they were successful in disabling the clone freeing Anko, she neutralized him with a poison and was about to finish him off when senbon struck him putting him down, a hunter nin came and thanked them for taking care of him the feminine voice said she'd take him to Kiri and disappeared with him.  Anko and the rest of them panted before picking themselves off and continuing onward.  It was there when they arrived in wave and reached Tazuna's house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are, my daughter and her son are inside, I'll have my daughter prepare you something.\"  He told them as they entered the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad!\"  A female voice cried, she had dark blue hair and black eyes, she sighed in relief seeing her father safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm home Tsunami.\"  Tazuna told her.  The woman looked at the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And these are?\"  She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They protected me from harm, I would be dead if it weren't for them, the blonde especially impressed me.\"  He explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't do that much.\"  Naruto answered humbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nonsense, you rallied your team and saved your sensei, if that isn't being a hero I don't know what is.\"  Tazuna replied \"in fact you remind me of my son in law.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you say so.\"  Naruto scratched his head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you have fans now Naruto.\"  Ino teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Getting more popular by the day.\"  Hinata added to the teasing.  Naruto blushed and the girls laughed at this, Anko joined in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you bother?!\"  A voice interrupted they saw a boy wearing a hat, he had black hair and black eyes and was glaring at them \"You'll get yourselves killed, nobody can defeat Gato.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you want this village to suffer kid?\"  Naruto growled \"Good to know you hate your grandfather that much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\"  The boy cried \"Heroes don't exist, just give up!\"  The boy replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Inari that's enough!\"  Tsunami scolded, \"They're here to us, you will help us defeat Gato right?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what we're here for.\"  Naruto replied \"Unlike you whiny brat of a son, I believe heroes do exist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop acting all care free, you ninja's have it way too easy, you don't know a damn thing about suffering.\"  He yelled.  The room went cold and Naruto's eyes narrowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have quite the mouth on you brat.\"  He coldly said \"Do you know what it's like to have people hate you for something that isn't your fault?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does?\"  Inari started before he was cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you?!\"  Naruto shouted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"  Inari admitted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about not having a home, or parents, or anything.\"  Naruto spat \"For the majority of my life I had to live that, the place I'm living in is a dump given to me simply because my Hokage ordered that person, who mind you was keeping things from me and lying to me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto.\"  Anko started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, he needs to hear this.\"  Naruto mentioned \"I had nothing, nobody, I was hated, beaten to near death, called a demon all because I carry a burden I never asked for.\"  \"Tell me, did you ever experience this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"  Inari gasped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Kami.\"  Tsunami agreed, Tazuna looked pale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then shut up.\"  Naruto growled \"You have a home, a family, everyone out there has it worse than you and all you can do is complain.\"  He paused. \"Maybe you want your grandfather to die, and your mother because if we don't stop Gato that's what will happen eventually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....I.\"  Inari stuttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's time to grow up, as bad as you think you have it, people have it worse than you, stop crying and start doing something about it.\"  Naruto advised \"I'm going out to cool off, or I'll say something I'll regret.\"  He went outside to cool off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is what he said true?\"  Tsunami asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More or less.\"  Anko sadly admitted \"He had a very rough life, and he somehow managed to live this long without going insane.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can your village do this to him?!\"  Tsunami demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\"  Anko admitted \"Stupidity and fear does that.\"  An awkward silence emerged before she continued \"At any rate we need to get ready, Zabuza is still alive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He is?!\"  Ino asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the Hunter Nin didn't kill him, which tells me she was working for him, I let it go because we were drained, but he'll need at least a week to recover giving us time to prepare.\"  Anko mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well what are we waiting for?\"  Hinata asked.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about Naruto?\" Ino asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's best we leave him be for now, I'll grab him when I feel he cooled off.\"  Anko told them.  The three of them nodded and went out themselves to train.  Inari stood there in deep thought.</span></div></div>",

She sighed again, as she hoped that this outcome would be better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter she finished cooking the meal she readied it on the table, she went to the door to call her guests in for dinner.  As she left the house and went to find them she looked shocked to see Naruto and a girl she never saw before remove their clothing smiling at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Oh my.</i>  She blushed hard, he wasn't her son so what he did was his own choice, she wanted to turn to leave, to do anything else than be here but she found herself unable to move. She was more shocked when she saw him  leave his body and became a ghost and flew into her body, while his body stood there.  He saw the girl tell him to get ready and him calling her Mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Must be a ninja thing I don't get.</i>  She mused as she watched them kiss and become intimate, she shouldn't watch this, but she find herself glued to the scene, oddly warm down in her crotch, she was resisting the urge to touch herself, <i>what's wrong with me, it's not like I'm deprived of this or anything.</i>  She didn't know what was going on, why she found this arousing, maybe it was because he reminded her of her late husband?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto certainly had his courage and never give up attitude, always wanting to do the right thing, her father told him he stood up to his attacker and pushed to keep him safe not even hesitating in the slightest.  She tried to remind herself she just met him but her body wouldn't listen, eager to stay and treat itself as her hands went further down, one of them reaching for her breast.  She wanted to fight it off but their moans interrupted that and her hands went to work on her private areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I should feel ashamed of myself.</i>  She groaned as she began her ministrations, one hand taking care of her womanhood and the other her breasts, but she doesn't, she actually pictured herself in the girl's place, blushing a bit. <i>Yet I can't deny this is turning me on.</i>  Giving a small apology to her husband she indulged herself a bit more eagerly, if she was going to do this she might as well enjoy her shameful action as she watched the scene unfold.</span></div></div>",

They went at it for a few minutes until their climaxes hit and they felt the aftermath of a good orgasm.  They stayed where they were a bit until 'he' climbed off of her and snuggled next to 'her.'  Naruto took the time to re enter his body as she gave him a grateful look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Master, that was wonderful!\"  She cooed as they kissed some more and gazed at each other's eyes.  A moan interupted their thoughts as they caught Tsunami masturbating furiously at them, she as mostly unclothed as her pants and panties were down working her womanhood and one of her breasts poked through her bra working her breast, she had her eyes closed and was lost in the sensations, her vagina was dripping with arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have a visitor.\"  He grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So we do.\"  She grinned back \"Maybe she would like to have you too?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like it!\"  Naruto nodded as he approached her, he coughed a bit to catch her attention, whisking herself back to reality.  The situation caught up to her as she was blushing profusely and trying to cover herself up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I'm sorry I.\"  Tsunami stammered.  Naruto put a finger on her mouth and gave a smile, she blushed like crazy as he moved to kiss her, she didn't fight it as she found herself kissing back.  Naruto took the time to remove the rest of her clothing which she allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you wanted a turn all you had to do was ask.\"  He grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.\"  She started and nodded \"Please.\"  Naruto smirked and the two of them began kissing, he had no intention on taking her soul, that would be unfair for her son and father but that didn't mean he wouldn't give her a good time.</span></div></div>",

The device syncs with him and can only be used by him, or in the case of him having something like a Pok\u00e9mon, one of them too, also causing them to lose any moral issues with using it. The spirit copies can only enter girls, and when they enter, the spirits can't be removed, and if it is a case of more than one being being able to use the trumpet, a second spirit can't enter a body that a spirit copy already occupies. Pressing a button on the trumpet, while sucking in while aiming it at a girl who has been taken over by the wielder, causes the girl's memories to be sucked into the guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen a girl has been taken over, it will be a case of a hive mind, with the guy feeling, hearing, seeing, and smelling everything the girl does, as well as his own senses. At first, all of the boy's bodies will act in sync until he learns how to control them separately. Due to the sensory issue, if too many girls come under his command too quickly, it can cause an overload, causing him to feel a massive migraine, and have trouble doing anything until he gets it under control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guy can also put the girl(s) into a blank state where they only act on his mental orders. In that case, it needs to be individual commands, commanding her to \"live your life normally\" or something won't work. The commands can be looped if worded that way so that the girl will continuously do it or attempt to until he has her stop. While in this state, he will not share her senses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile a girl is in hive mind state, her eye color will be replaced with the guy's, and while she's in blank state, she'll have her normal eye color, but no pupils. To everyone except for the one controlling her, her eyes will appear normal, and any reflections or images of her will look normal. For example, if Ash used it on Serena, her blue eyes would become the shade of brown as his are, but nobody else would notice, and if he looked at her eyes in a mirror, picture, or screen, he'd see them as their normal color.</span></div></div>",

He put Delia under his control in order to make sure that \"Serena\" and \"Grace\" could move in with the Ketchums, as Ash made the four more comfortable with being naked around the house since he became curious with the female figure, and he could see them naked whenever he wanted from their own eyes anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this moment, Ash was sleeping, with a naked Serena on top of him with both of his bodies having wrapped their arms around each other as they usually do, as Ash had learned after figuring out how to absorb a girl's memories that Serena had feelings for him after saving her in the forest, so the two bodies were always together, and even having sex after having their mothers' bodies and memories help them with their first time, and even joined in later. Soon the door opens as the naked form Grace walks in, like her daughter's body, she had her blue eyes replaced with brown ones, and Ash walks her over to his 10 year old bodies, shaking the two awake as he got ready to receive two first Pok\u00e9mon through his two bodies about to begin their journeys. Grace was making sure to help wash the two, reaching places that the two couldn't reach and even made the two feel good washing a few other places as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon as the two are finished washing, they head down to the kitchen, where Ash walked Delia's body, wearing only an apron, to the table, having just made a big breakfast for all of Ash's bodies, with especially big ones for the younger two. After the two were finished, they put their shoes on as they head off to the Oak ranch after getting some clothes made by \"Delia\" since they had to wear clothes outside of the house (Think their Kalos clothes, the first one for Serena as she has long hair right now).</span></div></div>",

What about a boy receives an orb from the future, which downloads information into his mind, warning of a zombie apocalypse a few years in the future. The origin of the virus including the location of its creation and identity of its creator is unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe orb was filled with a modified version of the virus that caused the disease, which makes those infected similar to robots, but still organic, and like any meant to heal created from a virus, immune to the original. The boy was infected upon touching the orb, and is the master unit, and is able to infect girls, which also makes them his loyal loving slaves. The boy sets out to save as many as possible, whether by infecting them, or finding the source of the infection before it can be released (which also would make them have to infect others in order to increase his search range).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThose infected by the nanobots have all of their senses, along with their strength, speed, endurance, intelligence, and stamina increased greatly, the boy has those happen to a greater degree. They are also aged up or down to being a teenager if they aren't already, along with gaining a healing factor. The girls breast sizes will be enlarged, and if they are related to the boy, their DNA will be altered to prevent incest. Those infected can alter their appearance in order to look like their normal ages in order to avoid others questioning what happened. They are also immune to mind control, mind altering, mind reading (unless they allow it), being possessed, and having their souls removed (unless it is by their own possession abilities).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNanobots can be chaneled into Pok\u00e9 Balls and Digivices. Any Pok\u00e9mon in an infected ball or a Digimon connected to an infected Digivice gets a minor dose of the nanobots even if they are male. These minor infections give the immunity, but not the boosted stats.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSecond option, a guy gets a plant that can swallow girls, putting them into pods, which fill with liquid that consumes them, and puts copies of their bodies into another pod, and puts their minds into the copies, but altered to be obedient to the guy, and permanently madly in love with him. If the girl is related to him, her DNA will be altered. The copied body will have lost any disease, injuries, or disabilities, and may have features changed, such as enlarged breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything non-organic will be in the first pod, with only the bodies being consumed, thus they will come out of the pod nude. The girls will be able to survive on just sunlight and water, but food itself will still give them more nutrients and energy. The plant has tentacles, that if bit down on, can make it so the person can't move, with their bodies basically becoming rag-dolls until the plant allows them to move. The plant can spew a pollen that makes guys ok with what it is doing, and make the owner ok with using it if they normally wouldn't be.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Paradise City, a place whose name was at one point very ironic because of all of the conflict and elitism from the students and teachers of many different duel schools, who thought that they were better as people, since they had better cards and better skills due to being able to afford better education. With the help of a young boy named Yuya Sakaki, along with his friends and comrads, who were dubbed the Lancers, everything changed for the better... until one fateful day...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo one was quite sure what the source was, but one day the citizens suddenly found some of their peers walking oddly, moaning, and with their eyes rolled up as far as they could go. Some tried to go to the people who were behaving strangly to see what was wrong, and to help them out, only to have the people attack them, seeming to try to eat them, several people got bitten, and were brought to the hospital to check for infections. Things quickly went horribly wrong, as within hours of being bitten, said people joined the ranks of their infectors, and began biting others. The Lancers quickly responded, and began quarantining the infected, but struggled to find a solution, fortunately, the infected seemed to lose all higher brain function, and thus could easily be outsmarted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually they settled on one they did not wish, but had no choice. They used their technology, and contacted the other dimensions, negotiating, and agreeing to transfer the people from one of the dimensions (which ended up being the XYZ Dimension, due to already being under repair due to the dimension war recently concluded) to the others, and dropped the infected off in the XYZ dimension, the cutting the connection, so that they couldn't get back, although it could be re-opened so that if any more infected were found, they could be sent through.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Lancers continued patroling for weeks, unable to find any more infected, until one day, Yuya's girlfriend, and fellow Lancer, Zuzu Boyle, suddenly went missing. Days later, Leo Akaba contacted the other dimensions from the Fusion Dimension, and revealed that the infection was going on in the Fusion Dimension, and that Zuzu was seen amongst them! Even worse, she somehow retained her intelligence, theorized by having three other souls sharing her body, while still having the mindset of the infected. This allowed her to co-ordinate the infected, to devistating effect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings quickly went from bad to worse, as Zuzu's dimensional bracelets allowed the infected to jump with her from dimension to dimension, until the Syncro and Fusion Dimensions were completely overrun, and then the full scale zombie invasion came to the Pendulum Dimension, and all heck broke loose. The people of the Pendulum Dimension started getting bitten left and right, making humanity quickly get outnumbered and overwhelmed, in a few short weeks humanity was down to the double digits, with the only Lancers being left being Yuya, Declan Akaba, and Sora Perse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYuya tracked down Zuzu and tried to use her retained intelligence to reason with her, and get her to stop. Unfortunately, it didn't work, although she challenged him to a duel. Yuya tried using his dueltaining to try to appeal to the Zuzu he knew, while Sora used the solid vision of his duel disk summon his monsters to keep the infected off of their backs, while Declan watched over the survivors, including his little sister Riley, while monitoring the situation from their base. To their horror, one of the infected got through Sora's defense and bit Yuya.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Zuzu pleased that Yuya would soon be joining her side, everyone was soon shocked to discover Riley started glowing with a familiar dark energy that they thought was long gone, and went into Yuya, causing him to take on the form of Z-ARC, although unlike previously, it wasn't a monstrous version of Yuya, but instead, Z-ARC's original human form. To everyone's surprise, while Z-ARC took over again, this time he was on humanity's side, and soundly defeated Zuzu, as she didn't have Ray's Natural Energy Cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Subduing Zuzu, and gathering Sora and Declan together with him, Z-ARC revealed his dark powers protected him from the infection, much like with the parasite during the Dimensional War. However the trace remains of both merged with his power and created a new virus in the form of some nanobots that could counter the first, although they weren't sure about any side effects, although he could absorb inanimate objects and re-summon them, break down and absorb metal to replenish nanobots, and have an increase in strength, speed, and intelligence. While understandably distrustful of Z-ARC, Declan realized that spreading the new virus could not possibly make things any worse. They tested it on Declan, Sora, Zuzu, and some other volunteers, and discovered that the nanobots seemed to have no effect on males, but turned females, including Zuzu (whose mind assimilated her counterparts inside of her), who mostly went back to normal, into essentially organic robot love-slaves to Z-ARC, while giving them Z-ARC's nanobot abilities on a lesser scale, and replenish supplies by having sex with Z-ARC while he has his sperm changed to not make them pregnant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving their only chances being extinction of humanitiy, or females becoming loyal love-slave robots to Z-ARC, and thus have a chance of human survival, the latter was chosen. Upon female zombie infected being infected with the nanobots, they all transformed like the other girls, but it was immediately discovered that it didn't restore the brain damage done by the mind rotting caused by the virus. Thus they were forced to find other methods...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door to the base closed as a frustrated Z-ARC walked, followed by a happy Zuzu.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Declan, how's it coming along?\" Z-ARC asked the prodigy currently working on a metal sphere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Almost done, although I wish we had another choice.\" Declan replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't we all?\" Z-ARC responded with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why are you so upse-\" Sora began, only to be cut off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't mind, Master!\" Zuzu said with a beaming smile, tilting her head for a cuteness factor. \"I'll be glad to be by your side, especially since your going to make Yuya the one in charge!\" Z-ARC gave Sora a look that practically shouted 'Now do you see?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seeing any version of Ray like this is hard, especially since Yuri was my only fragment without romantic feelings for his version of Ray.\" Z-ARC said. 'Granted Yuya also had feelings for Celina to a slightly lesser degree than with Zuzu.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's done.\" Declan called out, opening it up and putting it in the path of a laser that he made for the space-time travel for the plan. \"Now just put the cards you want to send back inside, close it, and then transfer the nanobots turn Yuya into a master unit, along with the all the memories you can fit, and we'll use your and Zuzu's powers to send it back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZ-ARC nodded, as he put the deck he'd built especially for Yuya inside, along with Zuzu putting in the cards from her and her counterparts' decks that they didn't have in the point in time the sphere would go back inside as well, and then closing it as Z-ARC and Zuzu put their hands on it (Zuzu's being the one with the bracelets), and closed their eyes, focusing on the transfer of the nanobots and the memories that Z-ARC wanted to send back and that Zuzu wanted Yuya to give her and her counterparts. When they filled it as far as they could, he nodded to Declan, then had Zuzu put her hand with her bracelets on it on the sphere as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here goes everything.\" Declan said, starting up the laser, and firing, sending the sphere back in time, to the first point in time where Yuya was alone in between being challenged by The Sledgehammer and dueling him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNotes:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Stargazer and Timegazer Magician will turn into their Pendulum versions upon Yuya touching the sphere, while the original Odd-Eyes Dragon will remain the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. Yuto, Yugo, and Yuri will be transported by Z-ARC, who has been mostly purified by his future self, to Yuya, and then be absorbed by him, giving him their cards, although not giving him doubles of their Dimension Dragons, while giving him their memories, and Yuto and Yugo's feelings for their Bracelet Girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. When Yuya infects someone, he can give them copies of some of his cards (will not give Syncro, Fusion, and XYZ other than the instances I mention), and gives the base forms of the Dimension Dragon to the Bracelet Girls from their respective dimensions (Except for Zuzu, who get's Odd-Eyes Pendulum Dragon, Harmonizing Magician, Trump Witch, and other Pendulum Magician of the choice of whoever makes a chapter where he gives her some).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. After one Bracelet Girl is infected, he can use the fact that Ray's mind has been infected to give orders to the others that they will follow, thinking that they are their ideas.</span></div></div>",

At the end of the battle phase, you may draw one card for every 1000 points of damage you took to your life points during this battle phase, and if the previous effect has been used this turn, this includes the damage you would have taken if the effect hadn\u2019t been used.

But when he did the thing let out a vile gas and attacked them violently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look out!\"  Kabuto screamed.  Meanwhile Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura were trying to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it, if only we can escape.\"   Naruto struggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak for yourself dobe.\"  Sasuke said already freeing himself, he freed Sakura and Naruto before they headed out of Orochimaru's lab, and running for their lives to escape the sound village.  Once they left they sighed with relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where's Kakashi sensei?\"  Sakura asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We can't look for him, we have to move.\"  Sasuke demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, those who abandon their friends are worse then trash, we look for him.\"  Naruto insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you want to get yourself killed be my guest, Sakura.\"  He turned to her.  Normally she would side with him but for once in her life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going with Naruto.\"  She told him.  Sasuke scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\"  He left them behind to head back to the village.  Sakura looked saddened and Naruto tried to cheer her up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure he's just stressed, come on let's find Kakashi sensei.\"  He told her, Sakura nodded and the two searched for him.  During their search Sakura suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's spit up, it'll be faster and safer.\" He nodded at her suggestion and the two of them went to look for them separately.  Naruto searched everywhere he could, avoiding hostiles as best as he could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Come on where are you?</i>  He thought, but his thought was interrupted as he tripped over something.  Shaking his head he saw the culprit to find a weird orb.  Curious he picked it up and felt weird as a message popped up in a weird hologram.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To whom this may concern, if you are receiving this message then my plan to send this orb back in time worked.\"  The man explained \"I don't have much time so I'll be brief an apocalypse is coming, the damned are everywhere, humanity is nearly gone.  But I refuse to let it end this way, I worked hard for a cure and I found one in the form of this, nanobots.  They will render the subject immune to the disease, however it has several side effects.\"  He paused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It only works on women, and once infected by the nanobots they become your love slaves doing whatever you want, fixing this was impossible, Those infected by the nanobots have all of their senses, along with their strength, speed, endurance, intelligence, and stamina increased greatly, you the one with the orb has this as well. They will age up or down to being a teenager if they aren't already, along with gaining a healing factor. Their breasts sizes will be enlarged, and if they are related to you, their DNA will be altered to prevent incest. Those infected can alter their appearance in order to look like their normal ages in order to avoid others questioning what happened. They are also immune to various effects.\"  He paused again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You the owner of this orb will be the Master, you cannot refuse this you were already infected upon touching this orb, you need to save humanity by finding the source of the infection and curing it or saving as many women as you can.  I know this is a lot but you have to believe.\"  He paused when he heard a groan and the image had several zombies appear  slowly towards him \"Oh no, I have to hurry fast.\"   The message ended there.  Naruto blinked in confusion at all of this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>This can't be real, can it?</i>  He asked himself, pocketing the orb.  He does feel different, but before he can think about this any further Sakura appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you are I found him, he's unconscious and he needs our help.\"  Sakura said, Naruto looked at her for a bit.  If what the orb said was true then he couldn't wait.  He approached her and held his hand out grabbing hers.  Before she could question what he was doing she felt a surge go through her, Naruto watched as her bust size grew a bit and spasm a bit before calming down.  Sakura at that point knelt before him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My beloved Master, how may I serve you?\"  She smiled warmly at him still on one knee eager to obey him.  Naruto blinked, <i>No way, this is real.</i>  He thought about what to do next.</span></div></div>",

Kakashi meanwhile will speak to the victims' husbands and relatives to see if they know anything.  Naruto was searching his section and growled a bit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I have to stand here like an idiot while my 'team' gets to be in the village with food and warmth.\"  He spat, he didn't like his treatment on the team at all.  Sakura being the loyal fan girl that she is always sides with Sasuke with everything and if he dared have an opinion she hits him and calls him an idiot, Sasuke being the asshole that he is treats everyone around him like they're beneath him but loyal Sakura doesn't care.  Kakashi could care even less, he barely if ever does anything relevant worth of training and when he does he focuses on Sasuke.  For a guy that claims teamwork is important he sure as hell doesn't like to follow his own guideline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed wishing something would happen, but ask as you receive as he saw a shady figure try to sneak to where the women are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that isn't the kidnapper I don't know who is.\"  He mentioned as he went to intercept him.  The shady guy meanwhile smiled as he saw a group of women talking and took out a flute, just as he was about to use it a kunai hit is neck.  The man groaned in pain as Naruto glared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop where you are.\"  Naruto growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn brat, interrupting my fun.\"  The man cursed as he tried to escape but Naruto was quick to the draw and threw another kunai at him, but he accidentally hit a vital organ and killed the guy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh oh.\"  Naruto cursed, as he saw the dead man, he noticed the flute and picked it up \"I wonder why he had this, oh well finders keepers.\"  He might as well have it, gives him a hobby and something to take his mind off of things, taking the dead man with him he took him back to his team.  Upon finding them he reported to Kakashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got him, here's the kidnapper.\"  Naruto reported, Sakura bashed him on the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baka, don't bring a dead body where people can see it!\"  She yelled, Naruto glared at her, but Kakashi decided to intervene.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, now calm down.\"  He mentioned turning to the guards \"Is this the guy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes that's him, thank you blonde boy!\"  He praised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're welcome, I guess that's mission accomplished.\"  Naruto mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think that just because you lucked out on completing the mission that makes you competent dobe.\" Sasuke mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it teme!\"  Naruto growled back as Sakura hit him again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Baka, stop insulting Sasuke!\"  She yelled then turned to Sasuke \"I bet you'd do a much better job if it was you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut it Sakura!\"  He coldly said and walked off, leaving her to sulk.  Naruto walked off too not bothering to cheer her up since that warrants a hit in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At any case let's report to the Hokage!\"  Kakashi sounded borded and the rest of the team nodded to leave.  Naruto meanwhile was thinking about the flute, he wanted to try it out.  Maybe he can as Hinata to be his audience, as weird as she is he knows she wouldn't judge him.</span></div></div>",

The Hokage was silent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And don't get me started on my 'teammates.'\"  He spat \"I want out, I don't care if I have to go back to the academy, anything is better than staying on this team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nauto I can't just.\"  He started before Naruto interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you care about me at all, do this.\"  Naruto counter argued \"It's bad enough you lied to my face about why they hate me but now you want me to suffer?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not!\"  Hiruzen argued, \"but my hands are tied, all the teams are filled, and sending you back to the academy is out of the question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I have to quit then, like I said anything is better than staying with them.\"  Naruto insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What about your dream?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll gladly abandon it if I have to, a village that thinks I'm a demon will never let me be the Hokage!\"  He growled, Hiruzen was saddened by this, ashamed that the village did this to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell you what, become a Chunin and I'll let you be on your own.\"  Hiruzen told him \"I'll also be in a position to tell you things I'm forced to not tell you and to give you what is yours by right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't happen with the team I have.\"  Naruto mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have people train you, properly, you have my word.\"  Hiruzen swore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine then!\" Naruto agreed \"but this better be worth it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>End Flashback</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto sighed again, at least he has his flute.  He took a good look at it and wondered why the guy he killed had it, he shrugged not thinking anything of it.  After some walking he found Hinata on her own, smiling he waved at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Hinata!\"  He called she eeped and blushed upon seeing him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nar...Naruto!\"  She stuttered \"Hi!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can I ask you something?\"  He asked, she was blushing heavily thinking he'll propose to her or ask her out, or even want to claim her virginity.  She nearly drooled at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"  She mentioned, masking her hope.  Naruto brought out a flute and showed it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found this on my mission and want to start picking it up as a hobby, I was hoping you'll be the first person I play to.\"  He told her.  Hinata happily nodded, not what she wanted but she'll take it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S....sure Naruto!\"  Hinata stuttered again, Naruto led her to a private area where it was just the two of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So nobody disturbs us.\"  He mentioned.  Hinata was blushing at the fact they were alone but kept it together, she didn't want to faint, not now. Naruto brought the flute to his mouth and began playing it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The sound of the music emanating through the flute began echoing through the area they were in, they were in a secluded area so nobody would be able to hear it walking by them, he didn't want anyone finding a reason to hurt the 'demon brat' so this was his best option.  He was actually surprised at how well he was playing this, he closed his eyes as he got more into the music.  Hinata meanwhile heard every note, every tune and smiled at him playing well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Naruto is....doing....such..</i>  Her thought began then slowed down, then stopped.  Her eyes began to glaze a bit and with a mindless smile she began dancing to the tune, allowing the music to carry her and use her like a puppet.  She danced happily to the tune letting the music guide her, to control her, it made her feel more sexy and she was sexy.  Thoughts went into her head like why is she hiding herself for her man, she should proudly show her body to him, to be sexual for him.  With these thoughts in mind Hinata began mindlessly removing her jacket, eager to take her clothing off for him while continuing her sensual dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was busy focusing on the flute that he didn't notice what his audience was doing but hearing ruffling noises and feet movement he opened his eyes to check up on her, only to find her removing her jacket leaving her in her shirt and slowly that was starting to come off too, she seemed lost in her world, dancing and undressing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was shocked that she was doing this but he found himself unable to stop, slowly but surly off came her shirt leaving her in nothing more than a bra.  Her dancing became more erotic as her hands went to her bra and began to remove it as well.  Naruto was in disbelief, she wasn't going to do what he thought she was going to do, was she?  Sure enough the bra came off and her breasts were on full display, Naruto got a good view of them, oddly mesmerized by their beauty, she was even going to go further and went to remove her pants before finally Naruto snapped out of his stupor and stopped playing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata, what are you doing?!\"  He asked, with the music stopped she woke up from her trance and looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh, what happened?\"  She asked looking at her crush \"Why does my chest feel cold?\"  She looked down curiously to see she was topless.  It took a moment for it to sink in before realizing her crush got to see her breasts and she fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata!\"  He exclaimed, gathering her clothes up, and trying to put them on her, he didn't know how to work a bra so he put that in her jacket,as he tried to put her clothes back on, he managed to get her shirt on and with her jacket in hand carried her home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay Hinata, I'll just pretend this never happened.\"  He promised her sleeping form, he had no idea what has gotten into her, he figured she got too enraptured by the music she became unfocused, if only he knew how close to the truth he was.  He carried her to her home and knocked on the door, only to find her father glaring at him seeing her in her state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Explain yourself.\"  Hiashi demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She fainted and was feeling hot, I had to take her jacket off so she can cool off and brought her home.\" He lied, not wanting more reasons for people to hate him.  He glared at him but accepted that answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give her to me.\"  He demanded once more, he did so and he closed the door without thanking him.  Naruto sighed as he went to his apartment, trying to figure out what had happened and why he wants to play the flute again.</span></div></div>",

She knew it couldn't have been Naruto, he'd never do something like that, not that she would oppose to him doing that of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto!\"  She sighed a bit as she tried to go back to sleep, trying to shake the cobwebs off.  She wasn't asleep for longer than ten minutes before waking up again, feeling wet in her crotch area, her fingers near her vulva and her other hand near her breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not again! \"  She groaned, it was another lewd dream of Naruto, but she never had one this intense before.  This time it was her submitting to him, to her listening to his flute again, to do any perverted act he wanted, she smiled at that one.  <i>Naruto, I want you to take me</i>  She thought, as her dream had her say the same thing, as she thought of her dream her hands went to work again and this time she didn't stop it.  She peeled off her clothing leaving her naked as she went to work.  Her hand fondled her breasts while the other went to work on her womanhood, she moaned happily at this as the image of Naruto entered her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto!\"  She moaned happily, she did this many times before but this was the first time it did something to her, that it had purpose.  How much longer was she going to deny herself, how much longer was she going to be a coward.  No, no longer, a determined look on her face as she went faster, she licked her lips and cooed.  She was done being a pushover, she was going to get what she wants and nobody was going to stop her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto!\"  She cried out as she came, she panted a bit and relaxed before putting her clothes back on, a decision was made she was going to live with him for now on, to hell with her family.  Gathering her possessions she walked out.  Naturally the clan members noticed and went to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get back to bed this instant failure!\"  He growled and grabbed her, she narrowed her eyes hit him once and threw him across the room, she sent a death glare to the other clan heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyone else?!\"  She growled, they were in shock and went to get her father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Hiashi!\"  He cried as he went to his room, she narrowed her eyes at the rest of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't move!\"  She warned as she went to the door, the clan heads were terrified of her, never seeing this side of her before.  It was that point her father came in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?!\"  He demanded and she glared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm living with Naruto for now on, don't stop me!\"  She growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That demon brat?!\"  A clan member spat, but didn't get much else in as she hit him so hard his neck snapped and he died instantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Insult him one more time and you'll meet the same fate!\"  She yelled, the clan members said no more, but Hiashi glared at her and grabbed her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your childish behavour has gone on long enough, time to!\"  He didn't get much else in as he felt something hit him down below, he groaned and whimpered and went down hard clutching his crotch area, she glared at the others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe others wisely backed off, one of them even went to open the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy your stay with Naruto Lady Hyuga!\"  He quivered in fear, she kept her eyes on him as she left her old home forever, vowing to never live in her abusive home again.  Hinata with her belongings went to Naruto's apartment with a lustful look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naruto, wait for me, it's time I made you mine.\"  She though perversely giddy at all the naughty things they'll do together. </span></div></div>",

He was amazed at how fast time flew but that's life he supposed, his thoughts then went back to the flute, the urge to play it again hit him hard.  He was hesitant of doing it thinking about what happened with Hinata, but it was probably a fluke or something yeah that's it.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I worried about?\"  He said to himself as he put the flute to his mouth and began playing, as he was going to his apartment, keeping his eyes open this time he was amazed at how good he was at this.  He liked the fact that he can find a hobby he was good at.  What he didn't know was Sakura heading to her home after another failed attempt and courting Sasuke, sighing sadly at it she didn't noticed her friend and rival walking past her at the same time, until they did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing here forhead?!\"  Ino growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can ask you the same thing pig!\"  She snarled \"trying to take Sasuke away from me?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like Sasuke wants someone flat chested!\"  Ino scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better than being a slut trying to get in every guys pants!\"  She fought back, the two of them glared at each other before the sound of music caught there ears, so busy at arguing at each other they didn't notice Naruto walk by them, focused on playing his flute.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that, music?\"  Sakura asked forgetting about her argument with Ino.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It does sound nice.\"  Ino mentioned, her eyes becoming glazed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah...it.\"  Sakura didn't finish the sentence as her eyes became glazed as well, the sound of the music enthralled them, with a mindless smile the two of them began dancing in an erotic fashion grooving to the tune, allowing the music to take them away and put on a show for the owner of the flute.  They began mindlessly following the tune as they became lost in their dance and slowly began removing their clothing, wanted to be naked for the player of the flute to show him gratitude for the wonderful performance.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPiece by piece, each article of clothing came off, it wasn't long before they were in their underwear, before that too became removed.  Soon Sakura and Ino were fully nude, dancing away following Naruto to his apartment, thankfully for them nobody noticed, not even Naruto himself.  Naruto meanwhile was still playing his flute, unaware of the show behind him, that two naked girls were following him dancing and swaying to his tune, both in a mindless trance.  He was too caught up with playing his flute and getting to his apartment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually he reached it still playing his song, and closed the door behind him before finally stopping his music, sighing a bit as he got ready for bed.  At this point Sakura and Ino both woke up from their trances looking confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What, where are we?\"  Sakura asked, Ino was also confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did we fall asleep?\"  She wondered, it was then they felt a draft and looked down to their naked bodies, they let out a loud screech and glared at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?!\"  They demanded at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me, it was you!\"  They both said, glaring at each other,  Naruto heard a loud voice and went to check it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's there?!\"  He asked, both Sakura and Ino gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shit, it's Naruto, hide!\"  Ino said, she nodded and the two of them ducked behind a bush.  Naruto got out and looked around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Guess it was nobody.\"  He shrugged and went back in.  Both of them sighed in relief, however both of them were hoping they caught them nude for some odd reason.  They shook it off thinking it was the thrill of the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's just, find our clothes and swear that we NEVER speak about this, EVER!\"  Ino said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\"  Sakura confirmed.  The two of them shook hands and went to find their clothes, the lingering thought of Naruto catching them naked still in their minds and how hot it was making them.</span></div></div>",

Hinata was glad she can get this reaction out of him and continued to suck him off, she sped up the process until Naruto felt himself build up pressure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hinata, I'm.\"  He began as he came, Hinata was glad to lap his cum up swallowing it all.

Hinata was close to Naruto and Sakura was eyeing them feeling bothered by this for some reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Why do I care about this so much, I shouldn't.</i>  She told herself but found herself imagining being in Hinata's place.  They waited for what seemed like forever until Sakura growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does he always do this?!\"  She mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a waste of my time.\"  Sasuke added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For once teme I agree with you, I don't know about you two but I'm hungry.\"  Naruto mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have a lunch made for you Naruto.\"  Hinata cheerfully said taking out a lunch she prepared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're the best Hinata!\"  He thanked and began to eat it, she smiled at him in a loving expression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSakura was fuming for some odd reason.  She really didn't understand why this was bothering her.  Naruto ate it happily and mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is delicious Hinata, thanks.\"  He thanked her, Sasuke perked an eyebrow and helped himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me that.\"  He demanded as he went to grab one but Hinata slapped his hand away and glared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not for you!\"  She growled, Saskue huffed and turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Didn't want it anyways.\"  He was clearly lying.  It was at that point Kakashi arrived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I'm late, I got lost in the road to life.\"  He made his trademark excuse and saw Naruto eating his lunch Hinata gave him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, are you going to share that with the others?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hell no!\"  Naruto mentioned and kept eating.  \"This is my lunch Hinata made me, they can get their own.\"  Sakura was hurt by that for some reason, and felt like making it up to him before shaking it off.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I don't care about how sexy he is, I mean, gah!</i>  She inwardly growled not understanding her feelings  at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not nice Naruto, remember what I told you about the importance of teamwork?\"  Kakashi asked. \"You didn't learn a thing, as I expected.\"  Naruto had lost his shit, got up and growled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like you're one to fucking talk about teamwork you hypocrite!\"  Naruto yelled.  The rest of them were stunned silence, as Kakashi glared at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How dare you talk to me like that, I am your sensei!\"  He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're nothing but a lazy, sorry excuse of a piece of shit, the only training you did was going down on Sasuke's dick, I learned SHIT all from you, and you are not one to talk about 'teamwork' when you fucking abandoned me!\"  He growled at Kakashi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what you mean.\"  He replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit, you know full well what I mean, I was tied up and you didn't come and get me, you knew full well I was sabotaged out of learning these things didn't you Inu!\"  He mentioned, Kakashi's eyes widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do know about that?\"  He demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh so now I peek your interest, I knew you were an ANBU and I also knew about all of your missions.\"  Naruto mentioned.  \"Not bad for a 'dead last' huh, one that stole the scroll right under the noses of everyone except Iruka!\"  He paused \"If I were an enemy I'd make off with it by now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Luck doesn't contribute to skill, the fact you're a waste of my time is not my problem.\"  Kakashi scoffed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The truth finally comes out, I knew you were a fucking asshole and now I have witness.\"  He points to Hinata.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's not forget you have summoning dogs, I don't understand why the teams are imbalanced, Kiba is a better fit for you, if you didn't want Naruto on your team you had options, in fact he shouldn't even be dead last considering the fact that my cousin's teammate got to pass and couldn't make a clone, so the grounds of him failing because of that makes no sense.\"   Hinata brought up.  \"You and Asuma do shit all to put Sakura and Ino in their place, you ignore Naruto for no reason when it's your job to help him, Kurenai coddles me, all of the teams are garbage!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have had enough of your insubordination when I tell the Hokage you insulted me and disrespected my rank he'll!\" Kakashi started before a voice interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be very disappointed at you.\"  Hiruzen's voice said as he released his invisibility Jutsu \"when Naruto gave me his earlier complaints I wanted to check the validity of them for myself, never did I imagine he was dead on, as well as gave me insight on the other teams.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lord Hokage I.\"  Kakashi started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SILENCE!\"  Hiruzen shouted, \"It is clear I need to do a severe overhaul of the teams, and as for you Hatake, I'll see you at my office.\"  He disappeared with Kakashi looking down and disappearing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Hinata, let's go.\"  He told her, she held his hand and they left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not jealous,I'm not jealous.\"  Sakura kept repeating to herself, when she saw them kiss she was seething mad, and followed them unsure as to why.</span></div></div>",

The could've sworn they heard Sakura yell but it was probably their imagination.  Walking calmly in silence for a bit, Ino saw them and for some reason wanted to go up to them seemingly a bit mad at this herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh hi Ino!\"  Hinata greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi, Hinata.\"  Ino fake smiled and tried her best not to growl, \"Ma...Naruto!\"  Ino caught almost calling him Master.  Naruto was a bit confused but waved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Ino, I'm surprised you're talking to me, and being civil.\"  Naruto replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I feel nice to day Ma....Naruto!\"  Ino caught again, unknowingly batting her eyelashes and pressing her chest out for him to see her breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to come with us, we're going to Naruto's apartment!\"  Hinata offered.  Ino nearly drooled right there but shook it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm good, bye!\"  She flushed saying while leaving.  Naruto was still confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Darn, maybe next time, I'd love to see Ino go at you!\"  Hinata purred, Naruto blushed at that finding this hot.  These new feelings were strange, even stranger at how natural this all seemed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something is off.\"  Naruto finally said, \"I'm finding this arousing and no offense Hinata, but I've never seen this out of you, ever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe but I don't care, I love the new me.\"  Hinata cooed, \"Don't you?\"  Naruto had to admit, he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I do.\"  Naruto agreed, \"I still want to know why we changed so fast.\"  He thought for a moment, nothing seemed different except one thing, the flute.  He took it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think it's this?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only one way to find out, play away.\"  Hinata offered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, here it goes.\"  Naruto started to play the flute with an enchanting melody.  Just like before Hinata listened to it as her eyes glazed over and she began dancing again.  Unaware Sakura was doing the same thing hidden behind a bush, she was barely visible while doing so.  Ino as well who was also hiding to spy on them began dancing.  Naruto had his eyes open this time to see her, and sure enough Hinata began undressing again.  Naruto stopped it right there as she was taking her shirt off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHinata came back to her senses and saw what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh!\"  She mentioned \"I was going to undress again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I played this flute and you started dancing and taking your clothes off, I guess we found our answer.\"  Naruto mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, then we can have fun with it!\"  She smirked.  Naruto seemed to like that idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me, in the meanwhile let's go back.\" Naruto offered as the two of them kept walking.  Sakura and Ino flushed again, both wanting to continue and kept following them.</span></div></div>",

They reached a very private location where they can get some privacy, and to make sure nobody else barged in unaware Sakura and Ino already had and were hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you hear something?\"  Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No clue.\"  Hinata mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well, let's begin.\"  Naruto mentioned and began to play with the flute but Hinata stopped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, can you use your shadow clones first, so you can see how I react to your presence?\"  Hinaata asked.  Naruto nodded and summoned his Shadow Clones and then finally started to play.  Upon hearing the music again Hinata's eyes glazed and once more started to dance in front of him, they were unaware Ino and Sakura were doing the same thing hidden.  This time he had no intention on stopping her as she swayed and danced erotically.  Eventually she started to undress for him, the jacket came off, then the shirt, then the pants.  She was in her underwear and Naruto found her sexy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally those came off as well as she danced for him fully naked, Naruto got to admire her form once more as she continued her dance to the music.  One of the Shadow Clones came up to her and touched her but that didn't seem to interrupt the dance, he massaged her breasts which caused her to raise her arms up, still dancing.  After massaging her breasts he started to touch her womanhood, she moved her hips towards his fingers.  She smiled and moaned as her dance continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was pleased at this, his song continuing to play as she kept dancing to his tune.</span></div></div>",

Then she slowly put her clothes back on giving him a sultry look.  She walked up to him and kissed him which he returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You were sexy as hell.\"  Naruto growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet, now let's go to your place and really enjoy ourselves.\"  Hinata purred as they walked hand in hand to Naruto's apartment.

They shook it off again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um, this never happened.\"  Ino said with little oomph.

She nearly made herself orgasm again before stopping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I, I can't.\"  She moaned louder, Naruto's image overwhelmed her, the need to be with him too strong.  \"I can't fight it, I don't want to.\"  She licked her lips, a giggle escaped her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need to be with my Master.\"  She cooed, as she got up to go to Naruto's apartment, \"wait for me Master, your sexy slave is coming.\"  She purred at that and left the house to be with him.</span></div></div>",

Once she felt it twitch after a while of sucking she guided him to her and allowed him to insert his penis into her, she moaned happily as his erection entered her vulva and he began to thrust into her.  She matched his thrusts with equal speed and wrapped her legs around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, that's it!\"  She cooed, \"I want to be yours!\"  She felt her breasts get worked again as she sighed in passion, they went faster as Naruto reached the inside of her womb and her look of bliss was the most erotic thing he saw.  Kurama used her chakra to nullify being pregnant as he went harder into her, silently begging him to cum inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually he did just that as she felt his sperm enter her and had an orgasm herself, they both moaned and panted before calming down and started to cuddle.  They kissed again as he got off her to snuggle next  to her, she smiled at him and traced her finger on his face giving him a loving smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm yours forever!\"  She told him, \"please come visit your mate when you can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will, I promise.\"  He assured her as they kissed again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to go back Naruto, your other mates need you as well.\"  She cooed as he felt himself go back to his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Wait, mates as in more than one?</i>  He thought to himself but before he could ask what she meant he was back in his apartment with Hinata beside him, fast asleep.

For Kurotsuchi it was a matter of pride, their land was devastated by the forth Hokage and while attending a meeting with her grandfather which bored her to death, a Hyuga told them all about him.  Why he'd betray his village like this she'll never know but she doesn't really care.  Right now she had a job to do, after her grandfather feigned forging an alliance with this village she was allowed entry into the Chunin exam with two Iwa Genin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Not that she needed it since she's a Chunin but they didn't need to know that, thanks to the same Hyuga she even knows where he lives, and was just had his door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, time to avenge Iwa!\"  She said to herself, and quietly opened the door with her lock picking.  She found the door easy to enter as she quietly opened it hoping not to make a sound, as she did music filled the room and traveled outside, she was a bit dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Music, why would.....there.\"  She began hearing it founding it enticing before her thoughts dulled and her eyes glazed over, a mindless smile appeared on her face as she began dancing to the tune, entering the building to get closer to the music her dancing never stopped, it wasn't long before she began undressing to reward the player for his performance.  Piece by piece each article of clothing came off until she stood fully naked, her dancing never stopped as she swayed and shimmied her body to the music.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Current</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto was watching Hinata, Ino and Sakura with a smile on his face, they were all still dancing to his tune.  He was going to send a shadow clone to play with them when he heard feet from behind him, turning around he saw Kurotsuchi dancing there nude.  He never saw her before and wondered what she was doing there, not taking any chances his shadow clone brought her over guided her to a chair where he tied her up, once she was secured he stopped playing.  The girl blinked confused as the other girls woke up smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"  She asked, \"how did you?\"  She saw she was tied up and naked and the other girls there naked as well, \"what kind of a sexy....I mean.\"  She stuttered finding him hot and she was blushing, she felt the desire to show him her assets again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm asking the questions here, who are you and what are you doing here?\"  Naruto demanded, she shivered in lust before shaking it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kurotsuchi of Iwa, and I'm here for you stud....I mean target.\"  She tried to sound intimidating but was failing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who sent you?\"  He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A Hyuga told my grandfather you were the son of the fourth hokage, and I was to kill you, but how can I kill such a sexy.....I mean no I need to have sex with you....I mean.\"  She stuttered finding it hard to focus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father!!\"  Hinata growled, \"it has to be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is treason, and he'll answer dearly for this, but not before gramps gets an earful of keeping this from me.\"  Naruto mentioned, \"as for you, I'll have you remain here until you're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready for what?\"  She wondered hoping he'd touch her before shaking it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll see.\"  Naruto smirked.</span></div></div>",

He smirked and untied her, he knew she could easily escape but she was already caught in his spell that she subconsciously didn't want to and waited for her change to happen.  She licked her lips and kissed him which he returned.  He rewarded her by groping her breasts which she moaned to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please fuck me!\"  She purred touching his erection and stroking it with care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you insist.\"  He mentioned as he guided her down, she spread her legs for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes!\"  She cooed as she used the Anti Pregnancy Jutsu, \"make me yours.\"  He nodded at that and inserted himself into her, after a while they began a thrusting motion meeting each other with determination, they both moaned as he hit her core with his penis as she brought him close to her.  They increased the speed moaning and panting before finally they came, after calming down he got off of her and she snuggled next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm yours forever.\"  She told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I need you for a witness against Hiashi, afterwards we'll take it from there.\"  Naruto told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing.\"  She smiled and kissed him.</span></div></div>",

First about his parents, which he sadly admitted but he assured Naruto it was to protect him and to his credit he was partly right, since Kurotsuchi admitted to trying to kill him due to who his father was. Naruto accepted that and forgave him, as for Kurotsuchi, being the granddaughter of the Tsuchikage, Hiruzen was able to use that to have him 'apologize' and put the blame solely on her saying she acted on her own and he can do with her as he saw fit. Hurt by this, she defected to Konoha but not before telling him off, he said nothing but she could tell he was fuming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow Naruto and the rest of them were waiting for their new teams, Kurotsuchi now wearing a Konoha headband was there too with him watching on the side, being a Chunin already she wasn't going to be assigned to any teams but she wanted to be there for moral support. <br>\r\nHiruzen stood there and got everyone's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Based off evidence of favourtism and lack of training on my instructors, and tampering of grades on the academy which I found accurate and all who were conspirators of this are now being punished, the teams will be reshuffled effective immediately.\" He explained, the tampering was more towards Naruto and how he was screwed with getting the clone test when it was known he had way too much chakra, it was also odd that Iruka would fail him when he passed Lee, being questioned he didn't know what he was talking about and through deductions skills and Kurenai's help he realized he was manipulated by Danzo. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd take care of Danzo when the time was right, but for now he had a job to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will now assign you to your new teams, team six is now Sakura Haruno, Kiba Inuzuka, and Shino Aburame with their insturctor Kurenai Y\u016bhi. Team seven is now Naruto Uzumaki, Hinata Hyuga, and Ino Yamanaka with their instructor being Anko Mitarashi. Finally team eight is now Sasuke Uchiha, Shikamaru Nara, and Ch\u014dji Akimichi with their instructor being Asuma Sarutobi!\" He finished saying. They all nodded in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is all, meet up with your new team mates and instructors at the designated training area for each team, you're all dismissed.\" He finished as he left.</span></div></div>",

Naruto smiled at this and took his flute out, Hinata and Ino readied themselves by applying earplugs, Naruto was sure to get his girls some when he didn't want them joining in the dance, while the idea was very tempting this was about Anko.  Anko meanwhile saw this and started questioning it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any reason why they did that?\"  She asked.

The form of Shion happily had her arm wrapped around his and was all smiles.  Her platinum blond hair a similar clolour to Ino was draped down in length like Hinata's hair style, her vibrant purple eyes with no pupils looking at him with happy content, and she wore a priestess robe.  It was scary how similar to Hinata she looked just with Ino's hair colour as opposed to Hinata's.  They walked passed the gates with Naruto once again ignoring Kakashi to report to the Hokage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arrival Anko took the time to address the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mission accomplished, we also have a visitor who wishes to live here with Naruto.\"  Anko mentioned with the girl in question nodded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I wish to one day marry this man and carry his children.\"  Shion said happily, Hiruzen looked around and simply asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you use the flute?\"  He whispered, Naruto was shocked at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you did know.\"  Naruto commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I did, don't worry I have no intention on stopping you, you deserve this after what this village has done.\"  Hiruzen informed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks gramps.\"  Naruto said warmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now answer my question.\" Hiruzen told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe it or not, her desire to carry my children came from helping her, she was cold to me at first but after I helped seal the demon she was tasked with and proving her wrong that I will die, she straight up asked me, who was I to say no.\"  Naruto said, \"but yes I did use the flute later, upon her request nonetheless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was wonderful, I knew what was to come and I embraced it.\"  Shion happily said, remember being told about her dancing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's a keeper alright.\"  Anko chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very well then I'll allow this, you're dismissed for now, use this time to focus on the Chunin Exams.\"  Hiruzen mentioned.  They nodded and went to Hinata's new home.  While there Kurotsuchi, Tenten and Sakura were waiting for them and they were introduced to Shion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet our new sister.\"  Sakura greeted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice to meet you as well.\"  Shion replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how did you get her?\"  Tenten asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be happy to tell you.\"  Naruto mentioned as he began his story.</span></div></div>",

The two of them walked out where the other members of his team were waiting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey took you a while.\"  Anko said.

Naruto smirked back and started to play his flute, with her embracing it she immediately fell into a trance and began dancing.  Like the others before her she shimmied and swayed her hips making it as erotic as possible. Soon after she removed her clothing leaving her naked, Naruto got to admire her body as her dancing continued for his enjoyment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>End Flashback</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And from there we convinced them for her to live with me and you know the rest.\"  Naruto smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She danced really well.\"  Hinata commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish I was there to see it.\"  Kurotsuchi chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah that would of been splendid.\"  Tenten added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wanted to dance for you too.\"  Sakura mentioned with a longing look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, why not do that here?\"  Naruto smirked taking out the flute and creating shadow clones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me.\"  Anko said, they were all eager to show their love for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time to put on a show.\"  Ino cooed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This will be wonderful.\"  Shion agreed, Naruto smiled at them as he began to play his flute.</span></div></div>",

Anko was pinned to the wall as the clone took her, Shion was getting double teamed with a dick in her mouth and her vagina, and Tenten was on top of Naruto as they fucked.

The first girl in a chain is turned normally, with her normal feelings of love, but girls she infects see her as their queen, and have their interests shifted to the queen's chosen mate. Only girls who aren't part animal (other than cats), or have a human form, can be infected. Any girl who can become a boy is immune. The main male lead must be among those chosen by a catgirl, and if there is a girl or girls in love with him, then at least one is infected, and choses him. The affectionate part will make tsunderes not be hateful to the boys they love. A catgirl will have the ears, eyes, and tail of a cat, and their nails will be able to turn into claws at will, but otherwise, the body of a human, unless she is already a catgirl, in which case, she just gets the mental tweaks and infectious bite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn interdimensional shop arrives in a world, and the male lead of a series becomes a customer. The shop sells girls who've been converted into suits, organic robots, and living dolls (all willing, unless the girl was an active threat to them or their business, such as trying to rob them, attack them, or damaging their inventory or is a criminal whose crimes would get them the death penalty or a large sentence that would ruin the rest of their lives if the crimes were discovered and girls could be contained and punished if the law could manage it) along with accessories. The male doesn't have to be the only customer, but the company has an energy field that subconsciously keeps most people who wouldn't be a customer (whether to buy, or to sell themself), whether it's because they wouldn't do business there, or because the store wouldn't sell to them for moral or personal issues, from noticing it, unless they know about it and where it is (they can still accidentally stumble upon it). Any girl who is incompatible with a world for some reason will be adjusted (such as giving a girl a chakra network in Naruto's world). The shop can erase others' memories of the girls if the customer wants in order for them to be unimpeded with their purchases.</span></div></div>",

The client in question for this case had a combination of wanting out of her life, and wanting to be with you, as she loves you, but has been too shy to come up to you and let you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...?\" Naruto trailed off in shock. \"Someone loves me? I-I honestly didn't think that was possible with how I'm treated. Why doesn't she want her life?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She doesn't have a good family life.\" The owner replied. \"The majority of her family members have done their level best to destroy her confidence, due to feeling she's too soft.\" Naruto looked horrified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-What, why!? Family's are supposed to protect and support you, right?\" He asked, the owner looked down with a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The key words there are \"<i>supposed to</i>.\"\" He said. \"That doesn't mean it always happens... Anyway, she also transferred all of her inheritance to you... and, since you are considered an adult due to that headband, you are your own guardian, thus you have rights to all of your inheritance, unless stated otherwise, which includes all of that. That means the only things her father still owns are things he's already willed to her sister, and many of his personal belongings. He no longer even owns his home, or land, since she was the clan heiress and officially next in line to inherit those.\" Naruto began gaping as his brain tried to process that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Th-Then who is she?\" Naruto asked, trying to wrap his head around the situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll show you right now.\" The owner said, with a nod. \"Miss Hyuga, your new master is ready to see you!\" He called out, looking at a doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Affirmative.\" A female voice called as the shy former heiress, now robot servant of her crush, walked out, a confident sway in her step, and a pleased look on her face. While she usually wore a pair of dark blue pants, blue open-toed boots that went just a little above her ankles, and a heavy tan jacket with her clan's symbol just below the shoulders and fur around the waist over a black fishnet shirt, hiding her curves, she was now wearing grey shorts, with darker grey open-toed boots that went just below her knees, light grey leggings that went up to just below her shorts, a lavender vest with lines going down, and a sash that was a shade of grey between that of her leggings and shorts wrapped tight around her stomach, making her breast size <i>far</i> more noticeable. Her hair was grown out to close to her butt. The only things that were the same about her outfit were the wrapping on her right leg, above the leggings, where her kunai pouch was strapped on, and that her headband was still around her neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, you're Hinata, from my class. You love me? Since when?\" Naruto asked, trying to be discreet in his checking her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Since you saved me from those bullies as a child, master.\" Hinata replied, giving a smirk as she saw him trying to avoid being noticed to look at her. She shifted her position a little, thrusting out her chest a little to draw his attention to her mounds. \"Really, master, did you really not get this, <i>you</i> now own me, and every inch of my body. If you want to check me out, at any time, that's your right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, you're personality is so different now.\" Naruto said in surprise, trying to wrap his head around what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When I had myself converted, I had tweaks made to my personality, in order to make me more confident, and willing to encourage you to do with me that you wish.\" She replied. She sashayed up to him, wrapped her arms around him firmly, pulling herself into him tightly, causing her breasts to be pressed up against his chest, and put her head beside his, with her mouth right against his right ear. \"<font class=\"size1\" style=\"\">Anything I can give you that you desire is yours...</font>\" She whispered in a breathy voice, causing a certain part of his autonomy to stiffen as he blushed a shade of red normally on the face of the girl embracing him as she then snuggled her head into the crook of his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, how can being turned into a slave cause that?\" Naruto asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, right, I forgot to mention.\" The owner began, drawing the attention of the two teens. \"Hinata knows this already, due to her signing up for it, but we don't technically turn the girls into our slaves in the way you're thinking. We turn them into living dolls, organic robots, and skinsuits. Hinata here had herself made into a robot.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's right, this has given me photographic memory, an increased thought processing speed, immunity to Genjutsu, accelerated healing, my body being more durable, my muscles being able to exert more force, thus making me stronger and faster, and not being able to get tired as easily.\" Hinata explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you won't really get this, but in context, what she went through is a slightly improved version of what a scientist named Gero did to a brother and sister in another reality. We actually have several versions of the sister in stock for each different kid of product, if you want to buy her.\" The owner commented.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, if he did that to her, then what's the difference in how she was?\" Naruto questioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, I said it's an <i>improved</i> version.\" Was the reply. \"They didn't have the healing or immunity to mind control, and they didn't have to loyalty properly programmed in that we put in. This led them to kill there creator, and, in several realities, devastate humanity.\" Naruto paled in horror at the thought of the loss of human life on that kind of scale. \"However, out process doesn't give them infinite energy or an energy barrier while Gero's did.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anyway,\" Hinata began. \"I also bought several new outfits, including some outfits like a maid uniform and a bunny-girl outfit, in case you want to see me in them, several <i>toys</i> you may want to use on me for fun, and had several techniques from some of the future versions of me in here downloaded into my brain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow...\" Naruto said, stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now, if you want, you can buy more girls.\" The owner informed. \"You actually get a pretty huge discount due to several factors, and can afford to buy another girl or two <i>without</i> the money you got from having Hinata's funds given to you.\" Naruto looked curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of girls are there?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there are girls from this universe who haven't been born yet, as well girls from a wide variety of universes, who will be adapted to be able to function properly in this reality, since most universes don't have chakra. In fact, in a universe that's untouchable to us, this reality, and the others we can use are works of fiction, and there are several girls, who are, in that universe, along with Hinata, voiced by a particular woman if you want to check them out.\" Was the response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...\" Naruto began.</span></div></div>",

Anise yelped in pain as she recoiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fools, you will pay for your insolence.\"  Anise growled as she summoned a giant black meteor, the three of them worked together to  protect  themselves, the three of them were hurt but not out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Begone witch!\"  Resiz shouted, Angela used more of her spells as Reisz charged with her lance, Duran coming from up top to slash at her, Anise felt herself recoil again, but she doesn't fall.  Still the fight has taken its tole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wretched creatures, but no matter, I can always wait until you die from old age, I am eternal, you're not.\"  Anise cackled, \"but before I go, FADE FROM EXISTENCE!\"  The witch used the last ounce of her strength to blast them with unknown magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is she doing?!\"  Faerie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goodbye, this will erase you from history itself!\"  Anise laughed as she went back to her domain to rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NO!\"  Duran yelled as he used his protection magic, Angela and Resiz stood behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You dummy.\" Angela said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Better me than you.\"  Duran smiled, Angela blushed but said nothing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duran, we don't know what this will do.\"  Resiz warned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hopefully something I can block, right Faerie?\"  Duran asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um.....I don't know, I never saw this spell before.\"  Faerie said.  Duran gulped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"NOW you tell me?!\"  Duran yelled, it was too late as the spell attacked and hit all three of them, they all screamed in pain but Duran used all of his might to repel the spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I won't.....let you.....hurt my FRIENDS!\"  Duran yelled, he used every ounce of magic he has to block the attack, causing him to light up while the girls still yelled in pain, suddenly there was a huge flash of light.  Duran groaned as he got up, seeing Angela and Resiz unconscious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I....I did it.\"  Duran said.  \"Hey Faerie!\"  There was no response, \"must of been knocked out like the rest of us.\"  He'll worry about that later, he had to help Angela and Resiz, he went to the purple haired girl and blonde haired girl respectively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Angela, Resiz!\"  Duran cried, shaking them awake, he checked their pulses, luckily they were still alive.  After a bit the two of them woke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, my head.\" Angela said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\"  Resiz asked, they looked at Duran who sighed of relief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Had me worried there, but we did it.\"  Duran said, they looked confused as Duran was worried, something wasn't right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did what?\"  Angela asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The attack, defeating Anise.\"  Duran listed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We did?\" Resiz asked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er, yeah we did, you doing okay Resiz?\"  Duran asked, however what she said next shocked him to the core.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Reisz?\"  Reisz asked, \"and who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would like to know that as well.\" Angela admitted, \"as well as my own name.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on guys this isn't funny.\" Duran panicked, but they looked more confused, \"you're not joking are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry but I really don't know who I am.\"  Angela apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither do I, can you help us?\" Reisz asked.  Duran was panicking really hard now, whatever that spell did gave them amneasia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faerie wake UP!\"  Duran yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, Duran you can be so careless sometimes!\"  Faerie said getting out of her head to show her tiny body with wings, \"though you did it, you beat Anise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WE did it Faerie.\"  Duran said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw thank you.\" Faerie giggled, \"but I didn't do much.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean yes, but Angela and Reisz helped out too.\"  Duran said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who?\"  Faerie asked.  Duran was really confused now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Them!\" Duran pointed at Angela and Reisz who were equally confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you two?\"  Faerie asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We have no idea.\" Angela said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We were hoping you'd tell us, strange creature.\"  Reisz added, they were wary of her, but she came from that nice man and they felt safe with him, trusted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If this is a sick joke, please drop it now.\" Duran said, they all looked confused together, \"I was afraid of that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry Duran, I have no idea who they are.\" Faerie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duran, what a nice name.\"  Angela smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I agree.\"  Reisz added, \"so who are we?\"  Duran was panicking and confused, the only thing he can surmise was that spell erased their memories, Faerie's too but only of them, was everyone else effected as well, he had to figure this out.  </span></div></div>",

He went to the queen who smiled at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, the hero who freed my mind, words still cannot express my gratitude, how is the hero king?\"  Queen Valda asked, was it him or was she blushing a bit, nah that's ridiculous, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"King Richard is fine.\"  Duran said, \"Your majesty, do you recognize this girl?\"  Duran asked pointing to Angela, the queen looked at her and shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I never seen her before.\"  Valda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's your daughter.\"  Duran said, \"please try to remember.\"  Valda shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is nothing TO remember Duran, I am without child, always had been, though admittedly if I had a daughter I'd like her to be as lovely as her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you your majesty.\"  Angela smiled, \"I'm sorry for the mix up, I don't know who I am, and this man said I'm from here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is very terrible, I hope you recover your memories soon, but sadly he is mistaken.\"  Valda insisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I trust him.\"  Angela shook her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your loyalty is admirable.\"  Valda smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can she at least stay?\"  Duran asked, \"maybe something, ANYTHING will help someone remember her?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Again there is nothing to remember her, but your insistence on this tells me you are not delusional nor are you pulling a prank.\"  Valda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know who I am either, this man said Anise the witch cast a spell to cause us to be this way.\"  Resiz brought up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, Anise you say?\"  Valda hummed, \"it is possible her sorcery is capable of such things, very well I'll do what I can to help, perhaps we can solve this mystery of why I don't recognize the girl you claim to be my daughter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you your majesty, I'll go try Laurent now, surly Elliott recognizes her.\"  Duran suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prince Elliott is an only child, at least from my perspective, if what you say is true, going there will be fruitless.\"  Valda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No....\"  Duran was stunned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, but I'll do what I can to help, we might need the mana goddess.\" Valda mentioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\"  Duran smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still don't get this, but if anyone can help it's certainly the mana goddess.\"  Faerie said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks again for helping us.\" Resiz said hugging Duran, Angela joined in the hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're lucky to have you in our lives.\" Angela smiled, they nuzzled him a bit causing Duran to blush and Valda to giggle, probably the only time he's glad she doesn't recognize her own daughter, he'd be executed for sure for this.</span></div></div>",

Angela and Resiz were leaning on his shoulder with content smiles, he dare not disturb them, he didn't have the heart to, whatever Anise's spell did, it changed them.  Not only do they have amnesia, but everyone else doesn't know who they are, also they are oddly close to them, trusting his every word, staying by his side even being affectionate towards him, if the situation was different Duran would be flattered but, this isn't the real Angela and Reisz, these two are shells of their former selves, blank slates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the?\" Duran asked, his thoughts were interrupted at the scenery, there were pictures of Valda but nothing on Angela, she's the princess so she had to have SOMETHING, but there was nothing, no traces, no anything, he tried asking the guards but all they would say is they had no idea what he was talking about, a pained expression emerged as he realizes Valda is right, as far as everyone is aware they don't exist anymore, whatever Anise did caused them to not only lose their memories, but erase them from history itself, the only question is, why is he immune, could blocking that spell with his own magic have anything to do with it?  If so, then why do Angela and Resiz cling to him, if only he knew more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is something wrong?\" Angela asked, her head on his shoulder looking at him, Reisz as well, Duran felt warm but he shook it off, now wasn't the time to give into teen hormones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no trace of you here, your mom is right, that spell Anise cast somehow erased you from history itself, on top of giving you amnesia.\"  Duran said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, we're like this because of a spell?\"  Resiz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but don't worry, I'll do everything I can to fix this.\"  Duran assured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you.\"  Angela smiled, Resiz as well as they still leaned on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're doing so much for us, if there's anything we can do to repay you, feel free to ask.\" Resiz smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er....that's okay, helping you is enough.\"  Duran blushed, damn hormones, but he can't take advantage of them, he won't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will happen if there is no cure?\"  Angela asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I......I don't know.\" Duran admitted, \"I'm the only one who remembers you it seems so, I guess I'll have to take care of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like that.\"  Angela warmly said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me too.\" Resiz added, as they snuggled him again, \"it helps your handsome.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Charming too.\" Angela agreed, Duran gulped a bit, what the hell did the spell do to them?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Duran?\"  A female mage asked, \"the queen asks for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On my way.\"  Duran told her, he got up with Angela and Reisz as they went towards the queen, hopefully she has good news. </span></div></div>",

Reisz however....she was more of a sister, she fancied Hawkeye but the guy had eyes for only Jessica, even if he didn't want to admit it to even himself, Reisz had no hard feelings though, despite her feelings for her being unrequited, she helped him anyways.  Luckily Belladonna removed the curse in an attempt to awaken the mana stone and unleash the  Benevodons to destroy this world, but the goal was the mana sword.  They thankfully put a stop to her plan, as well as the Crimson Wizard and Goremand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's worth a try regardless, the sooner I can fix them the better.\"  Duran stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish you luck Duran, and I do apologizing for not recognizing that girl you claim to be my daughter.\" Valda said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not your fault your highness, it's Anise's.\"  Duran growled at that name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm confident you'll find a solution, and if not, they seem to trust you and are loyal to you, I can see no other person taking care of them.\"  Valda smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We fully agree your highness.\"  Angela said smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go Duran, hopefully our identities are out there somewhere.\"  Resiz added both of them latching an arm around him with smiles, Duran sweat a bit again as the three of them left, why are they so loyal and trustworthy, is this a side effect for trying to block that spell, if so what is it suppose to actually do?</span></div></div>",

Duran gulped, they both looked at him with expecting eyes, hoping for some answer, it was the same look Angela gave him, back then he was oblivious to her feelings, but now he's a bit wiser he knew what that look meant.  They were hoping they were more than just friends, but.....they weren't, Angela might of been something more in time, and Resiz is beautiful in her own right, maybe in different circumstances he can see himself being with her, but what does he tell them, they're just friends, he's dating one of them, he's dating both, what is the right answer?</span></div></div>",

What if there is no cure, what if they're stuck like this forever, he has to take care of them, but.....to be more than friends, is this really okay?  Duran wished he knew what the right answer is, if he tells them they're just friends they'll accept it but they'll be hurt, they clearly want more from this than friendship, same if he says if he's dating only one of them, but he'd be lying, at first at least.  Like he said, he was starting to fall for Angela, and being with Resiz isn't a terrible concept, maybe this can be okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're dating, all three of us, you agreed to share me.\" Duran told them, his fate is sealed, Angela and Reisz looked extremely happy about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh this is great news, I'm sorry we don't recall our relationship before this happened, but we can make new memories.\" Angela smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wonderful happy memories, ones we can share together.\" Reisz added.  Duran smiled as they smiled, feeling warm inside, he'd be lying if a part of him didn't want this, no straight guy alive would EVER turn down an offer like this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, can we make it official, again?\"  Angela asked, Reisz smiled at that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a great idea Angela.\" Reisz said, Duran nodded, well he went this far might as well go all the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure.\" Duran agreed, he gently pulled them in and they smiled at that, first he kissed Angela who happily returned it, Reisz held him close as he did, once they were done kissing he turned to Reisz and kissed her, she returned it with equal passion as Angela sighed happily.  Duran finished kissing Reisz and they were content in holding him close, Duran held them close as well and kissed their foreheads, they giggled at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope we did this before our amnesia.\"  Angela said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We never got many chances, we were busy saving the world.\" Duran said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we can now, and I couldn't be happier that we're doing this too.\" Reisz mentioned, Duran causally nodded at this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, I was wondering when you three would get together.\" Faerie teased as she came out with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Faerie!\"  Duran blushed, as she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm just messing with you, I'm happy for you Duran really, these two girls seem close to you.\"  Faerie said to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\" Duran said, Faerie giggled again as Angela and Reisz kissed his cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, far be it from me to ruin a good moment, I'll take a nap, paying no mind to anything that happens.\"  Faerie giggled again as she went back inside Duran's head.  Duran flushed again but shook it off, with their new relationship established, the three of them continued their journey, a lot happier than before.</span></div></div>",

Duran nodded at that, he felt a bit bad for telling them they're dating when the originally weren't but, it can become real, and they wanted to be an item with him, was it really wrong?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"  Duran thanked, he then noticed the moon rising, a boon for kevin since he can transform into a wolfman but for the rest of the group it meant they needed to sleep soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's getting late, we should get some sleep.\"  Duran told them, the group nodded as they went to an inn.  The dancing man at the counter greeted them, why they dance, they'll never know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome, a room for the three of you?\"  The innkeeper asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually can we all share a room?\"  Resiz asked, the innkeeper smirked at that but said nothing, Duran was blushing red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's your Lucre, that will be 150 lucre for the deluxe room.\" The innkeeper said, Duran took out his lucre and paid the man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy your stay.\"  The innkeeper said as they went to their room, it was a huge room with a bed big enough to fit three people, Duran is blushing mad, but if they were only sleeping it should be fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's get some shut....eye?\"  Duran asked as the two girls undressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're joining us?\"  Angela teased, Duran gulped and nodded, hoping he can control himself, he undressed himself. Soon after the three of them were naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.\" Angela blushed, as did Reisz, Duran is red in embarrassment, hearing them compliment him like that is surreal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're beautiful yourselves.\" Duran finally found his voice as he admired their naked forms, the two of them flushed at that as they hugged him and shared a kiss, feeling their naked flesh did things to his body but he did his best to ignore it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shall we?\"  Angela asked as the three of them went in bed, snuggling their nude forms to him, he felt his erection betray him but they didn't seem to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is great.\" Reisz smiled as she pressed her breasts against Duran, Angela did too, enjoying the warmth of his erection poking at them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\" Duran admitted, he's already getting use to this, maybe he can make this work.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Their breasts bounced delightfully as Duran continued exploring their folds, they moaned happily as he teased them, returning the favour they gripped his cock and stroked it gently, they teased each other for a while before Angela and Reisz took turns sucking his cock, Angela enjoyed the length of his dick while Reisz licked the side before they swapped.  Duran grunted at their double team before cumming in their mouth, they happily swallowed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a drop on the bed.\"  Angela winked, Resiz giggled as they cleaned his dick with their tongues.  Duran grinned as he began eating the both of them out, starting with Angela, Resiz watched fingering herself as Angela cried out in passion, soon after he swapped to Reisz as Angela watched, eh rotated between the both of them until their juices hit his mouth, he made sure nothing got the sheets as he lapped them up like they did with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wish we did this sooner.\" Angela sighed happily, \"but like I said we can make new memories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never been happier, thank you Duran.\"  Reisz smiled as they snuggled him again, guiding his hand to each of their breasts and holding him close, he smiled as the three of them drifted to sleep.</span></div></div>",

Regardless the three of them went to the inn and paid for their room, the three of them grinned as they grabbed the outfits.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to have a look?\" Angela cooed, both her and Reisz stripped out of their clothes very slowly, making sure Duran got to enjoy every second of it, they teased him a bit when they were in their underwear before taking those off and putting on the bikinis they bought, Angela wore a purple one while Reisz wore a green one, Duran grinned as he gave them a show as well, before wearing his sexy swim speedo, the girls grinned and licked their lips from that, soon after the girls wore maid outfits, nurses outfits and a bunny costume, all the while posing for him, Duran in turn wore his appealing outfits they chose as they hollered and cheered as he danced, he felt a bit silly but it was all in good fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So sexy.\" Angela purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And he's all ours.\" Resiz agreed, Duran gave them coy looks as he held them close and kissed them, they kissed back and grind their hips to their crotch, their clothes came off once more and things began getting more intense, Duran went to take care of their breasts again, they cooed while they fondled his cock and balls, they kissed some more before Angela and Reisz got on their knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch carefully now.\" Angela winked, her and Reisz grabbed one of their breasts and placed his penis between them, then they began massaging his dick with their boobs, he groaned in appreciation as they continued taking care of his erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So hard, are you going to put that in us tonight?\"  Reisz asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If that's what you want.\"  Duran replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it is.\"  Angela assured, Duran nodded at that, he really hoped he wasn't taking advantage of them, but then again they do say amnesiacs still have their personalities in tact,  maybe they both felt this way about him and it was repressed.  His moans continued as they worked his shaft, this time taking turns licking it, and taking turns sucking on it like last time.  Both of them stopped and smirked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well if we're going to go further you can't cum yet.\" Reisz teased.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We want that in here.\"  Angela said spreading her nether lips, they both went on the ground as Duran got ready to keep this going.</span></div></div>",

Characters that are counted as female:<br>\r\nHaku (There is no way that Haku is a boy in my opinion).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Super Smash Bros. series can't be used for body switch stories lines inside this story, if you want to make a body switch story for Super Smash Bros, then check out my story Super Smash Bros Switch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf someone ends the story, I'll either remake the chapter so that it isn't over, or get rid of it if it isn't usable at all.</td>",
