Her parents want her to become a school teacher, but she would rather\r<br>\nwrite stories and poems. \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe bright sunshine shown through her bedroom\r<br>\nwindow. She sat up on her cot and looked at\r<br>\nthe mohagany desk to her right. She hurried to get dressed. Today she would have lunch with Thomas Kellinger, the Captain's assistant, and also a crush of hers. She gets\r<br>\ninto her best dress, and shoes and heads to the deck. Of course, she must have breakfast.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nSitting on deck, and letting the sun shine down on you, and letting the wind blow through your hair is the best way to enjoy the day. Your black curly hair hangs to your lower back. You took it out of your bun so that the wind could blow through it. \"You know, I believe you're the first girl I've ever met who has dark hair with bright blue\r<br>\neyes,\" Thomas said coming up to the front of\r<br>\nthe ship with you. \"Thank you Thomas,\" feeling flattered. \"Are you ready for lunch?\"\r<br>\nThomas asked. \"Almost. I would just like to rest on the deck if you don't mind,\" You reply politely. \"That's fine with me,\" he replies leaning against the railing. \"What is\r<br>\nthat?\" You ask looking far off into the distance? \"I'm not sure. Let me go get the captain,\" Thomas replied.</span></div></div>",

As you think back of all the pirate stories you've ever heard, how entire ships are set aflame with the crew on board, and how other crews have been killed through torture, the only remaining traces being a floating body part here or there, what the sharks didn't get, you nervously begin to bite your finger nails. Then remind yoursef of that you promised to give that habit up three years ago.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou look around, where is Thomas?  You wish that he, or the captain, or anyone for that matter would come up deck near you to inform you of what is going on.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe ship has drawn nearer during the passing time.  You now are able to observe the lack of a flag flying- not a good sign.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou sigh and look around.  Surprisingly, the deck is deserted.  There isn't a soul around.  Alone, and feeling alone, on deck you stand and watch the approaching ship with dread wishing you could melt into the boards or sink beneath the waves.  </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You look up at the pirates from your position on the floor.  One of the pirates standing over you appears to be on the young side.  The arrogant snarl on his face and the muscular arms fisted on his hips leave you no doubt that the innocence of youth had been replaced with the necessity to be tough and perhaps cruel to survive as a pirate.  The other man is a bit older, broad in the shoulders and chest, his chocolate-brown hair tied at the nape of his neck with a piece of twine.  His expression is unreadable.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou try to regain some of your dignity by standing, only to find that the older pirate still hasn't let go of your ankle.  Irritation at his familiarity momentarily overcomes the mingling fear and sorrow you had been feeling moments before.  \"Unhand me, you brute!\" you exclaim, kicking yourself free of his grasp.  His eyes narrow, but he releases you and you jump to your feet.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou make a show of brushing the dust bunnies off of your skirts as if this task is more important than addressing the pirates in front of you.  The older one stands with an annoyed sigh, towering over you.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Your name,\" he repeats.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou look up at him, masking your fear and pain with the cool, collected, upper-class, snobby look you saw so often in England.  \"My name is Catalina Sherwood.  You, of course, may call me Miss Sherwood.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"So, *Miss* Sherwood,\" he begins, stressing the Miss in a mocking tone, \"What is a fine *lady* such as yourself doing on a little boat in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou manage to mask your surprise at your father's finest ship being called a little boat.  \"Why, this is my father's *little boat* and I have finished my college education in England and am returning home to the United States,\" you reply, keeping your eyes cool, your spine straight, and your head held high.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"You mean you *were* on your way to the United States,\" the younger pirate interrupts.  \"Hey, Hugo, what do you say we leave this little *lady* here, finish taking over the ship, and then come back for a little fun!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nOne look at the leer on the young pirate's face and you are certain you aren't interested in the *fun* he is suggesting.  You try to suppress the shudder of revulsion and fear that ripples through you.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I agree with that part about leaving her here for now,\" the pirate named Hugo starts, \"but I think you'll be leaving this one untouched.  If this really is her father's ship, she could be of value for ransom.  I can't imagine she'd be of much use after you and your friends would get through with her.\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe younger pirate actually smiles proudly as if Hugo has given him a great compliment.  This time you can't fully suppress your shudder when he turns to look at you.  \"Your loss, my pretty little lady,\" he taunts, undressing you with his eyes.  \"I'm sure me and the boys could have shown you a real good time before we slit your throat!\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHugo's expression remains unreadable.  \"Why don't you get us some rope,\" he says instead.  Without warning, Hugo picks you up, tossing you over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes, and walks across the Captain's cabin.  Your struggling, but your aren't even sure if Hugo notices.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nTo your disgust, he steps over the body of your beloved Thomas as if he wasn't there.  Looking down at Thomas' lifeless body from the height of the pirate's shoulder, the sadness wells up inside you anew.  By the time you have been uncerimonially tied into the captain's chair, the tears are flowing freely down your face.  'So much for my brave front,' you think in self-disgust.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYour position in the captain's chair gives you a clear view of Thomas.  His head is still turned to the side, and his open unseeing eyes are facing you.  For the first time you realize that he is lying in a pool of blood and gore.  Images from the fun weeks on the boat with Thomas flash through your mind.  It seems so unfair that sweet Thomas would end up as such.  The injustice brings a fresh flood of tears.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHugo seems to notice your distress.  He bends down and closes Thomas' eyes, and then pulls a blanket off of the Captain's bed, covering the still bodies of Thomas and the Captain.  Hugo then turns and faces you.  \"If I were you, Miss Sherwood,\" he says in an voice unusually void of emotion, \"I would be more worried about your fate than that of your father's men.\"  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nAnd then he is gone.</span></div></div>",

It is as you expected: if anyone could tie strong knots, it would be a man of the sea.  The silence is suffocating, and you find yourself dwelling on the hopelessness of your situation.  Your father was losing a great deal of his personal savings in the loss of this ship an his men.  It was not guaranteed that he could even come up with whatever ransom the pirates would demand.  Even if he could, how much time would go by before the exchange could take place?  It would be weeks before anyone even realized the boat hadn't docked on schedule, perhaps weeks later before word would arrive to her father that she was being held for ransom and was not just the victim of a sunken ship.  'This is foolishness,' you try telling yourself.  'You aren't even sure the pirates are going to succeed in taking over the ship!'  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou chance a glance at the blanket-covered bodies of your beloved Thomas and the Captain.  The cold blood is seeping into the blanket, and the darker spots are widening as the fluid bleeds into the fabric.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nTrying to distact yourself from such a gruesome sight and the bodies you know lie beneath the blanket, you force yourself to look at the surface of the Captain's desk in front of you.  The surface of the wood is rich and costly.  An elegant map lies partially unrolled, showing the intended course of the voyage.  Elegant fountain pens sit on the desk, along with an ink well.  You start to remember the last letter you had penned to your family: your father, your mother, your kid sister, Mary.  You had been so satisfied.  You had accomplished the goals your parents had laid out for you -- good education at an English school so she could be not just a school teacher but an elegant school teacher, proper, polite, and neat.  More importantly, her parents had hoped that her skills in conversation, music, and culture would make her qualified to be the wife of an upper class man.  Her family was, after all, new money, and she had not been raised in the richer class her sister Mary now enjoyed.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYour train of thought is interrupted when you notice a note on the table.  You are surprised you didn't notice it earlier.  Neat but definately masculine handwriting states the following, obviously refferring to you:  \"This captive is claimed by me and should be considered under my protection.   Abuse her and forfit your life.  -Hugo\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou are still sitting there in stunned silence when the first sounds of fighting reach your ears.  First there are the bone-chilling cries of the pirate crew as they rush onto your father's ship.  There are shouts as your father's crew rush out of their hiding places to meet the attack.  Then the shouts are joined by the sounds of metal hitting metal in sword and knife fighting and the occasional explosions from guns.  You realize that these sounds are all being muted by the strong wooden walls of the Captain's cabin and that they must be deafening on the deck.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe cries of the injured and dying are chilling to you, and you are just starting to find yourself thankful for your relative safety of the Captain's cabin when the door is opened.  The sounds of the battle are louder, and the brighter light from the deck spills across the floor.  As your eyes adjust you see two of the ugliest men you have ever seen.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nIt is obvious to you that they are pirates.  One of them leers at you.  \"Look what someone left for us!\" he cries.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe other is also undressing you with his eyes.  \"Tylas was right.  It would be a waste to leave a pretty little thing like this to Hugo and his ransoming idea.  Much less trouble to get her value out of her here and now!\"  He starts to approach you, and his intent is clear.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, the pirates recover first. More hastily than ever they approach you, and within a second they're towering over your helpless bound figure. One takes a moment to give a wretched smile before pinching your waistband with a thumb and forefinger and raising a mean-looking dagger to cut it--and the rest of your clothes--from your body, without much regard for how much skin will get slashed in the process. You close your eyes tight, regretting deeply that you were stupid enough to call for a pirate's help...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut instead of the feel of a blade sweeping down across your stomach, a loud gurgling shriek startles you into opening your eyes. The pirate with the dagger slumps onto the floor, blood pouring from a fresh cut across his throat. Hugo and the other pirate wrestle above the body, and after a quick struggle your other attacker also falls to the floor, wounded although not mortally. His adrenaline spent, Hugo turns to you and quickly cuts you from your bonds and just as quickly captures your wrists in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously I have to keep an eye on what's mine.\" You look at him, infuriated, and he knows exactly what you're thinking. \"My money, I mean. You're coming with me. You have no choice.\" Though his grip is tight as iron cuffs, Hugo's voice is nonchalant. With a harsh tug he leads you out into the sunlight.</span></div></div>",

The other crewman lay on the floor moaning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hamstrung me!\" he cried, holding his leg and rolling from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Served you right, ya scum!\" was Hugo's sharp answer.  \"You knew she was under my protection!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was just trying to have a little fun!\" he whined, and Hugo kicked him in the other leg.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\"  He turned and looked at me, realizing I hadn't said anything further.

And for what?  What would my father think?  Would I ever see my family again?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the questions going through my mind sent me reeling as we stepped out into the clear bright day.  For some reason I thought it would be dark and foggy and a nightmare outside as it had been inside.  But it was not.  The wind whipped my hair out of it's combs and I looked up at the snapping of the sails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were no men tending them, and they were flapping loose and the ship was listing.  Little as I knew of the sea from my short voyage, I knew that they were scuttling the ship and leaving on their own.  I thought of the cargo in the hold that had been intended for American shores.  It would never see the light of day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugo walked quickly, despite the heaving deck, and I was suddenly faced with the prospect of crossing over the waves on a slim board lashed between them.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can't go on that!\" I cried, my fears overcoming my silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can if you want to live,\" was the deep answer, and before I could voice another objection, he picked me up in his arms like a bolt of cloth, and twisting a rope around his other hand, was quickly up and over the board, putting me down on the other heaving deck as if it had been a jump over a barrel.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Welcome to the Northern Star, Miss Sherwood,\" he drawled, handing me over to a dark skinned man with dreadlocks hanging past his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI promptly fainted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your legs are tied at the ankles to the legs of the chairs, and your wrists are tied behind your back with the rope twisted around the wooden slats making up the back of the chair.  The struggling with the ropes, which starts tentatively, becomes frantic as frustration at your helplessness sets in.  When Hugo walks into the room you are in a frenzy, twisting uselessly in your chair as you try to free your hands.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Miss Catalina Sherwood,\" he says in the tone one would use to warn a naughty child.  You jump up, startled.  You hadn't even heard him enter the Captain's cabin.  \"You wouldn't be trying to escape, would you?\"  He steps towards you, stepping over the bodies on the floor and reaching you in a few paces.  He tips a finger under your chin and lifts your face up so your eyes meet his.  His are cold and expressionless, and a chill runs through you.  \"I told you that you were valuable to me for ransom.  If you had managed to escape and ran into the other pirates, I doubt you would be valuable to me anymore when they would get through with you.  So you see, Miss Sherwood, it is in both my best interest and your best interest that you do whatever I say, do you understand?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou give a frightened nod.  You hate being intimidated and useless like this, but he does have a point.  You are safer if you stick with this Hugo pirate, who sees you as useful, than you would be to the likes of the other pirates.  Especially if they were all like those two you had scared off.  But your pride refuses to let you be so easily tamed.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou shake your head defiantly, making his finger slip away from your chin.  \"Yes, I saw the note you left on the table.  I am supposedly under your protection now.  I have to wonder, though, how good that protection is going to be?\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nHis eyes narrow at you in what you might interpret as anger if his face wasn't so irritatingly unreadable.  \"You're still alive, so my protection is working wonders,\" he says cooly.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yes, I suppose I am...\" you start, letting the expected 'but' hang in the air for a moment.  \"But is it weren't for my own quick wit I would be of no use to you at all right now.  While you were off *murdering* my father's men,\" you are forced to swallow back the sudden lump that enters your throat at the the thougth of those dear men being murdered, \"two of your *pirate friends* were in here pondering how much bearing your *claim* of me had on their right to *have a little fun.*\"\r<br>\n\r<br>\nNow the anger in his face in unmistakable.  \"Who?\" he asked.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Who?\" you ask in return.\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"Yes, who?  Who dared to doubt my claim?\"</span></div></div>",

Hugo takes everything in ... even the shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tylas, then. Well well, my own right hand stabs me in the back. He'll see what that gets him soon enough. And the others would be Orrin and Edric, may they rot in hell.\" You both take some satisfaction in the curse, but you quickly remember that Hugo wouldn't care a bit for your life or your safety if you were just a poor sailor like Thomas. You look into Hugo's blank brown eyes coldly as he pauses to consider you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I suppose I'll have to invest a little in your security, with treacherous bastards like Tylas running loose,\" he says briskly. Pulling a dagger from its sheath at his hip, he cuts your bonds before grabbing your wrists, holding you where you are. He leans in until his face is an inch from yours, and for the first time you see a bit of fire in his mysterious eyes. \"But first things first. You *will* obey me, if you want to live and live well. I didn't kill any of your men, not yet, my job is to find the spoils and you're it. So don't be stupid and try to avenge their deaths by scorning me and ruining your only chance at life, got it, girl?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, the only thing you can think to do with his eyes so close to your own, and the next thing you know you're being pulled up and out onto the disturbing calm of the bloody deck.</span></div></div>",

You had heard before that sometimes, in a really traumatic experience, a person will seem to leave their body, to witness their life as if they were only an outsider and not a participant.  As you look through the pirates, you find yourself marveling at the irony -- your parents had tried so hard to set your future in stone, even going so far as to send you to England to teach you to be a proper, polite, and neat school teacher.  You meekly followed the course they charted for your life, studying hard to be both the perfect teacher and the model upper-class daughter.  You could take tea with the best of them; you knew the geography of all territories of interest to the United States and England; you could play the sweetest melodies on the violin and write elegantly in flourished handwriting.  And now you are on your father's boat in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, all of your protectors have been killed, and your desitny is in the hands of a bunch of pirates.  You want to both cry and laugh at the irony.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou must have smiled wryly during your mental monologue, because when you refocus your eyes on the pirates, they are looking at you as if you are quite daft.  You decide that is just as well.  'Maybe if they think you are daft you will have a better chance of planning an escape,' you wonder, 'If they don't kill you right now,' you add to yourself.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nOne of the pirates is standing, and you notice that he is younger than you would have expected, muscular in the arms but quite a bit narrower in the chest and shoulders than a full-grown man.  His clothing are a bit on the ratty side.  You can't help but notice the blood splattered on his shirt, and vagely wonder if it is his.  The other pirate is definately a full-grown man, with longer black hair tied back at the nape of his neck.  His face is obscured by a thick black beard.  His eyes, a piercing blue in the rich tan of his face, are watching you closely.  He is squatting down near your feet.  Finally you notice that this pirate, the one that so effortlessly extracted you from your hiding place under the bed, is still holding your ankle.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nThis seems to snap you back into reality.  You kick reflexively, freeing your ankle from his grasp, which had grown slack during your extended contemplation.  'Thomas!' you remember suddenly.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nIgnoring the pirates again, you half crawl and half stumble across the room towards the bodies.  'Thomas really is dead!' you force yourself to admit.  Still crawling on the floor, you go behind the captain's desk, retrieving from a drawer a small pair of scissors and a little glass vial with a cork.  You kneel in front of Thomas, your dearly beloved and now dearly departed friend, and cut one of the golden-brown locks of hair, putting the strands in the jar and carefully replacing the cork.  'I will put it in a piece of jewelry,' you think, placing the vial in the pocket bag tied to the sash of your dress.  Then you sit on the floor, still looking at his body.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou can feel the eyes of the pirates watching you.  Suddenly the most important thing is survival.  It occurs to you that they are waiting for you to say something.  'Quick!' you command yourself, 'Think of something to say!  Something important!  Some reason that they should let you live, and, more importantly, let you live unmolested.'\r<br>\n\r<br>\n\"I can play the violin,\" you hear yourself say in a very small, childish voice.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nThe dark man looks at you oddly.  \"Who are you?\" he repeats.</span></div></div>",

When he was satisfide with what he wrote he got up and headed outside on deck.<br>\r\n\"Jacob take us out to sea, You there,\" He pointed to another man, \"Get this message off as soon as possable, make it quick, then meet us in Port Castings due west.\" He smiled, the man took off and head out on the other ship. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter what seemed forever, the door was opened again and there stood Jacob once more.<br>\r\n\"Your wanted by Hugo.\" He told me. \"Come along and don't put up a fight, I'd hate to have to take you there dead.\" He grinned. I sighed and stood up going out of the room after taking a quick glance toward David. Heading back up to the captains chamber, I went inside with Jacob standing behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leave us Jacob.\" Hugo told him, he smiled and patted my backside, I quickly shoved his hand away. \"Your diffently a fisty one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you doing this?\" I asked him as he stood up and walked around the desk toward me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you think?\" he asked in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because your a cold hearted bastard.\" I stated when he stopped in front of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not as cold hearted as you may think, I do have a soft side.\" He told me, \"If I didn't, you would be dead right now, so think about that.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy life my have been in danger but my mind couldn't keep from thinking about how deep blue his eye's were and how the curve of his chin made me feel deep inside. His shirtless chest wasn't helping me at that point, my mind kept wandering as he stood so close to me that I could feel his every breath. He turned and walked away, Leaving me time to breath again and to keep from thinking the thoughs that I was having of him at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When your father receives the message of your capture, they will bring down every ship that they have for your safe return.\" He smiled, \"How much does your father really love you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As much as any other father.\" I told him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess your the lucky one, I never knew my father.\" He walked back toward me and slowly circle around, touching my hair with his hand as he spoke. \"Maybe that's why I turned out this way. Maybe if things had been different, I wouldn't be standing here right now.\" He stopped behind me as he picked up a lock of my hair and smelt it, taking in the sweet scent, then letting it drop back down. \"But then again maybe I would.\" he came around to face me once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why do you do this?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Profit my dear, it all boils down to money, that's every pirates dream, to make that big score, then go for another.\" He smiled. \"Your my big score on this one, I'm sure your father will pay hamsomly to get you back, and with a ship this grand, it can only mean that your swimming in wealth and I want a chunk of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll give you a chunk of something.\" I stated then rushed toward him, he grabbed me and slammed me down on top of the desk. \"let me go.\" I yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is going to be an interesting trip.\" He grinned then bent down forcefully kissing me, I pushed at his chest then weaked for a single moment as I took the kiss he was giving me, when he eased up, I shoved him backwards standing up as I did.</span></div></div>",

Before she could cry out, he said to her, \"Let me show you something, Miss Moneyknickers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could feel the strength in his iron grasp as he led her up the stairs, to the portside deck.  She knew he could grip her with much more force, if he wanted.  His hands were hardened with a lifetime of callouses from hard work.  He held her just tightly enough; she wasn't going anywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sun was sharp and hot on her fair face as they reached topside.  The first thing Catalina noticed as her eyes adjusted was how utterly calm the seas were.  the second thing she noticed was how quiet the pirate's ship was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if reading her thoughts, Hugo asked, \"Hear that, Miss Spoiled?  No?  Then let's take you closer to all the action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe bustled her around the corner, as if she were weightless, towards the bow of the ship.  There, she could see her beloved ship listing severely to the starboard side.  The once-beautiful boat was shattered and smoldering.  Catalina remained quiet, but tears filled her own blue eyes as she thought of the crew -- her friends.  How many lay dead or dying onboard?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe could see a dozen or more pirates throwing objects overboard, to be caught by the greedy scoundrels in the rafts below.  It was a pillage most thorough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gideon's Osprey,\" she whispered, \"may she and her crew rest in peace.\"  Catalina closed her eyes and bowed her head in prayer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aye,\" Hugo said somberly, and let his own head fall, \"'twas a fair ship, with a goodly crew.  Tis a pity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina gave the savage renegade a sideways glance; how odd it was for him to say such a thing.  Maybe he wasn't completely vulgar, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer momentary lapse in hatred for this man was dispelled when her held her shoulders and looked into her eyes from a scant breath away, \"Now listen to me, lass.  Ye may not like me, and you'd be surely right to fear me, but this doesn't have to be as god-awful as ye might think.  After Daddy gives us your weight in gold, we'll be happy to plop you on any dock of yer choosin'.  Then ye can be off to bathe in satin and pearls, or whatever it is rich girls do these days.  But know ye this:  you'd be wise to respect us, for any lip you give will likely get fattened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt any other time, Catalina might have bristled at being threatened, pirate or not, but the day had brought too much violence and misery upon her.  She nodded silently and cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHugo watched her a moment, then made sure the captain wasn't watching.  He lifted her quivering chin with one grubby thumb and whispered, \"You'll be fine.\"</span></div></div>",

If Catalina had not been drunk she would have never accepted a gift from a perate that had killed her fathers crew, but she WAS drunk so she took the choaker and draped it over her neck. She was having trouble with the clasp. Their faces were very close and Catalina was beginningo feel uncomfortable when Hugo fasened the necklace and stepped back. Catalina straightened and stumbled over to a mirror where she gazed at the delicacy on her long slender neck. The choaker fit perfectly and the diamonds shone in the evening sun that came through the windows. \"Thank you\" She managed to stutter amazed by the beauty of the gems.

Then he said \"Of course Hugo, what were we thinking Jake?\" He was acting sorry but Catalina could see his hand reaching for a dagger behind his back. Catalina screamed \"look out Hugo!\" Hugo whipped around and moved just in time. The dagger flew past and embedded itself in the ship. \"Mutany!\" He bellowed and sunk his sword deep into Tylus's stomache. \"Jake!\" He yelled \"go to the hold and lock yourself into the prison cell.

It was supposed to have docked in America 3 days ago. This was not surprising, ships were often late. It's just that no one had seen a ship flying the American flag for a long while. He was soon put out of his misery, only to be thrust directly into another one. A message came from an English ship that his ship had been seen flying the pirate flag, a skull and croosbones. He was now very worried about Catalina and her soon to be husband (he hoped) Thomas. He gave up any hope that they had escaped and almost all hope of them being alive when another message came saying a young girl had been spotted leaning over the rails of the ship kissing a ragged Pirate. Catalina's father was both relieved and terrified. What had those awfull pirates forced her little girl to do? The thought was horrible and he thrust it from his mind. He made plans to arm a ship and send it out to search the area where the pirate ship ahd last been seen. He must save his dear child from those terrible disgusting pirates!</span></div></div>",

In those days it would be called a scrap of cloth not fit to put on your sock. The pants (Catalina only wore dresses) were very small and had a lot of rips in them. The rips had been covered in baggy pieces of expensive looking translucent silk in all different colors. The third garment was a thin silk scarf to be tied around the neck. The bikini top (as we will call it) was deep crimson red, the pants were black and the scarf was a shiny silver color. Catalina looked at the \"clothes\" and then down at her dress, with it's high collar and sleeves and skirt that showed neither her wrists nor ankles as was proper. She took the clothes only out of kindness to Hugo and stood behind some crates to change. When she got them on she discovered that the clothes fit perfectly. She looked down at herself and gasped the Bikini left her stomache bare and the tops of her breasts emerged over it. The pants were very tight on the legs and buttox but luckily they covered her ankles (thank god) They hung low on her hips and her belly botton showed inched above where the pants commenced. The scarf hung down just over the bikini top and seemed to make the outfit more scarce than it already was. she stepped out from behind the crates and shyly stood in front of Hugo. his jaw dropped and his eyes rolled (let me explain, Catalina had a body that would make Britany Spears break down crying) Catalina burst out in tears \"It's hideous isn't it\" she sobbed into her hands \"no no no you misunderstood me. You are the most dazzlingly beautiful person I have ever seen\" Hugo gazed at her longingly \"really? but my arms are bare and my stomache and look at my chest!\" Hugo was thinking \"You don't have to tell me to\" but he said I would be honored if you chose to wear this in my presensce\" He knelt down and kissed her hand. Catalina wiped away her tears \"ok I will wear it. On one condition. If any of your men touch me because of this outfit I will never wear anything you give me again\" She said this with a defiance that meant she was talking business. \"If any of my men, even think about touching you I will lock them in the cell and feed the key to the sharks.

(They were also much easier to take off, when the mood struck Hugo and she) Catalina could climb and swing from the riggings and she could out-dance any lady she would come across (though she never did come across another lady) Though Catalina's new style of dancing was quite diffferent than that of a well-bred lady because it consisted of some very *revealing* moves. \r<br>\nAnyway, Catalina had been up in the crows nest and she spotted her fathers ship, though she did not know it was his at that time. The pirates had not looted or killed in the past 2 months because of the great ship they had just attained. They were taking a rest. Catalina was therefore surprised to see another ship. She hopped out of the crows nest and climbed quickly down the rigging. (much to the sadness of some pirates who had been looking up her shirt from below.) She ran straight to Hugo's cabin (which they now shared) and told him of the ship flying american colors \r<br>\n </span></div></div>",

Finally Catalina grit her teeth and pulled the shoes from her sore and bleeding feet and got to running once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut running to where?  What would she do when she reached the rear of the ship?  Or the bow?  Or below decks?  There was really nowhere to hide, but to her terrified mind there was only one solitary thought of which she was consciously aware: RUN!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd run she did -- right into the chest of a half-naked, creosote-covered black-heart that knocked her again to her backside with a jarring THUMP!  Her teeth snapped closed, narrowly missing her tongue, and her eyes wandered as her dizzy head spun like a top inside her skull.  Catalina was just clearing the cobwebs when the brute closed one massive paw along her jawline and picked her up to peer into her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe exposed all three remaining teeth when he sneered, \"Hey!  What's dis then?  HA!  A woman!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina still clutched both of her shoes in her hands, and the soles of them, she knew, were as deadly as any weapon ever wielded by any man.  She spread her arms wide, and this unexpected maneuver made the damned pirate pause to look at her actions with two dimwitted eyes, right before she swung her arms together as if she were crashing a cymbal instead of a man's skull.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe cried out and threw Catalina down, whereupon she landed hard against a large piece of railing.  It did not puncture her back and embed itself into her kidneys like the pain indicated it had, but it was certainly enough to forcibly drive the air from her lungs in a sickly wheeze.  There appeared to be two of him as she looked up, and neither was any better looking than the other.</span></div></div>",

So when the next cannon ball tore through the main mast and skipped off the deck before striking the man in front of her and sending his body into the sea, she was amazed at the power of the concussion of air as the enormous projectile passed by.  The displacement of which twisted her lungs and made Catalina involuntarily retch.  Thousands of deadly wood splinters tore through the air in search of something soft to pierce.  She wanted to duck but her world seemed oddly lacking in gravity, or a clearly defined sense of up and down for that matter, and instead her head lashed uncontrollably from one side to the other as wooden shrapnel pelted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she hit her head?  Why was she unable to focus?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina fought the nausea to see the huge main mast twisting free of the ship not twenty feet to her right.  And though it occurred to her that she needed to roll or crawl away as it teetered above her, her ragged body was too wobbly to react.  She could only keep still on her back and watch as the giant wooden cylinder broke free of the myriad of rigging that temporarily slowed its free fall and would soon become her tomb.</span></div></div>",

The vertiginous feeling was gone, replaced only with a strong sensation of floating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she died?  Had the main mast crushed her so thoroughly that she never felt any pain, and was currently on her way to the afterlife?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe answer was a resounding NO as her limp little body crashed back to the deck with something heavy wrapped around her.  She rolled over some rope, which burned her shoulders, and a random nail came perilously close to her eyes, but Catalina had no time to register this because it was at that very instant when the mast crashed into the deck with a destructive force a hundred times that of the cannon ball just a few moments ago.  It tore into the ship and crashed through the decks on its way through the hull and, eventually, to the very bottom of the ocean.  The ship screamed as the structural integrity gave out and the vessel suddenly turned on itself, collapsing inwardly as water surged upwards through the boat with great tenacity and inevitability, causing the ship's screams to turn to groans, almost as if it were aware of its fast-approaching demise and accepted it with little more than sad moans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat?  What was that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girl!  Are you injured?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Catalina's strained consciousness allowed her to focus on her surroundings once again, and she realized she was wrapped in the protective cover of two masculine arms.  She wriggled free and fell to her chin.  When she looked up, she stared again into the bluest eyes she had ever seen, the eyes of the first pirate that she'd stomped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat up and quickly looked around.  Catalina's ship was breaking apart and already the frothy sea was coming up to meet them through the extensive damage of the boat.  \"Are you injured?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't, I don't --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you walk?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, her mouth betrayed her with unintelligible stutters, \"I, I don't --\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man clenched his jaw beneath his lips and swooped one arm around Catalina's waist as if her were carrying a puppy.  He sprinted over flaming wreckage as easily as one might skip across the sidewalk on a lovely spring day, only with a hundred-pound girl on his hip.  He got to the remains of the outer rail and put one shiny boot on it.  He leaned over and shouted, \"McShay!  McShay, throw me a line, for the love of God!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina's dazed state kept her from knowing the precise actions of her savior, but there was a thump as he caught something in his chest.  Rope, maybe?  Then the weightless feeling returned as the man swung them across to the other boat, the sinister one, whereupon they were pulled from the air by rough hands, one of which found Catalina's breast.</span></div></div>",

After 2 years of only being on pleasure boats in the bay with Irish, she hadn't quite gotten her sea-legs yet, or for that matter, stomach. She wasn't alone however; most of the other passengers on the Saint Cleary were English patrons who'd never sailed in their lives, and were equally wrong-footed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't look half as ill as the rest of us,\"<br>\r\na groggy voice commented as you raised your head from over the side. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA girl with stringy blond hair, a couple years your senior smiles tremulously at you, slightly green.

Said my momma drank so much of it, was bound to be born looking like this,\" you said, running your fingers through your damp red curls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatherine smiled wryly. Suddenly, she was all business.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They say it'll be a long trip, couple weeks to a month. What say you to being my company?\"<br>\r\nShe asked, kind of shyly but still confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pretend to mull it over for a moment. Then you grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not? Two young girls like ourselves should not be left alone for such a time,\" you remark, preening importantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good. Well, I'm going to get ready for dinner. Meet me there? You can meet my family, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright. See you there, Miss Hart.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she left with a flounce of skirts and wiggling of her fingers.

You stayed for only 20 minutes before retiring to your cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you sat on the bed, you reached into your pocket and retrieved your soldier's parting gift.

Steeling your nerves, you face the sweaty, unshaven mass that is indeed a pirate. He grins sichophantically at you as he advances to your door. You stand still, hoping he cannot hear your beating heart through your breast. He makes to grab your arm...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...when your knee suddenly connects with his groin, and moaning he sinks to the floor, woozy, but still alert.

When no one came running, she slipped out into the hallway and started to make her way up the stairs. <i>I'm almost there,</i> she thought. <i>Just up these stairs and maybe I'll be able to find some help.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatalina stopped when she reached the top of the stairs. The door in front of her led to the deck, where all the pirates were probably lounging. If she were to open the door and start pleading her case, one of them might feel sorry for her. Or, they might all hate her and decide to kill her right then. She had to make a decision now, or else wait and let her fate rest in the hands of these grungy pirates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swung open the door and gasped when she saw the pirate called Hugo standing there with his arms folded across his chest staring straight at her. His gaze sent shivers up her spine, but she refused to look weak. Holding her head high, she addressed him in as calm and strong a voice as she could muster. \"I would like to go with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You heard me, I'd like to go with you wherever it is you are going.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smirk spread across Hugo's face and Catalina realized just how handsome he actually was. Dark hair and dark eyes framed his tan skin and she also couldn't help but notice how muscular he was and how wonderfully his barely-there shirt looked on him. She swallowed hard and made herself look the handsome pirate in the eye.</span></div></div>",

Glancing around for help, she could see the lifeless body of Jim to her left, lying in a pool of blood and shattered ship. Neither Garrett nor Thomas, or any other living soul, were to be seen beyond the many more bodies that were strewn across that deck. That was when the smell of battle reached Catalina. The foul, sticky mix of blood, gunpowder and tar burned her nostrils and the salt, sea air bit at her leg wound. She soon realised that she was alone on the Quarter Deck, alone with only the pain and ghostly silence to comfort her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing all the upper body strength she could muster, she hauled herself towards the steps that led to the main deck. Once near the top she realised that she was wrong in her assumption of being alone on the ship for, standing there on the deck was at least two boarding party\u2019s worth of pirates surrounding the surviving remainder of her crew. Scanning the faces she recognised Thomas\u2019 and a few other survivors and let loose a sigh of relief. This feeling of relief was to be short-lived as the broadswords, held firmly in the hands of the marauding buccaneers, were being forcefully thrust towards the crewmembers. Straining to hear what was being said, she heard an order for the Captain of the ship to be brought forward. Glowing with pride, Catalina watched as the crew remained silent, unwilling to fulfil this heathen\u2019s request. Movement below her redirected her attention and she watched with sorrow as her Captain was brought in front of the pirates. Once again Catalina\u2019s heart swelled with pride by the Captain\u2019s dignified approach, not once did he appear to have any fear in his heart. Calmly, he addressed the pirates, \u201cI command, as Captain of this ship, that you release my crew immediately and disembark from this vessel to the one from which you came, leaving at once.\u201d At which the pirates exchanged amused glances and sniggered. A cold, evil laugh that sent chills right through Catalina\u2019s body. It was a sound that would haunt her until the end of her days. Sniggering over, the pirates jabbed their swords towards the crew again and issued their commands. Unable to hear well enough, Catalina edged forward, unaware that she was becoming increasingly visible in the sight of the pirate gang.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe commands declared by the pirates were</span></div></div>",

She was surprised to learn that they had no interest in robbing their cargo, which was actually nothing more than food and supplies for the British army that had recently been evacuated from the American Colonies. She had only ever known of pirates thieving from merchant ships and couldn\u2019t fathom what other possible reasons they would have for their boarding. With her head through the banister she could just make out the voices of the trespassing pirates.<br>\r\n\u201cYou have two options. One, you join our crew and become a pirate, or we send you down to the locker. What\u2019ll be?\u201d<br>\r\nCatalina was puzzled by this demand. Judging by the number of pirates currently aboard her ship, she wouldn\u2019t have expected them to be short of hands, especially as there were bound to be more still lurking on the vessel alongside them. Casting a glance over the rail confirmed that there were indeed a handful of men still aboard the offensive ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden scuffle below on the main deck reminded Catalina of the present situation. Much to her dismay, some of her crew had refused to become part of such a crew and had been thrown overboard. Those left on deck became much more nervous and she could see that a few of them had been press-ganged already. Once the crew had realised that the threats were real, more agreed to the pirate\u2019s demands and were escorted onto the corrupt ship. The last pirates who left lit torches and threw them towards the remaining crew members, of which there were not many but did include both the Captain and Thomas in their group.</span></div></div>",

Her gaze turned distractedly to the main deck where the last members of the crew were busily falling back under the command of the Captain and attempting to salvage what they could of the burning ship. From her position above the deck, Catalina could see the fire was spreading ferociously without a hope of the crew stopping it or even merely containing it to the deck, it was quickly devouring everything on board, reaching into the cabins and climbing the masts. It was a devastating sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptivated by the sight of the fire and the crew frantically trying to control it, Catalina felt helpless, unable to move, let alone assist them. It was then that the main mast was conquered. She could hear the wood splitting as the flames devoured it. Calling out to the crew, drawing their attention to it, Catalina warned the men below just in time before it came crashing to the deck, taking with it a large chunk of the starboard side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shouts also alerted Thomas to her position and he joined her within seconds.<br>\r\n\u201cCatalina? Come, on. Let\u2019s get you off this ship. There\u2019s no saving her now.\u201d The sorrow in his voice was not hard to miss. Thomas had been on the Curious Jane since he\u2019d been a boy of 12, working his way up through the ranks on the modest merchantman, earning the respect of his crewmates and the approval of the Captain. Catalina knew this from their many conversations of their after-dinner stroll across the decks. It had been six days since they had left the English harbour of Portsmouth and in this time, Thomas had opened up to her, as she had done to him. She knew he aspired to follow in the footsteps of his father and own his own trading company but she also knew that he loved this, now weakening, ship as his home, as it had been for the past 11 years, and that this was to be the present Captain\u2019s final voyage before commencing his retirement. Thomas was to get the ship and subsequently be able to follow his dream. A dream that was now going up in smoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a sombre moment as he carried Catalina down the steps to the main deck. To her dismay, she realised there was only the one remaining lifeboat that was still sea-worthy, the rest lost to the flames. The crew gathered round and it was clear they would not all be able to cram into the small craft.</span></div></div>",

Entering you hear, the last of your captors speech.  \"There is something to her, something making her more than the wife of a crew member, she will be worth the cost of her trouble, a heavy ranson could be had for her.\"  You realize he must have seen you the entire time, the heedless flight off your father's ship which now you greatly regret.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou are aware of the captain looking you over.  The conversation in the room has died out and an awkward silence has taken over.  He is examining you.  Your drowned rat appearance, your stylish clothes, your miskept, snarled hair, your figure.  He's peering into you, behind the outer layer, you realize.  Not into you, he isn't capable of that, but you realize he's attempting to do so.  \r<br>\n\r<br>\nYou refuse to look down.  You meet his stare, if not exactly, looking directly at him, at least you don't turn away, and you feel shame mount on your face as he picks each part of you to pieces, mentally feasting on you.  Oddly enough, at least compared to standing up on deck, you are relieved your captor has remained in the room.

She briefly considered putting her clothes back on, but decided that her undergarments would have to do, for it was difficult to be stealthy in a petticoat. <br>\r\nCrawling up the stairs, she heard the muffles sounds of celebration and laughter. But which side had won? There was only one way to find out. Gently, she lifted the trap door that led to the deck, only to have it smashed down heavily by someone's foot. She waited a minute, holding her breath until the footsteps faded away, and then she tried to open the hatch again. <br>\r\nThis time she met no resistance, and dared to peek out of the small space. <br>\r\nThe victors were dumping bodies overboard, inspecting cabins and cheering. The pirates had won. Dismay crossed the young girl's face as she saw the captain's corpse fall into the sea, pushed by two ruthless men wearing ripped pantaloons and wide, V necked T shirts. She had never seen pirates before today, and despite her disgust at all that was happening, she was curious of what these people were like. They all dressed alike, wearing bright colors and thick buckled boots. Most of them wore head dressings such as bandannas, though some were bald. Catalina couldn't help but notice that all of these men wore an extensive amount of Jewelry, usually gold bands with a precious gem in the middle. There were also necklaces, bracelets, and earrings, all gold and silver. Catalina could have sworn that she even saw a glimmer of gold in a man's mouth, posing as a tooth!   <br>\r\nHer studies were suddenly interrupted by the appearance of two pirates coming from the captains quarters. The first thing that she noticed was that both of these men wore black, although the taller one was distinguished by a typical captain's hat and cape. The next thing that she noticed was that they were heading right for her below deck! In a panic, she dropped the trap door and bolted down the stairs. Leaping over her deserted attire, she clambered back into her original hiding place. <br>\r\nAfter carefully putting the lid back on the crate, she tried to calm her breathing down in order to hear.  <br>\r\nThe hatch opened, and she heard a voice say:<br>\r\n\"No, Crimby, I want you to see if the ship still has some cargo in it. They might have picked up some merchandise in the last port, unlikely though it may be.\"<br>\r\n\"As you wish, Captain.\" a deeper voice replied. <br>\r\nShe heard one pair of footsteps stomp down the stairs, and then a pause as i reached the bottom.. The silence lasted a full two minutes, and Catalina began to panic. Shifting slightly, she was able to see through a minuscule hole on the side of the crate. <br>\r\nThere was one of the darkly dressed men, standing as still as a statue except for his head, which revolved slowly around the room, surveying as if looking for a good hiding place. Catalina could hardly guess his actions until her eyes rested on the floor, where she had left-<br>\r\nOh gods! The dress!<br>\r\nShe must have emitted a small gasp because suddenly the man charged towards the crate, and drew a wicked looking dagger from his belt.  He pulled the lid off with little effort, and yanked Catalina out of her sanctuary roughly. <br>\r\n\"Please! She screamed. \"Please, don't kill me!\" But he already had the dagger to her throat, and she feared for the worst. <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

Her parents had sent her to a college in England. They want her to be a school teacher. Someone who is very proper, polite, and neat. On her way home, she has a run in with a ship full of pirates. They attack her ship, and kill everyone on board, except for her. When she comes out of hiding, she spots a very handsome pirate.\r<br>\n\r<br>\nShe goes onto their ship and through all of the terror aboard ship. She begins to have feelings for this mysterious pirate. Is it really just true love? Or just lust?\r<br>\n\r<br>\n--------------------------------------------------\r<br>\nATTENTION!: I would like to explain somethings before you continuing reading. I've seen you add in that Hugo is the captain. He's NOT a captain, just a pirate. I would also like to add that there shouldn't be any rape or kinky sex. If you'd like, you can put in sexual acts, but don't get graphic. I'll edit or delete chapters that don't specifically address this. I hope that you will follow the two things I've asked of you. Please don't blow the story out of proportion, or I'll add more regulations to this story!</td>",
