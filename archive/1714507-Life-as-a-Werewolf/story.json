Mind you we do have to be careful in our mid wolf form (thats what I call it wenh we chage without the fulll moon) as we are much easiler argured, offened or set into a rage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext myth we look like an real wolf, actually no, we look more like a hybrid of man and wolf, like in the older werewofl films, its not constant though, some off us look more wolf like, some look less, don't ask me why, its just something that happens. Next silver kills us, now this is true, a sliver bullet or sillver knife wto a fatal spot like the heart, neck or head will kill us, but that is not are only weakness, Wolfsbane works just asw well, to inhale or eat it will kill us in minutes. Mountain ash is also dangerous it hurst us to touch it, not agony hurts more it stings, and are final weakness is misiltol, yes the stuff you hang up at christmass, the smell of it is repulsive, the stench is to much for us, we can't stand being anywhere near the stufff, to us its torture. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne final thing your probably wondering about powers, well we are powerful, were superstrong, I used to be able to lift a table, I can lift a car with one hand, I ruun at over 70 miles an hour, I ca jump twelve foot in the aire, I can hold my breath for seven minutes, I can climb a tree and jump from tree to tree like a monkey, and nothing other than silver, wolfsbane and complete destruction of are body can kill us, now tahts clear...</span></div></div>",

He hadn't told his family about his new.....<i>condition</i> yet and he hoped to god that it never comes time to reveal what he had become. He shivered remembering the first time he transformed. The pain, the heat, the feeling of absolute power that came with the change that time was something he could never forget until morning came then he changed back into his human form and was alone in the middle of the woods in his birthday suit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat what the duffel bag was for as he packed plenty of spare clothing, a compass, a piece of incense, a portable phone charger, and mountain ash as precaution if his transformation gets out of hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking out to the woods behind his neighborhood, he ran through the thick underbrush into a isolated clearing that was far away from civilization. This was the first place he transformed into a werewolf, so it was a special place for him to come out and be alone when his other half needed to be let out. He could already feel the moon humming, calling out to his bestial half as twilight crept over the forest. \"Soon.\" Scott murmured and stripped off his clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stashed the duffel bag into a hollow tree as the change began to occur. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott growled. Literally <i>growled</i> as heat spread throughout his body then came the pain and he fell to the forest floor. It started with his bones as they cracked, broke, and reformed themselves into something not part of the human anatomy. His muscles tore themselves apart as they stretched, strengthened, and hardened into steel bands resembling muscle. His skin sprouted fur from every pore as it stretched and tore. Claws exploded from his fingers and toes as his transformation neared its end. Scott roared as his jaw stretched and razor sharp fangs burst from his gums with his head elongating into that of a wolf. Finally his transformation was complete and a great black beast with golden predatory eyes stood where the man known as Scott had been before. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt howled into the night. The joy in it unmistakable as every animal either fled or hid away from the terrifying creature that now prowled through the dark forest. The werewolf sprinted out of the forest, searching for its next meal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the beast vanished into the depths of the forests, a paranormal research club entered the outskirts of the forest. These students were from the nearby college investigating the strange howls that came from the forest during the full moon. The group was chattering with excitement as their leader, a rather nerdy guy with night-vision goggles and a camera called out the other four members. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright ladies and gentleman, we the members of the Paranormal and Supernatural Discovery Club will finally capture real footage of the elusive beast of Trinity that stock these woods on the night of the full moon. I, Mike Jackson, shall lead the search for the beast,\" He had the camera pointed at himself for the introduction then panned out to other members. \"with the help of my second-in-command, Stephanie Dresden\" he zoomed onto a pretty redhead wearing large glasses. \"Our tracker, John Oliver\" he turned to the dark-hair young man with a bored look on his face. \"Our benefactor, Mrs. Pitt\" He swung the camera towards the only adult in the group (their driver too) and centered on a dark-haired women in her mid-thirties that was still waiting in the car. She waved as Mike swung the camera to the last and the most remarkable member of the group, a young blonde woman that was armed with a crossbow and a silver knife, \"the only woman who has rejected more times than any other man, woman, and child on earth, Fiona Argent.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiona snorted at Mike's comment then he turned the camera back to himself, \"We will be the first to dare trek these woods to find the source of recent string of animal mauling. Local police have been baffled as the beast seems to disappear without a trace and only appears on the night of the full moon.\" Mike clipped the camera to the side of his night vision goggles then announced \"Now we shall begin the search for the Beast of Trinity.\"</span></div></div>",

A growl rumbled through his chest as he caught the scent of something up ahead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSliding to a stop, Scott growled again as a bear came ambling out of the trees ahead of him. The bear froze at the sight of the strange creature in front of it then following the thought of fight or flight, the bear choose \"<b>FIGHT</b>. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bear roared then charged at Scott as he roared back in challenge and leapt at the brown behemoth. Both collided in a spray of mud, claws and fangs flying, impossibly fast, black and brown clashing in a deadly tangle of death. Fur flew as both beasts, one primal and one supernatural, ripped ribbons out of each other as blood sprayed as they tore into each others flesh and painted the surroundings in a macabre of crimson. The bear swung its thick arm, sending Scott flying into a tree. His back made an audible crack as he collapsed at the base, the air knocked out of him but now he was getting angry. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt swung once again but Scott was ready and ducked beneath the bear's wild swing then stabbed his own claws deep into the bear's armpit. It howled in pain as his claws cut through layers of fur, fat, and muscle until he reached down to the bone. The bear went wild with the surge of pain, trying to dislodge Scott but he held on even tighter to the bear's side. Wrapping his fingers around the socket, Scott pulled with his bestial strength and ripped the bear's arm off. Screaming in pain, the bear fell away from Scott as he howled in triumph then started beating the bear back with its own arm with sadistic joy. The bear tried to run away from the monster that was beating it but the blood lost and missing appendage slowed the bear down and Scott kept attacking it till the bear finally breathed its last breath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nScott howled once more as he could feel that his wounds were already stitching themselves back together thanks to a werewolf incredible regeneration. Werewolves weren't immortal, just a lot tougher to kill thanks to their strength and regeneration. But all that power and healing needed energy, hence werewolves whether in human form or changed are in a constant state of hunger to fuel their enhanced abilities. Scott began to eat the remains of the bear to refuel himself for the next fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter his meal, Scott tore back into the night in search of more prey. His instincts were on overdrive after the fight with the bear so when he sensed something amiss in the forest, he came to a stop. Sniffing the air, he detected something out of place in the forest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did he smell?</span></div></div>",

The officer aims the shotgun at you. \"Is that the way you treat someone that saved your life,\" you laugh. \"Your a werewolf.

I couldn't eat another bite! But what do I do with the bones?\" he asked himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked at the skeleton, and the ropes of uneaten flesh and blood that still clung to it. He had to get rid of it somehow without anyone finding it, or things might get a bit problematic. He could always just bury it in the yard, where no one could find it, but his mom had started a flower garden last week. What if she does some digging and finds a finger or something? Maybe he could haul it to the forest, and hide it there. But the night is still young. What if someone sees him? Either way, he also needs to get rid of that pool of blood out front, before anyone sees that. Apparently, it's hard work killing and eating humans.</span></div></div>",

Zach decided the best idea would be to go after the weakened and drunken teenagers partying in the night. He might save the kids for dessert though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach then bolted towards the camping grounds, moving at full speed and using all four of his limbs to get him there. Within seconds he could soon see the glow of the fire, sniffing as he ran, he caught the scent of a human that had been separated from the rest of the group. Zach began to slow down as he would approach the area, hearing teens laughing and talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach slowly stepped forward and would see the human that was separated, a 16 something teen hanging out against a tree. He looked almost familiar, but Zach grabbed his stomach as it growled loudly, reminding him what he was here for. Zach decided to try something new though, instead of what he usually did; ripping, tearing, causing a lot of blood. Zach would instead attempt to swallow the human whole. It had some pros too, the prey could squirm and kick, which felt amazing! The prey would also be able to cry and scream for help, the werewolf's body usually muffling out the words, but still it was nice to hear them beg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Zach began to approach the teenager, looking around to make sure nobody else was watching. Zach was in the clear so he quickly lunged at the human, covering his mouth and dragging him away from the group. The human kicked and squirmed as he was taken away, but before he even had time to realize what happened, his world was plunged into darkness as Zach clasped his mouth around his head gently, avoiding his animalistic instincts to bite down onto his flesh. The human began to stutter as he tried to yell for help, too scared to move. Zach took another strong gulp as he swallowed up to the human's chest, licking him over and savoring his strong flavor. The human began to come to his senses as he suddenly began to pull out his phone, desperately dialing 9-11. Zach quickly just snatched the phone and threw it to the side mid-dial. Zach continued with his meal, taking a few more strong gulps as the human's feet would soon slide into his mouth. Zach, rubs the bulge going down his throat as the human was deposited into his stomach. He murred loudly as he gave out a smelly belch, the rest of the human's breathing air being removed with that burp as the human would soon pass out. It was for the best though, as Zach's stomach began to quickly work on such a large meal, acids pouring in to digest all that meat, hair, clothing and such. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach laid back against a tree, rubbing his belly. It wasn't that big, Zach was sure he could fit in at least 2 more teens, or 4 more kids. Zach sniffed the air and listed, noticing that nobody smelled scared and that nobody was screaming in fear. Zach growled happily as he felt the human breaking up in his stomach. Zach could always wait there for an hour for his belly to finish the human off, but he decides he'll just find some more prey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Zach decides to go after some more teenagers, the first one was so easy! So the rest of them should also be equally easy right? Maybe Zach could lure a pair of them away from the rest of the group, devour them when they're far enough away.<br>\r\n2. Zach decides to go after some of the children in another part of the campground. Their tender and often salty skin (from tears) was usually very tasty.</span></div></div>",

Maybe Zach could lure a pair of them away from the rest of the group, devour them when they're far enough away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach sat there, his belly gurgling and bubbling as he tried to think of a way to lure his prey away when he began to hear the human's phone ring loudly. Zach looked over and knew the other humans would probably hear the phone as he grinned evilly. Zach walked over and grabbed the phone in his mouth, munching on it light, but not breaking it, just tasting it. Zach held the phone as he saw two teenagers approaching, the phone still ringing. Zach slowly backed up, luring the two teens even deeper and deeper into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two humans, one a guy and one a girl. The girl was very stereotypical and held onto the guy's arm, asking for them to turn back. The guy was being a stereotypical 'badass' telling her they'd find David. The guy and the girl both smelled as if they bathed in alcohol, their clothes actually wet, the two of them were clearly drunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Zach decided they were deep enough in the woods, far enough so that they'd have to run a while to get back, Zach dropped the phone onto the dead leaves, burying it a little to confuse them. The two teenagers did find the wet phone and were quite confused, trying to figure out how it had gotten so far in and buried under the leaves. But before they could even react, Zach lunged out towards them, rolling with them onto the ground, but all three of them ended up rolling down a hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen they land at the bottom, things couldn't be better for Zach! The human girl was on the ground, her face being muffled out by his werewolf ass, the guy was actually already in his mouth up to his shoulders. Zach licked over the human, as he tilted his head back beginning to swallow him down, the girl starting to come to only to breath in the strong musk of the wolf behind. She began to scream and flail, as suddenly Zach felt something new ... the girl's head had entered his backside... Zach had heard of this before, eating with your ass, he never understood the appeal of it, but now that it was happening to him, he loved it! Zach decided to finish up on the male first though, swallowing him down further and soon sending him down to his belly with the partially digested 'David.' The girl within that time had managed to squirm so much that her shoulders had gotten into his ass next. Zach got onto all fours, his belly almost laying on the floor as he arched his back, lifting his ass into the air. With relative ease, Zach shook his ass, clenched his muscles and sucked the girl down further, feeling her waist and hips enter next. The girl continued to squirm and kick, displacing a lot of air inside as Zach grunted, and let loose a massive and loud fart, not loud enough to be heard by the others thankfully. The fart was so rank the girl passed right out as he sighed a little, knowing she wouldn't squirm anymore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nZach soon finished off the girl and sent her towards his belly to be digested. Cail let out a long belch, releasing their breathing air as he felt the guy's squirms steadily stop. Zach's belly gurgled loudly as he yawned and relaxed against the floor, letting out a small fart and burp releasing more displaced air as he rubbed his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Zach decides to head home for the night, happy with his bounty for the night. Zach's home is pretty far though, he probably won't be able to run there for a bit. Zach might even be able to refill his belly on the way to his home! Oh wouldn't that be fun~?<br>\r\n2. Zach decides to wait for a few hours, maybe take a power nap as he digests his prey. After his prey will be gone, he could then go out and hunt down some more victims or even grab a few kids to eat ... although he may need to release his waste someplace, might be hard to explain to his parents why he clogged the toilet with three teenagers worth of shit.</span></div></div>",

Zach's pecs began to protrude out of his chest creating 2 glorious mountainous pectoral muscles, next his bulging stomach srinks slowly forming a steel hard 6 pack. His biceps started to grow aswell as the rest of his muscles. Zach stands up and flexes his newfound muscles. The power zach felt is amazing, absorbing he human prey felt so good, and now it's getting him a bit excited to grow even more powerfull and feel more humans squirm inside of him. Zach immediately picked up the sent of more campers, teenagers again, and man how he sprinted on all fours egger to devour them all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Once zach reached the campsite he spotted a human peeing on a tree and he seemed really drunk and sleepy. Zach slowly made his way closer to the boy, the closer he got the harder his cock got. The anticipation was killing him and exciting him but he was patient, by the time zach got there he got a raging hard boner and thought \"maybe I could have some fun with this one.\" In expectantly the boy turns around, not bothering to zipper up his pants, and stairs at the wolf. \"Oh what's up. Who are ....\" The teenages says when he realizes he is looking at a giant werewolf he immediately sobers up and his eyes widen. He let's out the beginning of a scream when zach in a mixture of last minute thinking and desire for his load to be releced zach grabs the back of the boys head and shoves him into his cock slit. The amount of pleasure that gave zach caused him to moan and tilt his head back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe boy squirms sends ways of pleasure to zach as the teenager begins to slide in further and further into Zach's cock as he involuntarily contracts and releaces his muscles giving his cock the swollowing motion that was taking the boy down. The boy still squirming sank down to his stomach in the cock and eventually sank down into Zach's balls. The curled up form of the boy slightly squirming now and then showed up in Zach's balls, now expanded to hold the form of the boy. Yet another way to consume people and even more pleasurable then the last. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello? Steve are you alright?\" Sayed another teen peeking out of a tent after hearing the short scream. zach immediately hid behind the tree and keeped to the shadows, moving was a bit harder due to the boy in his ball. \"Steve I'm comming out ok. If you need help just scream again.\" As soon as the new boy zipped back up the tent and started walking closer to the tree zach pounced on him planing to devour him the same way he just did his friend a few moments ago, but not after the new boy was able to get out a few screams.</span></div></div>",

The 2 boys with sticks charge at zach but zach is not very afraid. The boys don't look to strong. One is thin and tall while the other has some biceps but dosent looks like he works out to much, both are clothes in pijamas. The 3rd boy however looks around for a weapon but then desideds to just got at zach with his firsts. The 3rd boy seems bigger then the 2 with sticks, not only was he taller then both of them, probably 6'' 7', but nude showing off his muscular body, 8 pack and all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tall teen reaches zach first and swings for his head. Zach ducks and takles the boy biking the wind out of the teen with the sudden first, zach opens his jaws ready to devour the boy but then remembers the other boy and rolls with the teen he tackled in his arms away just in time as the metal stick sticks into the ground where Zach's head was. The boy grunts as he pulls the stick out of the ground angry that he missed the wolf. The wolf tossed the boy he was holding away from the metal sticking order to deal with the other boy. The teen lunges at zach just as zach lunges at the boy. Zach manages to bite the boys wrist causing him to lose his grip on the weapon just as he noticed the 3rd boy taming into the wolf with his sholdure sending zach flying with the tall boys wrist in his mouth. Luckily enough zach lands on the other boy smothering him in Zach's butt. Zach smiles as he knows what to do. Zach begins to eat one boy with his butt and the other he slurps down like spaghetti in his mouth while getting on all fours. The sight was strange as one boy was being pulled into Zach's butt and on other being swollowed alive by his arm into Zach's mouth. The 3rd muscalar teen gives a face of horror and discust as he sees this, his face quickly turns to anger and he screams \"die you freak!\" And charges zach. zach quickly swollows down the teen in his mouth while half a teen still hangs out of his butt. Zach awkwardly charges the muscular teen too making a lunge at him hoping to be stronger then this muscle teen.</span></div></div>",

The teen refused to give up despite having a large muscular werewolf laying on top of him, he tried to push and punch zach while his screams were muffled by Zach's pecs. Zach smiled as he knew he overpowered the muscle teen, while having the teen pined zach decided to take this moment to swollow the rest of the teen in his butt. The feeling zach got from swollowing his prey was amazing, but the pleasure he received from absorbing his prey was indescribable. Zach wants to be alpha and now that he knew this big teen will now be absorbed into him made him feel so dominant that he couldn't help but smile. Zach pushed himself up ready to begin to swollow his new prey but as he got up he saw that the teens head was still stuck inbetween his pecs. Seeing this caused zach to laugh and the muscles flexing in his chest caused the teen to be pulled even further into Zach's chest. The teen was pulled so fat that only his feet were sticking out before zach realized what was happening, this new way to swollow his prey got zach Horney. Zach looked down and howled as he flexed to suck in more of the teen into his pecs. Eventually all of the muscular teen was compleatly sucked into Zach's pecs and zach leaned backed and releced the loudesed Howl he ever did out of pure pleasure. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was incredible to feel so many bodys squirming inside of him. 2 squirmed in his balls, 2 in his stomach that came in 2 diffrent entrances, and one in his chest. Zach felt so dominant and powerful now that he had so many humans squirming inside of him that he would soon absorb, he thought for a moment that maybe he might just keep them inside of him just for the feeling of the teens squirming, but zach couldn't resist the pleasure of absorbing them. Zach layed down for a while and began to absorb the teens in him. Zach felt all the teens squirms eventually stop as the bulges in the various parts of his body shrink then pulsate with musle. Zach began to grow taller and much more muscular. By the time he finished zach was 10\" 6' and bulging with muscle. His balls were the size of water melons, his cock was 7 feet long, and had a 4 foot diameter. Zach went on all 4 fours and howlled after feeling the immense pleasure of absorbing thoes teens.</span></div></div>",

Don't worry I won't tell your father about your secret.' Silvermane says \"At least she can keep secrets but what if Greywolf finds out?\" \"I have an idea, but I'll explain later.

I plan to join the Police Academy when I finish school.\" \"Nice save.\" whispered Silverfang.

I haven't old my parents about what happened in the forest because not only I don't want them to worry about me, because Greywolf told me that that my werewolf identity must remain a secret, even family.
