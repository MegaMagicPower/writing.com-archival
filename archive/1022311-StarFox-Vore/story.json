We'll speed things up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf looked very eager. Wolf had been torn for years between choosing to complete his mission and kill Fox, or abandon his mission, the money, and his hatred for Fox, apologize, and try to make amends. He, much to his pleasure, chose the second option. His life had never been better. He lived with Fox and the two developed a relationship (much to the displeasure of Krystal). Every so often, they'd share a fantasy and travel some place, just the two of them, to live it out. Today, Wolf shared an idea of being captured by Fox and forced to obey his every whim, or he'd be killed. But the thought of what was going to happen next made Wolf too eager and he wanted it to speed up.</span></div></div>",

Still tied up, Wolf could only sit there and return the kiss, smiling once Fox broke free. \"Are we still role-playing?\" Wolf asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox grinned and nodded, pulling his pants down before pulling Wolf's down. \"What are you doing?! Get away from me!\" Wolf cried, trying to wiggle free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox grinned and grabbed Wolf's legs, the lupine weakly kicking. Fox pulled up his blaster and grinned. \"Stop fighting, doggy, or you'll get a blaster bolt to the head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf whimpered and let Fox put his legs around his waist. Fox leaned forward and sniffed Wolf's chest, growling and pushing his hips forward. \"What sounds better to you? Dying like the dog you are, or letting me have my way with you?\" Fox asked, baring his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nO'Donnell gulped and looked up at Wolf. \"If I live...you having your way with me...\" he said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox grinned. \"That's what I thought.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf closed his eyes and let out a low howl, Fox pushing his hips forward and inserting his thick member into Wolf's rear. Fox lost himself in the passion and put Wolf's head to his chest, rubbing over it as his hips rocked back and forth, his hard cock sliding in and out of his lupine love.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf moaned, muffed by being buried in Fox's bare chest, his pants down around his ankles, and his vest being the only clothing on the vulpine. He murred as Fox's paws ran through his head, also forgetting about the RP as Fox 'raped' him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf's tail twitched as the cock slid past its base and into his tight, well-used tailhole. Being submissive was a secret Wolf only shared with Fox, and the vulpine made sure Wolf knew his place under him, and Wolf enjoyed every minute of it. The feeling of McCloud's cock sliding in and out of his plump, furry rump pleasured him greatly, but the thought of being discovered like this made Wolf very nervous. His team didn't even know about this, but he knew StarFox knew. For some reason, he trusted them to keep his secret more than his own teammates.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe canine pair, their eyes closed, slid back and forth along the ground as the continued their act of love-making. Fox's pride pushed deeper into Wolf's tight butt, throbbing as the pleasure built up inside him. \"Oh, Wolf...you're...so....ugh...tight!\" Fox moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf let out a whimper and pretended to howl in pain. \"I'm a virgin! Please..ooh...please....ugh...stop! It....oh yes...I..I mean....it hurts! Oooh...\" Wolf moaned, trying to stay in character, but his pleasure betrayed him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too bad..pup....like it or not...you're my bitch...\" Fox said, biting Wolf's ear as he thrusted harder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf howled and gripped Fox's cock with his innards, feeling a wetness come from the vulpine's cock. \"Here I come, Wolf!\"</span></div></div>",

His eyes were fixated on Fox's jaws, watching them open and close, consuming the lupine like a snake. His belly slipped into Fox's hungry jaws, feeling that rough tongue of his along his back and making its way over to his white middle. Wolf whined and struggled, but Fox kept swallowing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow standing up, Fox held up Wolf and shoved him down his gullet. Those sharp teeth grazed lightly over his chest, feeling his paws and arms becoming wet as he slipped further into McCloud's hungry jaws. \"Please Fox, have mercy!\" Wolf tried one last time to beg.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Fox wasn't listening. Wolf's delicious flavor had put him in a trance, telling him to keep eating. With only Wolf's head and shoulders to go, Fox couldn't stop now. Another large, audible swallow sealed Wolf in more, Wolf cringing from the \"Gloorrp...\" Fox made each time he swallowed the lupine. \"Gulllorp, glooorrp..gulllp...gelllupp...glooohhhrp\" was the only sound Fox made as he continued to devour his meal, Wolf's head sliding into his jaws.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his good eye, Wolf looked around, fighting his urge to murr and enjoy the sight of Fox's mouth all around him. He looked back and watched Fox's jaws shut, and with another loud \"GULLLLLLOOORRRP!\", Wolf was completely inside Fox McCloud, being pushed down his gullet with more \"glorps\" and \"gulps\" as Fox continued to swallow to push him further down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf wiggled in the tight throat of Fox as it pulsated and pushed him down. Finally, he found more room to move and curled up into a ball, realizing that he had just entered Fox's belly. The full vulpine lied back where Wolf once lay, rubbing his round, squirming belly. His stomach made gurgles and sloshing noises as Wolf wiggled inside, trying to get comfy. Fox's tongue licked over his teeth and lips, still tasting O'Donnell on his furry lips, loving the ability to still taste his meal. \"Mmm...you made a great dinner, Wolf...\" Fox said as he patted his stomach, which \"gloorp\"ed and \"slossshh\"ed in return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf had been told not to talk before hand in order to play the part of food, but still squirmed to Fox's wishes. All he had to do now was wait for Fox to get bored of being alone and let him out.</span></div></div>",

Wolf had begun to wonder if Fox was asleep, but the belches and rubs told him Fox was still awake. \"Uh, Fox? Sorry for breaking character, but when are you going to let me out?\" He asked, rubbing back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox chuckled. \"When you're digested, Wolf.\" Fox replied calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf laughed nervously. \"Ehehe, ok Fox...that's a good one. When I'm digested...seriously, when are you vomiting me back up?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox stared at his belly with an annoyed face. \"I just told you, when you've been digested.\" Fox growled, slapping his belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf gulped and looked around. \"Uh...you're still RPing right?\" He asked, getting worried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Did you see me take the pill that would let me vomit you up easily?\" Fox asked, burping again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lupine squirmed and was about to ask if he was just messing with him, but a sound more frightening than anything Leon says caused him to stiffen up. He turned his head and watched through the darkness of a liquid being pumped into Fox's stomach. As soon as it touched him, it burned. \"OW! Fox! Please, why!! Why are you digesting me?!\" Wolf panicked, whimpering and pushing out against his stomach walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You always said you wanted to be digested by me, Wolf...\" Fox simply replied, listening to Wolf's pleas amidst the sounds of his stomach beginning the digestion process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf gasped, then cried as more acids began to rise around him. \"Oh, no! Please Fox...not now! I love you...please, I meant...oh, I don't OW even knOOOWWW what I meant! Get me out, Fox!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox looked down at his belly.</span></div></div>",

But Fox was in a different state of mind. He loved Wolf...he loved Wolf as food...he wanted Wolf to become a part of him. The sounds of his belly gurgling and grumbling as they worked to make Wolf part of him was music to his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox licked over his lips and let out a hearty \"BURRRAAAAAPPP!\" smelling the digesting lupine on his breath. The air had been drawn out of Fox's death chamber and now Wolf was beginning to black out from pain and lack of air. Fox's belly grew silent, save for the \"glooramp, slloosh, slissh...gurrgglllop\" it made as the digestive juices inside his belly broke down Wolf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox spent the next series of hours just listening to his belly, watching it slowly shrink as the acids converted Wolf into nutrients and waste. With a bit of pudge, Fox let out another \"Urrrrrrrppppp\", getting hit with the wonderful smell of digested O'Donnell. His stomach felt odd and with a loud hack, Fox coughed up a large ball of grey and white fur. He knew it couldn't be all of Wolf's fur, but it was still a sizable collection. He grinned and watched the acid and saliva pool at the bottom. Fox reached over and pulled a souvenir from the furball: Wolf's eye patch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few hours, Fox spent hacking up more undigested pieces of Wolf. Part of his skull, a few unidentifiable bones, and a few smaller clumps of fur made up Fox's collection. The rest were now nutrients or waste making its way to his colon. His collection smelled horrible, but to the predatory vulpine, it was heaven. Wolf had left quite a layer of fat, and now Fox was pondering what he should do next.  </span></div></div>",

With each contact his hand made on his stomach, his stomach made a flat \"plop\" response. Fox grew bored of messing around with his belly and slowly rose from the floor pondering over rather or not he should of ate his lover. Gazing down at his bubbling gullet. \"Welp, Wolf, it was nice knowing you. You were a great bitch and you were an even better meal.\" He smirked as he fingered his furry navel. His stomach churned and he released a horrid sounding fart from his rear. Fox waved hot foul air floating behind the back door of his ass away, feeling that it was time to pay his respects to the toilet. \"Pee-yew! I guess it's time to send him off!\" Fox walks off to the apartment's restroom, releasing gas every three steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to Fox, however, his collection of Wolf's remains were slight shifting in the slobber and acid puddle that Fox had regurgitated. Slowly growing and forming into Wolf's original shape and size. Eventually, the remains reformed into Wolf, he was reborn. Wolf stumbled on the floor, panting and sweating. Still light covered in Fox's bile, silently cursing to himself. His lover, the person he trusted most, ate him and killed him for his own selfish desire. Wolf both very angry and somewhat turned on. His member told no lies. But more angry than horny. He wanted revenge for what Fox did to him. He wanted him to suffer like he did. Suddenly his ears twitched as he heard the toilet flush and a sigh of relief coming from the restroom. Fox waked out of the bathroom, still naked from his hefty meal. \"Enjoy the sewers Wol--Oof!\" just as Fox was making his way out of the hallway from the bathroom, he had slammed into the furry, smiley, smelly chest of his victim: Wolf O\" Donnell. \"H-how did you...?\" both naked, Fox stood before the sleek muscular Wolf, ominously glaring down at him with anger in his eyes. \"I don't know, and frankly, I don't care. What you've done to me, I'm going to do to you...Except, I won't be as kind.\" He bared his teeth menacingly and approached Fox slowly. Fox took as many steps back as possible, being both scared for his life and the pain about to befall him and confused at the revival of his once dead lover, he quickly weighing his options...</span></div></div>",

He had a feeling this is what it would be like to be inside of his gut. Fox's eyes darted around looking for something to fight him off with, then they spot his blaster laying on the floor a distance behind Wolf, he knew that if he could reach it he'd be able to easily dispatch Wolf...However, Wolf was between him and his life saver. The only way around the tall gray and white eye patch wearing Wolf was between his legs. Fox was slim enough to quickly squeeze himself through, but it had a very low chance of working because Wolf was just as agile as Fox was.

As soon as Fox made the passage under Wolf he jumped to his feet and grabbed the blaster.He then spun around pointing it at Wolf's chest, holding it in a fashion of success relief. \"Looks like you won't be getting that revenge!\" Fox mocks. Wolf stares at him in a confused stance, and then casually walks towards him. \"Don't you DARE move! Or I'll shoot your balls off!\" but even with that threat Wolf continues towards him, smirking, no less. \"Need a test? Fine.\" Fox aims for Wolf's crotch well ready to blow his jewels away, he pulled the trigger only to stand in pure horror; it was out of ammo. Wolf had approached Fox so much to the point that the blaster he was holding was poking him at the base of his cock. Fox was frozen, and was only able to look up at the laughing Wolf O' Donnell. \"That possibly would of hurt if you shot me with that blaster there...Too bad it's out of ammo.\" Wolf roughly grips both of Fox's arms with his hands and lifts him up eye to eye with himself. \"Now it's your turn to be burned and broken down.\" almost in harmony with Wolf's words his stomach started to churn loudly as Fox's body hovered in front of it teasingly. Fox panicked and tried to shake free but it was like a worm trying to wiggle off of a hook. Pointless. \"No, stop! It was an honest accident...I got caught up in the moment, please don't do it do me!\" Wolf scoffed at his statement. \"My ass. If we had to break up, I didn't want it to be this way, but you did this to yourself.\" Wolf then...  </span></div></div>",

The cliffs all went up into towering heights, before reaching some massive ceiling that was held aloft by their titanic strength. Looking around the only feature not smooth is a nearby mesa with soft looking, white sides, that rose above his head like a monolith.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fox, hear my words,\" came the voice again, and Fox now found the source to be the specter who had just been in his dreams. It looked so much like him, but it was just an outline of blue, with this one having just a hint of red that faded as he watched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dad?\" he asked, not sure if he wasn't seeing ghosts again, as he had just after beating Andross the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, Fox, I am not James, my name is Feral, and though we share blood, ours is separated by two generations,\" said the ghost, and Fox just stared at it, not sure how to respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm your great-grandfather, you nincompoop,\" said the specter again, and Fox nodded, finally understanding the thing's words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. So then great-grandfather Feral, where have you taken me?\" asked Fox, who'd already decided to get information first, then panic afterward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I haven't taken you anywhere Fox, and just call me Feral,\" he said, and Fox nodded again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, so if you haven't taken me anywhere, than where am I?\" asked Fox, sure someone else had transported him somewhere, and Feral had somehow come to his aid.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why, you're still in your room Fox, just a wee bit on the small side,\" said Feral, and once more Fox nodded, as if he'd just been told the time of day, but then, looking around he did a double take on the ghost of his ancestor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm shrunk?!\" he demanded of the ghost, looking in horror at the mesa, which he could now clearly see was his bed, and the bare walls were his bunk walls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't that what I just said? Now open up those ears and listen to me. Someone named Razmak, an ancient sorcerer, is trying to conquer the Lylat system, for I think the third time. Because I stopped him last time he decided to cast a spell to take my descendents out of the picture before they could interfere, but thanks to a little ghostly power I kept him from outright killing you,\" he tells Fox, who stares at the spirit incredulously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And this is better?!\"  He asks rather harshly, and the spirit floats before him, a thoughtful expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I admit this is an unexpected complication, but still, you're alive, and now all you have to do is stop Razmak from killing everyone. To do that I suggest you get that little blue chick to help you get big again, and then go after him with one of those fighters of your's He's hiding out on that planet where you beat the monkey man a few years back,\" said the spirit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't you go get Krystal's attention?\" asked Fox, realizing his small size was not something to play around with, as one of his teammates could easily see him and crush him like a bug, or worse eat him like one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but you're on your own for that one. I can only appear to those who carry my blood, and you're the only one left. So go find some way to get the blue woman to make you big again, and then save us all my son,\" said the spirit with a note of finality before disappearing completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh for the love of... And I just saved the universe. What's a guy got to do to get a week off around this Solar System?\" complained Fox even as he walked to his door. Luckily it wasn't an automatic and he was able to crawl under it with ease. Unluckily he was faced with a choice right from the get go. One hallway led to the bridge, and the other to the kitchen. Either one was likely to be the death of him, but since he could only pick one he chose...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Looking at the walls of the ship he now had to agree with Krystal that the GreatFox could use a new coat of paint, as he could now see the cracks and dents which were nearly invisible to him when he was normal size. He also made a mental note to tell Slippy to get Rod to sweep and mop, as the floors were filthy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one side of the hall was a pile of crumbs, probably from Krystal's midnight snacks, which she had every night at nine, twelve, two, and four. Oddly the girl was still keeping that figure she'd developed from adventuring across the stars looking for her parents. Then again, Fox muses, she shared enough of it with him that it was a wonder he hadn't gotten a bit of gut from the overeating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soon I'll be a Great Fox if I don't quit doing that,\" he commented to himself, striking his slightly rounder gut. He'd have to remember to do more training when he got big again, as he was already winded and he wasn't even halfway to the kitchen yet. Luckily it really wasn't all that far to the GreatFox's on board kitchen from his room, that being one of the reasons he'd picked that particular cabin his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPanting and slightly out of breath, Fox rounded that last corner to the kitchen hallway. From somewhere deep within himself came a rumbling sound that reminded him he'd chosen this course both for the likelihood of finding someone, and for the certainty of being able to find something to snack on at the very least. Looking over at the door he saw his luck was improving, as the light in the kitchen was on, meaning someone was in it. Filling with a sense of hope he ran towards the light, and at last looked into the kitchen to find the massive form of...</span></div></div>",

She was beautiful as always, and from his angle Fox happened to be looking right up her skirt as she was leaned over, rummaging through the drawers at the bottom of the fridge for something. He couldn't tell what it was, but it didn't matter. Seeing as how she was in the room, food was going to take second base to getting attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course getting attention wasn't going to be that easy. He was mouse sized compared to the blue vixen, which meant he would have to do something loud or bright to get her to notice him. Feeling his belt he wished not for the first time that he'd taken Falco's suggestion and started sleeping with his gun holstered. If he had that he could just fire off a shot and she'd be bond to see it, and then trace it back to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot having the blaster, or anyway to make a bright, attention grabbing flash, Fox was left with two choices. The first was to just run up to Krystal and start yelling. Though he wasn't sure she'd hear him from way up where her head was. The second option, while far harder, was much more likely to get him noticed, and that was to climb the nearby counter. Of course it would take time to do that, and Krystal could well leave before he got to the top. Which course does he take?</span></div></div>",

Of course, as he'd expected Krystal remained in her position, leaning in the fridge and searching for something. Closer to her now Fox could see she was searching in the meat drawer for something, probably not remembering that she'd shared the last of that with him just hours ago before he'd gone to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL, I CAN'T MAKE ONE WITHOUT SOMETHING,\" she said, her voice so loud it hurt Fox's ears, forcing him to cover them in pain. Rising Krystal turned back to the counter, staring at something on it with a look of concern on her face while shaking her head. Fox, his ears still ringing, wonder what she was making, but decided it was unimportant. He had to get her attention, and fast, before she decided to leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo choices was becoming a regular number for him, as he was again struck with an idea. He could just stay where he was screaming and hope that Krystal looked down. That was seeming to be a smaller and smaller possibility.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Not really considering all the implications of his next action Fox ran over to the open fridge door and grabbed the string hanging from the top. Quickly he tied one end around his waist and began to repel up the side of the open drawer which Krystal would hopefully look into to find him sitting there. Luckily for him the drawer was only about five times his current height, and he was able to scale it in only a few leaps, letting go of the rope during his arc so that he would fall right into it, and landing at the bottom with a dull thunk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Krystal!\" he shouted again, already feeling the bitting cold of the fridge. Unfortunately Krystal was staring at the counter top, not really paying any attention to the drawer anymore. It suddenly occurred to Fox then that she might not look inside closely enough to see him before she closed the fridge, sealing him inside it. If he didn't suffocate from a lack of air, then he would freeze to death long before anyone else would look inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kr-kr-krystal!!\" he cried out, a small stutter entering his speech already. Looking up he prayed for the goddess to notice him before shutting the door. As he watched her head swung back and forth again as she starred at whatever was on the counter, before turning one last time to the fridge, probably intending on closing it and going back to bed, but just before she did a flash caught her eye, and she looked straight down at the tiny Fox at the bottom of the drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hello there little one. I didn't notice you,\" she said, her voice sounding farther away to Fox within the closed confines of the drawer. It wasn't really that much quieter compared to her previous, but the echo effect of the box made it softer on his ears. Smiling at his turn of luck he ran towards Krystal's descending hand, letting her fingers pinch him at his waist. Their heat filtered into his body quickly, alleviating part of his chill as he stared up in gratitude at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WELL, WELL, A BIT COLD ARE WE. DON'T WORRY, YOU'LL BE NICE AND WARM INSIDE MY BELLY,\" she told him in that booming voice as she held him in front of her mouth, and for a few moments Fox just nodded at her words, not really hearing that last part. Then all at once his mind latched onto it, and he took a deep breath to shout at Krystal about her mistake, but before he could do so she had placed him on the counter, atop a soft white table, that he instantly identified as a slice of bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still ready to shout at her, when suddenly a stream of semi-liquid goo was squirted onto him, causing him to hack and cough. Licking a bit off his covered arms he was quick to ID the goo as ketchup, and even quicker to ID the green carpet falling atop him as lettuce. Still coughing up ketchup Fox was then subjected to having the wind knocked from him as Krystal dropped the second slice of bread atop him, completing her snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh boy,\" he said wheezingly, not remembering any swear words that were harsh enough to cover this particular situation. Looking out he realized his head was just outside the sandwich, and he spun around so that he was on his back, and looking straight up at Krystal, who, instead of looking at him as he would have expected, was playing with something that looked like a lance or long sword, but he knew was probably just a butter knife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I WONDER IF FOX WOULD LIKE A SNACK?\" she mused to herself, and Fox wished he could laugh. Krystal was deciding if she wanted to cut her sandwich in half, and him too, so she could offer half of it to him. Of course he also realized that she might have included other small animals in previous snacks, which explained why they were so crunchy. He wished he had the saliva to start spiting out the remembered taste of those snacks now, as he hated the idea of biting something's head off. Above him Krystal was still spinning the knife in one hand, and then slowly brought it down to...</span></div></div>",

She peeled the top slice off of him and helped him stand up, placing him on the counter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Yes, it is. I was hoping you could help me. I actually thought you were going to eat me there for a second.\" Fox laughed silently at his comment, strutting to get his blood moving around the placid counter-top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Actually, I was hoping to keep this a secret,\" sighed Krystal, placing her hand over her mouth as she spoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"What,\" asked Fox, slightly perplexed. <br>\r\n    \"I have an obsession.... with eating living things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Fox froze at her statement, unsure of what to say.<br>\r\n    \"Well, we all have quirks,\" he tried to sooth her, seeing she was clearly uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"It was actually a part of our culture back on Cerinia, every once in a while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Fox gagged at the fact, swallowing hard, looking around the metal clad kitchen. He caught a smirk on Krystal's face, and her tail swinging playfully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"That's all behind us now,\" he breathed weakly. \"Now if you don't mind, could you help me return to my normal size?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Krystal looked at him hungrily.<br>\r\n    \"Maybe get out of this kitchen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    There was a long silence, Krystal watched him, eyes unwavering. Her tongue ran over her teeth in her mouth, saliva dripping, filling like a pool along her gums.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I can't do that, Fox,\" she said sternly, still watching him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Why not?\" Fox felt fear rising in his chest, and he drooped his tail, tensing his body, ready to bolt if he had to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I have actually dreamed of eating you,\" she squeaked, cringing as she said it, clearly embarrassed, looking away for only a short second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Fox froze, unsure of what to say. He fidgeted, stepping back from her monstrous figure. As he did he couldn't help sneaking a peak at her massive chest, chuckling coyly. His mind then echoed what she had said, and he again became cautious, unnerved with a surprised awe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"That's fine, Krystal, I don't really care. But could you help me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Krystal again said nothing. \"Can you at least take me back to my room,\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Quick as the wind a furry blue hand struck from  Krystal's hip, rocketing toward Fox and embracing him in a tight grip between five pulsing fingers! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Krystal what are you doing!\" Fox screamed as the arm attached to the figures brought Fox's squirming body toward Krystal's, the vixen smiling down at him as saliva poured over her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I have dreamed of eating you, Fox, and now that dream will become a reality,\" she grinned, and laughed as Fox struggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Krystal, you can't do this to me! I saved you! I brought you here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Krystal remained silent, mulling over her fantasies in the enigma of her mind! Her hand began moving up her body, slowly, toward her mouth! As Fox passed her stomach he could hear it growl under the fabric of her clothes! Krystal moaned, and rubbed her belly with her free hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"I'm so hungry, Fox, I hope you can fill me up!\" She laughed, still rubbing her stomach, and licked her lips. \"I'll bet you'll taste delicious, too. All those battles must have worked some taste into you!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Fox watched, horrified, as he was hoisted up, quickly passing Krystal's chest, neck, and face. He stared pleadingly into her turquoise-green eyes, and said one last time:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Krystal, please, don't eat me! I'll do anything! Please!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n    Krystal ignored him, bringing him higher into the air! She tilted her head back, twirling her locks, and opened her mouth, sloshing her tongue in the saliva and swallowing a bit of it. Dangling Fox over her maw, she stopped, allowing him to get a good look at his impending doom. She still felt him struggling, and almost instantly thought that maybe she should do something else first. Weighing her choices, she held Fox there as he screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Krystal, don't eat me! Please don't eat me!\" repeated Fox over and over again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    \"Fox,\" she started, her voice blasting out from her mouth louder than ever to Fox's anxious, honed ears!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    She opened her mouth again...</span></div></div>",

Krystal opened the cupboard above her head took out a glass, walked over to the sink, and took a drink of water. Fox was swept away by the current of water and was finally swallowed. \"Finally.\" Krystal thought. Fox landed in Krystal's stomach, it was compleatly dark, he then remembered he had a personal flashlight with him. Now being able to see, Fox observed his new surrondings. When he was about half-way done doing a 360. He thought he saw something that was... alive. He rushed over to it. What Fox saw was indeed a living creature, one he had never seen before. \"Hey who are you?\" Fox asked the creature. \"I'm Redge.\" Redge anwsered suprised to see another being in here with him. \"So that crazy vixen got another one?\" Redge said a hint of pain in his voice. \"That vixen's name is Krystal. And how long have you been in here Redge?\" Fox asked. \"I've been sitting in this pit of death for two hours. Just waiting to die.\" Redge responded. \"Where did you come from?\" Fox interrogated. \"We have a colony on your ship.

He took a glance over to the driver, who kept staring at Falco as if he recongized the bird, but couldn't figure out from where.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bored avian returned his gaze to outside the window, tapping out a tune on his leg. The driver finally spoke up and smiled as he talked. \"Hey, you're Falco Lombardi, ain't ya?\" He said, glancing back but keeping his eyes on the hovercar track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalco sighed again and nodded. \"Yes. I am.\" He said softly, beginning to lose hope that he wouldn't be mobbed by a large group of fans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver chuckled and Falco raised an eyebrow as the driver turned off the fare meter. \"Lylation heroes shouldn't have to pay me.

You gave me back my money.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe driver grinned and took the exit off the hovertrail that led to the main parking lot of the zoo. Two roads appeared and the driver took the left and before long, the car slowly landed on the ground in the parking lot. Falco said his thanks and climbed out of the car. As he walked to the ticket booth, the feline inside recognized him immediately and waved him through without charging him, slipping a V.I.P. wristband through the ticket window for Falco to take. The avian sighed and slipped it on, then stopped in front of the map. The zoo was divived into differnt sections for each animal type on two sides of the park. Each section was accessible by a V shaped fork path. On the left path were areas such as the reptile display, avian display, aquarium, and oddities. On the right path were displays for mammals, dinosaurs, and the bathrooms.

It would make for some great drama and legitimize her as a member of the team, rather than just some follower who needed to be saved. Of course, now she was using that power as the team's destruction rather than its saving grace. \"It's amazing what a base drive such as hunger will do to a person's motives,\" she thought, \"I guess our will isn't as free as we'd like to think it is.\"<br>\r\nWhen the entire ship was inside her head, she grimaced and subtly knocked out all communication signals, disabling ROB 64 as well.<br>\r\nWith that done, she went out to investigate Fox's scent, which was much closer now.

Fox was still trying to get his muzzle out of her cheek with all his might as he began letting out muffled yells that he just couldn't project because her teeth kept his jaw closed. It made sense, of course. She doubted anyone really WANTED to be eaten alive, and mouths are pretty disgusting things to look at, let alone be in. She decided to have some sympathy for the struggling friend. \"Look, I can project nice images into your mind while I do this, if you want me to. It'll take away the shock a bit,\" she thought to him.<br>\r\nHearing this, he calmed down a little bit, but only because he realized she wasn't entirely evil and meant to make this as comfortable as possible for him, considering what she was doing. He thought, knowing that she would be able to read it, \"No, that's okay. If I have to go, I'd rather you do it and leave my mind out of it. I still like you and would rather you don't do this, but you seem to have some reason other than sheer madness. I just wish I knew what that reason was.\"<br>\r\nShe opened wider and began stuffing the rest of his head into her cheek, licking the outside of his cheek consolingly, as if she were licking his wounds. \"I have to. My power requires I eat someone around my body size every once in a while, or I'll die of energy loss. I've been eating a fallen foe here and there when we were on our adventures, but this peaceful universe doesn't allow that anymore, and I've been holding out so long that if I wait an hour longer I'll die. I figured you'd be the most understanding person on this crew,\" she told him and opened a little wider, stuffing his neck and shoulders in her cheek in the process, causing a comical, cartoonish bulge. What she said was pretty much true, but she was sure she could have avoided it if she really wanted to. Thing is...she didn't want to. Fox tasted just as good as she thought he would. She lifted him off the ground and shoved him into her cheek just beneath his shoulder blades, effectively pinning his arms between the strong muscles in her mouth. Anyone looking at this would laugh first before being horrified at what was going on. She pulled some more in, engulfing him up to the end of his ribcage, cheek sticking farther out and then with the obvious outline of Fox McCloud's head. He struggled a little more, but not much.</span></div></div>",

Luckily, no one was around, so she grabbed Fox by the belt and hoisted him up to his pantline in her mouth, her cheek well beyond what a cheek of that size would normally be able to contain. She bit into him a little bit on accident, making him wince in pain, then retracted quickly and apologized. She'd have to concentrate on not trying to chew him up. It just wouldn't be nice to he who saved her life earlier and it wouldn't be as pleasurable for her when she finally swallowed him. Her hand moved behind his knees and lifted them up into her other cheek. She shoved his legs in up to his boots, which remained outside her lipline.<br>\r\nHis tail wagged back and forth, but mostly in annoyance rather than happiness. He wanted her to get it over with, and she was just taking too long. It kinda' made him mad that she was taking so much pleasure in it, but he couldn't begrudge her that. After all, he'd looked at her in ways he probably shouldn't have and gotten caught a few times. It was about time she enjoyed something at his expense...although this seemed too much. Getting eaten alive didn't seem a just payback. \"Oh well...\" he thought. Not much he could do now.<br>\r\nThe vixen shoved Fox's boots into her cheek along with his legs, leaving his rump and his tail outside her mouth. Having an entire creature her size in just her cheeks put considerable strain on her neck, so she sucked in his rear-end, leaving only a flicking tail. She licked around and smiled a bit before she gave a gigantic gulp, forcing that bulge in her cheeks to transfer to her neck and onward down her esophagus, dragging the tail through her lips after it. The tail disappeared with a satisfying slurp and a small amount of saliva left her mouth. The bulge went down her ribcage and then rested itself safely in her midsection with a plop and a gurgle. She let out a little sigh and licked her lips, eyes closed, and rubbing her now-extended stomach. \"Well, it was nice knowing you,\" she thought to herself, making sure she guarded her thoughts from Fox. With that, she put a glamer upon herself to make it look like she had her normal body composition.<br>\r\nFox moved around in her gut, but couldn't make himself comfortable. He just sighed and let the walls carress him firmly, albeit with a large amount of moist slime. He just couldn't keep himself mad at Krystal, no matter how hard he tried. Yes, she just ate him, but she was so pretty. That's got to count for something. \"They say looks don't matter, but they're liars,\" he thought, and closed his eyes. A grin was on his face.</span></div></div>",

What's wrong?\" She asked, rubbing her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing...I just had a dream...where I ate you...and it was a bet!\" He said, shuddering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal gasped, wide awake now. \"Really? Wow! I had a dream just like that, only I ate you and it was a bet with the rest of the team and StarWolf!\" She said, giggling, the two having the same, but opposite dream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To be honest, I wouldn't mind going inside you.\" Fox said softly, Krystal returning his statement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox sighed, both wanting to be eaten. It was quite a situation, but what could they do?</span></div></div>",

I, myself, have always wanted to be eaten by O'Donnell...he looks like he'd have a nice stomach to curl up in. Plus he's so big and dominate...even though he's just a year older than me. Heh, I'd be willing to do anything with him if he made me feel small compared to him.\" Fox suggested with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal giggled and swatted Fox playfuly with her paw. \"It's a nice suggestion, and I bet Panther would really want to do that with me.\" She said, smiling at Fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox smiled back and rubbed the back of his head. \"What if they wanna yiff us before they dine on us?\" Fox asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal thought and then shrugged. \"If you're ok with Panther taking me, I'm ok with Wolf taking you.\" Krystal grinned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox nodded, ok with that. He thought again, thinking about how they were going to get to Wolf and Panther. \"You know, even though we're friends with them again, it might be hard for us to get up close to them. We could probably stay here until we're certain we can get to them.

Her lips opened up wider and darkness filled his vision as his head slipped into her mouth. Her rough tongue slurped at his face, causing him to close his eyes. Krystal's voice appeared in his mind as she tasted him. \"You taste quite delicious, Fox...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox whimpered and felt her lips press down over his neck, himself stopping here, unable to go further. He hoped Krystal wouldn't be able to do the same, not being able to help but murr as her paw undid his belt and slid under his top, the fingers gliding through his fur. He gasped as he felt his shoulders getting wet and her lips sliding over them. She wasn't joking around. \"Krystal! No! Please! I said I was sorry, please don't eat me!\" Fox cried out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal only laughed, finding the fact that she was devouring the great Fox McCloud quite ironic...yet arousing. She slurped over his clothes, surprised that they tasted the same as Fox. She figured he never wore anything else, so his scent and flavor saturated his clothes. She was now at his chest, pressing his arms to his side, moaning in pleasure as his delicious flavor danced over her tongue. She took a gulp and Fox's head went further down her throat, expanding it more.

She titled her head back and gulped, pulling Fox's rear into her mouth, his head sliding into her stomach. She took voracious gulps, Fox's legs disappearing inside her, McCloud turning into a large bulge in Krystal's stomach. As she closed her mouth around his feet, she trapped his tailtip outside her lips. With a final gulp, she slurped up the tail like a noodle. Her paws rubbed her throat and stomach, feeling the delicious Fox McCloud slide down her body and settle in her stomach. She licked her lips, still tasting him. \"Mmmm...Fox, you were SO delicious!\" She exclaimed, rubbing her stomach and feeling Fox's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox rubbed the stomach walls and squirmed to get into a comfortable position, Krystal murring in pleasure.

Man, she's such a predator! But this felt...rather good...actually...much better than what I tried...maybe I am a prey after all! Fox thought as he tried to steady himself in her stomach. \"Krystal, what's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blue vixen giggled as the movement caused her to burp. \"I'm just gonna go to the kitchen and let you out there.

His desire to eat Krystal had faded and now he felt like having a sandwich. \"A sandwich should do it, Krystal.\" He said, hoping she didn't take the path to the kitchen that led into the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause it was a faster root, she did and nodded as Fox told her what she wanted. As soon as she set foot in the bridge, she stopped. Inside was the entire StarFox team, along with Panther and Wolf. They all looked at her and smirked, Falco being the first to speak. \"Heh, I knew McCloud didn't have it in him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal tilted her head curiously, seeing some money in the team's paws. Slippy rubbed the back of his head. \"So, Krystal ate Fox...does that mean we get to keep our money?\" He asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalco slapped him on the back of the head. \"Of course, you idiot! We all bet that Fox couldn't do it! And he didn't, so we get to keep our money and Fox gives his to us...that is if he gets out of there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vixen laughed and licked her lips, a little urp escaping her mouth. \"Hehe, I'm letting him out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf walked up and poked her gut. \"Heh, deal's off Fox. Tricky's staying alive. Heh, in fact...I kinda wanna eat you too!\" He said, rubbing Krystal's gut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFalco, Slippy, and Panther agreed as Wolf chuckled. Krystal giggled and headed for the kitchen. \"I'll make arrangements for you boys! You'll all get your turn to eat Fox!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox groaned as he'd just been turned into the team's snack. Then, everything went silent and the belly rumbled again. Then, something pushed in on the stomach and up he went. Light entered the darkness and the kitchen soon followed. He rolled out onto the floor, drenched in drool. \"Thanks Krystal.\" He said as he shook the drool off him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKrystal smiled and turned to the fridge. \"So what do you want on your sandwich?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Note: I had permission to use that ending from the other story)</span></div></div>",

His maw engulfed her head. \"Fox you couldn't do this before, what makes you think you can do it now?\" She projected into his mind. \"I only pretended to not be able to swallow you before so that your magic would be weakened enough to not be able to do anything this time.\" Fox thought since he couldn't talk with Krystal in his mouth. And he was right Krystal knew her powers couldn't prevent him from eating her. Fox gave another powerful gulp pulling Krystal to her shoulder blades. The point of no return, this is where Fox had \"failed\" before but he had an ace up his sleve, he had a sample of Krystal's magic inside him. Krystal was afraid of this because she knew whenever she used magic on another person or object that entity had temporary magical powers based on how much power was used. And Krystal had used a fair amount of it when she was savoring Fox's flavor a few minuts ago. Fox swallowed again he was up to her breasts Krystal knew her fate was sealed as she felt the warmth of Fox's mouth on her stomach area. Her tail was flickering wildly in fear , Fox was sightly amused by this as he gave another powerful swallow having only Krystal's legs to deal with now. He swallowed them down rather quickly soon all of Krystal was in Fox' stomach. \"Don't wory Krystal your safe I'm not going to kill you, I could never kill the one I love. Plus you didn't digest me so I'm going to return the favor y doing the same for you. But for now I have something to take care of.\" Krystal wondered what that \"Something\" was. It took some doing but she found his motive. Fox stepped onto the bridge. \"Alright you guys give me my money back.\" Fox said as the crew saw his expanded stomach. Starwolf had already left the ship. \"Ugh, alright Fox we'll give you your money back.\" Falco said in disapointment. Everythng worked out Fox got (most of) his money back and he had the love of his life in his stomach.

If it did, he'd be able to see who he could feel in the room with him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne minute, he was walking down a lonely street in Corneria City, next minute, he was hit on the head from the shadows of a alley he passed. Now, Wolf found himself chained up to a system of pulleys, probably used to put him in certain positions for a certain torture. Whoever did this to him, he thought, was going to die a very painful death.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce his captor saw he was awake, he stepped out into the light with a chuckle. \"Well, well, well...look what you've gotten yourself into now, O'Donnell...\" A voice said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf knew the voice, but didn't believe it came from that person. He opened his eyes to confirm that it was Fox McCloud, the leader of the StarFox team talking to him. \"You...why did you knock me out and tie me up?! I thought I made myself clear when I saved your furry ass...\" Wolf said, snarling at Fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMcCloud folded his arms. \"Oh, you did Wolf. This isn't a torture session or anything...well, for you it might be. But, you could also enjoy it.\" Fox said, slowly stepping forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWolf blinked and watched the vulpine. \"What are you going to do?\"</span></div></div>",

The sight of the slutty Fox caused his cock to become erect. Fox spotted the erect member and slowly sat down, squeezing his rump around the meat as it slowly slipped into him. Both canids moaned and shivered as Fox positioned himself on Wolf's cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce he was sitting on Wolf's crotch, he began sitting up and sitting back down, causing the pair to moan in delight. Wolf closed his eye and bit his lips, thrusting his hips a little as McCloud rode him. Fox's eyes also closed and his paws rubbed over Wolf's belly as he worked himself out on Wolf's cock. The pre soon lubricated his tight hole and one of Fox's paws got curious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox reached a finger behind himself and tickled at Wolf's tailhole. Once seeing a pleasured response from Wolf, Fox slid his finger into the tight pucker and tickled around inside. Wolf moaned and thrusted his hips harder, howling quietly as his cock and tailhole recieved pleasure from Fox McCloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox moaned and panted and Wolf felt his cock tingle in pleasure as his climax approached. With a loud howl, Wolf spurted his load into Fox's ass, causing the vulpine to whine in happiness as he took in Wolf's seed. He slumped forward and hugged Wolf, panting once the seed had been pumped into him. He inhaled Wolf's scent deeply and moaned softly, a little drool dripping from his lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe licked his lips and sniffed again, his tongue curiously tasting Wolf. Again, he moaned and thought about what was planned next. As if on queue, Wolf asked what Fox was planning next.</span></div></div>",

His tail tip and feet were already inside and were being licked over by the hungry fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox moaned in delight as he licked over Wolf's feet, enjoying the taste they carried. He sighed as the chains did all the work, allowing him to sit back and enjoy Wolf O'Donnell's delicious flavor. Fox, and Wolf, watched as the grey furred ankles disappeared past his lips, followed by the rest of the legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox moaned happily, swallowing himself just to see what it would feel like. The chains kept lowering the doomed wolf into McCloud, who was rubbing over the bulges wolf was creating. Wolf watched and whimpered, begging Fox to let him go. Fox loved the irony of Wolf begging him for mercy. The lupine always wanted Fox to do that. Now, Wolf was just a tasty meal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready up to his stomach, Fox closed his eyes and savored Wolf's delectable body as the chains pushed him further down his gullet. He opened his eyes again and slurped over the last of his chest. Finally, Wolf's arms and head were lowered in. Wolf tilted his head up inside Fox's mouth, his eyes closing each time the tongue slurped at his face, and watched Fox reach up and untie his arms from the chains. As he entered the gullet, he saw the jaws close past his hands, sealing him inside Fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vulpine closed his eyes and took one final gulp, sending Wolf into his waiting belly. He sighed and let out a large belch as he sat back against the wall, rubbing his round and squirming belly. \"Mmmm, you were so delicious, Wolf. And you satisfied my hunger.\" Fox laughed, licking over his white furred lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside, Wolf squirmed and whimpered, fearing what was to come next.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Bill skillfully landed his Cornerian Fighter inside the Great Fox. He opened the door and hopped out of his ship and sighed, it had been awhile since he had a day off from work, and he was looking forward to wasting the day away with his good friends on the Star Fox team. Bill waited a few moments to see if anyone would come outside to greet him as usual, but this time around, no one came. \"That's strange, no one's come here to say anything, although I'm sure that they usually let me in by now,\" Bill thought as he decided to let himself inside the interior halls of the Great Fox. Bill glanced around and noticed that it was awfully dark inside as well. Bill soldiered on despite his instincts telling him to hop back in his Cornerian Fighter and jet, something compelled him to venture forth. Bill stepped into the kitchen, and there he saw something that he would have never expected to see, Fox lying on the floor covered in a red liquid that strongly resembled blood. \"FOX!\" Bill yelled out in horror. He ran to Fox and knelt down before him when he suddenly noticed that Fox was actually smiling at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's up Bill?\" Fox said with a huge grin plastered on his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nothing much outside of the fact that you guys scarred me half to death with your whole 'we died' routine! That's not funny! Geez! See if I help you next time!\" Bill yelled half-heartedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Bill, that's what you always say, and yet you always come back. Always. That's what I like about you.\" Fox laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, one of these days I won't come back, just you wait.\" Bill said.\"Where are the others anyways? Don't tell me they hid in other rooms too...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no,\" Fox started, \"they are all out with their boyfriends and girlfriends...\" Fox's voice trailed off and a certain sadness suddenly overcame him. \"Bill...\" Fox sighed again. \"What does Krystal see in Panther? What does he have that I don't?\" Bill thought about this for a second, and he honestly wasn't sure. Both  were talented fighters, both were both reasonable attractive, and neither were much richer than the other, personality wise though, Bill would have believed that Fox's personality would have been more attractive than Panther's... Honestly Bill wasn't sure outside of Panther's badboy imagine. \"Perhaps she likes the wild types?\" Bill finally settled on this as an acceptable answer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wild... Types...\" Fox stated this with a curious tone. \"So you're saying that if I was more... Risky that she might like me again?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's not quite what I had in mind...\" Bill's voice trailed off. Fox started to move around ferociously in the kitchen walking back and forth, he then shouted suddenly and ran up to his room. Bill stood in the kitchen wondering if what he said was the right thing, when suddenly Fox returned into the room. He suddenly motioned for Bill to come forward. Bill obliged to Fox's request. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Bill, we're friends right?\" Fox asked with an earnestly curious expression on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, we are,\" Bill responded with a flat \"duh\" tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And friends help friends right?\" Fox asked. Bill suddenly didn't like where this conversation was headed, but he simply nodded his head in response to Fox's question. \"Then I want you to do me a favor Bill... It's something I want you to do... And only you...\" At this point, Bill REALLY had a bad feeling about what Fox was going to ask of Bill, but Fox's begging tone piqued his interest. He would never admit it openly, but he always did want to have Fox in a position to take advantage of him. Both mentally and physically, so when Fox asked for Bill to devour him... Bill was naturally, totally unprepared for the question. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait. WHAT!? You want me to what!?\" Bill screamed. \"I can't do that to my friend!!!\" That's crazy. That's... Disgusting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Bill, it's the only way. You stated that Krystal likes wild types, so I'm going to prove to her that I can be just as crazy as Panther-- crazier even!\" Fox had a slightly deranged look in his eyes. Bill looked at Fox in sheer dismay, \"Sure, I'm willing to help you, but eat you? That would kill you, I can't just cook you like some sort of seasoned ham or something.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You won't kill me with this,\" Fox suddenly reveal his secret weapon. A potion. \"With this, you should be able to just swallow me up whole, and then later you'll spit me up. No problem. That's all you have to do, eat me.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... If that's it, I guess there can't be any harm done, but I gotta tell you, this is one crazy plan.\" Bill said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great. Crazy is the way I want it to be.\" Fox responded and handed Bill the potion. \"Drink up buddy!\" Bill took the potion and drank it. Suddenly he started to feel strange. His head began to ache as well as his jaw, and he was overcome with intense pain all over, it was as if all of his muscles had contracted in his body simultaneously making it all the more painful. Then suddenly, the pain stopped, and he began to relax. As a matter of fact, he had never felt so relaxed before in his entire life... Except there was one spot on him that was not relaxed, and it was hanging right below his belt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bill, you okay?\" Fox asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm okay.\" Bill responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, because at first I thought that potion had killed you.\" Fox seemed genuinely relieved. \"How do you feel?\" It was this question that sent Bill over-the-top.  \"Horny\" Bill responded as he lunged towards Fox.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? That's not what the po--\" Fox's sentence was cut off by Bill wrapping his arms around the vulpine and pressing his lips up against Fox's. Bill also injected his tongue inside of Fox's mouth and started to expertly force his tongue to dominate over Fox's. Fox attempted to push away, but was not very successful. After a short battle in their mouths, Fox finally managed to push his mouth away from Bill's, even if he couldn't escape Bill's grasp, he did manage to sneak out a \"Hey! You're just supposed to eat me, not rape me! I'm not like that!\" But Bill was too lost in the moment to care what Fox was saying and responded with a quick \"Well I do,\" while he began to strip himself down while holding Fox down with one paw around his neck. Fox attempted to resist Bill, but Bill's natural strength combined with the potion's effect wouldn't let Fox get Bill off of him. After Bill finally finished removing his pants, he removed Fox's clothing as well, all the while Fox kept screaming \"Stop Bill! This isn't part of the plan! This isn't what's supposed to happen!!!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that they were unclothed, Bill really wanted to satisfy his member, and he had two choices that came into his mind. Taking it to Fox's rear, or his mouth. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He'd been sent here by General Pepper to aid the team in their upcoming mission. He sighed and walked up the ramp into the hanger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCaptain FT was a large, anthro dark green dragon with light green belly scales, golden horns, and blond hair. In his large claws, he clutched suitcases, one filled with clothes, another filled with weapons and ammunition. As he stepped into the hanger, he saw the team waiting for him, Fox standing out in front. He dropped one of the suitcases and extended a claw, Fox taking it and shaking it. \"Captain Oikonny, I presume!\" McCloud said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT nodded. \"Captain Fatal T. Oikonny. Cornerian First Army, aka the Big Red One (WWII reference &gt;.&gt;).\" FT replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had been called \"Fatal Tragedy\" because his mother died in childbirth because of him. There was a small chance he was going to survive birth, and even a smaller chance of his mother living. Luckily, he survived. When he was 17, he saw one of his father's plans put into work, and didn't want anything to do with it, so he deflected and joined the Cornerian Army. Now, at age 28, he was sent to the StarFox team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe introductions were made with Fox, Falco, Peppy, Slippy, and Krystal and now he was exploring the ship. He was assigned a bedroom (right next to Fox, which he believed could be a convience since he was furry-bi and had a little crush on Fox) and was shown to the bathrooms, as well as important rooms such as the bridge, kitchen, firing range, dojo, and rec rooms. He challenged Fox and Falco to a firing contest, where he came first, Fox came second, and Falco came a close thrid, only missing two shots. \"Damn, you're good!\" Falco said, patting FT, who hit each shot dead center with his golden Desert Eagle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat impressed Fox was that FT was using the sniper target and himself had to squint in order to see it. The dragon had undergone an expirement that changed him into what he is today. He was once a monkey like Andross, but volunteered to be one of his bio weapons. His senses were highly increased, as was his strength and speed. This was shown to Fox when they sparred in the dojo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, FT was in the showers, washing up after a long day of proving himself to the team. As he showered, he thought of Fox. If the dragon hadn't deflected, he would have been sent to kill Fox, and now here he was, on his team, and sleeping in the next room. He chuckled and stopped showering as he heard a creak. The door opened and closed, followed by footsteps. \"Who's there?\" FT asked, sniffing the air. </span></div></div>",

Fox stepped forward and rubbed his head. \"You uh...really kicked my ass in the dojo and the firing range...\" He said, chuckling softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT chuckled and folded his arms. \"That's because of what my father did to me. You could have beaten me if my strength and skills hadn't been enhanced.\" The dragon said, tail scraping across the floor, the tip of it light green like his belly scales.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox nodded and he reached up, removing his white vest. \"I know...but I have a little rule around here...if you beat me...you either pay for what you did, or show your superiorty over me in different ways. So far, all of the new recruits we had haven't been able to show that superiorty and they were gone.\" Fox exlpained, removing his green shirt and exposing his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT purred and was unaware of the erection in front of him as Fox stripped. The vulpine removed his belt and his pants fell to the ground, exposing his own erection. He walked up and hugged the blushing dragon, rubbing over his back. \"I always liked dragons....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT couldn't believe it! Fox McCloud, the hero of the Lylat System and the vulpine he had a secret crush on was hitting on him! He grinned, being two years older than the Fox and towered over him. He knew he was the superior one on this ship. Fox sighed as he showered with the dragon. \"I really like dragons...\" He said, smiling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT smiled back. Fox never stated what he liked about dragons, just that he liked them. As if reading his mind, Fox answered that question in FT's head. \"I like to......\"</span></div></div>",

His tongue snaked out and slurped along it as he bobbed his head, sucking on the juicy dragon meat. The army Captain moaned and grabbed Fox's head, shivering and forcing Fox down on his cock. \"Oh, Fox! That feels so good! Oh, you do that like a pro!\" He groaned, digging into Fox's fur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox chuckled as he suckled on the dragonhood, smiling up at his 'superior officer'. \"I practice with Falco...he's got a nice dick!\" Fox laughed, wiggling his hips. \"Also likes to mount me, too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOikonny smirked and closed his eyes, placing a claw on the wall next to him as Fox sucked harder. Soon, his pre leaked from his cock and into Fox's mouth, who swallowed it down and kept sucking. FT reached down and pushed Fox's head off his cock, panting heavily. \"Ok...that's enough! Turn around, and raise your tail! Do it now, Fox!\" He ordered, catching his breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox nodded and licked his lips of pre, turning around and hiking his tail, showing off his tailhole and his wonderfully rounded rear. \"You sure know how to treat a fox!\" McCloud yipped, giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT laughed and mounted up on Fox. \"I must warn you, because I have a crush on you, I will probably consider this a mating.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox shrugged, not seeming to mind. \"I don't mind...I'd love to be mated to a big dragon that could dominate and eat me up whenever he pleased!\" Fox said, shivering as the dragon wrapped his tail around his furry leg and slid his cock into Fox's tight tailhole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good...are you gay, Fox?\" FT asked, shuddering as pleasure shot through his body as his cock stretched Fox's innards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...just bisexual...yourself?\" Fox moaned, closing his eyes, arching his back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My straight with my species, just bisexual when it comes to yours.\" FT explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox nodded and bucked his hips, the chitchat over and the mating beginning. Fox moaned in deep pleasure as the dragon pounded deep into his rear. The dragon grabbed Fox's hips and dug in deep, gripping Fox hard. His balls slapped against Fox's as he mated with the vulpine. His cock throbbed and his climax was just around the corner. He let out a loud roar and pulled his head back, opening his mouth and grasping Fox's neck in a mating bite. Fox whimpered, fearing the dragon was about to sink in and rip his head off. \"Relax, Fox...it's just a mating bite!\" FT groaned, letting out another roar as he ejaculated deep into Fox' tailhole. He licked Fox's fur, getting his first taste of the vulpine, and liking his flavor very much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox screeched in pleasure as his tailhole grasped hard around FT's cock, holding it in a death grip and milking the spooge within. The dragon made smaller thrusts, pumping more rich seed into McCloud. He shuddered as he thought about the situation, one he never believed would happen. As they collapsed on the bed, FT continued to lick and sniff his new mate, drooling over his neck. \"You taste delicious, Fox...\" FT moaned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox chuckled and looked back at the dragon. \"So it's dinner time huh?\"</span></div></div>",

His eyes widened in excitement as the dragon's mouth opened over his muzzle. His tongue lashed out and soaked Fox's face with his drool as he tasted the delicious vulpine. He reached down and wrapped a claw around Fox's head and pushed it inside his hungry mouth, sending Fox's muzzle into his throat. He suckled on McCloud's head before swallowing and stretching his jaws over Fox's shoudlers. \"Mmm...you're delicious.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox chuckled and stared down Oikonny's throat as the large dragon devoured him, feeling his rough tongue against his chest. \"Thanks...c'mon, eat me up you big dragon!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can do!\" FT laughed as he lifted Fox up further into his mouth, gulping voraciously. His lips slid over McCloud's stomach and his tongue slurped over it, the murring fox wiggling in his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT swallowed again, Fox's rump sliding into his mouth. He bit down playfully before grabbing Fox's legs and stuffing them in his jaws. After four pushes, he closed his mouth around Fox's footpaws and slurped up his tail. He moaned as he felt Fox travel down his body and slip inside his stomach. He patted the bulge and licked his lips, still tasting the delectable fox on them. \"Mmm, that was a great meal, Fox. You were very filling and VERY delicious!\" FT said, rubbing over Fox's head from the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox blushed as he sat in a stomach he always wanted to be in since he was a little kit and first learned about dragons. He nuzzled the stomach walls and murred, squirming about playfully, sending jolts of pleasure throughout FT. \"So, am I going to be digested?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFT shook his head. \"No, I have the power to prevent it. Andross' plans for me were to kill you in the air, or if that failed, capture you in my stomach and bring you to him, depending on if you pissed him off recently.\" FT explained, letting out a massive belch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFox nodded and smiled. \"Well, I'm glad you deflected. Heh, I'm going to enjoy having you on the team.\" Fox said, causing FT to grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm gonna enjoy it here too, Fox.

He had an odd fantasy set where he was cooked up for dinner, mostly by dragons. Prehaps this was the best opppertunity to live out those fantasies? Fox grinned and turned his head. \"Oh yes, FT...I'd love to be cooked up by you.\" Fox moaned, biting his tailtip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dragon moaned and licked his lips.

She has a set of small bifocals perched at the base of her muzzle, right between her piercingly intelligent amber eyes. She wears a red scarf with the two foot-long loose ends dangling in front.<br>\r\nOn each arm, starting just below the elbow, she wears a long, tight, cream-colored glove, the tips of which are open, allowing her clawed fingers fresh air.<br>\r\nAll she wears on her torso is a beige piece of cloth tied together tightly by two strings and functioning as a bra. Her chest is exposed in the front as much as is socially acceptable, while pushing the limits.<br>\r\nHer belly is quite visible until the point where her jeans come to. Through her belt holders, she wears another piece of cloth looking much like her scarf, but this time forest green. Her jeans are somewhat loose-fitting, suggesting that she is, despite the revealing top, somewhat sexually inaccessible (She's not a virgin, but she's picky). They go all the way down to her ankles, which are bare, as are her clawed feet.<br>\r\nSamantha looks somewhat anorexic, but she simply has a high metabolism.<br>\r\nShe is into politics because she sees them as the best way to attain her goal of making everything better for everyone. She was the city manager of Coella, her hometown, until she was transported from her native plane (the Dungeons and Dragons multiverse) into that of the Starfox setting by a massive space-time rift caused by the utter annihilation of the Aparoids (taking out that many creatures who take up that much space at once is bound to violate the law of conservation of matter, which in turn causes, at least, a few astral rifts and space-time anomalies). She's had trouble coping with the culture shock (she's from a medieval time setting), but has recently become a respected political leader on Corneria.<br>\r\nSamantha is highly intelligent, surpassed only by her charisma. She is also almost entirely good. One little quirk she picked up, though, when she transferred to this universe, is that when she's in PMS, she tends to lose herself and attempts to eat anyone who irks her (and with PMS, this \"irking\" often comes from irrational causes).</span></div></div>",

May we enter anyway?\"<br>\r\nShocked, the secretary waved them in without a word. She couldn't believe something urgent would have to come to Miss Weltzin.

They went in and the lizard closed the door behind him. For a second, she feared for Miss Weltzin's safety and was about to call security just in case, but then she remembered that the benevolent ones outnumbered the malevolents.

Her office was not terribly large, so it made the place somewhat stuffy. Nevertheless, she tried to keep a pleasant demeanor and welcomed them in with a weary half-smile. She had been working all night, compounded with the fact that she had just menstruated about an hour and a half ago, so she had to work hard to put on a decent face.<br>\r\n\"Yes?\" she asked.<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" said the handsome vulpinoid, blushing because he hadn't expected Miss Weltzin to be so...attractive. \"Uh, we've heard about your ability with magic and we were wondering if...uh...you'd like to help us out with a problem we've been having lately.\"<br>\r\nThe vulpinoid looked over to the vixen and smiled, then turned his head quickly away to hide his sudden and immense blush. Samantha deduced that he was ashamed to be more smitten with her than with this other person who must be his mate. The frown on the vixen's face confirmed it. No matter, though; she was going to keep this business strictly professional and be done with them so she wouldn't end up ruining a relationship (though she kinda' liked the fox at first sight, too, she dismissed it as simple infatuation that would leave once her memory of him faded in a day or two).<br>\r\n\"Well, tell me the problem and I'll see if I can help you with it,\" she said after a pause, feeling slightly annoyed at the uncomfortable atmosphere and the large amount of males of different species staring at her.<br>\r\nThe fox jumped, startled at her sudden comment: \"Well, it looks like a new threat to the Lylat System's coming on. We were wondering if you'd assist us in the development of magically-augmented weapons.\" He quickly added, \"You'll be well-paid, of course. Ever since we saved Sauria, we've been rolling in the funds.\"<br>\r\nThen the identity of this group snapped into Samantha's mind and her face clearly showed she had just suddenly come to a realization. \"You're StarFox?\" she asked.<br>\r\nThe gruff wolf in the back barked, \"And StarWolf! Don't you forget it!\"<br>\r\nThe person she now recognized as Fox McCloud rubbed the back of his head and said, \"Yeah. I thought you'd know us on sight. Maybe we're not so famous in this corner of the galaxy. That's okay, though. Celebrity isn't all that great.\"<br>\r\n\"Well, if you're StarFox (And StarWolf, of course...), then what right do I have to refuse?\" she said, anger clearly in her voice at her diplomatic helplessness. She thought, \"Ah, shit...I feel it coming on...I'd better get them out of here quickly or the galaxy is doomed...\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, come off it. We came here anonymously. It was you who figured out who we were and thought that meant something,\" the vixen whose name must be Krystal said, a vein clearly visible at her jealous temple.<br>\r\n\"Now, now, Krystal. We're asking her a favor, why be rude about it?\" Fox said, putting his hands on her shoulders and trying to calm her down.<br>\r\nShe pushed his hands off and crossed her arms, still angry.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the others were looking around the room nervously. The toad, Slippy, she remembered, piped up, \"Aw, don't mind her. She gets like that when Fox is nice to people more beautiful than her,\" to which Krystal promptly jumped at him, knocked him on the floor, and, kneeling upon his belly, started strangling him. Falco, Wolf, Panther, and Leon quickly moved in front of the scene to block it from their potential ally's view.<br>\r\n\"Yeah. I'll do it. I'll be there in a few days. Now get out of here before your amphibious friend is choked to death,\" she said, waving her hand toward the door.<br>\r\nFox stepped toward her desk (\"Please don't do that,\" she thought) and said, \"Uh...actually, we need you to come with us right now. We need you as soon as possible. It's pretty grim, from what the forecast seems to show. Hundreds of thousands of ships. We need something magical to be able to take out multip...\" Samantha stopped him with her hand and said, \"Seriously, please leave. I'll explain later, but right now I need some privacy...\"<br>\r\n\"What's wrong? Maybe we can help...\" he began to say and Krystal stopped choking Slippy, turned her head, eyes flashing fire as she got up and began to walk toward Fox.<br>\r\n\"You heard the 'beautiful' woman, Fox. She needs her 'alone-time,\" she said with as much sarcasm as she could muster. Samantha's anger flared and she decided that if she snapped and went on her eating spree (which she was intolerably close to), she would start with the bitch she had so honorably tried to save from some grief earlier...</span></div></div>",

I'm going to explain something...\"<br>\r\nKrystal, feeling cocky and certain that Miss Weltzin was going to slap her, initiating a fight between the two of them which she would surely win, leaned over Samantha's desk (showing off her cleavage, which she was sure was superior to Miss Weltzin's) and close enough to Samantha's face to be able to feel her breath on her muzzle.<br>\r\nInstead, the felinoid placed her hands reassuringly on each of Krystal's shoulders and tilted her head forward to Krystal's ear. She chanted the incantation for her \"Reduce\" spell and in an instant, Krstal was clasped between two hands about the size of her torso. She was shifted to two fingers, held up by the tail and she realized she was being quickly transferred over to a giant feline muzzle that was opening, showing off sharp, yellowed teeth (Samantha still hadn't gotten the hang of toothpaste), a rough tongue, pink cheek interiors, and a throat wall that could easily accomodate her. She was too scared to say anything, but struggled vainly.<br>\r\nThe others, meanwhile, stared at the spectacle of their teammate (and only estrogen onboard the Great Fox) being shrunk to a diminutive size. They barely noticed that she was about to be eaten.<br>\r\nSamantha, in the meantime, lifted Krystal just over her mouth, licked the little vixen, and let her slide down her tongue. When Krystal was sufficiently inside her mouth, she slurped her tongue back in and enveloped the struggling woman. She snapped her muzzle shut, spraying a small amount of spittle onto her desk.<br>\r\nKrystal was horrified to be in the position she was in. It was the last thing she expected Miss Weltzin to do. She wiggled and scratched, kicked and clawed, but nothing she could do would stop the inevitable gulp. She felt herself being tossed to one side of the mouth, where she felt hard, pointed enamel come down onto her back. It wasn't so hard that it pierced her flesh, but it did leave a nasty bruise. She yelped and started to cry. She didn't want to go yet. Fox was still playing coy with her and she was just getting good with guns and vehicles, though her martial arts needed a little work.<br>\r\nAs she thought this, she felt another bite and cried out. The tongue swished back toward her and removed her from that painful vice. However, she had no time to rejoice when she felt it give a thrust, sending her to its back, which quickly smacked her against the back wall of the throat, sending her to a tube where muscular action roiled and pulled her downward. She heard a sickening *Ulp...* and realized that she had just been swallowed whole. She screamed.</span></div></div>",

He looked up just in time to realize Miss Weltzin was casting one heck of a spell. She seemed to be concentrating incredibly hard and her nose had started to bleed a little. Wolf began to run toward her to subdue her, but she got the spell off and everyone but Fox became as small as Krystal. Wolf was still running but stopped once he realized he wasn't making nearly as much headway as a couple seconds before and that he was running toward a large foot. He started to turn back when he was suddenly grasped and lifted high into the air. \"You can't do this to me!\" he yelled, but apparently his captor disagreed because he soon found himself shoved into her maw. He grabbed onto her tongue with his arms and legs firmly wrapped around it, but it was quite slippery, so he knew he'd have to do something quickly. Just what, however, he wasn't sure. He wrestled with the large muscle in the moist darkness for about four seconds and then was thrown forcefully back, knocking him out cold. He didn't even feel himself being escorted down her esophagus and landing on Krystal's back, which knocked her over with an \"Oof!\"</span></div></div>",

They started pounding frantically on the door, but it didn't make much noise at all. The secretary would have noticed their yells for help, however, if she wasn't listening to music through her headphones and playing Internet games.<br>\r\nLeon rushed toward the bottom of the desk and attempted to use his uncanny hiding ability to cloak himself under it. He didn't know that Samantha saw him go under there, however, so he remained still and silent in hopes that she would give up after she had eaten all those other fools.<br>\r\nFalco banked his chances on Fox. He looked up at him and nodded at him, Fox nodding back. Falco then began to run circles around Samantha's feet, hoping to distract her long enough to allow Fox to control her and stop her from casting any more spells or eating anyone else. Fox, having known Falco for a long time, could intuitively guess the bird's plan and started marching toward the rampaging felinoid.<br>\r\nHe then realized he couldn't move. He was paralyzed. She had cast \"Hold Person\" on him and he was stuck in place.<br>\r\nFalco kept running around, not realizing that his ally was unable to complete his tactic. He changed running direction, stopping on a dime, to throw the (to him) colossal cat-woman off. However, this allowed the stomp that would have missed him to directly connect. She held him firmly under her foot as she bent down to grab him. When the foot loosened up a little, he tried to pull himself out. However, her hand was already waiting for him and snatched him up.<br>\r\n\"Aw, man...just my luck. Why'd you have to become incompetent now, Fox? I thought you knew what I was planning...Fox?\" He looked over at his ally from the large hand he was clasped in and noticed a dull stare from his teammate's pupils. \"Crap! She got you, too?!\" he said as he was jerked toward Miss Weltzin's face.<br>\r\n\"Now this makes more sense. Cats are supposed to eat birds, not foxes and wolves,\" Samantha said. When she finished speaking, she let her tongue loll out and stuffed Falco into her mouth. She slurped her tongue back in and closed her jaws, trapping him with nowhere to go but down. She swished him around a little bit, enjoying his flavor more than the preceding victims. After a little while, she decided that was enough and swallowed hard, making an audible *Glurp!* A small lump could be seen going past her scarf and disappearing around her collarbone. About a half a second later, a muffled, \"Not you, too!\" could be heard from inside the purring felinoid.</span></div></div>",

He never did like the new recruit, Panther, because he seemed fairly weak and certainly wasn't as good a pilot as himself or Wolf...who was now in that damnable woman's belly. When he got out of here and the spell wore off, he would certainly take revenge on this person for so callously eating his leader. However, he supposed HE was now the leader, so in a way he had her to thank. He decided that he would make the assassination quick and devour the corpse afterward. It would be a fitting end.<br>\r\nThe felinoid's feet began going toward the desk and Leon's heart jumped up into his throat. \"How could she have seen me?!\" he thought to himself. The feet turned away when they reached the desk, however, and he could hear it move above him a little. A small belch came from above, and he figured she was leaning on the desk, surveying her next two morsels.<br>\r\nJust then, Panther yelled, \"Leon, watch out!\" and Samantha turned around and dropped down quickly onto her knees and swiped her arm under the desk, grasping the lizard in one quick swoop and transferring him to that trap that had claimed three of his allies already. She stuffed him in her cheek and licked him with a large amount of slobber. This tickled him and he giggled his little lizard-giggle in spite of himself as he tried to ward off the tongue instinctively. He felt himself blushing and realized he liked it.<br>\r\nSlippy and Panther first looked at the crouching cat's nice little butt connected to the fluffy tail wagging in the air, then to each other, and smiled, knowing what the other was thinking.<br>\r\nThey ran forward, arms outstretched, determined to embarrass the cat before they, too, joined their friends.

They let out cries of exhaltation at their minor success. They could even see her blush a little as she reached for them. Mission accomplished as she snatched them up in her hands and shoved them both in her mouth, making her cheeks bulge with the little people. They high-fived each other from across the rows of teeth and the tongue.<br>\r\nSamantha, in the meantime, was trying to control her blush. The radiating pink skin was clearly visible at the lower corners of her eyes as she nervously dragged the two to the back of her throat. She gave a quick, unthinking swallow and felt the two slide painfully down her throat. Her eyes watered as they got stuck once, but a sip of water from a canteen on her desk flushed them the rest of the way down. She coughed a little, then burped as the two displaced some of the air out of her stomach.<br>\r\nKrystal had already moved out of the way when she heard the last gulp, and moved Wolf out of the way, too. She held him close to her chest and looked what she figured was \"up\" to see if she could detect movement from that hole she and so many others had come through. Of course, it was pitch black and she was surprised when she heard a double splash near her feet. From what she could tell, Leon was enjoying himself because he kept making little happy noises on the other side of the chamber. She felt Wolf begin to stir in her arms and let go of him. He groaned, \"Mmm...where...Ah, damn!\" He pounded his fist into the wall in anger and stood up from Krystal's lap. He quickly fell back down because of the unsturdy, muscled floor that kept moving beneath his feet.<br>\r\nSlippy and Panther were still giggling like schoolgirls.<br>\r\nFalco was kicking the stomach wall repeatedly until it shot out a bit of acid onto him because of the stimulation. He decided that perhaps that was not the best idea and sat down, muttering curses to himself.<br>\r\n\"Well, that's that, I guess,\" he said after a little while, \"I get the feeling ol' Foxie-boy won't be joining us in this little picnic we're having. It seems like she left him unshrunk on purpose.\"<br>\r\nSlippy said, \"Ohhh...don't mention picnics. Picnics mean food, and I'm hungry right now.\"<br>\r\nA few of the people chuckled, and Krystal said, with a smile (unseen by anyone of course), \"I didn't realize food could be hungry.\" Everybody, including the usually-scornful Wolf O'Donnell, laughed as the stomach began to fill with the weak acid that aids Samantha Weltzin's digestion.<br>\r\nSamantha rubbed her belly a little and looked at the still-paralyzed Fox. She wasn't sure what to do with Fox. Her PMS-insanity was beginning to abate, but she was still tempted to devour him. Perhaps even in his current size...</span></div></div>",

Samantha walked over to him, kneeled down in front of him, lifted his chin with her finger and said, \"There, there. I'm sorry about your friends. I tried to warn you. Normally, I'm a very nice person and I regret what I just did, but what's done is done. Let's go to your ship and save the universe.\" With that, Fox looked into her eyes and leapt forward into her arms, hugging her and crying over her shoulder. She patted him consolingly (stifled a belch, for his sake) until he had wept all his tears.<br>\r\nJust then, Fox's comlink began to ring. He took it out and the screen flashed up with Peppy Hare's face. \"Hey, Fox! It turns out there is no galactic scourge. The monitor was just magnified too much. All those things we thought were ships...they were dust particles. Ha HA! Anyway, we won't require Miss Weltzin's assistance any more. Peppy over-and-out!\" With that, the image disappeared back into the comlink. Fox and Samantha looked at each other and began to laugh heartily.<br>\r\n\"Just a second while I throw up your friends. I really hate vomiting, but, like I said, I'm normally a nice person,\" Samantha said.<br>\r\nWith that, she stood up, walked to the bathroom, opened the door, walked in, and shut the door. Fox got the feeling he'd be seeing more of this eccentric young woman, but certainly not after his friends got out of the infirmary. There's no way they'd allow him to so much as set foot on her planet again, let alone go to her office.<br>\r\nHe sighed a deep sigh and began to chuckle as the doorway opened and Samantha and his (fully-grown) friends walked back in. They had a few scars, were completely drenched, and their clothes were tattered and pretty much worthless, but otherwise they were alright.<br>\r\n\"Well, Mr. McCloud...gentlemen...lady...our business is concluded. If you wish for me to show you to the door...\"<br>\r\n\"NO!\" Krystal, Panther, Slippy, Wolf, and Falco all said in unison (Leon said, \"Sure.\"). They marched out of the room angrily (Leon following behind in a dreamlike state), and Samantha turned to Fox. \"Well,\" Fox said, \"I don't suppose I'll see you again any time soon...\"<br>\r\n\"I don't suppose so,\" said Samantha, wiping a small amount of vomit off her lip.<br>\r\nKrystal stormed into the room again, grabbed Fox's arm, and dragged him away in a huff, Fox waving goodbye.<br>\r\nKrystal slammed the door shut.</span></div></div>",

He saw Miss Weltzin lick her fingers and belch, then begin to approach him with that delicate walk women tend to adapt. She quickly chanted the now-familiar \"Reduce\" spell, waving her arms in the intricate motion of the spellcaster. He began to perspire madly as he stared straight ahead at her shins a second after she finished. \"This is it,\" he thought, \"I'm going to be eaten while paralyzed and we're going to lose to that gigantic army...\"<br>\r\nJust then, Peppy's face came up from Fox's comlink. It announced, \"Well, Fox, looks like we won't need Miss Weltzin's help anymore. That army on the monitor turned out to be a bunch of dust particles. Isn't that funny? You can come back to the Great Fox now. Peppy, over and out.\" The face disappeared, and with it, Fox's last hope of salvation.<br>\r\nFox felt himself grasped in a large hand and lifted into the air. He passed the denim jeans, the cloth in the belt holders, the belly where his friends now reside, the somewhat-visible ribcage, the chest he was attracted to for a small amount of time, the scarf, and finally reached the large face of his defeater. That she had a reputation for kindness and benevolence seemed an insane notion at this moment, when she was opening her jaws, revealing that deathtrap that had claimed everyone and would now claim him.<br>\r\nSamantha glomped about half of Fox's body, leaving his abdomen down outside her lips. She licked his face and realized this was the tastiest member by far. She grasped him between her sharp teeth, pushed his butt into her mouth, then slurped up his legs and tail. She smiled, drool finding its way out of her lips and onto her chin. Samantha spent the better part of a minute tossing Fox around in her mouth, scratching his back with her teeth, and otherwise getting his flavor out of him and onto her taste buds to the maximum effect. About halfway through, the \"Hold Person\" spell wore off and Fox began to struggle, making it even nicer for her. She opened her jaws one more time and stuck out her tongue with Fox sitting on it.<br>\r\nHe took one last look at the outside world, tried to get up and run, heedless of the fall that was sure to come, but tripped on the saliva and fell flat on his face. He looked up and held out his hand, screaming, \"NOOOOO!\" as the tongue re-entered the mouth and the teeth in front of him clamped together, sealing off all light. He felt himself flopped backward and began a feet-first descent into Samantha's stomach.</span></div></div>",

She decided it was about time to clear this up with her secretary and make sure she didn't tattle. After all, if Samantha was in jail, she couldn't do any good for the universe. She felt a little kick in her stomach and thought that this must be what a child in her uterus is like.

He was born as prey, not predator, but he could hold his own. He only allowed those he liked to vore him. A ring helped him survive rare trips to the stomach. He was half weasel, half otter, yet very small. But he learned to fight well and to disarm and spare his opponent. He wore a red open vest with red baggy pants with chains.His hair was born red, which he adored. He always had a smile on his face, no matter what happened.=D He was so polite that he never swore and always respected his supers. His one weakness was his want for a mother, as he never knew his. Which he always yearned for the breast of a mother. His weapons were a red amazingly sharp katana, and in the other hand had a gold large claymore which he used with one hand efficiently well. Something caught his bright red eyes. A blue female fox(Krystal, he doesn't know it yet) was being harassed by a male lizard and a male badger. He grinned a short smile, which flashed his two sharp teeth. With his hard-earned ninja experience, he jumped off the building, blocking the sun for a short moment. Many people looked up and gasped. He then applied himself to the side of the building and began to run down the wall. He landed with a soft thud completely unharmed. People looked amazed and returned to their business. Time to get back to his. He walked to the alley where the criminals were. He appeared right behind them and said, \" Please apologize and leave right now.\" They rolled their eyes and turned around. He saw the neck hairs on their back stand when he first spoke, but then they relaxed. \" Go home, kid or you may get hurt,\" said the badger. \"Yesssssssssssssss, little boy, run home,\" his the lizard. In the one second after he spoke, a flash of red and gold streaked the area at lightning-speed. The badger and lizard found themselves in their underwear and left screaming. He let out a small smirk and flashed a half smile and turned around. \"Are you okay....,\", that was as far as he got because his vision was blocked by blue fur. Krystal had hugged him and since he was small, his face was buried in her breasts. His hand began to twitch uncontrollably, eager to remove the piece of clothing that blockaded his path to a motherly feel. However, he resisted, though his hand began to sweat. Finally, she let go. It was almost like pure torture. \" You should join our group, we need someone of your skill. I'm Krystal, and you?\" He looked up and smiled and replied,\" I'm Pyrokense.\"</span></div></div>",

(Ex: Fox walked up and ate Krystal, the end!)<br>\r\nF) In character selection chapters, please leave an option for more characters. There are a lot in the universe than just StarFox, StarWolf, and the StarFox's team's friends.<br>\r\nG) GTS and shrinking is allowed, but try to keep the females on the growth side. Either side can shrink/grow, though.<br>\r\nH) As of this point, no humans. Any chapters with humans will be deleted.
