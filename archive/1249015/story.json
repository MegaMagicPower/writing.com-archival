In traditional French cuisine, the food was quite heavy, and it didn't help that Mrs. Potts had a tendency of overusing butter and heavy creams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     Belle was noticing a small change in her clothes. She was having trouble fitting into even the largest of her dresses. In the highly unlikely event that she could fasten the back entirely, it felt like she was wearing two corsets instead of just one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"How did this happen? I make sure to keep in decent shape,\" sighed Belle, flopping onto the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Well, Belle, sometimes this happens. You just have to grin and bear it,\" replied Belle's servant in a motherly tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Is it noticeable?\" asked Belle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Not to me, but I may be a bit biased.

She pulled several times as her breasts squished together. Belle cupped her ample breasts in her hands, pleasantly surprising by how round and full they had become. She said to her dressing assistant: \"I will just hold my breasts flat while  you pull the dress hard over them.\" With a few awkward attempts, the dress made it over her breasts only to get caught several inches down on her belly. The small pudge had grown into a round pot belly that hung out as far her breasts. Looking down, Belle could no longer see past her bosom. She had no idea how large her belly had gotten. Even sucking it in with all her might, the dress was barely able to slide past the bulge. But it finally did. \"There\" Belle said with satisfaction, her dressing assistant exhausted from all the pushing and proding. \"I knew I had gained some weight, but its not so bad. This dress still fits even without a corset. Now just button the back up and I am ready to go.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut no matter how many times she tried, the dressing assistant could not get the buttons to come together.

After ten minutes of hard work, the dress was finally attached, but was very ill-fitting on Belle, as it made her look a lot fatter, with breasts bulging on top and beefy arms spilling out from the short sleeves' end. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you! Now I'm going to be the prettiest of the ball!\" said Belle cheerfully, without realizing how she looked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dress was very very very tight, so she waddled slowly to the big stairs, which would lead her down to the ballroom. When she arrived there, all lights were on her and all eyes too. Some people whispered to others : \"How she's fat!!\" or \"With a belly jiggling like that, she sure isn't pregnant!\". Belle didn't heard them and she thought that the whispering and glances were admiration and envy. With every slow, awkward steps she took on the stairs, a button flew of her back, until every buttons were gone. Belle didn't notice that too, as the dress was still tight on her. When she reached the ballroom, her prince went to her, looking at her constricted breasts and rounded belly that stuck out as far as them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My love, you look... err... amazing tonight...\" he said, not very convincing. It wasn't that he didn't think she was pretty or anything, he was just shoked to see his wife constricted in a dress, as she was always so slim in the past! Beside, he was pretty much busy these days, so he didn't have the time to notice the gradual change in her appearance. He figured he'll talk to her about it later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awww thank you, you're so sweet! Now, let's eat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey went to sit and...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He pushed her chair out for her and she sat down in the chair. \"Thank you hun\" she said sweetly to her prince once he took the seat next to her. The servants quickly brought out the food to them as well as their guests. Due to this being a party, she had allowed the cooks to make fried food again. In truth, she had missed the fried food and was looking forward to eating some again. She greedily helps herself to everything, particularly lots of the fried food, and eagerly digs in. She begins to stuff bite after bite of the delicious food down her throat, unable to stop because she was so hungry and the food was so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe prince was once again surprised by his wife's big appetite. He wasn't disgusted or embarassed about it but it was something he wanted to talk with her about. He didn't really have a problem with these changes in Belle but he did want to talk with her about them for a couple of reasons. One to make sure she knew and two so he could understand how this happened. He also wanted how she felt about this weight gain and surge in appetite. He found alot of their guests looking over at Belle in shocked and wondered what they were thinking about Belle's gain and appetitie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle had been eating for 1o minutes and had just finished her second big plate when her dress could no longer contain her growing body any longer. She blushed bright red as she heard a loud ripping sound and felt the back of her dress around her butt rip open and feeling her big soft round butt ooze out onto the chair. The chair's coldness hiting her warm fat butt startled her a little causing her to squeal softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Please excuse me, I don't think I feel very well...\" she said after painfully swallowing her last bite of food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then carefully raised from her seat and managed to cover the rip on her dress with her napkin. before waddling her way out the balroom, as her dress didn't allowed to move a lot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Belle left the balroom, everyone turned to her prince, like they wanted him to tell what was going on with their beloved princess. However, he didn't know what gotten through his lovely wife either. First, she looked noticably pumper than before. Sure, he noticed that she gained a little weight in the past few weeks, but she was always wearing corsets and dresses that actually fited her so it wasn't that noticable, especially since he was so busy himself. Second, she shows up in a dress which was way too tight, and she seemed quite in denial because third, she stuffed her face like nothing else mattered!! More than ever, he felt the urge to have a good talk with Belle to see if she's okay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">----</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle stormed in her bedroom, and as she walked by a mirror, she almost screamed in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a mess!! An absolute, fat mess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the buttons in the back of her dress were gone, and she could see some flesh oozing from the hole on her butt.

And I made a fool of myself in front of everybody, I'll never go out in public ever again!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe quickly removed the last shreds of her dress and buried herself under her sheets, crying in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later, she heard a knock on her door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away please!!

Adam, please, just go away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Belle, don't cry. Please...Don't cry...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go away!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Belle, please...\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Go-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam had already opened the door, and walked over. Putting his hand upon some obscured part of his wife's body, it felt very pillowy. Then he looked at her with what Belle thought was pity, yes, he looked upon her with pity. And she loathed it!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYes, at that moment she loathed his sparking, blue eyes. Loathed his silky, long hair. Loathed his perfect, perfect body. His perfect body that was no different from the day they wed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd he just had to rub it her face! \"Belle,\" he repeated, removing his shirt, for he thought it best to sleep in here tonight. \"Don't cry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle got a real good look at Adam's defined,abdominal muscles, with a hatred she remembered her now undeniably fat middle. So, in shame, Belle turned away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't cry? Don't cry?! How can in not cry! For God sake, I just burst out of my dress! Will you deny that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer prince admitted, \"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you deny that everyone was staring?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will you deny that you were staring?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam! You sound like a dog, always trying to please. But, here's one there's no right answer to... Will you deny that I'm a fat, disgusting pig?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam pulled back the sheets. Truly getting a glimpse of his wife's plumpness. And, to be blunt, he was nothing close to disgusted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo. Truth be told her inflated breast, meaty thighs, and wide hips were quite infatuating to him. Quite, her bouncing bottom was practically begging to be caressed. All of her was begging to be caressed. Her newfound corpulence truly captivated him, especially her thick, bulging stomach roll. Her pale stomach roll that made him hard, as it was ep easily visible, even with Belle trying so very hard to hide its rotundity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Adam removed her arms. His eyes focusing solely on her midsection. Belle noticed this and turned away, in slight horror. But, Adam threw away all her worries. As he swept her off her feet, much harder a task now then when he had carried her back to their room, the night they wed. Holding her still, he fondled her stomach as though it was dough, for that's certainly what it felt like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't cry,\" he said for the last time. \"Belle...I will deny it. No doubt you are fat-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle's pupils doubled in the size, much like she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"-but you are anything but disgusting. You will never be disgusting to me. You are so very beautiful...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, though the look in his eyes was no different, Belle saw no pity there. Only love, love and adoration. \"Even...Even like this?\" asked she.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam sunk his fingers deeper into her softness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Especially like this...\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nHe smiled at her. Seeing an entirely different person, physically, then the woman he married, Adam kissed her. Her flesh almost swallowing his entire hand, he only dug further into her large midsection. Belle felt warm, as his caresses only grew sweeter. Remembering his past thought Adam plopped Belle onto the bed, in which she made a commendably big indent.  He would caress of all of her...His pretty, plump princess...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's what he called her. \"My pretty,plump princess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe would have to spend much more time doting on her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she would allow him to, that is. For when Belle got, more like rolled, out of bed the next morning. She took the covering off her full-length mirror. When she looked into it, she finally understood why it had been covered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I'm fat!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands flew to the fattest part of her, her middle. And she shrieked, somehow not awaking her prince. She understood last night that she was bigger than before, but not this much bigger! She looked more like a baby whale than a princess!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA princess...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam's words came into her mind. \"My pretty, plump princess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWas that she was? Was it? Did she want that to be what she was? Belle pondered it...His pretty, plump princess...His pretty, plump princess...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

However, her physical well-being and her love for herself mattered more than indulging in his strange fantasy. Calmly, but critically, she looked at the mirror again, studying her reflexion. As she looked down at her belly, she noticed her chin doubling slightly, which made her cringe, but she carried on her inspection. She was amazed (although in a disgusted way) to see that what have previously been a flat, toned stomach was now bulging into this pale globe of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One day, I'll have a belly as full and round as this, but not from being overweight...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis thought made her smile, as she began to rub her middle, dreaming of carrying Adam's child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it will probably make my breasts grow as big as they are now...\" she mused, cupping her now impressive bust. She had to admit, she quite enjoyed these new additions to her body, and she planned to ask her seamstress to make her bigger dresses low cut in the front so she could display her assets while she still got them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile her bigger bottom balanced her new figure nicely, she grimaced in disgust as she noticed that cellulite was beginning to dimple it. She disliked how her large thighs now rubbed, bounced and jiggled against one another, slowing her walk, and how her legs looked shorter now that they were thick. Her flabby arms also made her look quite matronly, and they kept spreading when laid close to her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle looked straight into her mirror, determined, and thought : \"Yes, I am a fat, overweighted mess, but nothing my strong will can't fix. I am young, I don't have any stretchmarks yet, I can bounce back and become fitter and healthier than ever!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then walked toward Adam, who was still sleeping, and she nugged him gently, waking him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, beautiful\", he smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good morning, handsome. Look, I've been thinking... While I am glad you love me at this size, this is not healthy, and I absolutely have to loose the weight. I'll diet and start exercising starting today. Might has well enjoy the flab while it lasts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with those words, Belle began kissing him, bringing his hands to her belly. As they were making love, Adam thought that, while he was enjoying his wife newfound confidence and horny mood, he was a little disappointed that she was going to loose the weight.</span></div></div>",

It had been a long time since she had last looked. She expected to look a little plumper. Everyone had commented on her rounder cheeks. But as she looked in the mirror, she almost didn't recognize the figure she stared at. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer whole body had ballooned up. She must have gained at least 30 pounds, if not more. Her breasts hung full over her large belly. Rolls of fat circled her wide hips and she had the beginnings of a double chin. She twisted her body to the side, looking at the gaping back of the dress, stretched as wide as possible. But what was most shocking to Belle was her beautiful new bottom. Her butt jutted out in two large mounds. Even as she slowly ran her hand down her back and over her bottom, she could not believe the sexy new bumps were attached to her. She squeezed the squishy fat in her hands for a moment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am huge!\"</span></div></div>",

She had been eating alot more lately and had been pretty lazy. She had to admit that she had quite enjoyed eating to her heart's content and being lazy. When she lived at hom with her father, she always had to work to help out and while they always had enough food, there was way more food to eat here at the castle. She also loved the way fat look and felt on her. She felt that the extra weight only added to her beauty and gave her a hotter more feminine figure. Realizing that she was enjoying her new lifestyle and it's effect on her body, she decided to gain more weight. She was definitely not ready to change her lifestyle, figured some more pounds would only add to her beauty, and knew her husband wouldn't mind. He hadn't complained about the weight she had gained so far. She had to admit that he hadn't really been around her that much to fully notice her weight gain but even still figured he wouldn't mind as she knew that he truly did love her.  She also realized this meant that she could start eating fried food again. She loved fried food and had to admit that she had missed it since she asked the cooks to stop serving it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle continued to admire her body for a bit more. She felt up her breats, placed her hands on top of her fat belly, jiggling it, and playing with it for a bit. She then turned around to shake her butt in the mirror, enjoying watching it jiggle and shake. She then turned back to the dressing assitant and asked her...</span></div></div>",

She stood naked from the waist up in the mirror, barely recognizing the figure she saw. Her full, round belly pouched out over her waistline. She ran her hand over the bumps along her side, while looking at her blossoming breasts spilling over her upper body.

Right away!\", replied her servant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle then reluctantly stood up so she could take her new measurement. She tried not to pay attention to the numbers on her measuring tape : feeling it dig a little into her softer flesh was enough of an indication that she did gain some weight. She vowed to pay more attention to her eating from now on. Once she had taken her princess' updated measurements, the servant left Belle's bedroom, taking some dresses with her so she could adjust them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelle was now left alone, standing in front of her mirror, fully undressed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Belle, are you com...\", Adam said, entering the room, stopping mid-sentence when he saw that Belle was poking and pinching her slightly fatter body. She gasped, turned around to look at her prince, her face now red from embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Adam! You scared me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Belle, are you alright? What is going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Adam, yes, I am fine... It's just... I gained weight and now nothing fits me properly, that never happened to me before and I don't know what to do\", Belle sobbed, feeling her eyes tearing a little at the admission.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWanting to comfort his wife, Adam rushed to take her in his arms, Of course, he had noticed that Belle's body had a little more bounce to it during their love making, and he had admired how her too tight dresses were squishing her breasts into a mouth watering cleavage lately. However, now was the first time in a long time that he could truly examine Belle's body. She was still quite slim, but one could tell that she was indulging in her new royal lifestyle. Seeing his wife in the nude, he could clearly see that her fuller cleavage was not just an illusion from her ill fitting dresses, and that her breasts had some more life to them when she moved now. It was hard for Adam to stop staring at them, but he carried on his inspection. Belle's waist really had thickened from the rich cuisine she was enjoying lately, but since it was impossibly tiny before, it carried the extra weight well. The biggest change was that a round little pouch had covered her previously flat stomach, but it didn't stuck out very far. Her arms and legs were just a touch softer, with some flab gathering on her inner tighs, filing the gap there once was between them. Her hips were more padded now, giving them a rounder, more feminine appearance. With Belle facing him, Adam couldn't see the current state of her butt though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, there, Belle...\", Adam said in a consoling tone. \"You are not even close to being chubby, let alone fat!\" Belle looked up to him, managing a faint smile. Sensing his wife relax a little, Adam dared to slide one hand to her ass, cupping one cheek and feeling his fingers sink into the squishy flesh, marveling at its new roundness. Belle was surprised at how good it felt : she wasn't used to have extra flab that could be grabbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdam continued. \"I am so happy that you are enjoying yourself and your new lifestyle. I want nothing more than to pamper you! Besides, you are even more beautiful now than when you first came to the castle...\" Adam said, letting his other hand wander to her hip, delicately fondling the small love handle that was spilling over it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was saying that because...</span></div></div>",

A thin layer of fat had begun to hang off her usually muscular, tight arms. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel found a blue dress she didn't remember wearing before. As she slipped it over her head, she found her frame floating in a sea of extra fabric. \"Ah, see? Perfect fit.\"The dress was several sized bigger than the one she had been wearing before. It disguised all signs of her growing belly and bottom as it draped over her. All that was visible was her blossoming chest as it bulged slightly out of the top.

And by the time she was responding for him to enter she was a little out of breath from all that movement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric's mouth dropped in shock when he saw his wife sprawled out on the bed. A thick layer of fat covered every inch of her body. Her stomach bulged, and if he didn't know better, he would have sworn she was pregnant. Her whole body looked squished into the same blue dress that only days earlier had loosely floated around her frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god Ariel. What happened to you? You have completely let yourself go!\" Eric exhaled, shocked and somewhat appalled by what the new ballooned shape of his wife. \"How much weight have you gained since I left?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel, embarassed and increasingly anxious about Eric's scolding look, shrugged. \"A few pounds probably. I told you, I am just filling into my new land body.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric shook his head in disbelief. \"A few pounds?! A few pounds?! You are way bigger than a few pounds!\" He took Ariel's hand and dragged her to the scale in the bathroom. In all the commotion, Ariel's dress burst in the back, and her huge ass spread out from its constraint. Her butt cheeks extended at least 6\" out from her back in two large, round circles. She let the rest of her dress fall off of her and released the clasps on her corset. Her whole body breathed a sigh of relief at her fat spread out into rolls around her frame. Her breasts hung heavy on top of the top roll of her stomach. Her deep belly button was lost in the second roll of her belly. And, the third roll hung over her crotch, nearly drapping to her upper thigh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric was still tugging at her arm as she stood in only her underwear. His large hands could barely wrap around the diameter of her upper arm now. Ariel was so embarassed she was moving where he took her like an enormous rag dolly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel stood on the scale expecting the number to show maybe 5, maybe even 10 pounds of new weight. Eric exclaimed: You weigh 175 pounds! Ariel gulped \"That can't be\" But she could not read the scale because her protruding breasts and belly blocked her view. \"Forty pounds in only a few days!\"  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She swan far away from her home, because she wanted no one to see her like that. Because she was covered with unwieldy blubber, she wasn't able to keep the rythm, and she finally retired herself in cave, eating nothing but seaweeds for days. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, she was pretty much back to her old weight, except that she didn't look quite the same : her body remained soft and untoned, a little paunch was still bloating her waist, a thin layer of fat still envelopping her arms and her breasts were an average B, although not as firm as her previous A. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to earth, she was warmly welcomed by her husband who was very pleased from her weight lost and blind to the little remaining fat. For her comeback, he organised a huge feast. While getting dressed, Ariel realised that her tighs were still flabby, her butt as well, with faint cellulite on the whole bottom. Her calves were a bit more full, but it wasn't much noticable, especially with her long dresses.

After the main course was finished, the waiters brought on the dessert, placing huge ammounts of chocolate pudding, ice cream and all sorts of cakes and pastries before the guests. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel was about to reach for a bowl when she saw Eric looking at her, she knew that she should lay off the dessert for a while...at least for now. So Ariel pulled her arm back and smiled pleasently at her husband. \"You know what? I think I'll go without dessert today,\" she said with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEric nodded, looking pleased that Ariel wasn't planning to overindulge herself this evening. He helped himself to the dessert, and the other guests loaded up their plates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel had to admit she felt rather jealous as everybody but her tucked in to their delicious looking food, her stomach rumbled, but luckily everybody else was too busy talking and eating to hear her protesting belly. She sighed to herself, it was going to be a long night...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that evening, when the feast was completed and the guests had all made their way home - Ariel climbed the spiral staircase to her bedroom hand in hand with Eric.

Ariel felt proud of her newly slimmed down body, although she hadn't regained her former toned and thin figure - she felt this new, curvier frame was pretty great looking. Now standing in only her tight fitting underwear, Ariel reached up and undid the clasp on her bra, allowing her bigger breasts room to breathe. She pulled down her panties, and standing in all her naked glory, posed cutely in front of Eric, hoping that he would like what he saw. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Whenever he had a spare moment, Eric seemed to force some sort of cake or treat on her - and she was getting into the habit of eating whatever was put in front of her. Ariel was surprised at the amount of food that seemed to be available in the castle - it seemed as though there was a never-ending supply. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEating under the sea had never been this much fun; there she had fed off of plants whatever was available, it was hardly a tasty diet, but Ariel had never imagined there was anything more appetizing out there. But the incredibly taste sensation that was human food had opened her eyes, now she savoured every bite, and eating was becoming her favourite activity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo weeks to the day that Ariel had revealed her curvier body to Eric and discovered that he not only loved her new form, but wanted her bigger - Ariel was sitting on the edge of her four poster bed, naked and extremely bloated from a huge breakfast Eric had just presented her with. Her husband had just left the room to take the empty dishes and plates that Ariel had licked clean back to the kitchens. Eric had volunteered to do this after Ariel had taken to having her morning meal naked - something that Eric hardly wanted the servants to see. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ariel liked Eric to think she was going nude so she could show off her body to him, the truth was she was getting too big for most of her clothes, and she hadn't really plucked up the courage to tell Eric yet. Her night gown had burst off of her last week in the middle of the night, and her dresses were now so tight they stopped her breathing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe past two weeks had taken their toll on Ariel's once perfectly slim body. Her belly had become her biggest attribute - bulging out over her lap and onto her widened legs. Her breasts, once barely noticeable, had now shot up about three cup sizes, and rested comfortably atop her gut. Her whole body seemed to have trippled in size, and even her once cute face had begun to show the signs of a feint double chin and chubby cheeks. And yet, despite all these changes to her body, Ariel was still enjoying herself. As long as Eric loved her body - so did she. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA creak came from the door, and Eric stepped inside, closing the door quickly behind him. Ariel turned and smiled, her breast jiggling slightly, but her food stuffed belly not moving a muscle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" said Eric. \"It's such a nice day today. I was thinking maybe we should go down to the beach, it seems as though we haven't even left the castle these past two weeks. What do you say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel bit her lip nervously. She wasn't sure she wanted to be out in the open showing off her new body, it had been all right when only Eric had seen her, but what if somebody caught sight of her? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We don't have to...\" Eric added, apparently sensing Ariel's distress. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No,\" said Ariel quickly, not wanting to dissappoint him. \"Let's go, but um...I might have a wardrobe problem...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Eric asked curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's just...\" Ariel lifted her hands and grasped her breasts. \"These have gotten so big, I don't think any of my bikini tops will be able to hold them back.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm...\" Eric said thoughtfully. \"Maybe you could...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Oh well, this could only be better than go around naked in public.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see what I can do. Go ahead, I'll meet you at the beach!\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, but you better hurry, I can't wait to see how beautiful you are in a swimsuit!\" Eric said, before kissing his wife with passion, his hands feeling her body before he left the room, leaving Ariel naked and alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarefully, she stood and headed to her drawer. She opened it and her hands dug into the pile of swimming gears. Sometimes, she picked a bikini she favored before, remembering the time she was parading on the beach, her trim little body glistening, a miniature cleavage created by the top. There is no way she could fit in one now, and she will probably look like a beached whale. Under Eric's look and touch, she was able to feel attractive, but she wasn't sure about her new figure : she felt heavy and awkward. Still, her husband expected her to come at the beach looking beautiful, and she decided that she will do her best to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, she found what she was looking for : her sea shell bra. It was even smaller than she remembered it, but she was thankful that it didn't need to be fastened in the back. There was still chances it could fit. To cover her lower half, she chose her biggest (but still tiny) bikini bottom, in purple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bra was able to cover her nipples; however, breast flesh was oozing over and under it. Ariel couldn't believe how impressive her cleavage was. As for the bikini bottom, it fitted due to its stretchy fabric but she had to arrange it as a thong because it cutted into her butt cheeks. Now it only bit into her hips. The front was obscured by her bulging gut, and a spongy set of love handles were decoring its sides.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Ariel was brushing her long hair to make it shine, she thought that she didn't look that bad. And it was true : she wasn't that fat, she was just plump and voluptuous. This thought gave her the strenght to go the beach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she arrived there, she didn't need much time to spot her husband, looking handsome and perfectly fit in his dark swimming trunk. She walked sexily to him, each part of her jiggling rhythmically. Eric gave her a very appreciative look, his mouth almost dripping with water at the sight of his love stuffed in her bikini. He hugged her tightly, feeling her softness against him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think this sea shell bra ever looked that good on you.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ariel had been enjoying her day at the beach, all the worrying she had done about her bigger body had been for nothing. There was very few people on the beach today, but those that were there had barely paid any attention to Ariel's weight gain - and Eric seemed to be incredibly pleased that she had chosen to expose herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel headed for a swim, leaving Eric sunbathing on the beach. As she dove into the water, she found that things had changed with regards to her swimming...when she had been a mermaid, she had been at one with the water - moving in and out of the waves like she was a part of them. But with her human legs, and the ammount of weight she had gained, Ariel was herself swimming slowly and awkwardly. Her breasts bobbed above the water, and she enjoyed the sensation of the water splashing up against them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ariel floated around and bobbed about in the water, she spotted some bubbles rising before her, and backed away cautiously. Suddenly, something burst out of the water, a shape Ariel recongised all too well - it was a mermaid, and a familiar one. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ariel!\" the mermaid smiled warmly as she rose from the water and came face to face with Ariel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aquatta?\" Ariel said, confused, but pleased to see an old friend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you haven't left the water completely?\" Aquatta asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I still like to swim, I haven't changed much,\" Ariel replied, realising how ridiculous that sounded considering her appearance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well...erm...yeah...\" Aquatta said awkwardly, looking down at Ariel's big breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel realised it was no good trying to hide it, Aquatta knew she had put on weight. \"I've put on weight, I know,\" she said guiltily. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, I wasn't...I didn't...sorry!\" Aquatta said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fine,\" said Ariel, smiling warmly. \"I don't mind, really. It makes swimming a little harder, but Eric loves my body, and this human food is so addictive and tasty. It's good to know I can eat whatever I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well you look like your enjoying up here Ariel,\" Aquatta said. \"But there's a reason I came to find you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it?\" Ariel asked curiously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just...it's your father's birthday feast this week, and I know your not a mermaid anymore but I thought if you could change back and come to visit him, it would mean the world to him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel considered, was she really ready to take her new chubby body under the sea and show it to her friends and family? Aquatta didn't seem to mind, and it would be rude not to attend her own father's birthday celebration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'll come!\" Ariel smiled. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAquatta grinned happily. \"That's great Ariel! It's three days away, just let me know when your ready and swim out to here, then we'll get you changed back into mermaid form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel and Aquatta said their goodbyes, and Ariel watched as her friend dove beneath the surface of the water and swam away. Ariel moved back to the beach and told Eric she would be going away for a little while. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, I don't mind,\" Eric said pleasently. \"It's your father.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd better lay off the food for a while,\" Ariel said, stroking her belly absent mindedly. \"It's going to be hard to swim with these extra pounds, even with a tail.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater...</span></div></div>",

After all, it was the least thing he could do for his love who gained weight just to please him. When the party will be over, she could still continue to gain if she wanted to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause her weight was going to be stable, at least for now, Ariel decided it was the right time to tell her husband about her need for clothes. She decided to do so while they were lying in their bed after a love making session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eric...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Ariel?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you notice that I was going around naked for the past two weeks?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I miss that? It drives me wild!!\" he said, moving closer against his wife's lush body, her belly and breasts flattening on his muscular chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I like the idea of turning you on by wearing nothing all day, but I kind of have outgrown all my dresses...\" she said, blushing and feeling ashamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How could I haven't thought about that! Tomorrow I am going to bring you the royal tailor, he will make you all the dresses you could dream of!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh thanks Eric, I just can't wait until tomorrow!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey soon fell asleep in each other's arms, with Ariel dreaming of beautiful gowns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day, Eric did as promised and brought the royal tailor to his wife. To make sure he wouldn't look shocked and make Ariel embarrassed, Eric warned him about her recent girth expansion. He promised he could make flattering dresses so she would feel beautiful no matter what. As her husband told her she could buy everything she wanted, she really indulged herself. Some gowns flattered her belly, some hid it with an empire waist and some made it very obvious. They had all a common thing though : they showed a lot of cleavage. Now that she could clothe her body, they will finally give parties again, but not until she came back from her father's one because she didn't want to tempt herself with lot of food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she had all her dresses, Ariel went back to Eric with a dress she ordered just for him. It was a strapless black one which ended to mid-thighs and displayed her full bosom. It was paired with high heels to give even more shape to her full calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I look?\" she asked when they met again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolutely breathtaking...\" he said, looking at his wife with lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel took great pleasure in modeling her new clothes for her husband, and the pleasure was certainly shared. The desire to still fit into her new dresses was an additionnal preasure to not put weight. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of the week passed as the days counted down towards Ariel's Father's birthday celebration. Ariel had suffered through most of the week with an empty stomach, hoping not to put on any additional weight over the course of the week. Although she was growing ever more comfortable with her growing body, Aquatta's reaction to her the other day had made her a little more self conscious - after all, her family and friends under the sea had always seen her body as perfectly slim and beautiful. She had been the prettiest girl in the kingdom - the envy of her sisters...but now she wasn't so sure...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround here, at least she had been able to cover herself up if she was feeling uncomfortable with her figure, but back home she would be practically naked, with the only item of clothing covering her up being a flimsy sea shell bra...which would no doubt draw attention to her bigger breasts. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe morning of the feast, Ariel woke up early and stretched her body out, releasing a long yawn. Another thing she had grown to love on land was her bed, the silk sheets felt delightful against her skin. She saw that Eric was still asleep, and decided not to wake him just yet. She pulled out her purple sea shell bra, and pulled it tight across her large breasts, making sure that her nipples were fully covered. She grabbed a pair of newly purchased panties and slid them on, not bothering with anything else due to the fact that her legs would soon be a tail again anyway. She moved to Eric, and nudged him, so that his eyes groggily opened and he woke up from his slumber. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll see you soon my love,\" Ariel said, kissing her husband on the forehead. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have fun,\" Eric said sleepily. \"You look...\" He didn't have time to finish his sentenace as he quickly fell asleep again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel laughed, and headed out of the castle and down to the beach. At such an early hour, there was nobody around, and she was able to get out of the castle without being spotted in her revealing clothes. As her bare feet touched the warm sand, Ariel spotted Aquatta splashing around above the surface of the water waiting for her. Ariel quickly headed towards her friend, gradually submerging into the water as she grew nearer. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ariel, ready to change back?\" Aquatta asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ready and waiting,\" Ariel replied. \"It'll be weird to lose my legs after all this time...I've gotten used to these dangly things!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAquatta handed Ariel a small golden locket. \"Your father made this for you, from a piece of his trident. As long as you wear it around your neck, you will remain in Mermaid form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, that's handy,\" Ariel said, impressed with the ease with which she could change. She took the locket and placed it around her neck, then began to feel her body change and transform - her legs fused together and moulded into a scaly green fin. It was strange not having human legs after so long, and with her added pounds, Ariel now found that her tail was fatter and wider, nowhere near as slender as it used to be. It was actually a bit of a strain to stay bobbing above the water. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, let's go, everyone's dying to see you!\" Aquatta said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling considerably more excited about this whole thing now, Ariel dove under the water and kicked her tail as fast as she could. She had to admit she was a little out of practise, but she soon picked up her old skills once again, and even with her added weight, she was able to keep up with Aquatta. She had always been a good swimmer, and it felt nice to be under the sea once again, with fish and creatures swimming by and the feel of the waves upon her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, her Father's palace was in sight, glimmering gold and glowing on the horizon. Ariel had forgotten just how amazing it looked, and was looking forward to spending a few days there. They swam towards the palace, passing by many other mer-people, some of whom seemed to recognise and gawk at Ariel. Ariel wasn't sure whether they were shocked she had put on some weight, or if they were just surprised to see her - either way, she tried to ignore them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they headed inside the palace, Ariel spotted her Father, King Triton, waiting for her, overjoyed to see him again, Ariel swam forward as quick as she could and embraced him. King Triton smiled and laughed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dear, it is so good to see you, I am glad you could come!\" The King said warmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't have missed this for the world father!\" Ariel replied. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It looks as though you've been enjoying your human life though hmm?\" Triton laughed warmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel guessed he was referring to her larger body, and went a little red. \"So, when's the birthday feast?\" She asked, trying to change the subject quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Later this evening, I'm a little busy at the moment, but I'm sure there's something around here to do in the meantime!\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Ariel's father had was wrong, there was absolutely nothing to do in the meantime. Her old friend Flounder was away, and wouldn't be here for the feast, and her father, sisters and Sebastian were all too busy preparing for the feast to spend any time with her. Her boredom was made even worse by the consistent rumbling of her stomach - she had not eaten a thing all day, and was desperately craving some human food. As she thought about delicious chocolate cakes, whipped cream and all of the other sweet deliacies she would have been enjoying on land, Ariel decided she would fix herself a snack before the feast. There was only so long she could go without food these days...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSwimming through the busy halls of her old home, Ariel spotted the occasional group of Merfolk staring at her. They seemed to be staring, quite blatantly, at her bulging midsection. A little while ago, Ariel might have been hugely embarassed by this, but she had grown so used to her growing body now that she wasn't even blushing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she neared the end of one rocky grotto-like corridor, Ariel found herself at the doors to the great hall, where the feast was due to take place later. She guessed this would be as good a place as any to locate some food, perhaps one of the chefs could whip her up a snack? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel pushed open the doors and swam on ahead, only to find the room totally empty, with the table already laid full of food. Ariel gently closed the doors behind her, and looked around the room to make sure it was empty. Although she had her worries that digging into this fully prepared feast would be bad manners...she couldn't resist tucking in and getting herself a little snack. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel swam forward, and eyed up the array of food on the table - it was all Merfood, various different types of seaweed served in exotic ways. Ariel would have killed for some human food at this banquet, and for a moment she amused herself with the thought of a cake floating around in the water next to her. Although she didn't find this stuff nearly as appetizing as she used to, she was still dying to eat something, so decided to tuck in to a nearby platter of red seaweed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't quite as tasteless as Ariel had expected, in fact, she was beginning to remember why she used to enjoy eating this kind of food. She began to devour more and more of the platter, which was beginning to look rather empty after a while...but Ariel wasn't feeling full in the least, human food felt so filling and satisfying, and always left her feeling content after a meal - but this seaweed, while tasty, was doing very little to satisfy her hunger. <br>\r\nAs she continued to eat from the platter before her, Ariel looked down and noticed that the once full plate was nearly empty. She was able to grab the last piece of red weed before all she could see was her reflection in the shiny metal. Ariel gasped, she had no idea she was eating so much - she had only come in here for a snack, and had ended up devouring an entire platter...and she still wasn't feeling full!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer stomach gave a low rumble, and she glanced around the room, fearing someone might enter at any moment and see what she had done. But it seemed she was all alone for the time being, so perhaps she could eat a little more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel grabbed at another plate, filled with a purple seaweed, and began to grab handfuls of it and cram it into her mouth. She was so hungry, she didn't really care about her manners anymore, and the quicker she ate, the quicker she would be full and be able to get out of here. But Ariel wasn't getting full, and soon she had eaten another platter of seafood, and moved onto the next. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll her inhibitions seemed to melt away under the rumbling of her stomach, and Ariel only began to care about one thing - satisfying her hunger. She continued to swim to different positions around the table, picking at food and shovelling it into her mouth. Realising she needed a breather, Ariel finally stopped eating and lent against the table, breathing heavily as she stared down at her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer belly was looking extremely bloated, and Ariel was shocked at how big it had become...had she really eaten that much? She didn't even feel full yet, but her stomach was as big and bloated as it normally was after a three course meal on land. She rubbed her hands over her bloated belly and sighed sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why can't I get full?\" She groaned, rubbing her hard, firm belly, which was stuffed with food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, Ariel spotted the table...looking rather empty...she appeared to have eaten nearly half the food that had been laid out. She covered her mouth in shock and stared around at the empty platters, that had once been piled high with food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did I really eat all that?\" She asked herself. \"I have to get out of here before someone finds me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel swam for the door...</span></div></div>",

As she reached for the door, it suddenly swung open, and Ariel gasped in shock as she saw Aquatta standing in the doorway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ariel? What are you-,\" Aquatta started to say, but her eyes quickly fell to Ariel's bulging belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel was blushing red with embarrassment, knowing that she was going to be found out at any moment. She tried to suck in her bloated stomach, but she simply did not have the ability anymore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAquatta was trying to see past Ariel, while Ariel looked down at the floor in shame. Her slim friend swam past her, and stared in shock at the empty plates scattered across the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ariel...\" Aquatta said in shock. \"Did you...eat all this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel swam up to Aquatta, her face still red with embarrassment, her belly jutting out in front of her. \"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!\" Ariel said desperately. \"It's just, being a human now, and coming back down here...the food is so different, I couldn't get full...and I just lost control of myself, before I knew it I'd eaten everything in the room!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTears fell from Ariel's eyes, and Aquatta placed a comforting hand on her friend's shoulder. \"There there Ariel,\" she said. \"It's not your fault, I'm sure you're father will understand!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone will think I'm such a greedy pig!\" Ariel sobbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure we can think of something to save you from the embarrassment, after all, this was only the first course...we'll just skip it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel wiped her eyes, suddenly feeling better. \"Just the first course? Do you think Daddy will mind?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAquatta shook her head. \"He isn't even involved in this part of the celebration, I'll just talk to Sebastian and we'll pretend this course never existed, it'll be okay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel smiled, and hugged her friend, her larger body squeezed against Aquatta's, who flinched slightly, looking as though she was being squeezed a bit too much. Ariel let go of her, and giggled slightly. Aquatta smiled and swam away, and Ariel decided it would be best to avoid temptation and return to her room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater that day, the feast was about to begin, Ariel's sisters and friends were all gathered around the table in the great hall. Ariel, not wanting to draw attention to herself, had arrived at the feast early and taken her seat. Her stomach, which had been extremely bloated, had now shrunk down in size, although she was still feeling a little stuffed after her gorging earlier. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKing Triton entered the room with Sebastian, who had prepared a musical number in honour of the King's birthday, as well as dancers and various other celebrations. After everyone wished the King a happy birthday, they sat down to eat... </span></div></div>",

She could see her sisters, still very slim, and about half her current size, eating smaller amounts than she was having now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>How can they be satisfied with such tiny portions?</i> Ariel thought. <i>Oh forget it, I'm just going to eat what I want!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel reached for another bowl and began to pile more food onto her plate. Aquatta, who was sitting besides her, gave Ariel a worried look. \"Ariel, don't overdo it...\" Aquatta whispered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel took a large bite and gulped down a satisfying amount of food. \"Mmm...what? Oh, no I won't...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAquatta looked worried, as Ariel began to pile more and more onto her plate. As the food earlier had only been a starter, this main course was a lot more filling, and Ariel was enjoying it a lot more. She suddenly began to realise why she used to enjoy eating food like this, and before she knew it, she was on her third helping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel was oblivious to the fact that her sisters had begun to pick up on her eating habits - some of them were staring at her as she hungrily gobbled up everything on her plate. Some of them began to exchange snide comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Living on the surface certainly seems to have increased your appetite...\" One of them said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll say...a Princess of the Sea would never let herself go like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel looked up from her plate and glared across the table at her sisters. \"At least I've been lucky enough to fall in love with a man who doesn't just care about appearances,\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer sisters looked away and carried one eating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That shut them up,\" Aquatta smirked. \"Ignore them Ariel, they were always jealous of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel smiled and carried on eating, but she had to admit that her sisters comments had gotten to her a little. She absent mindedly began to put more food onto her plate, gobbling it down quickly and trying to forget about what her sisters had said. She felt good about her body, and Eric loved it, being thin was overrated anyway. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, a loud belch escaped Ariel's mouth. It even shocked her, and she raised her hand to cover her mouth, \"Oh, excuse me!\" She said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of her sisters exchanged disgusted looks, Aquatta looked awkward, and King Triton simply laughed. Ariel felt a little embarrassed, clearly she was getting a little gassy...she wanted to avoid any looks she was getting, so began eating again, shovelling more and more onto her plate and clearing many of the bowls in front of her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout warning, another belch escaped Ariel's mouth, but this time, she didn't bother excusing herself, in fact, she barely noticed, she was becoming fixated on filling her bulging belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ariel...\" Aquatta whispered. \"Aren't you full yet? You've cleared this part of the table...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I...I have?\" Startled, Ariel looked up and saw that what Aquatta had said was true, she had eaten far more than she had intended to. \"Oops...well, I'm pretty full now anyway...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, it's time for dessert now anyway,\" Aquatta said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dessert?\" Ariel was hoping there would be another course, as she wasn't quite full up yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the servants cleared away the table and brought in the rich looking dessert, Ariel absent mindedly rubbed her pot belly, craving the dessert. A large bowl full of dessert was placed in front of Ariel, and she quickly dug in, shovelling food into her mouth from the bowl with the spoon, getting bits of food around her mouth in her hurry to satisfy her ravenous appetite. Within a matter of moments, she had finished, and finally felt satisfied. While everyone else was still eating, she lay back and rubbed her large, bloated belly. She released another loud belch, and wiped the mess from around her mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned slightly in pleasure as she caressed her full stomach.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A strange thought came into Eric's head as he pondered over a solution to Ariel's dilemma, and as the words left his mouth, he couldn't help but be surprised that he even said it: \"Why not just go naked?\"  The prince blushed and hurriedly clamped his hands over his mouth, absolutely dreading Ariel's reaction.  'No, no, no!' he thought.  'Why did I let such an insane suggestion slip like that?!'  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo his infinite surprise, though, it appeared as though his pudgy lover was <i>not</i> utterly outraged at his idea, as he had been expecting.  Rather, she had placed one hand on her flabby chin and appeared deep in thought.  While her old, skinny self would have most definitely balked at the prospect of giving up on clothes and exhibiting her body everywhere, the last few weeks of nude stuffing and fattening had had quite an effect on her judgment.  Something about all the time she'd spent without clothes, enjoying the feeling of her fat body growing as she ate everything she wanted, coupled with Eric's newfound love and appreciation for her form, had caused a change in the former mermaid.  She now felt somehow...<i>confident</i> about her new self.  It would be a somewhat rough transition, for sure, but as long as she had her food and Eric's support to fall back on, she might just make it...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Ariel was finally able to muster her response, the already surprised Eric was even more taken aback by what it was: \"Well...\" stammered Ariel, touching the tips of her thick little fingers together nervously, \"Yes-- I'll do it.  Or, I mean...I'll <i>try</i>, at least...I might wanna ease into things before actually going out in public naked, but all your encouragement over these past few weeks makes me want to give it a shot.  If not for me, then for you!\"  She finished off her answer with a smile, posing with her arms held together in such a way as to show off her generous cleavage.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo say that Eric was ecstatic would have been an understatement...and over the next few weeks, he delivered on his promise, supporting his beloved wife all the way as she gradually grew accustomed to life without clothes.  She started small, venturing further away from her designated quarters and allowing the various servants to see her exposed form; their responses were about what one would expect, but Eric quickly dissuaded them with a hurried explanation.  They were no less confused, but preferred not to question their lord's orders.  All the while, the young princess continued to gorge herself on every bit of scrumptious food she could get her hands on, growing bigger and flabbier with each feast.  Her already huge belly bloated out nearly two feet in front of her, and sagged down past even her knees, while her enormous breasts grew larger as well, resting heavily atop her shelf of belly rolls.  What was once the beginnings of a double chin on her face now amounted to nearly three, and a set of even chubbier cheeks contributed to a pleasingly round visage.  And last but not least, her butt had reached such a size as to lift her up off of any surface she sat on.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel's continued growth, surprisingly, had only increased her confidence; she was now even beginning to contemplate leaving the castle entirely and showing her new self to the world!  \"Why hide such a beautiful body,\" she thought; Eric certainly seemed more than happy with it.  And she would only get bigger and more beautiful the more she ate...by now, any thoughts of clothes had essentially vanished from her mind.  Of course, by this point, not even her biggest dress or skimpiest bikini would fit her, a fact that she actually took a measure of pride in...</span></div></div>",

Ariel was happy thinking about them seeing the new her. The possibility of them not reacting well to her expanded form (and it being shown naked) didn't even cross her mind, since her confidence was increasing more and more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe day of the ball finally came up, and Ariel was getting ready. To show how much her weight gain wasn't a result of her letting herself go, she pampered herself all day. Her red hair were curled into opulent ringlets, cascading on her pudgy shoulders and back. She applied make up with exquisite taste, and applied a slightly shimmery cream all over her body, making it look all silky and soft, which it was. Finally, she put some jewellery on her, a lot more than she was used to when she wore clothes but not too much it looked tacky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe went to wait the guests with Eric, who was so proud of her, especially since she wasn't anxious at all. The first people entered and they had an hard time not staring at their huge princess, or not gasping at this sight. Since they were all etiquette buffs, they quickly snapped out of their confusion and acted like nothing was weird at all, even though they couldn't believe how Ariel looked. But who were they to judge their royalty?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDuring the ball, Eric kept looking at Ariel like she was the most gorgeous thing in the world (which, in his mind, she was), and women started to notice this fact. Ariel was always a trendsetter and they used to dream about marrying Eric, so they wondered if being fat was the way to go now. Soon enough, they ate a bigger part of the buffet they thought they would, much to the men's amazement. They surprisingly found themself attracted somehow to their princess, especially since her confidence was very attractive.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Young children put pillows under their shirts to try and emulate Princess Ariel's fat belly while their mothers and sisters did what they could to try and make up the weight gap. Thin was out and fat was the new fab. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking class mothers gorged themselves on cheap but highly fattening treats absolutely loaded with processed sugar while the richer ladies stuffed themselves silly with expensive honey and fatty foi gras. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few people chose to go skinny in defiance of the trend, but for the most part Princess Ariel had no problems. As long as her kingdom prospered and Prince Eric kept on stuffing her gorgeous and expanding face she was happy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurrently, Ariel was sitting nude on the balcony of a rather nice but tasteful villa. The sunlight glistened off her pale, milky body. Healing lotoins kept away the stretch marks and constant gluttony and pampering had done the rest. A fattened bottom needed two chairs to sit in. Engorged happy belly spread out and reached to Ariel's knees as she sat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breasts were larger than before but they looked tiny on her massive frame. Double and second chins were driving Eric wild, who was just bringing in about a hundred more chocolate eclairs for his wife. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown in the street, a baker woman's desert was selling like crazy. The baker woman herself was looking a little plush; her normally lose outfit was tight in the middle and there was powdered sugar dusted across her ample cleavage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a team of couriers, a noblewoman walked by nearly nude. Most women still weren't brave enough to try and go full birthday suit. All she had to wear were nipple caps and an ultra tight g-string. The noblewoman's once heart shaped ass was widening and a potbelly shook with every step. Absentmindedly she munched on a chain of sausages (maybe she wasn't much of a snob?) which would never see home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt a local school, the plump girl that always kept to herself was now the center of attention. She really didn't want the attention though it was nice to be able to gorge and gorge and gorge. The studious fat girl took another bite of her lunch, a button busting off her midriff. The other popular girls watched with envy, they were only beginning to soften up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp on the villa balcony, Eric was starting to massage Ariel with lotions as she ate. The action was most . . . arousing. Ariel felt pleasure wherever Eric touched; he had the magic hands. It seemed like her hunger was never ending, and even her hunger for food couldn't match her hunger for Eric, sculpted manly man he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDropping the donut she had, Ariel grabbed Eric with an aggressive kiss. Eric didn't even resist as his obese three hundred pound wife rolled on top of him and started to kiss him in a way most men and women could only dream about. </span></div></div>",

Some females even looked at her enviously, before sighing when they looked down on their own new pot belly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Aurora saw Ariel, she was stunned by how huge her friend had gotten.

After gathering a pile of the fish food, she lay on a rock, looked around and then started eating and eating. She chomped down hard and fast as if the mermaid had not eaten in days. Eventually after about 20 minutes, Ariel had finished her meal, curled her body around the rock and sighed. \"Ahh, I'm so full!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Ariel's focus transferred to the immense amount of pressure coming from her bra. She looked down and saw that her boobs and even her stomach had grown once again and she had gained 2 pounds. It was obvious to her she would. After all, she did just eat a portion of seaweed capable of feeding a group of 5 grown fish folk. \"Oh goodness...\" she moaned sitting up then cupping her bra. Her boobs strained against her bra as since becoming human, she had gained a cup size, now grown to a full C cup. Ariel sighed as she saw the layers of fat forming \"Eric was right. I think I need to go home and tell Eric the truth\" She kicked her tail and swam in the distance of her home as fast as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe red haired mermaid surfaced a short distance away from the castle but from that far and at that late at night, she could not see the castle. In fact, she could not much of anything at all. After diving down and swimming straight ahead in the right direction, she ended up swimming into a net. Ariel was immediately tangled and no matter how much she tried, she was not able to pull free. She felt the ropes get tighter and tighter, twisting around her body. Eventually the ropes pulled and Ariel was being dragged along with it. She surfaced and the mermaid landed with a thud on the decks of a large wooden ship. A pirate ship that contained many food barrels and it was home to around 20 pirates who closed in on her. Ariel needed to make herself human and fast but when she reached her neck, she realised it was gone.</span></div></div>",

I had turned the book from a 'skinny book' to a thin one, but I was to late. She had turned the page and the book sucked all her life out. Ursula however turned the book's page one more time and that's when the book turned her 3 times her size.\"<br>\r\n       The king sighed. \"I blamed Ursula for Star's death and she blamed me for her gain in weight.

They both looked so much like star it made him happy. He liked it to see how they enjoyed it too be fat. Something star never did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just you two... Be careful with the book. And try to keep the book a secret. Besides we don't knew were the book came from.

Scales leaded to a smooth pale skin and feet formed. Soon, the ex-mermaid was the proud owner of a pair of long, lean legs and a small rounded butt. She was a human, truly perfect and stunning, and she was already picturing herself seducing Eric with her trim body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her daydreaming brutally ended when she felt a strange sensation running inside her. She remembered : she was cursed to become chubby. Ariel wanted to cry as she saw herself expanding. Her stomach, usually flat, bloated outward : creating a little curve at the beginning, it then turned into a full potbelly, with a deeper navel. Her incredibly thin waist thickened as well, along with a generous set of love handles. Her breasts were getting soft, and her sea shells bra broke under their weight, allowing them to droop a bit over her hanging gut. Her arms were coated with a layer of fat, leaving them bulky and flabby. Her cheekbones were hidded by puffy cheeks and her normally sharp jaw was replaced by a faint double chin. Her newly acquired legs and butt also faced changes : her butt widened, her hips were larger, her thighs grew to meet each others, becoming meaty and inviting, along with fatter calves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel, stroked her fattened attributes, looking terrified by her new body. This made Ursula laughs a lot, and she sent her on the beach.

Growing up Eric always had a fondness for larger women. Yet his regal upbringing meant that he could only date women with the appropriate size for the royal life. Years went by and Eric went on date after date with hundreds of different women who claimed to be princess material but he could never find one he believed he could fall in love with. He was convinced that he would never find someone who would be as big as he wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYet he had found a silver lining with his discovery of Ariel. He had no idea what to do or what to say, his body was shaking from excitement and he couldn't keep up with his own thoughts. Finally he was able to get his mind together and started to walk over to Ariel. She watched as he slowly walked over to her, she quickly turned around and buried her face into her knees. Her face began to turn bright red from embarrassment; this is nowhere near the way she wanted to introduce herself to Eric. Instead of him meeting a beautiful thin mermaid he was meeting a fat manatee. With her face still in her knees Ariel tried to think of a way to get out of this embarrassing situation, but before she could do anything she felt a hand being placed on her shoulder. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't need to be afraid, I won't hurt you\" Eric said in a calm voice. She slowly turned around and gave him a small smile; he smiled and walked in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Eric, what is your name?\" he asked. Ariel tried to speak but nothing came out she covered her mouth as she remembered that Ursula's spell also took away her voice. She quickly used her hands to write her name in the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So your name is Ariel, and by the way you are acting I can only guess you have lost your voice\" Eric said as Ariel nodded in agreement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you have anywhere to stay?\" Eric asked as Ariel frowned and moved her head from side to side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then I guess you will have to stay with me\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAriel couldn't believe what she was hearing things were not as bad as it seemed. She tried to stand up but her new legs and her extra weight made it a challenge, she struggled to get up but she had never used legs before. Eric looked over and saw her in distress and rushed over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need some help?\" he asked as Ariel nodded with a helpless look on her face. He walked behind Ariel and wrapped his arms around her waist, as she tried to stand up he started to lift her. As she slowly rose up his hands sunk into the soft flesh on her stomach which added to his excitement. As she stood up and feel into his arms causing the both of them to blush. When she was up he helped her learn how to use her legs, as well as admired her body as it jiggled with each step. When she had gotten used to walking on her legs Eric wrapped a large sail around her which just barley fit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should get going now Ariel it's getting late\" he said taking her arm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait if I bring Ariel through the front door I know Grimsby is going to nag and maybe even throw her out\" Eric thought to him self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could sneak her in through my window but with her size it might be a tight squeeze\" he added <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some thought Eric finally decided to.......... <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They'll recognize you and we will need to go back to your home...\"<br>\r\n\"You can't force me to get fat if I don't want to!\"<br>\r\n\"...Maybe I can.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Aladdin quickly rubbed Genie's lamp, and he appeared in front of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey buddy!\" Genie said.<br>\r\n\"I need you to tie Jasmine up so she won't be able to resist!\"<br>\r\n\"Wow, I didn't know that side of your sex...\"<br>\r\n\"It's not that : I need to force-feed her so she will grow fat!\" Aladdin said before Genie could finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine was watching them with fear. She couldn't think of something to do...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you crazy?! You want a fat chick?!\" Genie said. He then turned himself into a 10 pounds heavier Jasmine, with a little belly. \"Does this make me look fat?\" he said, taking a feminine voice and grabbing his love handle before turning himself back to normal. That made Aladdin laughs a lot, but not Jasmine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, it's because we need to go undercover but Jasmine is way too thin to pass as a regular citizen!\"<br>\r\n\"That explains everything!\" Genie said and, doing as his master wanted, tied Jasmine. He then made appear a small feast that surely would fill her up, before returning into his lamp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin hurried himself to stuff Jasmine because he didn't want her to feel that she was already full. Her trim abs were soon replaced by a pregnant-sized hanging belly. It was very hard, as it was packed with food, and perfectly round. Jasmine was very horrified by it, but she didn't have the choice and she continued to eat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNear the end of the feast, she had enough : her tummy was really hurting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aladdin, pleeeease, I can't stand it anymore, I think I'm going to burst!\"<br>\r\n\"Maybe this will ease your pain!\" he said. He took her full middle with both hands, and began to massage it. Jasmine couldn't help but be aroused by the sensation of her stuffed stomach being rubbed by the strong hands of her lover. Nipples erected, she urged him to continue and it was now possible for Aladdin to make her eat the remaining food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter her first binge, Jasmine quickly fell asleep in Aladdin's arms, food following her in her dreams...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Aladdin worried that all this talk of weight gain might have scared her off, and he hoped he hadn't worried her with his plan. Aladdin climbed out of the bed and pulled on his baggy white pants and purple tank top, then headed into the next room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jasmine?\" He called. \"Hey Jasmine, are you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin listened closely, and heard some muffled noises coming from the next room. He hurried inside, and found Jasmine, clothed in her usual blue green outfit, hunched over a table creaking under the weight of an enormous ammount of delicious looking food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...Jasmine?\" Aladdin said as he approached. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine turned around, and wiped the crumbs from her mouth, smiling broadly as Aladdin walked up to her. \"It's about time you got up,\" Jasmine said. \"I thought I'd start my binge a little early...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin smiled, but was secretly rather confused. Was she enjoying this now? Perhaps that belly massage he had given her last night had made her think twice about gaining weight. But could she really have enjoyed it that much?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you didn't want to put on weight?\" Aladdin said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine picked up a turkey leg and bit into it. \"I didn't...until you gave me that massage last night...the feel of your hands over my bloated belly was amazing...and I want that again...even if I do gain a few extra pounds in the process.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin smiled, and glanced underneath the table, where he saw Jasmines usually trim abs had bloated out into a pregnant looking ball. Jasmine didn't notice him staring at her growing gut, and continued to tuck in to the food. Aladdin found himself becoming incredibly turned on by the sight of his lover's swollen stomach...pushing and straining against her satin pants. He was actually surprised that her slim petite body could hold so much food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine belched, and leaned back in her chair, looking down at Aladdin knowingly and smiling sexily. \"Time to give me a rub...\" she said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin didn't have to be told twice, he knelt before Jasmine, and grabbed the sides of her belly, which was taught with food, and felt incredibly hard and full beneath his fingers. He squeezed at her bloated belly, and she groaned in pleasure as the pain of her overstuffed gut was eased.</span></div></div>",

He continued to rub Jasmine's overstuffed stomach, until he felt something strange underneath his fingers...it felt as though her stomach was bulging and bloating even more, but she hadn't eaten another bite since the start of the belly massage. He suddenly stopped his massage and felt her belly, a curious expression covering his face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine realised he had stopped and looked down at him curiously. \"What is it? Why did you stop?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think...I think your belly is getting bigger...\" Aladdin said, and he could actually feel Jasmine's stomach rising underneath his fingers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's ridiculous,\" Jasmine shrugged. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine inched herself forward in her chair so she could get a better look at her stomach. Aladdin continued to feel the bloated ball in his hands, his expression one of sheer confusion and surprise. \"I'm telling you Jasmine! I can feel your belly getting bigger!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine started to look worried. \"You mean I'm getting even <i>more</i> bloated?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin's mouth dropped open in shock, as, suddenly, he could see Jasmine's belly growing larger before his eyes. He hadn't imagined it, she was getting fatter by the second! Jasmine looked down at her bulging belly and gasped in amazement. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening to me?!\" Jasmine screamed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin lifted his hands off of Jasmine's belly as it continued to push out towards him, in a matter of seconds, Jasmine had gone from looking slightly bloated to looking as though she was nine months pregnant, her belly pushed out and hung down over her satin pants, growing larger, rounder and flabbier. Aladdin saw that Jasmine was looking rather upset about her newfound pot belly, but he had to admit that he was really enjoying this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin saw that it wasn't just Jasmine's belly that was growing, as he looked up at her, he could see her breasts had grown considerably along with her stomach - they were bulging and threatening to burst out of her top. Aladdin felt himself become even more turned on, as he began to hear ripping noises. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no! What's going on? Aladdin! Help me!\" Jasmine squealed, grabbing hold of her flabby belly and trying desperately to force it back to it's former slim shape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine's efforts were in vain, her belly continued to grow, and her breasts went up another cup size as her outfit tightened across her chest. Her green satin pants were tightening as well, as her ass began to swell and her legs thickened, her arms also began to gain some extra weight, going from slim to chunky before Aladdin's lustful eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah...\" Aladdin gasped as he gazed upon his lover's expanding form. \"How much did you eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not <i>this</i> much!\" Jasmine groaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin had to back away slightly to get a better look at Jasmine, his eyes dropped to her steadily growing breasts, and he watched in amazement as they shook and grew. Jasmine's top was stretching to it's limits, her belly had bulged out so far that it was now resting on her lap, and her ass had caused tears all over her pants. However, her growth seemed to have stopped. Aladdin was secretly a little disappointed, he was kind of hoping that she would keep going until her clothes ripped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wh...what happened?\" Jasmine gasped, looking down over her chubby new body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, there was a poof of air, and the Genie appeared before them. \"Oh...\" he looked over at Jasmine and grinned. \"It worked! Thought your old pal Genie might help speed up the whole fattening process so I enchanted the food!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You enchanted the food?!\" Jasmine shouted angrily. \"Look at me! I'm a blimp!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but you and Al's plan will work now!\" Genie said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin decided to speak up in defence of Genie. \"Well uh...he's right Jasmine, I mean, you were going to put on weight anyway...weren't you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine turned red with anger. \"I never wanted to blow up like a balloon, I'm enormous!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah well, you can't please everyone, good luck Al...\" Genie muttered, then disappeared in a poof of smoke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAladdin stared at the angry Jasmine and held his arms open. \"Come on Jasmine, you really don't look that bad, and now we can get away from here!\"</span></div></div>",

Oh well, I guess any clothing will look small on me now, and dressed like that, they won't recognize me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe removed her torn outfit, and explored her new self. As much as she hated her bloated form, she had to admit that she was looking very good for a chubby girl, and she was definitly plus size model material. Her skin was smooth, and every part of her was firm, yet soft at the same time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine began to dress herself. First, there was a small pink satin bra, which squeezed her already big breasts into an impressive cleavage. Then, a pair of harem pants made with the same pink fabric. She was amazed at how her butt and thighs filled a kind of pants that were usually loose on her. Her pregnant-looking belly was left bare and for all to see. A pair of pink slippers completed the outfit. To complete the transformation, she undid her braid, letting her long black hair wave around her slightly fuller face. Being plump didn't kill her desire to look good for Aladdin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe left the room to meet Aladdin outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, how do I look?\" she asked, posing in a seductive way in front of her lover. His facial expression, full of lust and desire, didn't make an answer necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Jas, you are...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no need for words, Al.\" she smiled. \"For now, we should...</span></div></div>",

She enjoyed relaxing in the morning, so she stayed in bed, half asleep, with her eyes closed. She usually felt pretty active in the mornings and could get straight up, but she didn\u2019t have it in her this time. She felt sluggish and\u2026she couldn\u2019t put her finger on it. She felt different, that was for sure, but she didn\u2019t know why. Not only was she feeling uncomfortable herself but her underwear was feeling uncomfortable too! There was no helping it; she would have to get up. If she wanted to later, she could always go back to bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly she opened her eyes and was rewarded by a face full of shining light. Her temporary lack of eyesight caused her to roll over so she was on her front. Now she really felt weird. It was as if there was more of her\u2026<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill facing away from the evil source of the light, the huge bay window, she slid out of bed and lay on the floor. Strangely, it felt more comfortable than she had expected. Almost as if she was laying on something soft. For the final time she rolled onto her back and sat up, but found she couldn\u2019t quite make it, as something was in the way. She must have dragged some of the duvet down with her. She tried again, opened her eyes and screamed. She found what was stopping her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn\u2019t part of the duvet or a pillow or something, but instead her own body. She couldn't help but scream at this realization. Her belly and her breasts, to be precise. Her breasts looked a few sizes bigger and after frantically battling to get past them she saw her stomach. It was now a bigger belly. She stood up with some difficulty, and almost ran to the full-length mirror on her wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first thing she did when she got to it was take off her underwear. She now knew why they were so uncomfortable. Her usual size was much too small! As soon as she managed to get the tight garments off she examined her body critically. Her whole body looked softer and generally fatter. Looking at herself, Jasmine felt as if her old body was trapped in a shell of fat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started with her face. It was puffier. You would be able to tell, just by looking at her face, that she had gained weight. She had the same deep eyes except there were puffier, rounder cheeks just underneath. There was no longer any sign of cheekbones and her lips even looked fuller. Her chin now had a friend appearing as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer neck was thicker and her arms no longer had any sign of muscle and looked soft to the touch. They were a lot softer to what she was accustomed to. Her breasts were larger, as mentioned earlier, although she would have welcomed this change in normal circumstances apart from the fact that they had started to rest on her belly. Her large, soft, round new belly. She could have cried when she looked at it in the mirror. It had grown outwards and looked like it would start to sink towards her feet with a little more size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompared to her old, flat, toned stomach it looked massive although it wasn\u2019t as big as she felt it was. She poked right into the middle of it with a now-chubby finger and it sunk through the soft, warm, plush-like fat. She then grabbed her belly with both hands and shook. She felt every single roll of fat quiver and was sickened as it continued to wobble like jelly even after she had let go of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, she eyed love-handles and a larger, much thicker waist. She also had wider hip bones and soft thighs that now met in the middle. She would find it hard to walk normally now without waddling. Her butt was now formed from two enormous globes of plush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn\u2019t quite as big as she thought she was, but to a girl who had one from incredibly slim to slightly overweight overnight. She started to sob and stepped backwards a few steps. She then sat on the floor, feeling her butt spread out underneath her, the fat acting like a cushion. She knew the next thing she would need to do but dreaded it. She walked towards the bathroom and her breasts, belly and butt bounded around with each step she took.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe got to the bathroom and stepped on her scales. The output changed to 160 pounds. All at once she felt every ounce of fat on her body and wondered how on earth she had gained 50 pounds in one night. She started to feel dizzy as the realization started to dawn on her. She needed to regain her old figure, but how? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if the situation wasn't horrible enough, she never felt that hungry in her whole life! She managed to cover herself with her ample bathrobe to get something to eat when someone, alerted by her previous scream, knocked at her door. It was...</span></div></div>",

All the pounds she gained seemed to go straight to her breasts and butt, creating a perfect hourglass, helped by enlarged hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine never failed to have all the men's attention, but now it was ridiculous : everywhere she went, they followed, watching her bubblebutt wobble. Her harem pants were now stretched to their limit in this area, highlighting its size. One guard even dared to grab one of her butt cheeks once. He was fired right away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObviously, her breasts were also making all the men drool. Kitchen staff's members were competing to bring her meals only to catch glimpses of her deep cleavages, enhanced by her tight little bra shirt and her flat, toned stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone had to agree, Aladdin was the luckiest man in the kingdom. He loved Jasmine deeply, not because of her appearance, but he couldn't help himself : he was very turned on by her feminine curves. Sometimes, it was even hard for him to look her in the eyes, as her perky cantaloup-sized breasts were hypnotizing him. When she noticed it, Jasmine was sad. She wasn't vain, yet she liked all this attention. However, it could really got on her nerves because it made her feel like she only had her good looks. At times, she even whished she wasn't so hot, so they would leave her alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sultan was still a bit disappointed, as he would like his daughter to get some fat in other areas, like a belly, chunky thighs or a double chin. She didn't get any of those... yet. Today, her tummy didn't seem as flat as before : she looked like some pudge was gattering under her navel, creating some softness. Was he dreaming or was it the reality?</span></div></div>",

Aladin rubed the lamp. Jinny apeared, yet having put on a cooks clothes. \"What's up Al?\" \"Our princess here feels a little hungry\", replied Aladin. Within a second, Jasmin was sitting on a chair, her big breasts resting on a table. \"Today we would like to recomend chips, and brugers, and... by the way, do we know what this is? Anyway\", said Jinny, throwing all kinds of fast food on the table. \"What's that?\", asked Jasmin. \"Very delicious, you should taste\", said Jinny, his mouth full of a burger. So Jasmin took the first bite, and she teally liked the taste. She wanted more, and started to dig in. Because the table was magic, it was always creating new chips and burgers, if there was some new space. After a few minutes of eating like mad, Jasmins belly had gotten really big again, and after about an hour, she was unable to reach the food. So she asked: \"Could you please feed me, sweety.\" Shhe looked at Aladin with those eyes, no man could resist, so he started putting the food into her mouth, slowly feeling her belly getting bigger. He kept feeding her on and on, until she finally sreamed: \"Ah, I can't keep this pain anymore.

Again her boobs, hips and ass had grown, leaving the rest of her body as it ever was. Her top had been giving in, as it lay under her in pieces, and when she moved, she could hear sound from her pants, telling that they also were about to rip off. Her boobs were now so big, that they reached down into her  lab, while she was siting on the edge of her bed, and her hips must have been so wide, that one could see all of her curves, cause her pants were stretched to the limit by her skin.

Aladin, who still was really turned on by the princess' constant growth asked: \"Would you like to eat something, sweety?\" But Jasmin felt like she had been eating enough for an entire month this day, so she decided, it would be fun, to go down into town. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Aladdin smiled, savoring the moment, very turned on by this. He eventually pulled away because he had to go get ready, but did so reluctantly. As Aladdin left, Jasmine began to feel hunger pains, and asked Aladdin if she eat could some of the food from last night. He agreed enthusiastically, rubbing the lamp and telling the genie this. Suddenly, a lot of breakfast food appeared on the table in her room and Jasmine started to eat slowly. She wasn't that hungry, but her stomach told her otherwise, as she was getting hunger pains. She began to eat a little faster, and soon her belly was starting to bloat outwards. She ate a little bit more until her stomach started to hurt, and then she fell to the floor, already asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJasmine awoke to the sound of Aladdin entering the room. He gasped loudly, seeing Jasmine. \"Oh my gosh! How much breakfast did you eat?\"<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked, getting up. She wobbled a bit, so she grabbed the chair to support her and looked at her new, bigger body. She was all-out naked, and Aladdin looked at her with deep lust in his eyes. Jasmine's breasts were about as big and round as two overinflated yoga balls. Her stomach had shrunk down to its original flatness, but her sides just below her shoulders had expanded outward to support her even bigger breasts.  Her hips curved outward at a nearly diagonal figure as her butt had grown into an even bigger and rounder half circle, with each butt cheek the same size as her breasts. Her breasts and butt looked totally out of proportion with the rest of her body, which made her hunch over at an odd angle. The only upside was that her hair had grown slightly longer, almost touching her giant butt, and was thicker, fuller and sexier looking. She tried to stand up straight, but she ended up falling to the floor.<br>\r\n\u201cAladdin, don\u2019t just stand there staring, help me!\u201d Jasmine said impatiently. <br>\r\n\u201cOh right, sorry.\u201d Aladdin said, still unable to quit staring as he rubbed his lamp. \u201cI wish that Jasmine's body becomes more proportionate!\"</span></div></div>",

The extra flab never bothered her however : it always had been a part of her, and clutching her plump stomach at night was quite comforting to her. It never bothered her father either, until the day when she turned 12, and he realized that soon, he would need to find suitors for Jasmine, and a lot of them would probably be turned off by the princess' ample form. As much as it pained him to deny his daughter's greatest pleasure in life, he needed to act, and fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat down with Jasmine, and explained her that, from now on, deserts and sweets would be forbidden, and that she would need to eat reduced portions of healthy food. Facing her saddened expression, he promised her that, as soon as she would be married off to a prince, she would be able to eat anything and everything she'll want. Through her tears, Jasmine managed a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first, it wasn't easy on the princess and the Sultan. On many occasion, her servants found hidden stashes of candies in the room, and those were taken away from her. Slowly but surely, though, she managed to stick to the imposed meal plan. Through dieting, and with puberty kicking in, the extra pounds fell of her, and Jasmine was left with a flawless figure, sought after by suitors from all the realms, and the envy of all the women.

The preparations for the wedding even began on the spot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the first things Snow White had to do was getting a fitting for her new dresses, especially for her wedding gown. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding only in her underwears, she was getting her measurements taken by an old little seamstress, who was babbling endlessly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Our kingdom is so lucky our prince chose a girl as beautiful and kind as you!\" she exclaimed, as she liked her new princess a lot. When she wrapped her tape around Snow's middle, she could help but make a remark about it's growth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsk tsk tsk, better be careful about that little tummy! I'm going to make you some corsets, and an extra sturdy one for your wedding : it won't give you back your tiny waist (it was well known accross other kingdoms as well) but it's going to make you look slimmer.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, the seamstress left the room, leaving a very speechless Snow White behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Was she really talking about me? I mean, I never had a belly before! I must have a look at my body.\" she thought, as she walked to the nearest mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she saw her reflection, Snow didn't scream or gasp : she wasn't vain, she knew that she would always be beautiful in her own way and that she would be loved by her friends and her prince no matter how she weighted. However, she didn't understand how she could have gained that weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Snow wasn't fat, and she was just crossing the lines of \"normal weight\" to join the \"chubby\" category, which was a shock as she was always skinny. Her breasts were now B cups and she couldn't help but giggle a little when she cupped them, feeling their weight, especially since her breats were barely there before. Her arms, legs and thighs were almost the same size as before, although they acquired some fat on them, becoming smooth and soft to the touch. Turning around, Snow noticed that her butt was a little rounder and bouncier, and she was sure that her prince would feel lust over that cute bubble butt of hers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the biggest change was, of course, her tummy. It wasn't even that big, just a beggining of a potbelly, but it was a huge difference as she was used to have a very flat stomach and the most tiny waist ever. Mesmerized by its sight, Snow White placed a hand on it and moved it to feel the curve of her tummy. The skin was firm but when she poked it, she felt how soft her belly really was. She liked the feeling of being touched, caressed, poked in her fattened middle that she couldn't wait for her prince to do it for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, she decided that the new weight suited her, especially since it added to her youthful and innocent look. Even when slim, her face was always cherubic and cute : her body was just a better match with it now.</span></div></div>",

When she will be older, she would marry Prince Phillip, King Hubert's son. At her christening, the good fairies Flora, Fauna and Merryweather arrive to bless her. Flora gives her the gift of beauty while Fauna gives her the gift of song. But before Merryweather could give her blessing, Maleficent appears on the scene, expressing disappointment in not being invited to Aurora's christening ceremony and curses the princess to die when she touches a spinning wheel's spindle before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday. Fortunately, Merryweather's blessing weakens the curse so that instead of dying, Aurora, would only fall deeply asleep until she receives a true love's kiss. Though King Stefan decreed all spinning wheels in the kingdom burned, the three good fairies knew Maleficent couldn't be stopped that easily and took Aurora away to a woodland cottage until her sixteen birthday lapses, passing themselves off as her aunts and swearing off magic to conceal themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlora, Fauna and Merryweather, being the doting godmothers that they were, had a tendency to spoil Aurora, renamed Briar Rose, with delicious sweet and fattening food. As it turned out, our princess had quite the appetite, and became a chubby little girl.

As she slowly opened them, she saw her husband Prince Philip looking over at her lovingly with a smile gently patting her pot belly. His patting her potbelly caused it to jiggle a little. This caused her to blush a little as she was still embarased about her belly but she had to admit that Philip's patting it and the subsuquent jiggle felt very nice. \"Good morning handsome\" she replied in a soft and sweet tone. \"Good morning beautiful. Did you sleep well?\" Philip asked her. \"I had a little trouble at first but eventaully I feel asleep\" Aurora replied. She then gasped as she noticed her belly looked bigger then yesterday. \"Oh my god! My belly is even bigger\" she said. \"Yes, I know Aurora. You were moaning in your sleep last night about how you were so hungry that I fed you the rest of the food from last night. You slept much better after that\" Philip replied. Aurora blushed and nodded as she took this in. She knew he only did that because he loved her and wanted to take care of her which made her smile a little. She also knew he wouldn't be able to get any sleep if she was moaning all night. \"Well thanks for taking care of me hun\" Aurora replied sweetly with a smile to Philip. \"My pleasure, it's my job\" Philip replied with a wink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I must look so digusting to you right now with this gut\" Aurora said in disgust, gently placing her hands on top of her belly, watching in embarassment and disgust as her nails dug into her soft flab. \"Actually I like how the belly looks on you and I wouldn't mind seeing you gain some more weight. You are gorgeous now but I think gaining some weight would only ehance your beauty. Fatina gave you this belly as a gift so that means she views this belly and you gaining weight as a good thing. I agree with her\" Philip said in a sweet and sincere tone, looking Aurora in her eye so she would know that he meant it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAurora considered this for a moment. She had started to feel really hungry from the moment she had woken up but was trying to fight it. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to give into this hunger and gain some more weight. She looked down at her gut again and then looked over at Philip who was staring lovingly at her gut. Then after a moment she said.....</span></div></div>",

She was bouncy and cute, glowing of happiness, even if her yellow and orange gown had trouble containing her expanded body.

Well if i see your kimono i would say it tells otherwise.\" And she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMulan looked and noticed that her kimono really was tighter. She put on some pounds last night. Well after Su's delicious dinner it was't strange she gained a little but still...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your food just tastes much too good Su.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank's i guess. Well me and my sisters all three gained after our marriage. You noticed. But you have't gained that much. Just a few pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i train with some of the girls every morning. They all want to learn to fight like me. You know i was't the best at training camp. More the worst. Everything wen't wrong. With shooting arrows, blow of a cannon or fight against Chang. But after i got the arrow back i knew i could do it. And also all the others. We all started to train harder and we became China's heroes.\"<br>\r\n\"And also thanks to a little dragon Mushuu.\" Mulan added to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSu was eating while she listened at Mulan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well all that training keeps you in form. Next generation we have a war girls will go. Just like you. And i can tell my kids that i traveled with you. The hero of China.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMulan looked again at all the food in front of her. It all looked very good. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i gained some pounds yesterday. Just a few more won't hurt.\"</span></div></div>",

Her cushionier butt was making her sitting on the saddle more confortable, and she could feel the blubber on iner-thighs squishing on its sides. There was slightly more movement on her breasts and there was a certain wobble on her arms. Lastly, her stuffed belly, taunt hard from all the food, made riding a horse more difficult.

I don't know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly walked outside. Looking around at all the things she knew from her childhood. She walked further and suddenly stopped. She walked further and stopped again. She also heard someone else. She was sure now . Someone who tried to walk at the same time with her so she would't notice. She did one step another and after that jumped in the sky. She turned around in her jump and almost kicked a young girl to  the ground if she did't noticed at the last moment and changed direction. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi Fa Mulan!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should't follow people like that. I almost kicked you to the ground.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry. But i just want to become just like you. So when you walked away i decided to follow you. Then maybe you could learn me a special private lesson. For your best student. Tell me the secret of your success.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't have a secret. I you want a private training i could do that. But you remembered what i learned you. You need to be hard and... \"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...And soft at the same time. I know that now. I'll do my best to be the best fighter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well a fighter also need to just rest sometimes so her muscles can take more later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe little girl hugged Mulan and felt her new love handles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hee you're so soft. how did that happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Go home now.

The fruit was in she shape of a pear except the color was a rusted shade of orange.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wonder if it tastes good?\" She asked herself. She then picked one of the tree and took a bite out of it and it tasted like the sweetest thing she ever tasted then quickly devoured the rest of it. \"Wow that was really good.\" She said happily. Then she she saw that the tree had more fruit where that came from and a new fruit quickly took the place of the one that was picked. \"Well I guess a few more couldn't hurt.\" She said while grinning.

Then she took a big bite out of the fruit and she was right this one tasted even sweeter than the fruit she had before. But all the while her belly started to grow even faster and was pushing up against her outfit.

They lived in a quite big apartment building in Theben, the same one that Phil and Hercules had lived in before. Megara had been convincing Phil to search for his own house, and because no man and no satyr could resist the beautiful woman's charme for long, he did so.

The small tallie and the sizeable roundings made a perfect figure. \"I'm not happy with myself.\" Hercules upper body sort of stuck out more than her own one and that was, what she had noticed right now. \"I have to get bigger boobs\", she thought to herself. \"Than Hercy will love me even more.\" So she decided to do two things.

Screw normally!\" And with that thought on her mind she managed to finish the first big plate within an hour. Megara felt that her stomach was feeling fuller than ever before in her life, and she loved the feeling! Her robe began to feel a little tight and she could se a little bulge in it, where her tiny little belly was. She put her hands on the slight bulge that was forming. \"Well, that thing seems to be easier than I thought\", she told herself. Hands on her robe, she looked around herself, to see what to take on next and found a big plate where a big pig was lying on, an apple in his mouth. Megara licked her lips, than bent over and took the plate. She noticed that it was getting more difficult, due to her small belly. Bit by bit she ate from the pork, but instead of disappearing, her appetite got bigger. When this plate was finished too, her belly was really noticeable, but still and for some strange reason, Megara was hungry. The girl took another plate, this time full of seafood, made herself more comfortable by lying down on her side and continued to eat. She ate and ate, until four hours after she had started her feast, this third plate was also fnished. There was a big ball under her robe, that was her belly. The robe was really tight, so she thought: \"Maybe I overdid it a little. I should take a little break.\" And even though it was no good idea on a full stomach, Megara stood up.

But Megara did not even think about giving up. And so she put on her robe and headed for the town. When she was in the street she headed straight for the best restaurant she knew. There she went to a table and called for the waiter. \"Miss Megara. It's an honour. Have you chosen something yet?\", he asked. \"I would like to have everything on the whole cart once\", she replied. The man was confused, but he took the order. \"This time it has to work, or I'll be left as slim as before when Hercy comes back\", she thought to herself. As soon as the first meal arrived, Megara started to eat. When she was finished, she realized that the next four plates had already been brought to her table. When she had finished the next two plates, the entire table was filled with food. \"I'll have to eat quicker, or there'll be no space for further meals\", Megara realized. So she stopped eating gently and started stuffing her face. The other guests were surprised, but Megara ignored them. She did not know how much time passed anymore, but she ate and ate, her belly getting bigger and bigger. The sun had set long ago, when Megara had finished every single dish available in the restaurant. Just than she realized how full she was and that her big belly was hurting badly. Her robe was extremely tight. She looked like nine month pregnant, and had problems getting out. When the girl moved, it hurt even more, because she wasn't used to eating that much. \"I should try to go home. If I eat another bite I'll explode\", she thought to herself.

Megara blushed. \"Oh sorry, I have to disappoint you. I only ate a little more than usual\", she said. Megara became aware, that Alkmene had bigger boobs than she had, and also the rest of the older woman's body was quite fat. So Megara asked her \"Can you help me gain weight?\" Alkmene didn't know why she should do this. But because she liked Megara, she said: \"No problem. Just come with me. You can stay with Amphitrion and me, until Hercules comes back.\" The two women greeted Amphitrion. Afterwards Alkmene led her to a chair. \"Just wait here, and we'll prepare you the best meal you ever had\", said Alkmene. So Megara just sat there. After about an hour, when she was just about to get bored, Just then, Hercule's foster parents returned, and carried several large plates, filled with food with them. \"You won't leave here, until you ate all of these\", they said. Megara's eyes widened, but she began to eat all kinds of treats.  Even though, she still was a little full from her previous stuffing, she kept on eating. After about an hour, her belly was as big as a basket-ball. \"I think I'm finished\", she said. \"Oh, I think you aren't nearly full\", said Alkmene. She brought in the next plates full of food, each one bigger than the ones, Mgara had before. Slowly her whole robe filledup with her big belly, that rested heavily in her lap. Several plates and hours later, she had big pains in her stomach, but instead of helping, Alkmene started to feed Megara. The sun set, and Megara became tired, and after hours of constant stuffing, Alkmene stopped, \"That should do it for today\", she said. Megara had bad pains and was tired and about to puke from all the eating. Her robe had ripped long ago, and she had to lay down because of her huge belly. </span></div></div>",

She had tried that morning  and had gotten a lecture that she couldn't and why in song. When she was younger, a lesson in song was fine but now that she was nearly eighteen, it wasn't so cool.  She was debating on how she could convince her mother to let her go when all of a sudden some guy climbed into her tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScared and not sure what to do, Rapunzel then eyed one of the cooking pots she had just cleaned, she quickly grabbed it, and ran toward the guy who still luckily hadn't noticed her. He was too busy checking his satchel, checking it, and saying something about \"Being alone at last\" before she knonked him on the head with her cooking pot, knocking him out, and causing him to fall to the floor. Pastel made his way over to the guy and whacked his arm with his tail before quickly backing away in fear that the guy would awake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill feeling nervous and scared herself, Rapunzel took a couple steps closer to the guy. She couldn't help but notice that he was a good looking guy. He didn't look like a bad guy or a thug. Remembering that her mother had told her that bad guys and thugs had crooked teeth, she carefully opened his mouth with her cooking pot and breathed a sigh of relief when she saw the guy had perfect teeth. It was than that a great idea came to her, if she managed to lock this guy up in a closet then she could show her mom that she could handle being out in the world on her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith some good struggle and a little assitance by Pascal, Rapunzel was able to lock the guy away in one of her closets. Can't take care of myself mother? We will see about that she thought to herself, feeling really confident about proving it to her mother so she could go see the lanterns.</span></div></div>",

She knew her mother would not be too happy knowing a man climbed all the way to their tower, and she wouldn't let her leave with him. And she didn't even know if he was good to trust!! As she was getting more and more worried, her sight fell on a plate of cookies she baked just an hour before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm... cookies!! Just what I needed!!\" she said to herself, her mouth salivating. Surely a little sugar rush wouldn't hurt in her situation. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne cookie after another, she quickly polished of the tray, liking the sweet flavour off her lips and fingers. If she took time to think, she'd remember her figure would probably take another hit after her sugary binge : Rapunzel, however, was taking her perfect body for granted again, since her hair restored it for her without any problem. Beside, she'd always have her hair to do it again and again whetever she needed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd she'll need it quite soon, as Mother Gothel needed her hair's power almost everyday to regain her youth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rapunzel! Let down your hair!\" she heard from outside the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Coming Mother!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapunzel ran to the window and let down her hair as her mother asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce inside, Mother Gothel noticed the cookie crumbs all around the empty plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rapunzel! Stop being such a little pig!!\" she paused, seeing Rapunzel looked a little hurt by her remark. \"Just teasing!! I mean, you don't want to spoil our little supper!! I'll make hazelnut soup, your favourite!\" Mother Gothel didn't even notice that Rapunzel was back to her slender self, but to her she was nothing more than magic blonde hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Mother, don't worry I still have some room for it. I just thought about my birthday g...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I TOLD YOU NOT TO MENTION THE LANTERNS AGAIN!!\" Mother Gother cut her in anger.

She was a little worried he would be awake when she let him out but luckily he was not and just fell right down on the ground again. Again, with some struggling and a assist from Pastel, Rapunzel got the guy seated in a chair and tied him up with his hair. Rearming herself with her pot, she waited for him to awake. Determined to prove her mother wrong and comforted by the fact that the guy didn't have crooked teeth, Rapunzel was feeling more confident though still wary of this guy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing the guy stir, Rapunzel quickly put on her tough face. The guy surprised her when he smiled and said flirtly \"Hey\" when he noticed her after focusing his eyes on her. It was then that he noticed he was tied to the chair by her hair and seemed a little freaked out. It was then that he remembered his satchel with the crown in it.  \"My satchel!\" Then looking at her he said, \"Where is my satchel?\" \"I have hidden it where you can't find it\" Rapunzel replied a bit smugly. The guy looked around the room a bit and noticed a vase which is where she hid the satchel. Rapunzel immediately got nervous, grabbed a couple more cookies and devoured them due to being a little nervous. \"It's in the vase isn't it\" the guy said matter of factly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapunzel then quickly hit him with her pot again and hid it under the stair case. When the guy awoke again, she said said, \"I have now hidden it where you can't find it\" she said. The guy looked around again, and this time seemed to believe her. \"Now, what do you want with my hair? How did you find me?\" she asked, leaning in close to him. Mothel Goethel had warned her about bad people wanting to use her hair. Pastel joined in on the fun, giving the guy a touch look as well. \"Blondie, the only thing I want to do with your hair is get it off of me\" he said.  Rapunzel could tell that the guy said that sincerely. \"Then why and/or how did you find me?\" she asked him carefully. \"I was running away from some bad guys, I saw this tower, and climbed up it, thinking it would be a good place to hide\" he answered. Rapunzel and Patel shared a glance, it seemed like the guy was being truthful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I mean, I'm sure you never ever had a chance to eat something like that, being all locket up in your tower...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRapunzel's eyes flashed in delight, she wanted to taste those sweets so badly!

While it was kinda annoying for him, he could think of worse things he would have to do to get his satchel back. \"Alright blondie, let's get this over with\" he said as he got up after Rapunzel released her hair around for him. \"Great! I'm Rapunzel by the way\" she said cutely with a smile as she introduced herself. \"Nice to meet you Rapunzel, I'm Flyn Ryder\" Flynn said trying to sound all cool and dangerous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlyn then made his way down to the ground and called up to Rapunzel after she didn't come down immediately. \"Are you coming blondie?\" he called up to her. After checking to make sure the satchel was still safely hidden, she then used her hair to slide down to the ground with the cooking pot in her free hand and Pascal on her shoulder. As soon as she got down onto the ground, she started to run, so happy and excited to finally be free from the tower. She had to slow down a bit after running a few ways as she was still so full from the candy. She then rolled around in the grass and threw up leaves in the air. Flynn just watched this in shock, it was like she was a little girl but in fact she was 18 or at least he hoped she was. She looked like she was 18. \"Okay blondie, I just have to make sure that you really are going to be 18. Rapuzel blushed a bit at that. \"Sorry about that, I just have never been out of the tour before so I am really excited. I am really going to be 18 though\" she said sincerely. \"Okay\" Flynn said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll of a sudden they bothe heard a rustling in the grass and Rapunzel shrieked as a cute little harmless bunny rabbit popped out and looked at them both curiously. Rapunzel blushed, feeling a bit embarassed about how she had overreacted but at the same tiome, she had to admit, she enjoyed having herself close to him. Flynn felt warm and strong.  Two thoughts popped into Flynn's mind. One that he enjoyed feeling Rapunzel's soft body against his and two that he may have found out a way to get out of this deal sooner.</span></div></div>",

Naturally curious and inquisitive about the world outside the towel, a day didn't go by where Rapunzel pleaded with her mother to let her outside. Mother Gothel tried fobbing her off with gentle lies and excuses as to why she couldn't leave, but soon the constant requests began to grate on her nerves. She couldn't even trust Rapunzel to be left on her own anymore, she had the nagging feeling that one day her curiosity would lead her to the point of disobeying her own mother. Mother Gothel was at her wits end, she couldn't risk her precious little flower escaping from her, but she had to make sure that Rapunzel couldn't leave the tower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wicked smile crossed her painted lips, and she bought her fingers up underneath her chin. The only way out of the tower was through narrow windows and doorways, it had been built long ago when people were generally much thinner. Mother Gothel stood up from her armchair, taking slow, deliberate steps across the stone floor. If Rapunzel was too big to fit through those exits, then it meant that she would be unable to physically leave the tower. She threw back her head as she laughed, quietly as Rapunzel was still sleeping upstairs. It was simple. She would just have to fatten Rapunzel up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Mother Gothel started to use her magic. She baked pies, sweet cakes, trifles and pastries, all of the sweet, fattening things she knew the young Princess loved. She made each treat as delicious as she could make it, with a slight addictive nature to the taste, so that poor Rapunzel would continue to eat no matter how full she felt. Mother Gothel sang to herself as she worked, soon the kitchen table was groaning with the weight of the treats she had made, and even more lined the counters of the room. The sun had began to rise when she was finally finished, and almost predictably, she heard Rapunzel's feet on the staircase. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pretty blond teenage appeared with sleepy eyes, she rubbed at them on seeing all of the food on display, seeming to wake up a little. \"Mother?\" she asked as she looked around in surprise, \"What's going on? I thought you said I should cut down on treats because they made me chubby.\" Mother Gothel let out one of her tinkling laughs, and she shoved her adopted daughter into a chair, pushing her in tightly to the table. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh perish the thought,\" Mother Gothel insisted, resting her hand over her heart, \"You're far too thin, Rapunzel. You don't need to worry about what you eat with that trim waistline of yours.\" Rapunzel seemed confused, but she reached out for one of the jam tarts all the same, taking a small nibble of it. Mother Gothel watched closely as the magic took hold, and Rapunzel began to eat with a little more fervour, as if she had been starved for weeks, rather than just one night. Soon the tart turned into two, three, and soon Rapunzel had cleared the plate completely. Crumbs were scattered against her dress as she reached for one of the cakes, starting to eat hungrily. Mother Gothel could only watch in amazement, and soon her gaze dropped to Rapunzel's previously flat stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was starting to push out into the slightest of bulges from the food that was being packed into it. Mother Gothel smirked slightly, and murmured an incantation under her breath that would allow Rapunzel's clothes to grow with her, so that she wouldn't know any different. With that Rapunzel continued to eat, making quite the dent in the food on the table. </span></div></div>",

Then there was the fact her clothes seemed to be growing with her, Mother Gothel had tried to explain off hand that she had done it with magic, but Rapunzel had to question just why she had gone to all of that trouble. She shook her head, burying her face into her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know what to do,\" she admitted, her voice thick with tears, \"I wanted to see the floating lights for my birthday, but how can I even leave the tower like this?\"  </span></div></div>",

Both were up late last night. There were a lot of guests. Tina's restaurant was a big success. Every night the place was full of people. It was almost impossible to get a place without a reservation. Of course people came for the food but they also liked the music so much no one seemed to care there was also an alligator on the stage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Men this really is tight. Maybe i should weigh myself.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slowly walked over too the bathroom and stepped on the scale. She went a bit pale when she saw the number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That can't be! This thing must be broken. I can't have gained 15 pounds!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down at her chest and belly and noticed it all was a little bit bigger. She did't put that many attention to her body lately. She pulled her shirt down but noticed a stroke of brown soft belly flesh was visible. She sighed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh i am so fat!\" She said and leaned against the wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh it's not so bad. I still think you look beautiful.\" Naveen said a grabbed her from behind and pushed her against his chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naveen.\" She said with a giggle since she must admit she liked this. \"Let me go. I need to get ready for work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tiana take it easy. You no longer have to be the girl that always needed to work. You have your own restaurant now. I know that i used too be a lazy party guy but i changed. Now i know how too work so you need to learn too have some more time for fun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of fun are we talking about then.\" She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTiana's mother asked a long time for grandchildren even before she met Naveen and now she married him her mother looked even more forward too grand children and if she must admit she also would like it too have some kids. Hearing little footsteps. But before that you need to walk around nine months with a bulging belly and then she would be a few months away from her restaurant. She did't wanted that. With as many guest's if they had now she wanted to help in her own restaurant. Wow that sounded good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i would't mind doing your mother a pleasure.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And Lottie. When we were toddlers i promised her that when i would get kids she would be godmother. I know for sure she did't forget that. You know if that marriage of us would't have made us human then our kids would have been frogspawn and later tadpole's.\" She said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStrange idea. I will never order frog legs again. Besides they taste just like chicken. But you said you were so fat. What did you mend by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well i gained 15 pounds this month by eating food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's good. You need to taste the food. If you want to keep your guests you need to make sure they get the best food. So if you tried the food yourself you can be sure they get the best food. That's really important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm i guess your right. But still i gained 15 pounds.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah come on. You always were stick thin. Remember after our first meeting we met those alligators that tried to eat us and one of them said : \"I want the fat one.\" Well they mend me. Of course this are actually just pure muscle but...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get it. I'm thin so i don't need too worry about it. But we need to go too work. Both of us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All right but is it possible to close in the weekend so we have two days free time?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. Then we have the most guests. But i could ask my new chef to lead the kitchen for two days. How does that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout waiting for answer she went back to her bedroom to get dressed. She took a half minute to look in the mirror at her new extra pounds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm. Don't look that bad. Besides most great cooks have big bellies.\"   </span></div></div>",

Being Queen meant Elsa had responsibilities one of which took her away from Arendell Anna asking Kristoff to accompany her after Elsa had asked Anna to stay behind so Arendell would not be without a ruler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her brief protest Anna realized that her sister was only looking out for her and their people so she agreed. Elsa would be gone a few days, a week at most, so that left Anna with the castle all to herself for the time being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did wonder if Olaf was around? The comical snowman did seem to pop up every so often regardless of the weather conditions, thanks to a little help from Elsa's magic, but she hadn't seen him yet so she assumed he wasn't in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna continued to wander the halls trying to find something to occupy her time when she suddenly felt her stomach grumble softly. She had skipped out on breakfast to see off Elsa so perhaps that had something to do with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then let's get you fed.\" Anna stated humorously as she playfully tapped on her empty stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short time later Anna shut the door to the fridge with a slight kick as she carried a surprising-sized stack in her arms. She had forgotten how often the villagers would give her and Elsa the gift of food so even though it was just her and her sister in the castle the two never really had to worry of running short on food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking herself a few sandwiches Anna set aside some chips and a soft drink to help wash everything down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she worked her way through her meal however Anna began to wonder how Elsa was doing and because of that she also began to simply eat away lost in the thoughts of her sister. </span></div></div>",

Her belly grew from a potbelly to a proper sphere of pure fat. Her dress developed a couple of small rips around the belly region. Her breasts gained another two cup sizes, stopping at E-Cups. Her bra was now digging into them quite badly. Her ass became two orbs of fat, her panties disappearing in between her ass cheeks. Her thighs moved towards each other. A second chin formed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYawning, Anna groaned before rolling over, straight onto the floor. <br>\r\n\"Owww! Actually, that wasn't that sore\", she said, before her eyes flew open. \"Oh God, what have I done?!\", Anna said, struggling to her feet.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Glancing at her sister, Anna held back her question. <br>\r\n\"Now is not the time\", she told herself. \"But when is?\"<br>\r\nAfter the incident a couple of weeks ago where she froze everything, Elsa had returned to the castle. However, Anna had noticed a couple of differences in her sisters behaviour. They were mostly positive, such as Elsa actually talking with her and laughing. But, she couldn't help but worry. Elsa wasn't eating properly. She hadn't finished a meal since her coronation, and she was looking thinner every time Anna saw her. <br>\r\n\"I have to do something\", said Anna, walking around her room. \"She'll eventually starve, and I don't want that. Hang on, what if...\"<br>\r\nCasting her mind back to Elsa's coronation, she remembered her sisters reaction to a certain kind of cake. And now, she planned to use it to help her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Anna. What can I do for you?\", asked Elsa, watching Anna as she entered the throne room. <br>\r\n\"Well, I figured that because you ran off during the coronation, we never finished it. So, I arranged another one! And it's not a coronation without the new queen!\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I guess...\", began Elsa. <br>\r\n\"So it's settled!\", exclaimed Anna happily, grabbing Elsa's hand and dragging her outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter meeting most of her friends, such as Olaf and his snow cloud, which kept him from melting, and Kristoff and Sven, who were sharing a carrot, much to the amusement of small children, Elsa broke away from the main crowd. She intended to leave, but before she could, she smelt a familiar smell. <br>\r\n\"Mmmmm.... Chocolate!\", she exclaimed. <br>\r\nLooking around the courtyard, she saw Anna wheeling in a number of chocolate cakes. She started in the direction of the cakes, stopping to saw hello or to shake someone's hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the cakes, Elsa was disappointed to find that, in the amount of time that it had taken her to get from one side of the crowded courtyard to the other, most of the cakes had been eaten by other guests. Only two remained. Looking around, Elsa quickly wheeled the cart off. <br>\r\n\"Got to be quick and quiet. Don't want people asking too many questions...\" Elsa told herself. <br>\r\nReaching a corner of the courtyard that nobody could see, Elsa quickly cut the two cakes into manageable slices and began her binge. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrumbs and chocolate sauce fell to the ground, but Elsa wasn't too bothered by it. Nobody would see them. Polishing off the first cake, she gave a quiet burp before starting on the second. She used one hand to eat the cake and the other was used to rub her slowly developing belly. Her backside was getting a small bit of the cake, while her breasts were beginning to grow. Her dress hid the growth in her breasts and backside, but did nothing to hide her growing belly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinishing the second cake, Elsa giggled. <br>\r\n\"I haven't had a cake that good since my first coronation\", she said, absent-mindedly rubbing her belly. \"I need to order more of them...\"<br>\r\nShe trailed off as she caught sight of her body. <br>\r\nShe had developed a potbelly which strained against her dress. Her breasts, which were originally B-Cups, were now slightly bigger. She guessed that they were now C-Cups. Her backside was bigger, along with her thighs, which were also pushing against her dress. Her hips had widened, giving her a pear shape. <br>\r\n\"What have I done?\", she whispered, horrified. <br>\r\n\"Saved your life, but the looks of it\", came a voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpinning around, Elsa saw Anna, who had a wide grin on her face. Walking towards her, Anna grabbed the bottom of Elsa's new belly and pinched. <br>\r\n\"Someone has eaten all the cakes, Elsa...\", She teased. <br>\r\n\"That... That isn't true!\", Elsa argued back, horrified at what she had become. <br>\r\n\"Well then\", replied Anna. \"You won't mind if...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

She skipped off in the direction of the party. <br>\r\nElsa started after, but soon stopped. She found that small run very exhausting. She also didn't want the party-goers to see what had happened to their new queen. <br>\r\n\"Anna, why? Why did you do this?\", Elsa asked. She collapsed on a nearby step and buried her head in her hands. She stayed that way for a bit, until she became aware of something on her face. Lifting her head up, she swiped her finger across her cheek. She saw a smudge of chocolate sauce, which she quickly licked away. <br>\r\n\"Mmmmm, so good... No, stop! This isn't me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, Elsa marched further away from the party. She didn't get very far before a familiar shout was heard. <br>\r\n\"Hey, Elsa. Where are you going? I got more food for you!\"<br>\r\nElsa groaned. <br>\r\n\"Go away, Anna!\"<br>\r\nElsa was soon running from her sister. She had no intention of slowing so she could be stuffed with food. But she couldn't keep this pace up forever. She had run into the castle, hoping to lose Anna by taking random turns. Her plan, so far, was working. <br>\r\n\"Elsa, slow down!\"<br>\r\nShe gave no answer, still intent on escaping her sister. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter running for a while, she had escaped her sister. Or so she thought. <br>\r\nTaking the next turn, Elsa ran straight into the back of Anna. <br>\r\n\"No!\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, Elsa. There you are. Here, I hid some food for you!\"<br>\r\nGrabbing Elsa by the hand, Anna walked off, Elsa trying her best to escape. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside, Anna sat Elsa on a step. <br>\r\n\"Right, stay right there. I'll go get the trolleys!\", Anna said happily. <br>\r\n\"Yay...\", Elsa groaned. She wasn't looking forward to her stuffing. <br>\r\nA rattling of wheels was heard, as Anna rounded the corner with three trolleys, all full of chocolate covered treats. A couple of white tarps covered a couple of items. <br>\r\n\"Alright, where do you want to start?\", asked Anna, sitting next to Elsa. <br>\r\n\"Is nowhere a viable answer?\", replied Elsa gloomily. <br>\r\n\"Oh, I know!\", shouted Anna, ignoring her sister's comments. \"We'll start with the surprise I had specially made for today!\"<br>\r\nShe jumped up and whipped the tarps off. Underneath them was replicas of Olaf, if he was made entirely out of chocolate ice-cream, and covered in chocolate sauce. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nElsa couldn't help but admire the detail. She was interrupted by Anna, who had shoved a spoonful of the chocolate Olaf down her throat. <br>\r\n\"Mmm!\"<br>\r\n\"It's nice, isn't it?\", asked Anna. She didn't wait for Elsa's answer, as she had already shoved another three spoonfuls down her sister's throat. <br>\r\n\"Anna, st-Hmm-op!\"<br>\r\nIgnoring Elsa again, she quickly finished off the first Chocolaf. It had added to Elsa's girth. Her belly was constricted within her dress, while her breasts were causing small rips to appear. Her backside and thighs had caused a rip down the side of her dress to appear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want to eat a snowman?\", asked Anna, grabbing another Chocolaf. This time, Elsa grabbed a massive chunk of the treat and shoved it into her mouth. She stopped afterward, mortified at what she had just did. Her gloves were now stained with chocolate, and her mouth was covered with crumbs. <br>\r\nAnna, seeing her hesitation, started to feed Elsa again. <br>\r\n\"Come on, Anna! No more!\"<br>\r\n\"Just a few more, Elsa\".<br>\r\nElsa was doing her best to resist, but it was becoming harder by the second. Her belly was now an orb of creamy flesh, packed full of cake and chocolate ice-cream. Her breasts were two smaller orbs that sat atop her belly. Her backside had widened the rip in her dress, and her thighs were twice as wide. <br>\r\n\"No more, Anna, or you'll regret it!\", threatened Elsa in between spoonfuls. <br>\r\n\"Just a few more...\", repeated Anna. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the second Chocolaf had been finished, Anna wiped a smudge of sauce from Elsa's plump cheeks. <br>\r\n\"Hold on a second, I'll get another one\", said Anna, turning around. <br>\r\nElsa...</span></div></div>",

Moving her hands downwards, she grasped the two orbs that made up her ass and gasped. They were also sagging slightly. Her thighs now resembled small tree trunks. Feeling her face, she felt her softer cheeks and her developing second chin. Looking back at Anna, she grinned devilishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaddling slightly over to Anna, she grabbed her by the shoulders, which caused a \"What are you doing?\" from her, and pushed her down onto the steps. Elsa froze her hands and feet, meaning she couldn't move. <br>\r\n\"Elsa, let me go!\" Anna pleaded, struggling to free herself. <br>\r\nElsa didn't answer. <br>\r\nInstead, she grabbed a Chocolaf, grabbed a handful of it, causing chocolate sauce and ice-cream to fall to the ground, and stuffed it in Anna's mouth. <br>\r\n\"Mmmm!\" Anna swallowed it. \"Elsa, stop-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was cut off by another handful of Chocolaf. And another. And another. <br>\r\n\"It's not so nice, is it?\" asked Elsa, smiling at Anna. \"Being stuffed with chocolate? Watching your figure disappear before your eyes?\"<br>\r\nAnna shook her head. She couldn't answer, as another handful was stuffed in her mouth. <br>\r\nShe now had a potbelly, which was spilling in between her legs. Her breasts had gone up a cup size, and had tightened her dress considerably. Her backside had gained a few pounds, and was spilling out slightly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a couple more bites, Anna was done, or so she hoped. <br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, Elsa! I was just trying to help!

I'm much heavier than you are, and I don't find that fair\".<br>\r\n\"Wait, Elsa, don't-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnna was cut off by a slice of cake being stuffed into her mouth. She chewed slowly, hoping Elsa would stop, but instead got another slice of cake shoved into her overfilled mouth.

Elsa, not taking no for an answer, started rubbing Anna's belly, much to her confusion. <br>\r\nAfter a couple of minutes of Elsa's chubby hand rubbing Anna's equally chubby potbelly, her weird move became apparent. Anna felt a pressure building up inside her. She tried keeping it in, but it was no use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she opened her mouth to burp, Elsa struck. A flow of ice leapt forwards from her hand and directly into Anna's open mouth. Immediately, her belly began to fill with Elsa's magical ice. Her small potbelly disappeared, and was replaced with a slowly growing globe, similar to a full-term pregnant woman. Her breasts jumped up a couple of sizes, testing the limits of her dress. Her ass ballooned, ripping her dress down the sides and revealing her thicker thighs. Her face rounded out, and a second chin formed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Elsa watched her sister grow to her size, she wondered if she should stop. Anna has learnt her lesson, but going even further would make sure it sticks with her. <br>\r\nWhat does Elsa do?</span></div></div>",

They were in love and all the castle's staff adored their new princess. She especially befriended with her own private maid, Maria. Not only did they have similar personnalities, but they had very similar figures : both had slim and tall perfect bodies that they were very proud of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, lately, it seemed Maria was starting to fill out a bit. It wasn't a big deal, but Cinderella noticed that when she walked, her rounder breasts and butt had some bounce to them, while her hips had more sway. With her thicker thighs, she had a true hourglass figure, barely diminished by the beginning of a belly, which was pushing on her apron, creating a little bulge. Cinderella kept quiet though, as she didn't want to worry Maria about it. Beside, she thought her new softened figure was really suiting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day, Maria rushed to Cinderella's room, crying. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's wrong?\" asked the princess, very worried about her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm getting *sob* faaaaaat!! It's been a couple of weeks since I noticed the pounds pilling on my body, but at first it wasn't noticeable and I thought it would go away, but it won't... Now, I gained 15 pounds and my uniform is getting too tight!!\" Maria said, before poking the soft flesh under her apron for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Awwwn, Maria, don't say that!! First, if your uniform's size is bothering you, I'll just order you a bigger one, so you will be more comfortable. Second, I noticed your body's changes too, but I think it just make you more beautiful. Those curves make you more feminine and sexy, I'm so jealous of you! Beside, your extra 15 pounds doesn't even make you chubby yet. Don't worry, everything is going to be fine!\" said Cinderella, before hugging her friend, feeling her even-so-slightly squishier body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really think so?\" A smile lightened Maria's face, creating faint dimples in her just a little more padded cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't lie to such a good friend.

You are so lucky to have an hourglass shape, you barely have a belly yet your breasts and butt are so round and sexy!! Have you noticed how the castle guards can't keep their eyes off of you, and if I didn't know better, I'd think even my prince is lusting for you!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww Cindy, stop that, you are making me blush!! I guess you are right and that the new weight is looking really good on me, and I could try to gain a little more. After all, if I don't like it, I could try and loose it after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit!!\" Cinderella smiled. \"Shall we start now? I can get you a bigger uniform from another maid so you'll be more comfortable and have more room for a little binge!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that you mention it, I was starting to get a little hungry!! Let's get started!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Cinderella gave her a bigger dress, who was almost Maria's perfect size except for the waist part which was a little too big for her, they went to the dining room.

She really wasn't used to make a pig of herself like that, especially since when she lived with lady Tremaine, she barely ate at all. Starvation also lowered her metabolism, which wouldn't be able to keep up with her eating if she was to continue binging herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I wouldn't mind either, and until you judge you are curvy enough, I suggest we do this every day, what do you think?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be wonderful!
