Kagome is running though Inuyasha's forest crying. \"Damn that Inuyasha, how dare he call me weak, someday i will show him.\" She stops at the well and looks at the night sky and makes a single wish on a star. \"Wish i may, wish i meet, i wish on a star tonight. I wish i was as strong as a demon to show Inuyasha that i'm not a weak person.\" She jumps down the well and ends up in her era five hundred years into the future* \"Get a hold of yourself Kagome star wishing doesn't come true.\" She lets out a sigh and climbs out of a well, then she walks into her home. \"Mom i'm home.\" No one responds and she figures they are out for the evening so she goes to the bathroom and relaxes in a bath. \"Ahh this feels great.\" After the bath she goes to her room and puts on some pjs and lays in bed as she thinks of the events with Inuyasha.<br>\r\n~Flash back starts~<br>\r\n\"Inuyasha you jerk. Why is she here?\" Kagome points at Kikyo her rival for Inuyasha's heart and she has a major dislike for Kikyo, kinda the same dislike Sesshoumaru has for his younger brother. Inuyasha yells. \"because she is better then you Kagome!\" kagome then turns around and yells. \"SIT SIT SIT SIT SIT SIT SIT SIT SIT SIT SIT!!!\" Which causes Inuyasha to end up in a Inuyasha size hole in the ground about 12 inches deep and she runs off into the forest near the well. ~flash back ends~<br>\r\nKagome turns on her side and goes to sleep while crying a little but not before saying. \"I think i will go see a certain someone when i return to the fedual era.\" She has a peaceful sleep not knowing her wish is coming true.<br>\r\nWhat kind of demon does Kagome turn into?</span></div></div>",

But as a half demon she won't be as strong or as fast and her senses won't be as sharp as a full demon. She also acts like a cat when she gives into the feline desires Now as a full demon she still has cat ears and a longer cat tail, sharper claws, and fangs. Way better balance and grace then a half demon feline, able to transform into a giant cat about the size of Sesshoumaru's dog form. Now the true question is which one and how fast does the change happen?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Well how about something western. Kagome is a reincarnated priestess so her becoming a demon does go against her nature a little bit. Demons can be good, bad, or neutral in Japan, But demon as we in the west know it still gives off this idea of being evil or at least a bit corrupted. But it never said anything about her becoming an Angel. A priestess is already a pretty light spiritual entity in Japanese culture anyway, so what would be a step up? Why an Angel of course! Angels can be very powerful, are mysterious and would be a good contrast to all the demons of feudal japan. Now you have to decide on if you want a good Angel, a bad Angel, or a light or dark Angel. Good &amp; bad are self explanatory. Will Kagome's transformation make her Evil, Cruel, &amp; Mean or will she stay Kind, Sweet, &amp; Good or will she become even KINDER &amp; NICER and become a bit more like Kasumi from Ranma 1/2. Dark or Light means will she be naughty but playful or sweet and innocent looking but still in a hot way. This means that there can be bad light Angels and good dark Angels.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile typing this I thought of a step above Angel. Goddess! Kagome could become something Shinto style like Amaterasu (And be an original creation or the reincarnation/embodiment of an already established Japanese deity (god or goddess) but I was thinking more along the lines of Belldandy from \"Oh! My Goddess!\" Again the same guidelines fore Angels apply to being a Goddess. <b>Except</b> if she becomes evil she should become a Demoness in the Western sense or the \"Oh! My Goddess!\" sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo them's the options! Pick a winner now!</span></div></div>",

Now here is what a dragon demon looks like. If kagome becomes a dragon she will grow many fangs razor sharp, very sharp claws, dragon wings from her shoulder blades very painful transformation, she will be able to turn into a dragon. now a dragoon this one is based off of the game Legend Of Dragoon so Squaresoft aka Square Enix owns it. i just couldn't pass it up. Now a Dragoon has thick dragon scale armor which can be red, black, green, purple, aqua, golden brown or white, my personal favorite is red and black. It comes as full body armor no helmet and is able to transform at will the wings are attach to the armor and is able to fly less painful but it puts more stress on the body if used to much for a while at first which could kill Kagome. If that doesn't interest you then maybe if she was a bird demon or even a fox demon.</span></div></div>",

It doesn't burn up during re-entry and it is red hot but cool to the touch it lands right on Kagome's floor by breaking through her bedroom window. The noise causes kagome to stir a little but she goes back to sleep. The sun raises up and shines brightly in Kagome's room reflected off of the shiny red stone and the light causes Kagome to wake up. \"Inuyasha just five more minutes.\" But the light is doesn't fade away and which causes kagome to get out of bed. \"what is this light? I can't see.\" She then uses her hands to shield her eyes which causes her to see a pretty red stone on the floor. \"Huh, how did this get here?\" She walks over and picks it up which causes her to be engulfed in a bright light. \"Ahh to bright.\" She shuts her eyes until the light fades away and when the light is gone she is hovering a few inches from the ground as she flaps her new wings and is wearing heavy looking armor that is fire red. In her confusion the armor and wings go away which causes her to fall onto all fours panting. She is wondering. \"What just happened? What was with that light/ It felt like i was on fire but i wasn't getting burned.\" She then opens her hand and stares at the red stone. \"Did this stone have anything to do with it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nwhat happens next? remember folks i am only a novice so i am sorry if it isn;t very good.</span></div></div>",

Due to the tail she wakes up and is still unaware of the changes. Kagome walks over to her closet and pulls out her usual school uniform and places it on the bed. Then she walks over to her dresser and pulls out a bra and matching panties then she gets naked and when her skin touches the fur from her legs and tail she turns around and screams. \"How did this happen? I look like a fox demon! Did my wish come true?\" She pair of scissors from her desk and cuts a hole in her panties for her tail and she strokes it. \"This is cool once you get over the shock of it.\" She then giggles. \"Shippo will be happy now i can protect him better and my friends once i learn how. Maybe Sesshoumaru will train me if i ask him nicely, if that doesn't work i will give him a reason to.\" She now has a cunning smile on her face as she gets dressed and she uses her priestess powers which has demonic aura in it to hide the fur on her legs, once she is dressed she opens up her window and instantly covers her nose with her arm and coughs. \"God it stinks in this era , is this what Inuyasha smells when he comes through he well?
