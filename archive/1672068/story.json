It was shinning brightly illuminating the entire forest. This day long hike she had decided to go on had definitely taken a sour turn. First her cell phone battery died and then she had taken a wrong turn and gotten lost. Now she was desperate to get home but all she had was her compass and instincts at this point. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she turned a corner she saw what looked like a cliff as she sighed with relief. If she could get to the top of that ridge she could see the entire forest and get back to her campground. As she made her way to towards the ridge she stopped as she saw something on top of cliff. She couldn't quite tell what it was as she struggled to see it. At first it looked like a wolf but it far to big....\"Maybe it's a bear?\" Amy thought as she squinted her eyes more. That's when she froze as her eyes went wide. The animal suddenly stood up in its hind legs like a human as she got a better look at it. It definitely looked like a wolf but not like One she had ever seen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://i1028.photobucket.com/a...\" target=\"_blank\">http://i1028.photobucket.com/a...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the wolf creature stood in its hind legs it gazed up towards the full moon as it let out one of the loudest howls Amy had ever heard. Amy had to cover her ears it was so loud as she tried to back away from the giant wolf before it spotted her. Just then it started sniffing....the wolf beast dropped down to all fours again sniffing the air before its gaze suddenly fell right into Amy who was now frozen in fear. It's eyes were a bright yellow almost glowing in the darkness. It slowly looked down on her as it licked its fangs slowly before making what had to be an impossible feat. The wolf leapt from the cliff fell over 100 feat before landing on the forest ground uninjured before growling deeply as it began stalking its prey....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny was almost too terrified to move...her legs were shaking with fear so bad she could barely move. Slowly she reached down and pulled out the long silver knife her grandfather had given her years ago. She had to make a choice now to fight or to run....her hands were shaking as tears ran down her face....she knew she couldn't fight it so she did the only other thing she could....run....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Using every ounce of strength she had she felt the adrenaline pouring into her body as she fled for her life. However no matter hard she ran the footsteps of the wolf beast behind her never went away. She was too terrified to look back at this point. She didn't know if the wolf was right behind her or if the beast was just toying with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she ran with every ounce of speed she had any looked for anything to hide her or escape with. The problem was she was in a large national forest very few places to hide. At least where the wolf would not be able to find her. As she ran suddenly she spotted something! A large fallen hollowed out tree! it looked barely big enough for her. Thankfully Amy was quite petite at only 5'4 and 105lbs. She dove at the log and began crawling her way through the opening trying get away from wolf hot on her trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was almost fully tucked away inside the tree as she tried to pull her legs inside when suddenly she felt a sudden stabbing pain in her left foot. Crying out in pain she looked down to see the wolf had bitten all the way through her hiking boot and its fangs were digging into her left foot and ankle. Amy cried out in pain as the wolf was trying to drag her out of the tree but Amy refused to give up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing her other foot she began kicking furiously at the beast focusing on its sensitive nose kicking it over and over again with every ounce of strength she had. Finally the beast released her as she pulled herself inside the tree. The pain in her leg was intense as she reached down and touched the wound feeling the blood that was soaking up her sock and boot. Amy clutched the knife desperately as she wolf the wolf jumping around and sniffing and scratching at the tree trying to find a weakness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pleaded and prayed that the beast would give up but she continued to hear it growl. Just when Amy was about to lose hope she heard the growling stop as the footsteps seemed to be moving away. Amy let out a large sigh of relief but it was quickly short lived....without warning the top of the tree she was hiding in was ripped away, pulled part with immense strength by the wolf who now stood on its hind legs once more. Amy had no idea what kind of beast was capable of something like this both physically or mentally...the wolf actually seemed to be thinking....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching down the wolf grabbed Amy and pulled her out of the tree. It's hands were much more like human hands with opposable thumbs and everything. Amy screamed and kicked trying to break free of the beast's grasp as she scrambled to reach for the knife she had dropped. As the wolf pulled her out of the log Amy barely managed to grasp the hilt of the knife as she grabbed it tightly and plunged it into the chest of the wolf.....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Amy stabbed the beast which had grasped her the wolf suddenly stopped...its grip released as Amy fell back down as the wolf seemed to pause for a second before looking at the knife in its chest. The weird thing was Amy noticed the wound was bleeding, but smoking....steam was rising out of the wound as if the blood of the wolf itself was evaporating....the wolf began to stumble backwards for a second before it let out a loud whimper of pain before it suddenly fell down. It was howling in agony as it seemed unable to touch the blade...Amy didn't know what to make of this...was the beast allergic to the silver the knife was made of?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot wanting to take any more chances Amy summoned the last of her energy and rage to do the unthinkable. She charged at the wolf...she reached over and grabbed her knife and pushed it deeper into the wolf. She heard it howl in pain more as Amy took the blade with withdrew it and quickly stabbed the creature several more times before the wolf finally could not take it and began to flee. It stumbled away slowly whimpering and howling in pain befire vanishing into the woods.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy took a deep breath and sighed with relief. She wasn't sure if the beast was dead or not but she was safe for now. Looking to her knife she saw something odd. The blood of the wolf was coated on the knife was it was evaporating as if her knife was red hot...soon it had all but vanished off the blade the inscription from her grandfather became visible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be Vigilant Against the Coming Darkness.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words seemed to echo into her mind as Amy soon found her eyes growing heavy....she had lost a lot of blood and with the adrenaline fading her strength had given out. Soon she collapsed on the ground wondering if this was how she was going to die....alone in the woods...As her eyes began to close she suddenly heard barking in the distance....however this was no wolf sound, it was the sound of a rescue dog leading her old camping group to her location. With the last of her consciousness Amy smiled as she felt a dog licking her cheek and barking as familiar human voices grew closer to her location. </span></div></div>",

Tears ran down her mothers face as her family came and held her closely. The doctors were careful in helping her sit up slowly. Her left foot was wrapped up in a large bandage and there were several more bandages around her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have us quite a scare kiddo.\" Her dad said smiling through his tears of joy as Eddie came and held her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"When you didn't come back from your hike I took Buster and the rest if the camp ground and we went searching for you.

Now she was 18 and he was 21 and she was there training to be a camp councilor. They had been officially dating now for about 8 months. Things went pretty slow at first because she was still in high school but now that she just graduated she hoped they could take their relationship to the next level soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you remember what attacked you? We couldn't find any traces of blood or animal fur anywhere close to you.\" Eddie asked as Amy tried to remember.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was...a wolf...a strange wolf....I've never seen seen one that big or act like that before...\" Amy said as the memories of the attack gave her chills. \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt it was a wolf Miss Wilson.\" The doctor said who had been waiting in the room patiently. \"Those bite marks I treated were far to deep and large to match any known species of wolf. I believe it had to have been some kind of bear....perhaps starving or rabid...that's why we gave you all the proper treatments to protect you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen I'm telling you what I saw! It was a huge wolf! It even stood up on two legs! It seemed smart and cunning like it was hunting me the whole time!\" Amy said angered that no one seemed to believe her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Listen sweetie it was traumatic, who knows what you really saw? The important thing is your safe now.\" Eddie said as he held her hand tightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we want to keep you one more night for observation so tomorrow morning you are free to return home.\" The doctors said as everyone was escorted out of the room so Amy could rest.</span></div></div>",

She actually felt better than she had in a long time. Her energy was up, everything smelled stronger, and she could even hear better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was home her parents took her upstairs to rest. She had been given crutches to walk since her left foot was in a banfage but for some reason she felt like she didn't even need it. After her parents had left for work she decided to get her foot free and examine the wound. Taking a knife she cut the bandages and took them off slowly. Once her foot was free she examined the wound her eyes suddenly widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe doctors had warned her that there would be some scarring from the bite but she didn't expect it to look like this. The bite mark on her ankle and foot was black....one could say it looked infected but there was no outside swelling or inflamed tissue. In a strange way it almost looked more like a tatoo of a wolf bite than an actual bite scar. The wound had seemingly healed perfectly but she was going to have to get used these markings on her now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought back to the note from before and shook it off. She spent the rest of the day on the Internet looking up different kinds of animals in hopes of getting some kind answers as to what the hell attacked her that night.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Reaching back she felt her hair brushing against her as she nodded off again before suddenly realizing something....she didn't have long hair! Amy jumped out of bed and went to the mirror and covered her mouth when she saw her hair. It had grown at least three inches over night! Her normal brunette hair was usually cut right below ear level for her. Now it covered her ears entirely and even brushed down a little past her neck...she also noticed her normally well kept locks were a bit more untamed now. Her hair seemed a bit wilder than usual. She tried to think of an explanation for all this but she couldnt think of anything rational. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter jumping in the shower and washing her new longer hair Amy decided she should go out today. She hadn't gone shopping since the camping trip and for some reason she had a strange desire for something sexy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the shower she saw there was a text on her phone. Looking at it Amy raised a brow as she saw it was from a blocked number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beauty and Lust are marks of the beast....tonight is the first night find me before the beast comes calling on the third night...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is this? How the hell did they get her number?\" She thought as she had almost forgotten that stupid letter from the hospital but now it seemed like someone wasn't satisfied with her just yet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting dressed Amy noticed her jeans and shirt were a bit too tight. She hadn't really gained any weight they just seemed smaller then usual to her....putting on some sweats and an over sized t shirt she went out to find something a bit more fitting for herself <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The kind of feeling you get wearing too many layers on a hot summer day. However this was mid Autumn....Most people were walking around in coats yet to her it felt like middle of July. She hoped she didn't have a fever as Amy checked herself noticing she felt fine. She just needed something better to wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping at several stores Amy tries on many different varieties of her usually outfits, jeans, shirts, nothing too fancy. However no matter what she tried nothing felt good. It was like her skin was too sensitive, everything felt itchy or too hot. Getting frustrated she noticed her tennis shoes were causing her massive discomfort as well. Taking them off she felt immediate relief once ditching her socks feeling her bare feet on the ground. She tried on various other shoes but got the same result as well. It wasn't until she tried in a light pair of flip flops did the discomfort subside. She could feel something odd inside her. Something telling her her feet needed to be exposed to the open air...she tried on several different saddle types finding out the less material there was the better they felt. She then saw a pair of 3 inch heeled sanders on a shelf. While never much of a fan of wearing heels ever in the past she decided to try them on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe minute she slid on the heels and stood up balancing on the halls of her feet she expected the familar pain and annoying feeling of wearing heels, but was instead greeted with something else. Once she stood up she felt the complete opposite of pain....it felt good to stand like this. Almost like her feet were designed to stand like this. Walking around she felt comfortable and nice and also a little sexy....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBiting her lip gently for a bit she was starting to feel those strange feelings again. Something telling her to by something light and sexy.</span></div></div>",

So what if you can't shift back to being a human anymore?'' Your brain is screaming 'WHAT?!', but all you can say is ''Uh huh....'' as the pleasure of the werewolf's scratching. You sit up like a dog and wag your newfound tail madly as you begin to pant, much to Rotfoot's delight. ''Yeah. That scritching right about there makes every were go stupid happy and fast! Wait 'til you get a belly rub~''<br>\nJust then, a chipper voice comes calling through the trees. ''Rotfoot! Rotfoot? Where are you?!'' He hollers through the trees ''I'm here with a first timer, Paint Stripper!''<br>\nWith a rumble of leaves and a snapping of branches, your stupor is broken when a pink blur comes bounding like a lightning bolt through the trees. With an impressive flip, the female lands right in front of you. You jump back with a startled yelp.<br>\nThis were has pink fur with a white strip of fur running down from the bottom of her chin to the ends of her inner thighs. Her tail is shorter than Rotfoot's in her cutoff Daisy Dukes, but the long headfur she has is tied into two long ponytails behind her ears with what looks like chains of daisies and leaf stems. Her violet eyes sparkled mischieviously as she looked from you to the wolf that bit you. ''So, Rottie, you finally have a pet! That's super cool, but your pet looks healthier than you do!'' Rotfoot snickers as you stand up. ''Hold on a second! I'm nobody's pet!!'' Paint Stripper smiles and begins to talk directly to you. You can see why they call her Paint Stripper, too. Her breath nearly peeled the flesh from his face as she spoke. ''Relax, Newbie. It's a term of familiarity. After all, by Lycan Law, he has to train you in the ups and downs of being a werewolf!'' Rotfoot smiles. ''That means you and I are gonna be closer to each other than the stink of a dead skunk!'' He wraps an arm around your shoulders as Paint Stripper laughs. 'Well,' you say to yourself in your mind, 'Rotfoot is a pretty cool monster, and being a were could be fun....</span></div></div>",
