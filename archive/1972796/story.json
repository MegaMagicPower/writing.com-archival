After a boring day of classes, you decide to take the scenic route on your way back to your house in the suburbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile walking, you see a group of kids huddling around a rock, and trying to pull something out. After shooing the kids away, you look at what they were hiding and upon closer examination, you find a mediaeval-styled longsword. So, enacting out one of your favorite scenes from <b>The Sword in the Stone</b> you yank the sword out. You try to cover the sword up as best you can with your jacket, and carry it all the way back home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce in your room, you pull the sword out and take a better look at it. You see the sword was made with shining steel that has eroded over time, and the hilt of the sword has a small dial. Just as you're about to turn it, a letter falls out from your jacket pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe letter reads:<br>\r\n<i>Dear finder of my sword,<br>\r\nI am a great mage who has left his sword to whomever can retrieve it from my enchanted stone. This sword has several modes, however all follow the same premise that the sword can cut any body part, but allow the owner to retain ownership of their limb, until it is reattached. Currently, the sword will not exhibit this skill until the sword's dial is changed into a mode. Be prudent, however, as once a mode is chosen, it is locked that way for 100 years!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, I will list out the modes for you to choose:</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Please choose what mode you would like to use)</span></div></div>",

Standing five foot six, with pale creamy skin, her shockingly bright orangeish red hair done up in a pony tail, sparkling green eyes, button nose, and soft pink kissable lips, her pretty face covered with a light dusting of freckles, not to mention her smoking hot body, slender and athletic with long sexy legs, flaring hips and ass, and a perky pair of C-cup breasts, your fraternal twin is the subject of considerable lust among your schools male student body, as well the envy of the female population. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNor are you immune to your sisters charms. However, unlike most teens with a hot sister, you're not compelled to merely look and dream. Being twins, and growing up in a poor household, you and Jenna have always been remarkably close to one another, even sharing a room up until a few months ago when your mom married the asshole you call your stepdad. As a side effect of this closeness, as well as a lack of parental supervision during your early teens when you were both first learning about sex, the two of you developed an incestual relationship that is still going on to this day, though with greatly reduced frequency, both of you being involved in a relationship now, as well as having more people around, making finding time to be together both harder and less necessary. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight now though, you and Jenna are the only one's home, both your mom and stepdad being at work, your younger brother Staying over at a friends house, and your Stepsister Stacy being out on a date, meaning the two of you have the house to yourselves. Judging by the look on her face, Jenna has realized this as well, as she impishly inquires \"Well bro, are you just going to stand there staring all day, or are you going to let me in?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, sorry about that.\" you said, laughing awkwardly while rubbing the back of your head, before continuing \"It's just really hard for me to take my eyes off of a girl as pretty as you sis.\" gesturing her into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing down at your crotch, Jenna giggles, replying \"Hmm, that's not the only thing that's hard around here.\" giving your junk a little pat as she enters your room, closing the door behind herself to give the two of you some measure of privacy should one of your other family members come home unexpectedly. Turning back to you, she reaches down, attempting to remove your jeans. As much as you would love to allow her to continue though, you have another order of business to deal with first. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently pushing her away, earning you a look of mild confusion from your sister, you explain \"Hold on just a minute sis, before we do anything else, I found something really cool today that I think you should know about.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea? What could be so cool that you'd pass up sex just to show me?\" You're sister inquires, slightly miffed at the interruption, but also intrigued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching under your bed and pulling out the sword, along with the note, you show them both to her giving her time to read over the note before inquiring \"So, feel like helping me test my new toy?\" you inquire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArcing one eyebrow, Jenna replies \"Seriously bro? You don't really believe this nonsense do you? I mean, I know you've got these fantasies about magic and stuff, but that's all they are, just fantasies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're wrong is, and I'll prove it to you!\" you insisted, picking up the sword and slicing your left hand off before your sister could stop you, failing to consider the consequences should this whole thing be a hoax in your desire to prove the existence of magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon seeing what you've done, your sister screams in horror, covering her mouth with her hands before crying \"Quick bro, help me find something we can use as a tourniquet! If we can get your hand on ice and get you to the hospital quick enough, we may be able to... John, why are you looking at me like that? Are you going into shock or...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor you're part, while your sister was horrified, you were elated, the sword having functioned precisely as advertised, as, though there was a three foot blade of steel separating your hand from your wrist, you could still feel it, and furthermore, there was no pain, only a mildly pleasurable tingling sensation as the sword cut through you. \"It works!\" you excitedly cry, experimentally, you tried to move your fingers, your severed hand responding to your commands just as though it were still attached to you, and after a short moment you had it standing up on your finger tips, running around the room like thing from the Adam's family, eliciting yet another shriek from your sister, who doges away from your questing hand, grabbing hold of your wrist and examining it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell? T-there's no blood!\" Jenna says in surprise, noting that, in place of the bloody stump she was expecting, at the end of your wrist instead there's only blank skin, no different than that covering the rest of you body aside from the lack of any sort of detectable hair or blemish, your new skin being unnaturally soft and smooth to the touch. \"this, this doesn't make any sense, you should be bleeding all over the place.\" your sister said, clearly confused and slightly disturbed at having her world view shattered so thoroughly, though considerably less frightened than before. Overcoming her initial revulsion or the spider like nature of your severed appendage, having an intestine phobia of spiders and bugs in general to a lesser degree, Jenna bends over, picking up your hand and studying it. \"It's still warm. Can you reattach it?\" she inquires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging you answer \"Lets find out.\" Taking your hand from her and pressing it to your wrist, you feel that strange pleasurable tingling sensation, which you assume means the magic is working. Once the tingling passes, you wait for a few seconds just to be sure before letting go of your wrist, your hand remaining firmly attached, with no evidence remaining that it had ever been severed in the first place. Raising your hand, your palm facing your sister, your wiggle your fingers a little, showing Jenna that everything is still in good working order despite your recent experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHaving mostly recovered from her initial panic attack, her fearful expression having been replaced with a look of wide eyed wonder, Jenna gasps \"Wow! That's just, I mean,...Wow! That's like one of the coolest things I've ever seen bro! Sorry for doubting you earlier.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apology accepted sis. To be honest, I'd normally be a little skeptical myself, but there's just something about this sword that let me know it was the real deal, and that nothing I did with it could cause me any sort of permanent damage. Well, not on this setting anyway.\" you added almost as an after though. Smiling as you brandish the blade, you inquire \"So sis, feel like helping me play with my new toy?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding bro? Of course I do!\" Jenna replies, adding \"____________________________.\"</span></div></div>",

So, now that I'm headless, or bodyless I guess I guess I should say, what are you planning to do with me?\"  Rather than respond, Jenna brings your head in close pressing your lips firmly against her own in a passionate kiss. The two of you make out for a moment before Jenna pulls you away from herself, walking over to your dresser and setting your head down, giving you an excellent view of not only your sister, but your body as well, still standing there exactly as you'd left it, as you hadn't yet bothered trying to move it. Stepping back towards the center of the room, Jenna then proceeds to give you a slow and sexy strip tease, first removing her school jacket and shirt before unsnapping her bra, using it to tease you with tantalizing hints of her bare breasts for a few minutes before finally relenting and dropping it, revealing her magnificent pale orbs in all their naked glory, her soft pink nipples standing fully erect and appearing almost as hard as diamonds. After flaunting her breasts in front of you for a few moments, your sister then turns her ass towards you and proceeds to remove her underwear, sliding the undergarments down her legs inch by inch then stepping out of them, leaving her clad only in her tie, school skirt, knee socks and shoes. Still leaning forward slightly, Jenna grabs the back of her skirt, flipping it up, displaying her ass, the cheeks of which are full and round, like a ripe peach, her moist sex just barely visibly between her thighs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy this point, you're hard as a rock, and having trouble containing yourself, but you resolve to be patient, knowing that your sister has something good in store for you. As it turns out though, you don't have to wait long at all, Jenna turning to face you once more, making a come hither gestures, first towards your head, then your body. Seeing as your body was the only one of the two parts you could move right now, you caused it to step over to her, grabbing her by the tie as though it were a leash and pulling her in close, before exchanging it for a big double handful of tit flesh, groping and squeezing your sisters melons and teasing her nipples, causing Jenna to moan in pleasure, unzipping your pants and reaching inside, massaging your member and almost causing you to cum then and there, such is your state of arousal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two of you do this for a moment before Jenna pulls away from you, stepping back and retrieving the sword from the bed where she'd left it, using it to remove her own head, which she then ________________________?</span></div></div>",

The two of you begin to move, slowly and awkwardly at first, but with the familiarity of plentiful practice you soon get into it, your sister bouncing up and down in your lap with you thrusting up to meet her, Jenna's hands resting on your chest, providing her with extra stability. Your own hands don't remain idle for long either, reaching up and clutching your sisters breasts, gently squeezing them and tweaking her nipples, inspiring her to even greater heights of passion. \"Oh God yes!

Indy agrees, on the basis that he would be lonely without them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst up is Anita, Indy\u2019s archeologist colleague and love interest. Remembering what they saw in the film, Apollo and Millie track down a second German Shepherd, this one female (this is what Anita is in the film), bring her to the house and remove her head. Indy, meanwhile, goes off and acquires clothes similar to what Anita wears in the film. Using the body of a single woman with few connections as Anita\u2019s body, the three dogs attach the female German Shepherd\u2019s head to the woman\u2019s body and give her the identity of Anita.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext up is Karloff, the ex-mercenary cat. Apollo and Millie are used to cats - having quite a few in their neighborhoods - and it is not difficult for them to acquire a stray tabby cat for use with their Karloff. The cat has the same gender and body coat as what Karloff is depicted as. It takes sometime for Indy and Anita to get used to the cat, given the usual antagonism between cats and dogs - but eventually they manage. After all, film Karloff had an uneasy start with the rest of Indy\u2019s team after they first met him. The cat\u2019s head is attached to another single man with few connections, with similar body type to Karloff, and is given his identity complete with film Karloff\u2019s attire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next one, Roman, the language expert, is a little tricky. Indy\u2019s body is that of a 40-something man, his head is that of a five-year-old German Shepherd, Anita\u2019s body is that of a 30-something woman, her head is that of a four-year-old German Shepherd, Karloff\u2019s body is that of a 20-something man and his head is that of a two-year-old cat, but Roman is supposed to be elderly. This means creating a version of him requires a bit of thinking. Fortunately, Apollo, Millie, Indy, Anita and Karloff are able to acquire the body of a 70-something senior and the head of a 11-year-old Border Collie, which they combine to create Roman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last of the team to be created is Texcoco, the Chihuahua Maya-Aztec archetype. The team use the head of a two-year-old Chihuahua and the body of a short yet tough Latina/Mestizo woman in her 20\u2019s. The woman happens to have clothes that match what someone like Texcoco would wear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing this...</span></div></div>",

Jenna moves to pull your head off Apollo's body, but try as she might, she cannot remove it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not coming off!\" she cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried that with my body and it detached fine. Maybe it is only between the head and the original body that happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll try it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tries again, tugging and tugging, but fails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Jenna is about to go for a third try, Apollo on your body, Maxi on her owner's body and Millie on Michelle's body arrive with Maxi's owner on Maxi's body and Michelle on Millie's body. Seeing Jenna tugging at your head, Apollo does a quick swing of the longsword and decapitates her. You try to warn her, but by the time she hears it, it is too late. You can only watch helplessly as the three decapitate Kat and attach her head to Jenna's body. Jenna's head ends up on Kat's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing this, the dog-heads agree that Kat will stay and look after you, Michelle, Jenna, Maxi's owner and Goldie while Apollo, Maxi and Millie go off converting more dogs.</span></div></div>",

You, Jenna, Kat and Apollo have never had a problem with Sancho and Raul; despite the stereotypes surrounding pit bulls, Sancho has a sweet heart, never picks fights with neighborhood dogs or attacks children, and has actually played with Apollo on several occasions. In fact, you consider them to be the best of friends. Raul has never gotten into trouble in any shape or form whatsoever, and is involved in a legitimate job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSancho gets excited when he sees Apollo, Davis, Maxi and Millie approach. He loves their changes, and they can tell by his expression that he wants to join their cynocephalic pack. Happily obliging, Apollo removes the head of the pit bull with the longsword. Then they see Raul standing there confused and wondering why four dogs with human bodies are in his yard. Apollo gets behind him and removes his head, followed by placing Sancho\u2019s head on Raul\u2019s body.

The owner\u2019s name is Sanford Roberts, Jr. He just calls his dog \u2018Sandy\u2019, but you call him Sandy III because of Sandford\u2019s nickname.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dogs find Sandy III resting outside the house while Sanford reads a book on the porch. With Sanford obviously for the moment, Apollo sneaks up on him and removes his head with the sword. He then removes Sandy III\u2019s head and places it on Sandford\u2019s body, giving Sandy III control of the body. After joining the pack, Sandy III goes to your house and drops off a confused Sanford, who is picked up by Kat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dogs move on to Smokey Bear, a brownish Cairn Terrier living two houses from Sandy III. Smokey Bear\u2019s owner, Reyna, named him after the mascot of the US Forest Service, on account of a Cairn Terrier\u2019s bear-like appearance. The dogs cannot see any male humans on Reyna\u2019s property when they see Smokey Bear in the lawn, but they do spy Reyna, her Hispanic body looking fairly hot. The dogs thus decide to experiment with putting heads on different gender bodies, which means putting Smokey\u2019s male head on Reyna\u2019s feminine body. The other dogs distract Reyna by showing off their bodies, allowing Apollo to creep up on Smokey and decapitate him. He then approaches and decapitates Reyna, before placing Smokey\u2019s head on her body and vice versa. Joining the group, and not too worried about his feminine body, Smokey drops Reyna off at your house, where Kat collects her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next dog they go for is Jessica, the Maltese owned by middle-aged Mr Hood down the street. The dogs see Mr Hood walking Jessica down the street and hide from him, waiting in ambush. As soon as Mr Hood passes by, Apollo makes a swing and cuts his head off, quickly followed by Jessica. The dogs swap their heads. Accompanied by the others, Jessica takes Mr Hood to your house and hands him over to Kat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey next target Marshmallow the Bichon Frise, whose owner is your friend, William. They find William playing with Marshmallow outside his house. With the distraction, they sweep in, shocking William just before they relieve his body of its head. They then do the same to Marshmallow before placing his head on William\u2019s body. Once that\u2019s done, they go back to Kat\u2019s house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile dropping off William, the dogs spot Mr Wilde, the neighborhood stray mutt, outside the house. He regularly wanders the neighborhood looking for food. Many of the neighbors don\u2019t think kindly of him, but you have helped him several times. Apollo, spying an opportunity, makes a swing and cut off Mr Wilde\u2019s head. The dogs then locate a homeless man who would be say to disappear and remove his head, replacing it with Mr Wilde\u2019s. The dogs then go back to the house. Apollo signals to Kat, who goes outside. Initially unamused that her fellow dogs gave Mr Wilde a human body, she then relents and takes the homeless man inside. After this...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering that he left your car at Michelle's place, Apollo signals to Millie to drive him there, as well as signaling to Davis, Jessica, Marshmallow, Maxi, Sancho, Sandy III, Smokey Bear and Mr Wilde to wait for him. Millie gets into the driver's seat and Apollo the passenger's seat, and drive to Michelle's seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, your car is still there when they get to Michelle's house. Apollo is able to find the keys and is about to get in when Millie signals to him. She has just spotted Adam, the German Shepherd next door, and her young adult owner Geoff walking. Apollo moves in and decapitates Geoff and Adam, and Millie switches their heads. The pair convince Adam to join their pack and come back to your house for a while, bringing Geoff with them. This time, Michelle's car is left behind as the three get into your car and drive back to your home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour house is soon filled with dogs - Apollo, Adam, Davis, Goldie, Jessica, Kat, Marshallow, Maxi, Millie, Sancho, Sandy III, Smokey Bear and Mr Wilde. They have you, Geoff, Nina, Jenna, William, Michelle, Raul, Sanford, Reyna, Mr Hood, Maxi's owner, her brother and the homeless man outside in the yard. You try to figure out how to get through their predicament, as the dogs prepare their next move.</span></div></div>",

Enjoyed your walk with Apollo and his girlfriend?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxi is surprised to hear an anthropomorphic version of her brother Davis appear at the door and say this. Apollo and Millie are just as surprised - Davis is apparently convinced they are dating. The two of them blush - or, do a dog version of that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, yeah, Davis, it was a good one,\u201d Maxi says in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so. You have quite a good relationship with the two and Kat. Where did you go?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxi has to make something up. \u201cJust a few laps around the block. What about you? What have you been doing?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPracticing on my guitar. I\u2019ve got band practice tomorrow. I tell you, Barkheart is going to be great!\u201d Maxi and her friends - which is what they have become - have never heard of such a band, but pretend not to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I heard you once, you\u2019re quite a talented guitarist,\u201d Apollo says. He also makes something up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh thank you,\u201d Davis replies, \u201canyway, I\u2019m stepping out for air right now. See you in about an hour. Might feel the need for frisbee afterwards.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe steps outside. Maxi notices that Davis is wearing a red hoodie, cargo pants with a hole in it for his tail and running shoes. Under the hoodie, visible to them when he was facing them, is a \u2018Rock Dog\u2019 tee-shirt. What exactly is Rock Dog? Is it another group or something? He walks out onto the street and turns right. The other three step into the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat was that all about?\u201d Millie asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess that when I hit that button,\u201d Apollo says, \u201cnot only did Davis and us transform into Cano-sapiens, but reality warped as well.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCano-sapiens?\u201d Millie is confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m calling me, him and you girls. You heard of <i>Road Rovers</i>?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s this 90\u2019s show that John and Jenna (why did I use their actual names?) have a habit of watching. Basically you have five dogs who are gathered by this scientist to fight evil, and for that purpose they are put in this machine that turns them into creatures similar to us. They were referred to as Cano-sapiens.\u201d Apollo bases his comparison on the fact that their new body structures not only resemble those of humans, but also the Cano-sapiens from the show. Apart from the attire, the main difference is they and Davis have five fingers on each hand, like a human - the Cano-sapiens had four.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWasn\u2019t the Swiss dog in the group naked and less human than the others?\u201d Maxi asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen it as well?\u201d Apollo is surprised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, I have seen glimpses of it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxi walks into the kitchen and, through the window, spots Kat interacting with Goldie. Like them, Kat has turned anthro with fur all over her and her old tail appearing, and seems to be confused by the circumstances. Goldie thinks it is all normal.</span></div></div>",

Kat has no recollection of this...and neither does Apollo or Millie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis is confusing,\u201d Apollo says. \u201cCheck the Internet, one of you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxi opens a laptop and looks online.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApollo, I found something on Wikipedia.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo looks at the screen and sees the Wikipedia page for Balto, a Siberian Husky participant in the 1925 serum run to Nome, Alaska. Instead of the regular article (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balto\" target=\"_blank\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balto</a>), the main picture of the article he sees is a black-and-white one of Balto standing in the snow, dressed in winter clothing. The article says he was born in 1889 (not 1919) in Alaska, that he died in 1959 (not 1933) in Ohio, and that he fought in World Wars I and II.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought Balto was 5 or 6 when he made the sled run,\u201d Apollo says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLooks like when you hit that button, you made all of us age as long as humans,\u201d Maxi says. \u201cIn this world, Balto would have been about 36 when he did the run, and 70 when he died.\u201d She then checks out the article for Togo, the lead sled dog on Balto\u2019s team. It becomes clear a similar change has occurred. Togo\u2019s altered article says he was born in 1862 (not 1913), suggesting he made the run at 51, and that he lived to the ripe old age of 78, dying in 1940 (rather than 1929) in Maine. A check of the article for Hachik\u014d, the dog who kept waiting for his owner to return despite the man dying, reveals the idea of an Akita who lived from 1899 to 1959. Despite the chance, the story of him waiting for Hidesabur\u014d Ueno remains almost the same; apparently the anthropomorphic Hachik\u014d survived the fire bombing of Tokyo in the 1940\u2019s, where he served as a reserve soldier, and kept hoping that Ueno survived despite others insisting he was long gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHachik\u014d was always a loyal dog, even after reality changed.\u201d Millie comments, having just seen the article.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAlright, let\u2019s hunt down this \u2018Rock Dog\u2019 that Davis had a shirt for,\u201d Maxi says. A quick check reveals an all-canine, four-piece rock band from California active since 1991. The group consists of Blu Longarce, a Labrador Retriever who is the lead singer and guitarist; Bert Adams, a German Shepherd who plays guitar; George Roberts, a Golden Retriever who plays bass guitar; and Sam Longarce, Blu\u2019s cousin and the drummer. They apparently got together at high school in the early 1990\u2019s and had their first album and single in 1993. Nine albums are attributed to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s interesting. This world\u2019s Davis must have gotten the idea for Barkheart from them,\u201d Maxi says. At that moment...</span></div></div>",

He imagines that, for Davis, it would be interesting to live like a human, with the humanoid body frame. Other than the fur, the three dogs retained the human body frame from the head swap, complete with the plantigrade feet and the five-fingered hands. Apollo cuts off Davis' head, but nothing happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything else we should do?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe two more cuts are needed,\" Millie suggests.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I get you,\" Apollo replies just before he cuts off Davis' tail. He then removes the piece of neck from the back of Davis' head and moves it to the base - their heads kind of shifted to this position when they transformed. After this, the sword upgrades - a button appears on the side of the hilt, alongside the original button. Holding this button allows the user to duplicate body parts. Apollo notices that Maxi's former owner's brother has come home and is lounging in the garden. Testing the sword, the dogs copy the man's body parts, then after going inside, assemble them into a human body and attach Davis' head and tail to them, head to the neck and tail where the coccyx is (after doing a normal cut to the pants). When Apollo hits the button, Davis grows fur all over his body, just as Apollo, Maxi and Millie did, and his jaws adjust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, guys,\" Davis says, able to talk for the first time, \"I appreciate it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you want to become an anthro Aussie, Davis?\" Maxi asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you looked hot with that body, sis, but I felt you should give me a humanoid body just to be free.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, let's check up on the others,\" Apollo says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen Apollo, Davis, Maxi and Millie enter your house, they find Kat standing there waiting for them.

I looked at my hand, and this is what I saw.\" She shows them her hand. Like their hands, it is furry and human-like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a trace of a dewclaw in sight,\" Apollo comments. \"That growth in your ass, that was obviously the tail growing, right.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of the others?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goldie's still herself - for now - and the others...\"</span></div></div>",

Apollo takes pity to them, having lost their original bodies, and lobs off the heads. He then hits the button, which restores the four\u2019s original human bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, that was something else,\u201d you say, glad to be able to feel your real body again. Jenna and Michelle agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, what is Davis doing with an anthropomorphic body?\u201d your other female companion asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust wanted to join the fun,\u201d Davis says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, I get you,\u201d you say. You then notice the headless four-legged dog bodies, laying lifeless on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, I think we should those bodies before some notices.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood idea,\u201d Maxi says. After you, Michelle and Jenna dress up, Apollo and you take the body that had belonged to you and him, Kat and Jenna take the body that they had used, Millie and Michelle take the body that they had used, and Maxi and Davis take the body that used to be Maxi\u2019s. They are hidden somewhere you are sure they won\u2019t be found. The same thing occurs with Davis\u2019 headless, tailless original body. You then think of something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGuys, where\u2019s my car?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, I left it at Michelle\u2019s,\u201d Apollo admits. \u201cYou think we should fetch it?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201c\u2018Fetch it\u2019?\u201d You are amused by that. \u201cYes I think we should before it is impounded.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI guess so,\u201d Millie says. \u201cAnd I think we should take Goldie and the sword with us. If Michelle\u2019s sister is there, we can duplicate her body parts and use them to anthropomorphize Goldie.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat, the sword can duplicate body parts now?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cUpgrade. It can still cut off parts.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFive minutes later, you, Michelle and your dog copies have taken Goldie, the sword, Michelle\u2019s car, and are driving off to Michelle\u2019s house, leaving Kat and Jenna at your place and Davis, Maxi and their former owner at their place. When they get there, Apollo and Millie take the sword first. After restraining Goldie (and reassuring her), they cut off her head and tail. Then they give the sword to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThis button appeared during the upgrade,\u201d Apollo tells you, pointing the extra button. \u201cIf you hold it down it will allow the duplication. I\u2019m not sure what happens if you hold the other one down for long enough - maybe it causes a reset or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly afterwards, Michelle\u2019s sister Nina shows up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Michelle, how\u2019s it hanging?\u201d she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve had an interesting day,\u201d Michelle says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey, John, I almost didn\u2019t notice you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAh, no need for that,\u201d you say. \u201cListen, I have something to show you.\u201d Holding the duplication button down, you slice at her, duplicating all her body parts except the head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, how did you do that?\u201d Nina wants to know.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI swapped heads with my dog with the sword, and then he went off and did some cutting himself,\u201d you explain. \u201cThe sword must have upgrade twice, because when he came to get my head off and restore my body (and I say restore) he had grown fur all over him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I guess that explains the monster dogs,\u201d Nina says, referring to the anthro Apollo and Millie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMonster dogs?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know, from that book <i>Lives of the Monster Dogs</i>. Expect they don\u2019t look like something from the nineteenth century.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOf course we don\u2019t,\u201d Apollo says begrudgingly. He takes Nina\u2019s duplicate body parts from you, then he and Millie assemble a dog-headed human from these body parts and Goldie\u2019s head and tail. As the being starts to show signs of life, you hit the other button quickly. Goldie feels a twitch in her jaw and near the base of her neck, and the fur on her head and tail spreads to the rest of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWoah, what have you guys just done?\u201d is the first thing Goldie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust giving you an upgrade,\u201d Apollo says. Something is clear from the offset - Goldie is naked. The sword didn\u2019t exactly copy clothes. (Davis had been supplied with his clothes from what Maxi could find in his human body part donor\u2019s room.)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy I am naked, and you having clothes?\u201d Goldie asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, John and Michelle were clothed when we swapped,\u201d Apollo says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell that explains it,\u201d Goldie says. \u201cI\u2019m going to need some clothes, in case anthro dogs are treated like humans when it comes to nudity. Mind if I borrow some clothes?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Nina says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter Goldie goes inside, less than eleven minutes go by before she returns wearing a blue t-shirt and black socks. Your group notices that she is wearing one of Nina\u2019s skirts over bicycle shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou look like a canine tomboy with a girly streak,\u201d Millie comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMight as well be,\u201d Goldie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk then, I\u2019m going to get you some shoes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Labrador and the Golden Retriever get into Michelle\u2019s car and drive off, leaving you, Michelle, Nina nad Apollo standing there, pondering what to do next.</span></div></div>",

You realize just as you do so that you forgot to attach Adam\u2019s tail, but it does not matter, because while Adam\u2019s new body is growing its fur, the tail grows back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou ok, Adam?\u201d Geoff asks the now-anthropomorphic German Shepherd.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, Geoff, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Adam replies, now able to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWait, did you just talk?\u201d Geoff is bewildered by what happened to his canine companion. It\u2019s not surprising that Adam would say Geoff\u2019s name - he got him three years ago from a dog shelter, but the GSD is now talking like a 26-year-old.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, this is cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cEven cooler because it was the result of my little adventures,\u201d Apollo says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cReally, so that\u2019s not a suit?\u201d Geoff becomes intrigued. Apollo nods, to show that he is not a guy in a suit. At that moment, Millie and Goldie come back in Michelle\u2019s car, Goldie now wearing sneakers and both dog girls  carrying boxes of shoes. It becomes clear they did not just go to the shoe store, since they have bags of clothes shopping with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYour dogs were changed too?\u201d Geoff asks in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Michelle says. \u201cHow did you manage the shops?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was okay,\u201d Millie says. \u201cThe shoe store staff did think we looked unusual, but they let us pass.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd as you can tell, we were down in the clothes shop too,\u201d Goldie says. \u201cSaves us borrowing your clothes. There\u2019s some for Maxi, some for Davis, some for Kat, some of you - Apollo - and some for both of us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow did you manage to buy clothes?\u201d Nina asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle had her purse in this pocket when Apollo originally headswapped her, and Millie says she used it to pay for them and the shoes, much to Michelle\u2019s shock. Somehow, the dogs knew her credit card PIN. This gets you thinking - did all the cutting, button pressing and anthropomorphizing give the dogs alternative memories?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSpeaking of clothes, mind if I borrow some from you?\u201d Adam asks Geoff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk,\u201d is all Geoff can say. As Adam goes inside, Nina and Michelle help their dog versions with the shopping, while you and Apollo take the sword, your car and some of the shopping bags, and drive off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter chatting with the girls for a while, Geoff goes into his house. Adam is lounging around on the couch in the front room when he finds him, wearing a grey tee-shirt, brown jeans and grey socks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know something, Adam,\u201d Geoff says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat would that be, Geoff?\u201d Adam asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWith a body like that, I was thinking, you could become a lounger rather than just a pet.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s cool.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk then. It puts us on an equal footing then. I\u2019ve already suggested it to the girls.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you and Apollo get back to the house, where Apollo mentions something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was thinking, maybe we could make more dogs like me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to take myself and Kat around the place, copying the parts of everyone who has a dog and then creating more anthro dogs with those parts and the dogs\u2019 heads and tails. You okay with that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk, just send me the images of the transformed dogs, alright?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, you give Apollo your phone, tell him how you unlock, step inside and call for Kat. She comes out and walks off with Apollo, leaving you with Jenna and her phone. Over the next few 90 minutes, Apollo sends Jenna the images of anthropomorphized dogs. Raul\u2019s pit bull Sancho, Sanford\u2019s Great Dane Sandy, Reyna\u2019s Cairn Terrier Smokey Bear, Mr Hood\u2019s Maltese dog Jessica, William\u2019s Bichon Frise Marshmallow, Ana\u2019s pit bull Ion, Coriander\u2019s Great Dane Nyx, Ms Lovelace\u2019s Malionis Foxy, Gemma\u2019s Blue Lacy Azure, Emma\u2019s Corgi Junior, the local stray mutt Mr Wilde; all of them are anthropomorphized by copying human body parts with the duplication button, cutting off the dog heads with normal cuts, attaching the heads to the assembled human bodies and pressing the other button, giving them furry bodies and restoring their tails. Apollo comments in the captions that he had to remove the breasts and vagina from Smokey\u2019s new body, Ion\u2019s new body, Azure\u2019s new body, and Junior\u2019s new body, and the penis and testicles from Jessica\u2019s new body, before hitting the button in each case. The removed feminine features from Smokey, Ion, Azure and Junior were replaced with copies of Apollo\u2019s genitals, while the removed masculine features of Jessica\u2019s body were replaced with copies of Kat\u2019s vagina and breasts (of course, these dogs would be much more casual about nudity than humans, but would choose to wear clothes around humans).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes after the last message, Apollo and Kat come home, having called it quits on chopping and anthropomorphizing for the day.</span></div></div>",

You and your fellow human decide to let Apollo and Kat sleep in your respective beds, to get a feel for living life like a human. You change into your pajamas and climb into the bed. After a while, Apollo joins you, wearing only his boxers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMind if I sleep on the side?\u201d he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou probably need to,\u201d you say. \u201cWhen you were a regular dog, your tail was a sensitive pressure point. I imagine your new tail would be similar. That would mean you\u2019d have to cut holes in your new leggings.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re right, actually,\u201d Apollo says. \u201cThat was what I was on about. The car journeys were a pain. Imagine if you had a tail and it got compressed against the seat! I think I might have to start up a car modification firm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhy, so that you can make holes in the seats of cars anthro dogs buy to make their journeys more comfortable?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cExactly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he gets into the bed beside you, lying on his left side. You both fall asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, the girls get into bed in Jenna\u2019s room. Kat has had the same idea as Apollo, and sleeps on her right side. She wears just the bra and bloomers Jenna had on under the shirt and pants she had when Apollo originally headswapped her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you wake up the next morning, you find Apollo in your bathroom - and he\u2019s not doing anything human, despite being a humanoid. Instead, he is drinking out of the toilet bowl. He is cupping his hands, putting them into the bowl, taking them out and drinking from the cupped hands. You do not like the look of it - you clearly never thought of the toilet being used that way by anyone looking human.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cApollo, what are you doing?!\u201d you demand. \u201cThat\u2019s not a drinking fountain!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSorry, John,\u201d Apollo says, still able to talk. \u201cI was feeling thirsty and some of my old canine habits came back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo that explains it,\u201d you say sarcastically. \u201cOld habits die hard.\u201d You remember reading somewhere that dogs can handle toilet water because their bodies are better able to cope with it. Maybe this quality has come back in some way. After all, he is an <i>anthropomorphic</i> husky now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt breakfast, you and Jenna eat like normal humans, using cutlery, but the two dogs eat directly out of dog bowls which they put on the table. Jenna is not one bit amused, but Kat insists that it is a natural thing for dogs. The foods they eat are also more like the stuff you have bought for them in the past. After breakfast, they roll around in the grass for a few minutes before going back inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Jenna help Kat cut holes in her and Apollo\u2019s new leggings. During this, you observe that her head has altered to be more like that of a mix of a Siberian Husky puppy and a Labrador Retriever puppy. However, since dogs age faster than humans, you guess that this is because she has become a <i>teenage </i> anthropomorphic dog.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow old would you consider yourself, Kat?\u201d you ask. \u201cOne? One and a half? Two?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNineteen,\u201d Kat replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot fourteen?\u201d you react with amazement. You were expecting her to become younger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re thinking about it too generally,\u201d Kat replies sarcastically. \u201cEvery normal dog breed is different. With those old bodies they age differently. Apollo has a version of your body, so if he has changed as well he might be about seventeen had he always been like that.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go off to find Apollo applying flea powder to his head, and sure enough his head has changed to resemble that of a husky puppy. You wonder if the magic of the sword caused the dogs\u2019 head-ages to start changing (and their aging to slow down to human speed) after so much cutting yesterday. A few minutes later, he has dressed in a red shirt, blue trousers with a \u2018tail-hole\u2019 in them, white socks, yellow running shoes and a black hoodie; all bought by Millie and Goldie during their shopping spree yesterday.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMaybe we might end up getting alternative memories after this,\u201d Apollo says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I might as well end up being classed as Russian-American or something.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOk. I understand where you\u2019re coming from with that. Siberian Huskies are a Russian breed, after all.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time after that exchange, Apollo says goodbye to you, Jenna and Kat and takes the sword. As he is leaving, Kat suggests something to you...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan we play frisbee?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grab a frisbee and the three of you walk outside. As Jenna watches, you throw the frisbee at Kat, who catches it in her teeth. This carries on for several minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Apollo steps outside to find Millie standing there. She is wearing a blue jumper, green trousers and brown woman\u2019s shoes. Her head has altered to become more like that of a Labrador puppy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHi Millie,\u201d Apollo says, then kisses Millie in a dog-like way. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI was wondering if you were up for a date tonight,\u201d Millie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cFine then. I was about to go on a dog anthropomorphizing run today, but maybe we can do a limited number.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPerfect. First that, then the date.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cRight.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaxi comes out to them, still the same as before expect her head has adjusted to the age of the body it is attached to. Her humanoid body is somewhat older than Apollo\u2019s, Millie\u2019s, or Kat\u2019s, so her head now resembles that of a two-year-old Aussie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey guys,\u201d Maxi says to Apollo and Millie. She has completely lost the accent she originally had and is now speaking in an Australian accent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, Maxi, you\u2019ve changed quite a bit, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Apollo comments on her changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I guess so.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHow\u2019s Davis?\u201d Millie asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s ok,\u201d Maxi replies. \u201cHe and Foxy have gone to the park as of a few minutes ago.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe really likes that Malionis, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d Apollo comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes, and he considers this to be the chance to be really with her. He\u2019s okayed it with Ms Lovelace.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s great. Wanna join us in anthropomorphizing another dog?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSure, which one?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo replies...</span></div></div>",

Fortunately, the Clarks from down the road are on their annual road trip and happen to know where John's (your) aunt's farm is, and the three are able to hitch a ride in their RV. There are four members of the Clark family - the father; the mother; the son, Ethan; and the daughter, Amy. The three dogs, who do not disclose their nature to the human family, ride in the back of the RV. During the trip, they spy a companion. There is a German Shorthaired Pointer in the back of the RV with them, with a liver coat color. Thinking quietly, Apollo has Millie cut at him with the duplication button held down, which duplicates his body parts. The only parts she doesn't copy are his head and tail. As they are assembling the parts, Apollo has a look at the GSP dog's collar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'BRUNO'\" he reads, \"so this is a boy then. We got it right didn't we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So right, we did,\" Maxi says, \"Now we should be near the farm. Let's get this head off and on the body and then off the RV before they release what we have done.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey lie the assembled anthro husky body on the couch on its side, then cut Bruno's head off. Apollo says his goodbyes and thanks through the partition separating them from the Clarks, then he and the girls get Bruno's head onto the body. Then they get off the RV with Bruno's old body hidden in a box that Millie brought and quickly hit the button after closing the door, just before it drives off, continuing on its way. In the RV, Bruno's new body's fur changes color to match his head, and his tail reappears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the road, Apollo manages to find the path leading to the aunt's farm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your mother's name, by the way?\" Millie asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sierra.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey take the headless GSP body out of the box and dump into the bushes out of view of anyone. They then walk down the lane for a few dozen yards and arrive on the aunt's farm. The aunt indeed has a female farmhand who has a collie (of the Rough variety). They find the aunt resting in a chair. She does not notice them as they go into the house. The three discover that Sierra, Apollo's mother, is in fact still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Ideas for extra choices</b>:<br>\r\n- She has somehow turned anthro and seems to have a husband.<br>\r\n- She is still normal, and loves her son's changes.<br>\r\n- What happens when the Clarks find the transformed Bruno?</span></div></div>",

She is wearing female farmer's clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mother?\" Apollo thinks to himself. Then he notices something. Sierra seems to have a wedding ring on her new hand. Then he sees something else. Another anthro dog. He realizes that this creature is an anthro version of his father, Diego, who he never thought would be there. Diego is wearing male farmer's clothes, and what looks like a second wedding ring is on his finger. It looks like Apollo's mother and father are married!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father? This can't be.\" Apollo thinks to himself. Then he speaks out loud. \"Mom, Dad?\" The two older huskies turn and look at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, there's our boy,\" Sierra says, seemingly thinking this is normal. \"The one who went off to live with missus' nephew fourteen years ago. Come to visit, I take it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo, Maxi and Millie are confused. \"Fifteen years? It can't have been fifteen years,\" Apollo thinks to himself, but because he doesn't want to mention or allude to the sword his thoughts come out as \"Yes, that's right. And I brought some friends along.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, good thing, Apollo,\" Diego says, \"Good you were able to make some friends. Who are those pretty girls?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm Maxi Anderson, and this is Millie Lee,\" Maxi says. Apollo is confused - did she just assign herself and Millie surnames to play along with this? Millie is similarly confused, but Diego and Sierra are not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you, girls,\" Sierra says, \"Millie wouldn't happen to have to be related to Luna's husband, would she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's Luna?\" Apollo asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your aunt, sweetie,\" Sierra says, \"Diego's sister, up in town. She married a Labrador twenty-one years ago. They had a daughter named Katherine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Katherine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly. She's well, isn't she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually,\" Millie cuts in, \"can we go to the living room for a while?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, go ahead,\" Diego says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo and the girls slip away and sit down in the living room. They notice a family portrait that if you had been there you would swear you never saw before, labelled with a reference to a family known as the Chernoffs. This name gets Apollo interested - it seems like Anglicized Russian, as if a Russian family immigrated into Alaska before the purchase of 1867, stayed in the territory, changed their name and lived to see the gold rush at the end of the century. Apollo wants to inspect it, but he has other priorities first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you introduce yourself as an Anderson, and Millie as a Lee?\" he asks Maxi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I reckoned that giving myself a surname would allow me to fit in better,\" she says. Then she has an admission: \"...though shortly afterwards, I started getting these alternative memories. My brain tried to convince me that I had lived in Sydney for most of my life before moving here for university.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, that explains the accent,\" Millie says sarcastically. \"Does that mean that I potentially came from Portland or Cleveland?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Portland, Maine?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the 'Katherine' thing,\" Apollo says, \"Was mother refering to Kat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Possibly. Maybe when you hit the button, not only were our parents anthropomorphized, but reality changed so that they would think they had always been like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speaking of which, I'd like to know who these Chernoffs are,\" Apollo says. He has a look at the portrait and is surprised by what he sees. The image is of his parents, with him standing between them. It looks it was taken on a previous visit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's odd. I must have changed reality greatly. Though the button pressing probably doesn't affect other relatives right away, which would be why Davis wasn't anthro when he saw him after turning ourselves.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, so there's a change in you, isn't there?\" Maxi says. \"'Apollo Chernoff.' But you and your parents speak with American accents; Pacific Northwest I think, which probably means relatives in Seattle. That would make you Russian-American huskies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have a point there,\" Apollo says. He takes the sword and inspects a bedroom, finding an old shirt, old jeans that have a hole in the tail area, and old boots. This gives Apollo an idea, and he summons Maxi and Millie into the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here, Maxi,\" he says, giving Maxi the sword, \"you can create a clone of me for yourself. If mother and father don't see us at this they will think he is my littermate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, then,\" Maxi replies, \"one of you for me, and the other for Millie, then.\" She swings at him, copying all his body parts - this time, including his head and tail. She assembles the parts on the bed and dresses him in the shirt, jeans and boots, making sure to put the tail through the hole in the jeans. The new Apollo gets up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi guys, I'm new,\" he says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, this is interesting,\" Millie says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so,\" Apollo says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need a name,\" the other Apollo says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would Yuri do?\" Maxi says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"'Yuri?' I like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe house briefly rumbles around the four. They quickly go back to the living room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Apollo, Yuri, are you doing fine with your girls?\" they hear Sierra saying out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, we are,\" the two say, both confused and embarrassed. When he inspects the Chernoff portrait again, he notices that Yuri has appeared in the image next to him. Then he notices something else - he sees five more young huskies that he seems to recognize as members of the litter he came from. Apart from himself, the members of the litter were Axel (who appears in the image wearing farmer's clothes), Oscar, Tonya and Nova. Apollo was the middle child of the litter. Axel was born first, followed by Tonya, then Apollo, then Nova, and finally Oscar. Now all of them are anthromorphized - it must have been a delayed effect of hitting the button, at least 12 hours or something. If the anthro Apollo is 17 (and so would Yuri), then Axel would be 18 or 19, Tonya would be 18, Nova would be 15 and Oscar would be 11.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think about life ahead now. You have Millie, Yuri has Maxi. You think of anthromorphizing the collie in the yard, but first something happens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Note:</b><br>\r\n- The surnames here for Apollo, Maxi and Millie - for this chapter going forward on this path - have the first letters on names of their breeds. 'Chernoff' was inspired by 'Chukcha', an alternative name for the Siberian Husky; 'Anderson' has the same starting letter as 'Aussie'; and 'Lee' has the same starting letter as 'Labrador'.<br>\r\n- My ideas for other choices are: <br>\r\n- - Maxi gets a regular phone call from her parents in Australia.<br>\r\n- - Meanwhile, Kat gets a surprise visit from her parents.<br>\r\n- - Meanwhile, with Bruno and the Clarks...</span></div></div>",

She boils one and a half cups of the rice in a large saucepan in three cups of water in accordance with the instructions on the packet. After setting it aside, she heats a tablespoon of olive oil in a stockpot over medium heat, then she adds the turkey and cooks it for around 4 minutes, crumbling it as she goes.

A Labrador/husky mix ('Siberian Retriever'), Kat has been as much a companion to Jenna as Apollo has been to you. While Apollo has been walking around with your body and converting two female dogs into dog-humans, Jenna has been out on a long walk with Kat. You often found it amusing that a dog would be called 'Kat', as you consider it one letter away from 'Cat'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a few minutes, Jenna does not notice you with a mismatched body. It is only when you imitate Apollo's bark that she spots your predicament.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, John, what's happened to you?\" she asks, shocked by your head on Apollo's body. \"Where's Apollo?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's walked off on his own with my body,\" you say, still able to talk despite having spent several minutes to an hour on a dog body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found this sword that can detach body parts without harming or killing a living being recently,\" you explain. \"I decapitated myself and Apollo and placed his head on my body. He then decided to attach my head to his body and then he walked off. Wherever he is, he could been swapping humans and dogs as we speak.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really, John? Do you think they'll come for Kat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd say so. I think he's already gone for Maxi next door and Millie at Michelle's, and they are likely helping him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo, Adam, Maxi and Millie are busy putting Michelle into the trunk of Michelle\u2019s car, Maxi\u2019s owner into the boot of your car, and Adam\u2019s owner into the boot of his car, when they see a dog show up at their feet. It is Michelle's family's other dog, Goldie, a Golden Retriever. Millie reassures her adoptive sister that everything is fine and gets her used to Apollo and Maxi. The two already know Adam well, no need to get used to him. Then they see Michelle\u2019s sister Nina show up, and see her sister in the boot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood god, Michelle, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Nina asks, in shock over what she\u2019s seeing. \u201cWhat\u2019s your head doing on Millie\u2019s body? And why are there dog-headed humans outside carrying some sort of sword?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll explain it later,\u201d Michelle says. \u201cJust help me with this first.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNina tries to pull her sister\u2019s head off the body, but without luck. Seeing this, Apollo moves in and decapitates her with the sword. The dogs swap Goldie\u2019s head with Nina\u2019s head and make Nina join her sister in the boot. Soon, the dogs are on the room, heading towards your home - Apollo drives your car with Maxi in the passenger seat and her owner in the trunk; Adam drives his owner\u2019s car with the owner in the trunk; and Millie drives Michelle\u2019s car with Goldie in the passenger seat and Michelle and Nina in the trunk. In Michelle\u2019s car, the two dogs do not exactly pay heed to the conservation coming from the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- Michelle: \"What the hell is Millie doing? I don't want to be a dog forever!\"<br>\r\n- Nina: \u201cCalm down, Michelle. Everything will be fine. Except it's not fine now because Goldie has taken my body thanks to those things.\u201d<br>\r\n- Michelle: \u201cShe <i>is</i> one of those \u2018things\u2019 now; so is Adam from next door!\u201d<br>\r\n- Nina: \u201cThat was Adam on Geoff\u2019s body?\u201d<br>\r\n- Michelle: \u201cExactly!\u201d<br>\r\n- Nina: \u201cWhich of them started this? I\u2019m guessing it wasn\u2019t Millie or Goldie or Adam.\u201d<br>\r\n- Michelle: \u201cIt was that husky thing! He rocked with the sword and cut my head off. He was going to create an Aussie thing out of my body with an Aussie\u2019s head, but then this woman showed up. The Aussie\u2019s head must have been alive or something, for it used my body to grab Millie and drag her out. They then decapitated the women and made an Aussie thing out of her body with the Aussie\u2019s head, then the husky put my head on Millie\u2019s body, as you can see, and put her head on my body. They then went after and headswapped Adam and Geoff, then they spotted you and Goldie and that is why you are in the same boat as me.\u201d<br>\r\n- Nina: \u201cWait, did you say \u2018husky\u2019? I thought I knew the body. It looked like your boyfriend John\u2019s.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack at your house, Jenna is complimenting what to do with you and your mismatched body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think I can be removed from this body?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can try,\" she says. Kat comes in and looks at the ensuing scene. Jenna moves to pull your head off Apollo's body, but try as she might, she cannot remove it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not coming off!\" she cries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried that with my body and it detached fine. Maybe it is only between the head and the original body that happens.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'll try it again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tries again, tugging and tugging, but fails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as Jenna is about to go for a third try, Apollo on your body, Adam on his owner\u2019s (Geoff) body, Goldie on Nina\u2019s body, Maxi on her owner's body and Millie on Michelle's body arrive with Geoff on Adam\u2019s body, Nina on Goldie\u2019s body, Maxi's owner on Maxi's body and Michelle on Millie's body. Seeing Jenna tugging at your head, Apollo does a quick swing of the longsword and decapitates her. You try to warn her, but by the time she hears it, it is too late. You can only watch helplessly as the four decapitate Kat and attach her head to Jenna's body. Jenna's head ends up on Kat's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing this, the dogs agree that Kat will stay and look after you, Michelle, Jenna, Nina, Geoff and Maxi's owner while Apollo, Adam, Goldie, Maxi and Millie go off converting more dogs.</span></div></div>",

Their plan is fetch Davis, Maxi\u2019s brother, who is still on the property, and give him a human body, preferably from Maxi\u2019s owner\u2019s brother. As they prepare to enter the house, Maxi sees her owner's brother's car appearing in the street, and signals to the others. Maxi opens the door to the house and Millie runs inside to fetch Davis, while Apollo hides behind a pillar, sword in hand, waiting for him to get out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brother gets out and looks around in confusion. He must have seen the dog-headed humans. He calls out for his sister, but in vain, after which Apollo sneaks up behind him and decapitates him. The brother cries 'Shit!' as his head is removed. Millie finds Davis and brings him outside. Apollo decapitates Davis and puts his head on the brother's body, while Maxi puts the brother's head on Davis' body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dogs then decide to deliver the new human-headed dog to the other house. Kat appears at the door, now wearing an apron over her human body. Maxi's owner's brother looks at her in confusion as she takes him and brings him inside. The dogs convince Davis to join them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey next decide to swap the head of Sancho the pit bull (specifically an American Staffordshire Terrier) with his half-Italian, half-Spanish owner, Raul. You, Jenna, Kat and Apollo have never had a problem with Sancho and Raul; despite the stereotypes surrounding pit bulls, Sancho has a sweet heart, never picks fights with neighborhood dogs or attacks children, and has actually played with Apollo on several occasions. In fact, you consider them to be the best of friends. Raul has never gotten into trouble in any shape or form whatsoever, and is involved in a legitimate job.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSancho gets excited when he sees Apollo, Adam, Davis, Goldie, Maxi and Millie approach. He loves their changes, and they can tell by his expression that he wants to join their cynocephalic pack. Happily obliging, Apollo removes the head of the pit bull with the longsword. Then they see Raul standing there confused and wondering why four dogs with human bodies are in his yard. Apollo gets behind him and removes his head, followed by placing Sancho\u2019s head on Raul\u2019s body. Now in control of his master\u2019s body, Sancho places Raul\u2019s head on the pit bull\u2019s old body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce that\u2019s done, the seven make their way back to your house to drop off Raul to Kat. When they get there, the stray mutt known as Mr Wilde is outside, foraging for food. He regularly wanders the neighborhood looking for food. Many of the neighbors don\u2019t think kindly of him, but you have helped him several times. Apollo, spying an opportunity, makes a swing and cut off Mr Wilde\u2019s head. The dogs then locate a homeless man who would be say to disappear and remove his head, replacing it with Mr Wilde\u2019s. The dogs then go back to the house. Apollo signals to Kat, who goes outside. Initially unamused that her fellow dogs gave Mr Wilde a human body, she then relents and takes Raul and the homeless man inside. Apollo and the dogs then decide to...</span></div></div>",

The owner\u2019s name is Sanford Roberts, Jr. He just calls his dog \u2018Sandy\u2019, but you call him Sandy III because of Sandford\u2019s nickname.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dogs find Sandy III resting outside the house while Sanford reads a book on the porch. With Sanford obviously for the moment, Apollo sneaks up on him and removes his head with the sword. He then removes Sandy III\u2019s head and places it on Sandford\u2019s body, giving Sandy III control of the body. After joining the pack, Sandy III goes to your house and drops off a confused Sanford, who is picked up by Kat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dogs move on to Smokey Bear, a brownish Cairn Terrier living two houses from Sandy III. Smokey Bear\u2019s owner, Reyna, named him after the mascot of the US Forest Service, on account of a Cairn Terrier\u2019s bear-like appearance. The dogs cannot see any male humans on Reyna\u2019s property when they see Smokey Bear in the lawn, but they do spy Reyna, her Hispanic body looking fairly hot. The dogs thus decide to experiment with putting heads on different gender bodies, which means putting Smokey\u2019s male head on Reyna\u2019s feminine body. The other dogs distract Reyna by showing off their bodies, allowing Apollo to creep up on Smokey and decapitate him. He then approaches and decapitates Reyna, before placing Smokey\u2019s head on her body and vice versa. Joining the group, and not too worried about his feminine body, Smokey drops Reyna off at your house, where Kat collects her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next dog they go for is Jessica, the Maltese owned by middle-aged Mr Hood down the street. The dogs see Mr Hood walking Jessica down the street and hide from him, waiting in ambush. As soon as Mr Hood passes by, Apollo makes a swing and cuts his head off, quickly followed by Jessica. The dogs swap their heads. Accompanied by the others, Jessica takes Mr Hood to your house and hands him over to Kat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey next target Marshmallow the Bichon Frise, whose owner is your friend, William. They find William playing with Marshmallow outside his house. With the distraction, they sweep in, shocking William just before they relieve his body of its head. They then do the same to Marshmallow before placing his head on William\u2019s body. Once that\u2019s done, they go back to Kat\u2019s house.</span></div></div>",

You were almost a little disappointed to see Michelle's mother still fully intact, you'd half expected the reality change to have changed her too, though you supposed that that may have been too much wishful thinking.  \"Well well well, look who deigned to grace this humble abode with her presence!\"  Pamela said, checking her wrist which currently had a massive watch surely meant for Michelle's father's wrist strapped to it.  \"And only half an hour after curfew!  Why, it must be my birthday!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, mom.\"  Michelle answered sheepishly.  \"I just wanted to hang out at John's house for a little while.  I know I should've called and asked for permission first, but I forgot.  Honest!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hm.\"  Pamela responded, clearly not believing her obviously lying daughter.  Turning her attention to you, Pamela said \"Hello, John.  Since I was miraculously able to get home from work early, and wanted to surprise my wonderful, caring, rule abiding family with a nice homemade meal to show how much I appreciate their honesty and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ALRIGHT, I GET IT!  I'M SORRY!  I WILL TEXT YOU NEXT TIME!\"  Michelle interrupted, her cheeks warming your palms and her body stamping its foot like a child throwing a tantrum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"love.\" she continued, not batting an eye at Michelle's outburst.  \"Dinner is almost ready.  Would you care to join us?  I'm sure you must've built up a sweat, carrying that dumbbell with you all the way here.\"  She asked, emphasizing the 'dumb' in dumbbell to make extra sure that her wordplay was not missed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were, in fact, actually kind of hungry.  And Michelle's head actually was kind of heavy.  And you did want to spend as much time with your headless girlfriend as possible tonight.  \"Uh, sure thing.  Thanks, P-uh, Ella.\"  You said, remembering Pamela's preferred form of address at the last possible second.  She hated Pamela, as their family's last name was Von Hess which was close enough to Voorhees that by the time Pamela Von Hess was thirty she'd heard, by her own count, about a million and two <b>Friday the 13th</b> jokes.  She hated the nickname Pam for the much simpler reason of not wanting to be named after a cooking utensil, which just left her with Ella.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice save.\"  Pamela joked, though her tone indicated at least a little genuine appreciation for the effort.  \"Anyway, you two knuckleheads get inside and wash your hands.  Paul and Nina will be home in a few minutes, and once everyone's at the table I'll serve you.\"  She stepped aside, ushering you and Michelle inside.  Following your girlfriend's body as it plodded into the home, trying to keep enough distance so that Michelle's face and ass wouldn't bump into each other if she stopped abruptly, you were immediately greeted by the warm smell of beef stroganoff emanating from the kitchen.  Looking around the living room as you passed it on the way to the bathroom, you saw that just about everything was the same.  Same couches, same chairs, same tables, same TV, only two differences caught your attention.  One, there was a small, green ottoman set directly beside the couch with a suspiciously head shaped indent in its well worn surface.  Two, the red raincoat that Michelle always kept by the door had vanished, and in its place there was a poncho sharing the same red color as the old coat, along with what appeared to be a transluscent plastic bowling ball bag.  You supposed she didn't need the hood if she didn't have a head to cover, and she still needed something that would cover her relocated head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking to the bathroom with your girlfriend, Michelle washed her hands first, then took her head back as you washed your own hands.  You almost felt a little sad as you handed her head back, having enjoyed carrying around the cute, warm, and talkative little accessory, though seeing your headless girlfriend holding her own head at her side and giving you an embarrassed but happy smile was rather cute too.  As you finished drying your hands, you heard the front door of Michelle's house swing open.  \"Oh, look who's back from soccer practice!  And just on time!\"  You heard Pamela call from the kitchen, Michelle's eyes rolling at her mother's insistence on rubbing her nose in her incredibly minor act of rebellion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi mom!\"  Nina, Michelle's younger sister of two years, called out happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello my love!\"  Paul, Michelle and Nina's father and Pamela's husband, said shortly afterwards, shutting the door behind him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, let's get to the table before mom accuses me of being late to that too.\"  Michelle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing your girlfriend back into the main hallway, you saw Nina and Paul, and were forced to use every ounce of willpower in your body not to jump up in shock.  The sword HAD altered more than just Michelle in this new reality, for standing there at the end of the hallway was...</span></div></div>",

As you may or may not have noticed one of my stories, namely \"One Long Weekend\" is no longer appearing under my portfolio.  That is because after a very long time of being up for sale someone finally took it off of my hands, a writer by the name of <u>Kamen Rider Survivor</u> or dark-karas@Writing.Com.  He's quite good, you should check him and his stories out!  Also you can expect a new story from me soon, I hope when it's posted you all contribute, I'll pay you back for it with chapters!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that a traditional horizontal slice would be the best choice for the time being you cleave the blade through her abdomen, just above her hip line.  A thin line appears on the area where the sword had cut, though since time was still frozen Michelle didn't fall in half.  Clicking the button on the hilt again time restarts with a jolt, the line around Michelle's waist vanishes, and Michelle looks at you with confusion.  \"So, what's so special about this sword of yours?\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, uh, nothing.  I just thought it looked cool and that it's really weird someone would just leave it on the street.\"  You lie, confused as to what had just happened.  Michelle was still in one piece and didn't show any visible signs of being affected by it.<br>\r\n\"I guess so, but I don't really think it was worth dragging me all the way over here for it.  Anyways if you wouldn't mind I have to go, my stupid little sister is having a slumber party that I'm supposed to be supervising and if she notices I'm gone and rats me out mom and dad are going to kill me.\"  She said, turning towards the door.<br>\r\n\"Wait!\"  You say, wanting to check if the blade had done something.  \"Uh, would you care to leave me a goodbye present?  Something to keep me company since I'll be alone all night myself?\"<br>\r\nMichelle pauses, then smiles.  \"Well, I DID finally install that new steering system in my car that allows me to drive without my legs... and I haven't used it since I got it last week... alright, I'll keep you company tonight.\"  Michelle reaches into her pocket and pulls out a thick pair of gloves and pulls them over her hands.  She then reaches down to her waist and pulls up, causing her to split in half and verifying your belief that she could now do so at will.  Setting herself down on her gloved hand she begins hand walking down your stairs while her legs walked towards you.  \"Alright, don't try anything too crazy while I'm on the road, and make sure you give them a good wash later tonight!\"  She said as she walked out of the door on her palms, leaving you with the sexy lower half of your now bisected girlfriend.  Smiling at yourself you pat her on the soft expanse of her cut surface, causing her to snuggle up closer to you.  What to do what to do?</span></div></div>",

Are we walking anywhere in particular?\"  You ask, walking over to your girlfriend's pile of limbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nah, just walking around.  I just wanted to get some fresh air without all this weight on my shoulders.\"  She said, her empty shoulders shrugging.  Something you hadn't noticed before was that your girlfriend's body was now wearing some kind of harness system, with straps, latches, clips, and buckles crisscrossing her body like she was a <u>Final Fantasy</u> character.  Her coat, which was lying on the ground, was also a little different.  It was the same color and general style, but a little thicker and bulkier, like it was made to hide the strap system while she was wearing it.  It dawns on you that harnesses were there to keep her head and arms securely in place whenever she decided to wear them, and are momentarily astonished by the amount of fine details the reality warping power of the longsword had taken care of.  \"Something wrong?\"  Michelle asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?  Oh, uh, no.  Just... admiring my beautiful girlfriend.\"  You say, picking up Michelle's, noticing that it was heavier than you'd expected, and giving her a quick kiss on the forehead.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh barf.\"  She said, though her tone was clearly one of approval.  \"Just load me up in your bag and lets go.\"  She says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, sure.\"  You say, going over to your closet to collect your backpack.  Opening it up, however, you see that a new bag has found its way into your possession.  Next to your backpack was what looked to be a dog carrier bag with translucent mesh sides.  A few modifications had been made to the bag, however, such as a large and firm neck pillow sewn into the bottom of the bag facing forward, two lines of wide elastic loops had been sewn onto the bag's underside, and a large pocket affixed to the back.  Figuring out that this was the bag she was referring to, you take the dog bag and set it next to Michelle's pieces.  You load her head into the main compartment, pressing her snugly into the neck pillow so she wouldn't roll around, and shoved her arms through the set of elastic loops underneath the bag.  Putting your head and one shoulder through the sling of the bag, you stand up and realize just how heavy two arms and a human head weigh when dangling from your side.  No wonder Michelle wanted to take all this weight off.  \"Alright, lets go.\"  You say, wrapping your arm around the underside of the bag to try and better distribute the weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, aren't you forgetting something?\"  Michelle asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"  You say, looking around the room.  \"I... don't know?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My harness!\"  Michelle says, playfully twisting her waist and causing the loose straps dangling from her empty shoulders to swing around and lightly slapping your arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What about it?\"  You ask, looking the contraption up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're going out in public, take it off and put it in the bag!\"  She explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why?\"  You asked, genuinely confused.  \"You're getting your arms and legs carried around in a dog bag while your headless and armless body is following me around, it's not like you're keeping your condition a secret.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and it's not a secret that I'm wearing a bra or panties, yet you don't see me parading those around in public either.\"  She said, her comparison to undergarments putting the straps into a new light for you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the complex web of straps and latches and buckles, not knowing where you'd even start to take them off or how the hell you'd put them back on later, you decide to...</span></div></div>",

What we're we talking about?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, we were discussing your living arrangements while your parents are away on their trip.\" you lied, excited to realize that Michelle didn't notice anything odd about her limbless condition, or even remember you mentioning the long sword to her in the first place!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, that. Well, my mom said that it would be okay for me to stay with you till they get back, she likes you you know, and my dad agreed with her, though your parents have the final say in the matter.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I doubt my parents will object. My mom likes you too, and as for my stepdad, I don't think he really cares what I do as long as it doesn't inconvenience him.\" you said somewhat bitterly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Than it's settled then!

So babe, what would you like to do first?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, lets see. We're alone, in your bedroom, and haven't spent time together in days... seriously John, do you really have to ask? I want you to fuck me silly, right now!\" your limbless girlfriend orders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes mam!\" you happily agree, stripping both Michelle and yourself as quickly as possible and climbing into bed, pulling your girlfriend in close where you begin sucking on one of her tits, using one of your hands to tease the other while your remaining hand begins stroking her belly, slowly making it's way down towards her crotch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes! I like that! Give me more!\" Michelle begs, her tiny limbless torso squirming beneath your touch, being incapable of anything else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCeasing your sucking for a moment you reply \"More eh? Well, how about this?\" driving your hand down between where Michelle's legs used to be, slowly massaging her cunt for a moment before driving your fingers in one by one until all four are inside of her, your thumb continuing to rub away at her clit even as resume playing with her tits, driving your girlfriend into a frenzy of lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH GOD YES! IT'S SO FUCKING GOOD!\" she screams as she cries out in passion, her tiny body shivering and shaking as she orgasms, her pussy muscles clenching hard around your fingers, trapping them there as she convulses. Soon, the moment passes, her body slowly relaxing as she lays there panting, staring up at your with the profoundest look of love you've ever seen on your girlfriends face. \"Was it good for you?\" you tease, smiling down at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving you an incredulous look, Michelle exclaims \"Was it?! It was fantastic! mind blowing even! But you must be feeling really left out, so, how about giving me a chance to return the favor?\" she suggests, licking her lips in a way that leaves you with no doubt as to her meaning. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding eagerly, you roll the two of you over, positioning Michelle's limbless torso between your legs, her face mere inches from your crotch, making it easy for her to reach even with her substantial limitations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving her head forward, Michelle brings her lips to your cock, softly kissing all along your shaft starting at the base and working her way back up until she reaches the head. Tenderly kissing the tip, causing you to shudder in delight, she then opens her mouth, engulfing the head of your penis, which she slowly sucks on, teasing the underside with her tongue, and right then and there you nearly cum, all your concentration being necessary just to prevent it, but somehow you manage to hold on as Michelle sucks in more of your cock, working her lips down towards the base bit by bit, tonguing every inch, until she's taken the whole thing, her chin lightly pressing against your balls, which she teases you with wiggling her head side to side, caressing your nuts the only way she can in this position given her lack of total lack of limbs, before making her way back up towards the head of your member, still slowly licking and sucking away until she arrives at the tip once more. Releasing your dick from her mouth, she begins licking your balls, gently slurping them into her mouth one by one and sucking on them before letting go. Returning her attention to your cock, she deep throats it, taking in the whole thing in one go, sucking and licking away as she goes to town, rocking her head back and forth, up and down as she works your shaft at an almost frantic pace, and in the face of this much pleasure, there's nothing you can do except cum, most of your hot seed spurting down your girlfriends throat, though some small portion of it leaks out, coating her chin, throat and breasts in a thin shiny sticky layer of your man juice. once your finished cumming, Michelle sets about cleaning the two of you up as best as she's able, sucking up all the cum still stuck to your cock then licking up every bit of your sperm covering her face that she can reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, you sure like the taste of my cum, don't you babe?\" you inquired. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes! Johnny's cum is yummy!\" Michelle replies with a smile, nodding her head enthusiastically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well then, here, have some more!\" you said, using your fingers to scoop up a big glob that's found it's way into the hollow at the base of Michelle's throat, beyond her limited reach and placing it in front of her mouth. Without the slightest hesitation, Michelle accepts it, taking your fingers into her mouth and sucking on them, running her tongue over and between each digit as she seeks to devour every drop of cum she can find. Once she's finished you withdraw your fingers, continuing to feed her in this manner until she's mostly clean, before flipping her over and placing a couple of pillows under her ass as you prepare to enter her from behind. \"You ready babe?\" you inquire after positioning yourself, the head of your dick pressing teasingly against the entrance to her cunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than ready. Screw me with that big hard dick of yours! Fill me up with your hot man meat!\" Michelle begs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're more than happy to oblige, ramming your way deep inside of her without warning, causing your girlfriend to cry out, though in pleasure, not pain, as she's already plenty loose from your earlier teasing to accept you. Leaning over your girlfriends limbless form and seizing her tits, you begin to pump, shoving your rock had dick in and out of her hard and fast while roughly groping and squeezing her tits and pulling on her nipples, grunting and groaning from the effort as Michelle begins to moan with pleasure. \"Oh oh oh!

FUCK ME HARDER! <b>HARDER!!</b>\" she screams. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nResponding to your girlfriends demands, you redouble your efforts, fucking her at a frantic pace, both you and Michelle's breath coming in gasps, yours from the effort your putting into fucking and hers due to sheer sexual excitement as her limbless form shudders beneath you, cumming over and over in quick succession, her pussy spasming around your dick, clenching and releasing you several times a minute, but there's no way you can maintain this pace forever, nor any way that you can resist the sheer amounts of bliss induced upon you by your limbless girlfriends tight cunt and magnificent tits, and though you manage to hold out for nearly ten minutes, eventually, you just can't hold it in, your hot sperm spurting out, filling your girlfriends insides to the point that had Michelle not been on the pill she almost certainly would have became pregnant. Collapsing on top of her your roll yourself and Michelle over on your sides, spooning her, your arms wrapped around her waist, your slowly softening dick still nestled deep inside your limbless girlfriends cum covered cunt. The two of you simply lay there for a moment panting, struggling to catch your breaths. Finally, feeling you've recovered sufficiently you_______________________?</span></div></div>",

Loved? \"Man\" you thought to yourself \"Enough with trying to figure this out, I'll have time later to do that.\" With that quandry settled, you reach over to grab her foot, brushing the sole in the process. Laying on your side with your back to her head, you can hear her laughter, when an idea pops into your head. Reaching into the box, you find the pieces for her legs, and assemble both of her beautiful legs, complete with her feet attached to their respective ends.</span></div></div>",

Before long you had her roaring with laughter!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ACKhehahohahaGAHOKSTOP\" she yelled, practically out of breath...errrr, air? \"Ok, alright I get it, and thanks for that, I forgot how nice it was to have limbs.\" At this point she has a wild grin beneath her now wild hair from all the laughing. \"Would you be so kind as to give me a proper body?

And that applies to the foot, calf, and thigh. Once the thigh and calf are seperated, you'll need to either pry apart the seams or you can use a knife to seperate them easier. Once they're seperated, I'll lose feeling in them. For the foot, all you need to do really is either A) Halve the foot sideways or longways, and avoid splitting the toes, or B) Remove all the toes and then cut the remain chunk in half. If you'd like to keep the foot or leg whole, you can technically attach it to a flat surface, and then peel it off. Either way, it'll be considered detached and I'll finally be in sweet, sweet peace.\" She said almost contently, fidgeting on the spot with you running your hand up and down her leg. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, so if it gets attached to a flat surface, it can still be whole?\" You asked, surprised. Then, you decided that carrying the entire leg around was a bit cumbersome, so you removed the foot, and separated the rest into pieces. Conveniently nearby was the box Michelle was stored in, so you took the top part of the ankle and connected it to the box, when it suddenly went limp, and you could hear Michelle sigh in content. You grabbed a hold of the ankle, and pulled it off the box with a soft thhhwip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for that, now, if you want me to explain the rest of my body, would you mind if we used a substitute? I really enjoy being a head right now. It's oddly freeing. Now, I take it you had a few ex's, right?\" She motioned over to boxes with the bold <b>EX'S</b> on them, \"well, let's use on for a demonstration. Now go and get the head pieces, and I'll show you something neat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grabbed the box labeled \"Alice\", and found what looked like beautiful blond head...pieces. You brought the four pieces over to Michelle and laid them in front of her. \"Alright, you see this bits on the top part, her brain? You can remove all but the cerebellum and essentially have an obedient 'zombie' that'll do whatever you say.\" Taking a knife in your hand, you pry out the unnecessary pieces, left the cerebellum, and then assembled Alice. Once the last piece slotted in, you could see the first \"breath\", but Alice did little else, other than stare straight ahead, eyes wavering a little. \"Hmmm, obedient you say. Alice, stick out your tongue and wiggle it.\" Hearing the command, Alice stuck out her tongue and wiggled it, \"Alice, bite your tongue\" you commanded, and Alice complied. With an audible thunk she slammed her teeth down <b>hard</b> on her tongue. A little too hard, actually, as she managed to sever her tongue, and it lay on the ground, wriggling back and forth. Alice, seemed to grimace slightly, but remained stoic. Feeling your pants tent a bit, you reached over and grabbed her tongue and popped into your mouth, working your tongue over Alice's severed one, and you moaned. Twice, apparently. Mouth full, you jolted, and could see Alice's eyes closed in bliss. Apparently you left something there, since Alice can still feel her tongue as you play with it. You spat her tongue and said \"Alice, open your mouth\" and then you carefully stuck her tongue back in place, and then swiftly kissed her fully. You distinctly remember Alice being a good kisser, as both of your lips and tongues played over each other. After you enjoyed a strangely familiar embrace, you pulled away, noticing a faint smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoying yourself, are we?\" Michelle chuckled, \"Well, you oughta let me enjoy the \"bottom\" then sometime.\" she said, eying your tent. \"Well, if you like her so much, would you like to fully assemble her brain, or leave her as is, and move onto her body?\" </span></div></div>",

Soon your arms deep in the box looking for her other foot. Like the first one, it stretches in your hand after assembly; however this time when you rub her sole you get a slight chuckle out of her. With that you stick her big toe in your mouth and begin to suck on it a little. You can see the look in her eyes widen at first and then roll back as a smile beads across her face. \"how come I never let you do that before?\" she coo's at you. After a few more minuets of digging you now have both her calves and her upper thighs assembles. With a few more presses, you have two complete legs standing in front of you. \"there's only one thing left for you to assemble if you want to see them walk around\" she says with a bit of sass. With a renewed sense of urgency you peer into the box looking for the parts to her lower torso. Much like the face, there's 4 parts. The left ass cheek, the right, the front top and then in the box you find it. You can't help but blush looking at it. Her entire pussy is located on the last peace along with her anus. It's slightly odd seeing it all there. as you pick it up you can feel it's warmth in your hands. You run a finger over it, it's dampness slickening your skin as you do so; like it's anticipating what's about to happen.  \"you know that I can't feel that till it's all assembled\" she says to you.<br>\r\n\"I know,  it's just still interesting on some level to have it in the palm of my hand\"<br>\r\n\"Well once you put it in it's place it'll be more fun for both of us\" she says winking at you<br>\r\nWith that, you place her pussy right into it's slot and press down. Then grabbing her by her ass you take her torso over to her legs and press down hard making her lower half whole again. You back away for a moment as Leah takes her first steps. Her legs may be short but they are so very well proportioned. She does a slight strut around the room making sure her perky little ass bounces around giving you a show. You start to tent really hard in your pants and she sees it.<br>\r\n\"I wasn't very aggressive with you when it came tot he bedroom was I?\" she asks<br>\r\n\"well... \" you trail off.<br>\r\n\"maybe you should take your pants off, and maybe you should let me try to make things up to you?\" she says in her cutest seductive little voice. <br>\r\nWithout thinking your hand goes for your belt and in one swift move your pants come flying off.<br>\r\n\"Now come grab my head!\" she says, to which you respond very quickly. \"Pull me close and kiss me\" she says this time, and you do. Within moments your tongues are intertwined. She takes a breath and asks you to lie down on your back and you do so while still holding her head in your hands. Her hair pressed into her cheeks as you grip her to get a better hold of her lips on yours. With that, you feel it happen and with one eye you see Leah's lower half straddle you while your laying on the floor. Slowly she lowers herself down over your erect member. You feel the heat and moistness of her pussy as it envelops you. Slowly she starts to move her self up and down on you. Without thinking you reach back for her ass cheeks, dropping her head on your chest where it then rolled off to your side. All you hear is her panting and moaning though as you now help glide her lower half up and down over your manhood. The sound of her wetness and the clap of her ass cheeks fill the air as you move her faster and harder on your throbbing cock. You hear her moaning harder now and with one hand you reach over and grab her by her stump and pull her back in for another kiss. This time as you do, you feel yourself release into her lover half. at the same time you feel her clinch down as a orgasm rips through the two parts of her body. A slight scream leaves her mouth followed by a moan and then nothing more than heavy panting. You place her head down on your chest and you see her nestle in a little bit as the afterglow weights heavy on the two of you. </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>After a few moments of silent bliss, you pick Leah's head up off your chest and hold her upright. Her pale green eyes are still a little glazed but she makes eye contact with you. A smile creeps over her face ever so slowly and she blushes a little. \"well that was quick\" she says.<br>\r\nYou stammer a little but she chimes right in \"No, No... it's ok. It's been a while and this time it looks like I hit the right button; as did you I might add\" she says winking at you. This time your the one that begins to blush. <br>\r\nWith that Leah's lower half begins to stand up and you see the aftermath. \"maybe a shower is in order?\" you say.<br>\r\n\"Let me see!\" she says to you and with that you turn her head so she can see for herself. \"Yeah, that's kind of bad. You've had that one building for a while haven't you. Maybe I can help?\" she says licking her lips.<br>\r\nYou clue in pretty quick and sit up a little moving her head to your still slightly erect member. You move her hair out of the way of her face and grip it so you can truly tea bag her in some manner. Then with one hand on her cheek and the other holding her by her hair close to the back of her head, you begin to move her down onto your cock. She grabs a hold of it with her tiny mouth, sucking and licking away at the leftovers from your prior adventure. You start to harden once more. You grab her by her cheeks, moving her up and down as fast as she can take you in. You feel the explosion start to build. Soon you fill her mouth with another load and she swallows hard, making sure not a drip is left. \"Where was this version of you the first time?\" you finally ask.<br>\r\n\"I don't know. As a Build-A-Girl, my thought patterns are always that of the original copy. She might not be into those kind of things, but as something that's made to tailor the needs of my buyer, I can adapt when asked to or when I see a need. Apparently I didn't see the need for this change till you dissembled me. It gave me time to think and take a new approach.\"<br>\r\n\"Speaking of disassembly, I still have some work to finish reversing that process.\"<br>\r\n\"Well please don't let me stop you. I can't wait to wrap my arms around you again!\" she says with a warm smile. \"Plus, we could use a shower and it would be easier if I was whole.\"<br>\r\nNot one to argue with logic, you place her head on top of your bed so she can look down on you while you work. Her lover half  sits it's self down Indian style across from you. You decide first to assemble her hands looking for all the right parts. After finishing her right hand you decide to place it on your cock and she takes a firm hold of it, massaging it ever so slightly. You then assemble her left hand and place it on the floor next to you. As you do, she makes it move like 'Thing' from the Adams family. It scurries across to her lover half and goes right for her pussy. Her lover half lies it's self down legs at an angle and her hand starts going to town on herself. Leah's head starts to moan now as she's taking care of herself and you at the same time. \"Look, I'm multitasking\" she says with a slight chuckle. <br>\r\nYou do your best to focus on the task at hand, but it's difficult with the sight in front of you while having your own member taken care off at the same time. You manage to assemble the rest of her lower and upper arms and then you go to work on the remaining final part, her upper torso. It seems to have the most parts. You start with a lower part consisting of her belly button and from there you find a couple more chunks building her lower and upper back up to her neck. A couple more pieces build up to where her breasts would be. Then you begin to assemble her C-Cup mounds. Each one seems to have a upper and lower piece and a side piece for each and then a center piece. once assembled they moves freely as one, but they were still missing something. Sitting alone in the box now was the last two pieces, her nipples. You grab them each and fit them right onto the tip of each breast. Upon pressing the last one in you hear her moan a little. <br>\r\n\"time for final assembly\" you say taking her hand off of your cock. You press her hand firmly onto her wrist and then attach the lower arm to the upper arm. You then take her arm and press it to her shoulder where it reattaches very quickly. You feel a tap on your side and see that her left hand has made its way back to you. Picking it up you notice that her fingers are wet with her own juices. Not being able to help yourself at all, you pick her hand up and suck off her fingers. Leah moans a little as you do this and she reaches up with her assembled right arm and grabs the hair on the back of your head. After cleaning up her hand you assemble it with it's matching parts and place it on her other shoulder. Leah is now in three pieces in front of you and the possibilities of this scenario are endless! What to do next you think to yourself...</span></div></div>",

Her tits press into your chest and with that you stand up, her clinching on to you. By this time, her legs have managed to get up and have walked over to you, standing there at attention. Slowly you place her upper half onto her lower half and press down slightly. Stepping away you take in all of her body, her tiny little frame with it's perfect hourglass shape begins to stretch and bend for the first time. \"God, it feels so good to move again. I didn't know how much I needed this till just now!\" she chirps. Suddenly, she jumps up and down a couple of times. <br>\r\nYour mind falls into a rut as your focus turns to her tits jiggling as she moves. \"Uh...\" you mutter.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, just making sure it's all attached.\" she says to you. <br>\r\nWith that, her body turns around and walks over to the bed, the sight of her plump little ass is mesmerizing as she moves. Upon reaching the bed, she reaches down and picks her head up and positions it into place. \"There, all done\" she says turning around to you. She then walks over to you and wraps her hands around your neck and pulls herself up to your face for a deep kiss. Not being able to help yourself you reach around and pull her up by her ass. Upon doing so she wraps both her legs around you. You stand this way for a moment kissing each other passionately, moving your tongues in and out of each others mouths. Finally she pulls away and then nestles into your neck, still holding you tightly.<br>\r\n\"Are you ready for that shower?\" you ask.<br>\r\n\"More than ready!' she squeals.<br>\r\nShe lets go and the two of you walk to the bathroom where you start the shower. <br>\r\n\"Maybe a hot bath would be better\" she says to you. \"That way I can answer any questions you might have about my abilities that we never discussed the first time\"<br>\r\n\"That sounds fair.\" you say, although the though of her soapy ass pressed into you in the tub was all you could really think of.<br>\r\nAfter drawing a hot bath you slide in first and she follows nestling right into you. \"So what else can you do?\" you ask her.<br>\r\n\"Do you want the usual start up message?\" she asks<br>\r\n\"Start up message?\"<br>\r\n\"Yeah, the one that I said when I was first turned on.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, no. That's not necessary. I think I can maybe narrow my questions down without a need for a full manual.\"  you lie, not remembering the first time, but not wanting to hear it again. \"Is it possible to reboot you, like cleaning your memory?\"<br>\r\n\"It is\" she says with a sadden tone. \"Are you thinking of taking me apart again?\"<br>\r\nYou realize she's actually really upset about this question. \"No, I wouldn't do that to you again. I guess I don't see you as a toy. You seem really human when it comes to emotions and I was just curious as to how far the programing goes.\"<br>\r\n\"Well I am a toy, but I really like that you don't see me like that. Makes my connection to you deeper. The deeper the connection, the more I can do. There's actually a lot built in that is unlocked when a connection is made. Truth be told, taking me apart and then rebuilding me the way you did was a turning point. A reboot could have been made then if needed, say if you wanted to give me away, or ship me back. But doing what we did took me to a next level just as being disassembled gave me time to open up those levels.\" She turns in the tub slightly to look up at you then grabs your one hand and places it on her breast. \"I'm not as afraid of being taken apart and played with as much now. Go ahead, pull on my tit.\"<br>\r\nyou give her tit a pull and with that the whole squishy mound comes up in your hand. <br>\r\n\"Instead of following the directions to take me apart, now all you have to do is ask and I'll pull apart any way you want, when you want. Or even when I want\" she says pulling her own upper half off her lower half so she could fully turn around and look at you. <br>\r\nYou feel the blood once again begin to flow to your member <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With that, she takes her boob and places it back on her chest. Then, turning around, she reattached her upper half to her lower half. <br>\r\nAt this point your mind is curious as to just what exactly she can do. \"I think it's time we went back to the bedroom and went over everything that your capable of.\"<br>\r\n\"I'd love to show you... maybe you'd be able to fully adjust some of the personality traits of the original Leah that you don't like.\"<br>\r\n\"How do I do that?\" you ask as Leah climbs out of the tub and reaches for a towel. <br>\r\n\"Well, like I keep saying, technically i'm a toy. You can actually hook me up to a computer once you've gained clearance and adjust my likes and dislikes within reason.\" <br>\r\nMost of what she's saying is passing over your head slightly as you watch her start to dry off. The tought of her as just a toy and not a actuall person seems silly watching her. \"Gained clearance?\" you finally manage. <br>\r\n\"Well yeah, which you have as of today... I can't realy explain why it unlocked, other than you coming back to me the way you did; but you totally have clearance now. Let me wrap a towel around my hair and then we can head back into your room. I'll show you how it's done. It's actuallty quite easy.\"<br>\r\nFollowing suit, you get out of the tub yourself, grab a towel and follow her back to your room. she quickly sits down next to your desktop. \"If you don't mind starting it up,\" she says glance at it. You quickly turn it on and then look at her for the next instruction. \"Now, take the USB cable from your iPhone and we're going to use that.\"<br>\r\n\"How?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm going to remove my face, and when I do you'll see a small conector just lioke on your phone. Just attach one to the computer and one end to that and then wait.\"<br>\r\nYou figure things can't get and weirder, so you turn on the computer. As you do leah reached up and grabs her face at her cheeks, closes her eyes and mouth and then removes her face from the top of her forhead all the way down to her chin. You take the face from her and look, and sure enough, there is a small usb port dead center of where her brain would be. Its weird, because where her face was is just a flat grey area.. no hint of a mouth or eyes. Like everything that would exist is only possible when her face plate is in place. You remark at it for a second and then realize shes tapping her foor again. You quickly plug in the USB cable and after a few seconds a image of leah walks out on your computer screen just like a virtual girl. You can't help but notice that Leah is wearing the towels on your computer screen too. <br>\r\n\"If you want to start just go ahead and double click my head\" she then says to you through the PC speakers. You ablige and go right into it. By double clicking her head it brought up a larger image of her face and a small menu system with a series of folders. One marked food, one marked clothes, one marked hobbies, and another marked fetishes. Oh god... what to change first??</span></div></div>",

You hadn't expected this particular request, and weren't quite sure what to do about it. \"I ah, my-my mom...\" you stammered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your mom isn't here. She's out shopping remember? No John, it'll have to be you. Come on, please help me out here!\" Anna pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat sealed it then. You couldn't very well allow your best friend to wet herself, especially not while she was lying on your bed (ewe!), so you'd have to help her, no matter how embarrassing it might be for the two of you. Picking her up, one hand beneath her hips, the other wrapped around her chest just below her boobs, you carry her across the hall to the bathroom. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, now what?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're going to have to strip me.\" Anna explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Strip you!\" you exclaim, somewhat loader than you'd intended, then freeze, expecting your dad or your little sister to burst in at any moment to see what you're going on about, but after a few seconds you relax and more calmly, you ask \"What do you mean strip you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think I mean? I mean, you don't seriously think I can go while I'm dressed do you?\" Anna answered, rolling her eyes at the stupidity of your question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, no, I guess not.\" you answered lamely, a bit angry at yourself for asking such a stupid question in the first place. Setting Anna down on the counter next to the sink, you grabbed the waistband of her shorts and underwear and pulled them down her abbreviated hips, and off, leaving her lower half totally exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try not to stare too much, but it's difficult, as your a typical teenage boy as far as girls are concerned, and your childhood friend is fairly attractive. When you were kids, you used to think of her almost like a sister, but in recent years  as Anna's blossomed into a young woman, you've often found yourself having thoughts and feeling about her that are far from sisterly, and having her lying in front of you like this, half naked and totally helpless due to her lack of limbs, certainly isn't helping you keep your cool.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoticing your staring despite your trying to hide it, blushing cutely, Anna says \"John, can you please stop staring? This is embarrassing enough as it is.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sorry. I couldn't help myself.\" you apologized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, I get it, teenage boy, naked girl... Look, just put me on the toilet already alright?\" she instructs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yea, sure.\" you say, quickly snatching her up, your fingers accidentally brushing her clit in the process, causing Anna to gasp and squirm in your grasp from the close contact with her most intimate areas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What? Did I do something wrong? I didn't hurt you did I?\" you demanded, slightly worried that you might have injured your friend somehow, having somehow failed to notice what you had done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"N-nothing, I-I'm just a little sensitive, that's all.\" Anna stammered, looking a bit flushed from the incidental contact of your hand and her genitals.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. OH! Feeling a bit needy are we?\" you teased, once what she'd said had fully registered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, well, it's not like I can do it myself, and asking my parents for help would be way, <b>way</b> too awkward. It wouldn't be so bad if I had a boyfriend, but, well, you know.\" Anna said, glancing sadly down at her limbless body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I don't know. Besides, don't you have a boyfriend? What was his name, Kevin, or something?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow it was Anna's turn to stare. \"John, what are you talking about? I've never had a boyfriend, and probably never will, since nobody could ever want a limbless freak like me around.\" she said, a few tears leaking from he corner of her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, that's not true! I'm here aren't I?\" you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well yea, but you're my friend, not my boyfriend, it's not the same.\" Anna explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess not.\" you concede, while privately thinking that being her boyfriend wouldn't be such a bad thing, especially while she's like this, both horny and helpless. You're not to worried about pissing off your current girlfriend Michelle either, as _________________________?</span></div></div>",

While you know that you changed reality, in this new reality you've always been able to do this.

This will make it so much easier for us to do well on the quiz!\" She splits into two and then without warning, her left side merges with your right and her right side merges with your left. You hear Anna's thoughts as though they were your own: <i>If I can pool together our analyses of the story, then we'll both have a better understanding of the material!</i> Or were they your thoughts? You couldn't tell, as the sheer amount of information being taken from your brain and given from the other brain was astounding.

You're not sure what just happened but you start to realize that the information you got from Anna has melded with your own, resulting in a cohesive understanding of every subject. You realize what this could mean for both of your friendships, and for your grades in school. In the back of your head you realize that you got some of her memories and she got some of yours. You find that one of them is her actually showering, and you feel like you're in her naked body for a moment, to the point where looking down at yourself now, the fact that you are a boy freaks you out. She seems similarly freaked out too, because when you were merged she could sense your shock and it carried over to her now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What... I'm sorry. That was on a whim. Seriously. Ahh.\" She says in a daze. \"At least now we're both ready for the quiz tomorrow, with double the knowledge.\"<br>\r\nThe two of you laugh.

You just said that too.\" You figure that the merging, aside from merging some of your knowledge together, also merged your personalities a bit as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think our personalities kinda merged too-\" she says. You almost say it but as soon as she started you stopped talking. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand in silence. You remember what it was like being merged with her and you love it, and you love the memories you got of being her as well. You can tell she wants to do this again, and maybe try out some other things with your half you-half her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter another minute of awkward silence, she's about to go, but you interrupt by saying:</span></div></div>",

You ponder what to do with them, then go for it and decapitate Kat. Once time freezes, you quickly get Kat's head to where your headless mother is and attach it to her neck. You could press the button now, but you decide to give Apollo your dad's head, for the fun. You decapitate your dad, then decapitate Apollo. Apollo's head ends up on your dad's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen time resumes Apollo's body, Kat's body and your dad's head vanish. Apollo's head and Kat's head remain attached to the bodies for your father and your mother respectively. Since reality has changed they will have become your parents in this world. You go to where the pictures are, and see your parents on their wedding day - or rather, Apollo and Kat on their wedding day. Reality changing means they have taken their places. You look at the family photo and see that...</span></div></div>",

Since your new father Apollo is a Siberian Husky headed man, you reason that you have 3/4 Siberian Husky features and 1/4 Labrador features. You go to the mirror in the bathroom and see your new grey and black head, canine ears and everything. You notice that one of your new eyes is blue, and the other is brown. You have heterochromia of the eye now!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Interesting,\" you say briefly before realizing you are talking normally. You let out a bark of embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't think that would happen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon realize your sister can hear you.

You wonder why she said that. Humans don't normally get fleas. Dogs do, however, so maybe fleas are like lice to cynocephalics. Either they are the same as actual dog fleas, or else there are little vampiric humans with flea heads about an eighth of an inch high living on your head. You look in your bathroom and eventually find something. Procter and Gamble Flea Powder for Cynocephalics. You didn't think P&amp;G made flea powder. Either way, you give some to your sister, who thanks you and walks off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering what else has changed you look at your phone and see an image of your girlfriend Michelle.

You locate your sister in her room, and lobe her head off. You cut your/Kat's head off and reattach it to her body. Your own consciousness stays in your body. You go off and find the other dog of the house, Apollo, who belongs more to you. He is a husky, unlike Kat. You cut off Apollo's head off and attaches it to your body. You restart time, and see Apollo's body disappear before your (new) eyes. In her room, your sister's head vanishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou discover that your legal name is now John Apollo _______, and that Apollo's subconsciousness and soul has merged with yours. You discover you can talk again despite having the wrong head - \"This is so weird, even if I have the wrong head\". You go back up to your sister's room. Kat has embraced the sister role well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, hey, Apollo,\" Kat says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stop dead in your track. That is your sister's human voice coming out of Kat's canine mouth. \"You can talk now?!\" you think to yourself, but because you don't want to make her suspicious, your thoughts come out as \"Oh, hey, Kat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how is my little husky brother doing?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Doing fine.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walk out of the room and think about what memories you might have now. You look at a picture of your mother and discover she has turned into a husky-headed woman. Apollo's subconsciousness would recognize that head as the head of his mother Sierra, but she had been living on your aunt's farm before this. Did her original form vanish when you altered reality? You don't really have time to think about this, because you notice in family pictures from when you and Kat were younger. A picture features a puppy-headed Kat when she was younger, but instead of your mother and father, two people of similar body frame appear; the man has a husky's head, and the mother, whose body looks like your mother's, has a Labrador Retriever's head. You then notice a image of you and Kat with your father. Your mother (Sierra now) appears in the image, just above you. Wait, did you make Kat your <i>step</i>sister? This is so odd.

That means your mother is her stepmother now. With that explained, you take the longsword and get into your car. No one bats an eyelid to a cynocephalic husky driving a car because reality has changed. You think of making everyone on the street dog-headed later, now that you are starting to enjoy this. For now, though, it is Michelle who is now important.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou get to the house and see Michelle there with her dog Millie, a Labrador Retriever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Apollo,\" Michelle says as you get out of the car. Thinking about what to do now, you decide to give Millie Michelle's body and make her your girlfriend. You cut your hand off, then after reattaching it, you go up to Michelle and Millie - who, along with everyone around you, are frozen in time due to the sword's magic - and decapitate them both. You place Millie's head on Michelle's body. While there's time you find Michelle's sister Nina, decapitate her and place the head of Michelle's family's other dog, Goldie the Golden Retriever, on the body. You do the same to their neighbor Geoff and his German Shepherd Adam. You go back to where you were before cutting your hand and press the button. The bodies of Adam, Goldie and Millie, and the heads of Geoff, Nina and Michelle, vanish just like your head, your sister's head, Apollo's old body and Kat's old body. Their personal details change as well due to the sword and their subconsciousness and souls combining with the dogs - Michelle's middle name (and nickname) becomes Millie, Nina gains the nickname Goldie, and Geoff's name minus surname becomes Adam Geoffrey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Millie,\" you say to Michelle/Millie, mentioning nothing of the sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, I thought you weren't answering for a few minutes,\" Millie says. \"I was wondering how you were.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine thanks. How's Goldie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goldie's fine. I think I mentioned this to you before but she's been fitting in nicely as a Golden Retriever in a Labrador family ever since we adopted her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't remember her ever saying this to you, or Nina/Goldie being adopted instead of being born into the family, but decide to play along with it. Then again, why should you argue at this time? You slid into the new world nicely when you spoke to her and called her Millie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's great. I know, before you ask, I've said that several times before. And what of her relationship with Adam?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're going along very well. Anyway, anything arranged for today?\"</span></div></div>",

You decide that your fastest &amp; most convenient option was to use The Longsword on your next door neighbours, the Smiths.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou approach and knock on your neighbour's door, to which you were shortly then after greeted by 47 year old Mr Smith. Before he could even respond to your unexpected visit, you swing the Longsword through Mr Smith's neck, separating his head from the rest of his body and immediately freezing time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith time now frozen for the next 5 minutes, you take advantage of the situation to carefully lift Mr Smith's head away from his neck and proceed past his now headless body and into the house. Inside you find Mr Smith's wife who is 45 years old aswell as his two daughters, who are 18 and 20 respectively. You swiftly relieve them all of their heads then leave the house carrying them all before time resumes again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you walk home, you struggle to carry all 4 of your neighbours heads aswell as the Longsword itself. You decide that next time you will make sure to bring something to help carry them. You make it back to your room and sit your new heads down on your desk next to Emma's. Though you still have some frozen time left, you decide to press the hilt and resume time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce time resumes, you observe the heads on your desk. They all appear emotionless just like Emma's was earlier. Their eyes gaze at you briefly before looking around the room they now find themselves in. You take their lack of a proper response as a good sign.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCurious about how the Smiths are coping without their heads, you walk back outside and down the street. You see Mr Smith standing at the front door where you left him, looking a little confused as to why he is there. He waves in your direction as he notices you. As you wave back, you spot Mrs Smith appear behind him, curious as to why her husband is at the door before walking back into the house. As expected, the Smiths are completely unaware that they all had their heads stolen just moments ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPleased at the result of your handiwork, you rush back home to retrieve an old sack that had been laying around the garage. You then head on down the street again to add more heads to your collection. You repeat the same process as you had done with the Smiths, taking the heads of the Kennedy's, the Malcolm's and so on, stopping by your house to drop off some heads once the sack became full or too heavy. By late afternoon, the entire neighbourhood had been deemed headless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack in your room, you look over your new collection of around 50 heads. You had collected a diverse range of heads of different ages, genders and ethnicity. You have certainly outdone yourself. With so many heads you don't know where to begin or how you are going to explain this.</span></div></div>",

The most notable change was the attachment of a skin colored ribbon to the very edges of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" her face said with ease, despite feeling very rigid in your hands, \"Now hand me to my body.\" You gave the face to her body, who then pressed her face against the blank stretch of skin as she had done earlier. Instead of attaching like last time, it instead fell on to the floor. \"Hey,\" she said \"why isn't this working?\" \"It's probably because se made your face into something you normally place on your face, so it makes sense for it to not be attached.\" Her body reached down and put her face back over the blank are, this time fastening it in place with the ribbon. As she finished tying the ribbon into a knot, the ribbon suddenly changed colors to match her hair and head, and the knot disappeared too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle then reached behind her head, and lifted both the ribbon and mask off with ease, handing it to you she said, \"Put it on.\" Not wanting to disappoint her, you place the mask over your face (surprised that you could still see and breathe, as the backside of the mask had no holes whatsoever) and tied the ribbon, with the same effect as on her happening to you. Your girlfriend's body jerked in shock, as both she and you realized you now had full control over her face, and that she had no way of talking to you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" you said to her body in her voice, \"I'm going to you off now, this is too freaky for me.\" You reached up and ...</span></div></div>",

Normals boring! I want to see more of what this thing can do!\" Michelle says excitedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis causes you to laugh. \"Yea, I guess I should have expected something like this for a NBM(natural body magic) freak like you huh? Okay, I think I might have an idea, but it's sort of extreme. You may not want to go through with it.\" you cautioned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah!

I don't care how extreme it is, if you think I'll enjoy it, I want to try.\" Your girlfriend answers quickly without the slightest hesitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's all I needed to hear. Wait here, this will only take a moment.\" you said, heading towards the storage room in search of a particular  box, one containing old coats destined for charity. It's not the coats you want though, but the Velcro fasteners attached to them. Pulling out your pocket knife, as the sword is far too large and unwieldy for this job, you quickly slice through the seems holding the Velcro in place before hurrying back to your room and your waiting girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting what it is you're carrying, Michelle gives you a puzzled look. \"Velcro? What the heck are you going to do with that?\" she ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a surprise. A pleasant one I hope. Of course, if you're felling nervous, you can always back out, I won't think any less of you for it.\" you answered mysteriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope, not backing out. You've got me way too curious now for that.\" Michelle responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then, in that case, I need you to sit down and hold out your arms.\" you instructed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like this?\" Michele said, sitting down on the edge of your bed and holding her arms straight out in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, that's not quite right. I need you to spread your arms out to your sides, I need to be able to see your shoulders.\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle quickly corrects herself. \"Like this?\" she asks once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, that's perfect, just hold that pose.\" you answered, then before she can ask any more questions, you raise the sword high above your head, take careful aim, and bring it swinging down, cleanly severing Michelle's left arm at the shoulder, followed by the right arm, leaving her essentially helpless, both arms laying on the bed on either side of her. Once they've been removed, you take a couple of the Velcro strips you'd gathered earlier, attaching one side of each strip to your girlfriends armless shoulders, and the other side to the shoulders of her severed arms, then wait a moment before removing them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, so now my arms will be like Velcro from now on?\" Michelle asks curiously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, we're about to find out aren't we?\" you say, picking up your girlfriends severed arms and attempting to reattach them. They stick easily, and Michelle begins moving them around, making sure they still work the way their suppose to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, everything working alright?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seems to be. Hey, hand me those weights would you?\" your girlfriend requests, pointing towards a pair of dumbbells you keep around o help you keep in shape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, you mind if I ask why?\" you ask, picking the wights up and handing them to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out to accept the weights, your says \"I just want to test something is all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering what it is she wants to test, you release your grip on the weights......?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Your next choice is to just full on the sides of the mask, but when your hands run over the area where her mask joined your face, there was only smooth skin.  \"Huh?,\" you felt Michelle's face, and yet it felt like your own.  You pulled on the skin and winced at the pain.  \"Michelle, it won't come off!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body perked up and blindly reached out for you.  Your body felt hot and weak, and you stumbled towards your girlfriend.  As you fell towards her, she awkwardly caught you by the chest, causing you to moan.  \"Wait, wuh-?\"  Her touch felt nice on your chest, and when you looked down you saw something you did not expect to see, ever.  You had a pair of breasts under your shirt, breasts that Michelle was unknowingly groping as she held you.  \"Michelle, what is going on?!\" you cry out in her voice, \"I'm turning into a girl!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFaceless Michelle stopped touching you and held you at arms length by the shoulders.

She reached for your pants,and pulled them down in one go.  \"Michelle what the h-!?\"  You were about to ask her why, but the reason was laid out before you.  Expecting to see your junk hanging out, you instead saw a tight pussy, with a shaved tuft of blonde hair above it.  You were a brunette.  \"O-oh my god Michelle, I'm you!\"  Michelle gave you a 'Duh' look, something she achieved without a face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, okay, okay.

Curious, you pull the box out, coughing as a massive cloud of dust exploded around you, and lift off the lid.  Inside you see many wooden and plastic toys that hadn't been touched in nearly one and a half decades, including a set of stackable rings, a fuzzy stuffed pig with spit stained fur, and an firetruck-red jack in the box.  This last item caught your attention better than anything else you'd found so far, and after pulling the small yet surprisingly weighty metal box out of the cardboard box, you set the rest of toys aside and turned around to show Rachel your selection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A jack-in-the-box?\"  She asked, her hand instinctively reaching up to the empty space where her head had been to scratch her scalp in confusion, before remembering her current state and reaching over to scratch the head laying next to her.  She smiled that smile she always smiled before saying something that would get you both in trouble, and said \"Do it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to your cousin, you place the base of the jack-in-the-box on to her neck and press down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah!\"  Rachel says, her body jolting up and knocking the box off of her neck and sending her head rolling off of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the second time in only five minutes you save your cousin from possible brain damage, dropping the sword and catching her head just before it hit the floor.  Raising her up to eye level, you asked \"What's wrong?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... uh... that felt weird.\"  She said, her body rubbing her neck.  \"I... something definitely happened.  My head and neck felt all tingly when you pushed the jack-in-the-box into me, and even now they feel... different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Different?  Different how?\"  You asked, turning her head around in your hands.  It didn't feel any different than before, nor did it look any different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I dunno, just different.  It's hard to describe.  It's like a pressure or something underneath the skin of my head and neck.\"  She said, her body poking her empty neck stump.  She giggled a little, and began rubbing the spot, her face twisting int-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">Do-</font></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth of you froze as a high pitched note rang out from the space where Rachel's head had once been attached to her shoulders.  It sounded like a chime from one of those old fashioned mechanical music boxes.  Like a \"Jack-in-the-box!\"  Rachel blurted out, her cheeks warming up in your hands as she spoke your thoughts verbatim.  \"Put me back on my body!\"  She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObeying your cousin's request you pressed her head back onto her shoulders and with a strangely mechanical 'click-clack' she was reattached to her body.  She touched her neck again, rubbed the area vigorously, then frowned.  \"Nothing's happening.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you feel any different?\"  You asked, wondering if reattaching her head had somehow undone the magic.  The note said that that would only happen if you hit the button on the bottom of the sword, though nothing about this sword made any sense so why should the random note that came with it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah?\"  She answered, still rubbing her neck and furrowing her brow.  \"Like, there's definitely still a pressure in there that wasn't there before, but... this isn't doing anything.\"  She said, feeling around the area where the sword had decapitated her.  \"You heard that sound too, right?  It did something before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.\"  You nodded.  You thought for a few moments, watching as your cousin rubbed her throat with her cute little fingers with their bright red nail polish.  Watching her tilt her head to the ceiling, sticking her slender throat straight out as she ran her hands over it, an few odd ideas popped into your head.  \"Hey, silly question, but did you feel anything when your body made that noise?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\"  She vocalized.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you feel anything?  Like, when your body made that noise did you feel anything?\"  You clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, a little?\"  She said.  \"Like I felt a little more pressure build up in my head and neck, but I didn't feel gears and chimes moving around inside my chest or anything.  I'm not a robot now, id that's what you're asking.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not asking that.  What I'm asking is... look, maybe it's not WHERE you touched yourself, but HOW you touched yourself.\"  You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel smirked.  \"Hey, phrasing!\"  She said, putting on her best H.

I mean I guess?  The pressure felt like a good kind of pressure, and the skin was a lot more sensitive than my shoulders is.  It was kind of ticklish, very soft, like... kind of like someone rubbing my thighs, I guess?\"  She stammered, her cheeks taking on a rosy glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did it... wind you up?  A little?\"  You asked, doing your best to suppress your own blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel didn't respond, and the awkward silence that hung between you hardened into an all but visible wall.  You had gone way too far.  You could see it in her eyes.  She was two seconds away from leaping onto you and beat the ever loving shit out of your creepy ass.  What kind of pervert talks like that to their own fucking cousin?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thighs twitched, then squeezed together.  They squeezed together hard, her already tight fitting jeans going more taught across her skin as she rubbed her legs back and forth across one another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">Do-Do Do-Do</font></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped moving, and the music box stopped with it.  Both of your faces were doing their best impersonation of a strawberry now, your skin on fire as the unfortunate realization that you were right sank in to both of you.  Rachel the jack-in-the-box really had to be wound up if you wanted to see her pop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, listen.  I can undo the magic if you want.  We can totally find something else to do.\"  You said, avoiding eye contact and rubbing the back of your neck uncomfortably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel...</span></div></div>",

You're the one who brought 'winding me up' into this!\"  She said, firmly but not roughly shoving your shoulders.  \"It's not... it's just... look, this pressure that I feel in my neck, it's... it feels really good.  It's like the same sort of pressure you feel when you're... you know... 'on the edge'.\"  She explained, her gaze returning to that indistinct spot five feet to her right.  \"And every time it starts and stops... it's like I'm edging.  I just... l'm curious to know what'll happen when I go pop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at Rachel for a while, then let out a long huff.  You had to admit, she was pretty.  Short brown hair cut into cute little bangs, big brown eyes flanking a long thin nose, and a body that, while not particularly busty or thicc in around the waist and thighs, was lean and athletic from years of competitive dancing.  That said, \"We're cousins!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not biologically!\"  She blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What?\"  was all you managed to say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel didn't answer immediately, then quickly spat out \"My mom was adopted by our granny, and your mom was still a baby when it happened so she never told her, and... that's why your mom never told you.  We aren't REALLY cousins.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stared at Rachel for several seconds, scanning her features, then flatly called out \"Bullshit.\"  Rachel shared way too many facial similarities with your sister, and your aunt Gina looked so much like your mom that it would've been more believable if Rachel had claimed they were secretly twins this entire time rather than adoptive sisters.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel blushed.  \"It was worth a shot.\" she said to herself, admitting to you that the two of you were indeed related by blood.  \"But fuck it!\"  Before you could do anything Rachel had launched herself at you, deftly sidestepping the panicked wave you had reflexively made with the long sword and throwing her arms around your shoulders to press her body into yours.  Heat radiated off of her like, well, a radiator, and when you opened your mouth to give a yelp of alarm Rachel took the opportunity to plant her lips on yours and start smacking your tongue around with her own.  She tilted her head and closed her eyes, and as she sloppily kissed you and dry humped your leg, you heard the sound of the long sword clattering to the ground.  You don't remember dropping it, nor did you consciously command your emptied hand to grab a meaty fistful of Rachel's toned butt, but once it had you couldn't help but close your own eyes and begin reciprocating the kiss.  You'd never had someone glomp onto you so passionately before, not even your-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Girlfriend!\"  You said, pulling your face away and pushing Rachel back as far as her iron grip would allow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Heh, going a little fast there, aren't you?  Let's finish this first and see where it takes us.\"  Rachel said, staring at you with drooping eyelids yet fully dilated pupils, like she was in a trance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I mean I HAVE a girlfriend!\"  You clarify, as Rachel tries to crush herself back into you.  Placing a hand on her chest you try to shove her away, only to hear the mechanical tune of her libido bouncing off of the walls of your room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Obviously.\"  She said, rolling eyes which were more pupil than white.  \"But who cares?  I've never met her, no one in this town knows me, and once my parents get back from their cruise I'll be going back home where no one knows her.  Unless YOU tell her what happened here, no one will ever know.  it'll be like nothing ever happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou frowned.  \"Did... have... DO you have a boyfriend?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nope.\"  She said, shrugging.  \"I've had a casual screw for a while but nothing ever seriously came of us... well, nothing ever BECAME of us.  I'm young, I'm saving all that love stuff for later.\"  Rachel stepped back, nearly causing you to stumble as your shoving shoving limbs were suddenly left pushing empty air.  She began stripping, and you...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Fuck your fucking teenage fucking hormones!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour throat tried to produce an frustrated growl and a horny groan at the same time, resulting in an alien noise that caused Rachel to stop her undressing, momentarily, and giggle.  When she saw you pause, however, she picked up the pace, quickly tossing her shirt away and unfastening her bra, exposing a small but perky set of breasts with hardened nipples pointed directly at you, one slightly but still noticeably higher than the other.  She clasped her arms behind her back and thrust her chest out to you, an exaggerated grin stretching from one dimpled cheek to the other as she tried to steer you back on track.  It worked, much to your own shame and annoyance, and you continued stripping.  While you peeled and tossed your clothes aside with all the grace of a molting snake, Rachel put her dance experience to good use, twisting and turning and rocking her body as she wiggled her jeans down to her ankles, kicked them aside, then waved her rump at you as she first hitched her panties up into her crotch and crack, then pulled them down to her feet in a single smooth motion, catching them on one finger and twirling the garments like a racing flag once she'd returned to a standing position.  You didn't notice the magically produced music playing until it had stopped, and when it did stop you were pretty sure it had gone through at least one full rotation of 'pop goes the weasel' by now.  Seems as though the 'pop' didn't necessarily coincide with a 'pop', but that didn't seem to perturb your clearly horny cousin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're awful.\"  You said, freeing the last stitch of clothing from your body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know.\"  She said, smirking and tossing the garments onto your shoulder.  While the cloth itself weighed next to nothing, the scent your cousin had left on it hit you like a brick, your nostrils reflexively flaring out and your lungs pulling in a long whiff as you brushed them off.  It was a stronger smell than anything your girlfriend had ever produced, and while you wouldn't exactly call the stench of moistness and ass sweat pleasant, it definitely drove some primal parts of your brain wild.  You wanted her.  Now.  You just needed to-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you doing?\"  Rachel asked, watching you cross the room and dig through your sock drawer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, what do you think?\"  You ask, tossing some socks aside and pulling out a small box of medium condoms.  \"I'm not getting my goddamn cousin pregnant.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... yeah.  Yes.  Ok.\"  She said, each individual word said with a different inflection.  It seemed as though the magical situation she found herself in had temporarily made her forget the normal rules of sex, and this sudden reminder of normalcy had jarred her.  Not enough to make her not fuck her cousin, mind you, as Rachel merrily hoped backwards onto the guest bed she had been sleeping on the past few days and spread her legs wide, a plump set of extremely slick and very red lips inviting you in.  Then, she said \"Fuck me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, I hope there isn't a hell.\"  You said, knowing that if there were some fiery pit of eternal torment somewhere you were definitely getting yourself an express ticket there with this little scene.  Pulling the blue tinted condom down to the base of your shaft, you all but charge across the room and mount Rachel like the depraved animal the long sword had turned you into.  Without a word you entered her, the condom's own lubrication proving all but superfluous as your cock slid effortlessly down Rachel's dripping cunt, the musical accompaniment of Rachel's body going up a few decibels as you did.  Surprised by your forcefulness after so much hesitation, Rachel's breath caught in her throat.  She coughed, cleared her throat, then sank her fingers into your shoulders and stared you straight in the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Make me go pop.\"  She purred, her voice deeper suddenly much deeper and more womanly despite her juvenile remark.  Your hips pulled back and gave another deep thrust, Rachel's grip tightening and the music swelling as you moved.  You paused, and both the music and Rachel's grip slackened.  You repeated the slow pull and deep thrust and Rachel's body and the magic within it reacted the same, although maybe a little louder and tighter than before.  After one more slow drawback, you began pumping with a steady rhythm, the disconnected notes gaining cohesion as Rachel's grip on your shoulders tightened.  She grit her teeth as you fucked her, her head shuddering violently as the pressure in her neck built up.  Her knees rose from the bed and dug into your kidneys, while the walls of her pussy clamped tightly around your rubber wrapped shaft, her entire body doing its best to hold you inside of it until the climactic finish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe end didn't seem to far off, as less than two minutes later Rachel was panting like she'd just run a marathon and the music was loud enough to drown out all but the most enthusiastic of your combined sex noises.  By this point, your neighbors could probably hear the deafening \"<i><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">Do-Do Do-Do Do-Do-DoDoDo  Do-Do Do-Do Do-Do-Do</font></i>\" and were VERY confused about what the hell was going on in here.  Luckily for them, they wouldn't have to listen to that tune much longer, for as the most recent <i><font class=\"size4\" style=\"\">Do-Do Do-Do Do-Do-DoDoDo</font></i> approached its end, Rachel's full body grip tightened like an industrial press, her eyes widened to the size of tangerines, and she screamed, above the music but in perfect time with it, \"POP!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had expected the magic to do something crazy when Rachel popped.  What you didn't expect, however, was for Rachel's head to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cAAAA-AUGH-aaaah!\u201d  Was one of the bizarre noises you heard Rachel make when the music stopped.  Another sound you heard was one of stretching, compressing, and wobbling of spring steel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat in the fuck?\u201d  Was yet another sound that came in the wake of Rachel\u2019s cumming, and a second passed before you realized that it was you who had said it.  Trying to comprehend what you were seeing was taking the vast majority of your conscious processing power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOw.\u201d  Rachel hissed, swishing something around inside her mouth before spitting out a thick glob of blood and saliva right onto the floor of her guest room like the respectable young cousin-fucker she was.  \u201cI bit the thit out of my tung.\u201d  She said to herself with a noticeable lisp, thankfully swallowing the next mouthful of blood before saying \u201cHowy thit!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowy thit was right.  Rachel had not only borrowed the jack-in-the-box\u2019s music box and windup mechanism, she\u2019d borrowed its spring loaded surprise too.  When she \u2018popped\u2019, her head and neck had launched off of her shoulders like box\u2019s titular jack springing out, and just like the jack her head had remained attached to her body by a thick steel spring that wobbled back and forth as she panted for air.  Air that, somehow, traveled down the spring and into her expanding and deflating lungs.  Or did it just teleport down there?  Magic made no sense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGetting a wittle dithy.\u201d  Rachel said, her hands trying and failing to grab her own head as it wobbled back and forth.  Not wanting vomit to be added to the list of bodily fluids your cousin had gotten on your floor, you quickly grab her head and steady it, looking for damage.  Well, damage you could see, as obviously was wrong inside of her head.  She had a small goose egg on her forehead where it had hit the ceiling, and looking up you could see an alarmingly large crack in the plaster above you.  Her cheeks couldn\u2019t decide whether they wanted to blush with post-coital bliss or go pale due to her head\u2019s wild ride in the aftermath, and as such they were a patchy mess of deep red and pale white that felt really weird to hold.  Apart from that, however, she looked perfectly fine, and the somewhat seasick smile that crept across her lips confirmed that she felt well enough now that the room had stopped bouncing.  \u201cThankth.\u201d  She said, reaching up and grabbing the backs of your hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe puckered up, and you took the hint, pulling her head towards you and audibly stretching her spring.  While Rachel was already basking in the afterglow, you hadn't even gotten off yet and were still hard and half inserted into her dripping womanhood.  As such, you did nearly all of the work in this make out session, grunt and twisting your head and softly biting her lip.  Rachel didn't seem to mind one bit, and demurely allowed you to have your way with her bloodied tongue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh...\"  You said, pulling away from your cousin.  Smacking your lips, you could definitely taste the coppery flavor of blood in your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatth... ugh... what is up?  Why did you stop?\"  Rachel asked, forcing herself to speak properly despite the pain.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...\"  You froze, not sure how to phrase 'you don't have anything, do you?' while minimizing the risk of getting slapped in the face.  When you couldn't think of a good way to say it (assuming there even was one), you decided that distraction was your best bet.  You simply let go of Rachel's head, her warm cheeks slipping through your fingers and her head rocking back and forth like a playground spring rider.  \"Heh-heh, I think the magic is broken.   It turned you into a bobble-head, not a jack-in-the-box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ath-hole!\"  Rachel lisped, sticking her hands out to catch her head only to slap herself right in the face.  Eventually, she figured out that grabbing the spring was her best choice and did so, stopping her very cross looking head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\"  You said, sheepishly shrugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ugh, I can't believe I actually let you have sex with me.\"  She said, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LET ME?!\"  You shouted indignantly.  \"You BEGGED me!  You threw yourself at me!  You did everything short of hold me down and fuck me against my will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, well if you didn't want to have sex then I guess we should stop.\"  She said, a devilish grin spreading across her cheeks.  Hopping back on the bed and releasing you, Rachel popped you out of her crotch and left your very red cock and very blue balls in the suddenly much colder air of the guest room.  \"Don't worry, I'll reverse this, shower off, and we'll pretend this never happened.\"  She continued, grabbing her head with one hand and  reaching for the big red button on the longsword's hilt with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait!\"  You said, your cock taking full control of your body and forcing you to not only shout, but grab her wrist in desperation.  It NEEDED to get off, and if it wasn't at the hands of your magically modified cousin it wouldn't let you sleep at night.  \"I'm sorry, I didn't... I mean you did... I'm sorry.  I'm sorry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you DO want to have sex?  With me?  Your cousin?\"  She asked, her index finger slowly extending toward the sword's button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes...\"  You said, your body sparing what little blood it could to blush up your cheeks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, that wasn't a very enthusiastic yes.\"  She said, her spring creaking as she turned her head 90 degrees, pointing her ear right at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YES.\"  You said, loudly and clearly but no more cheerfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, since you helped me out, I GUESS I'll help you out.  Cousin.\"  She said.  If there wasn't a hell already, they'd definitely have to invent one for you two.  What does Rachel do next?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You heard the <b><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">CRASH!</font></b> before you could consciously register what was happening, and as such your body reflexively leapt backwards and fell flat on its ass, your free floating nuts just barely avoiding a devastating crack as you hit the floor.  You blinked a few times, your heart racing so fast that you couldn't tell where any beat began or ended, and you did your best to assess what had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell, your cousin fucking popped alright!  Standing up slowly, you saw a nude, sweaty, headless body trying to gasp for air and a few jagged shards of glass in the corners of your windowframe.  What you didn't see was a window, nor did you see your cousin's head.  You put two and two together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit.\"  You said, leaning forward as far as you dared and peering through the mostly empty window-frame.  Outside you saw a front yard sparkling in the afternoon sun, the cascade of glass shards shimmering like the morning dew.  Peering down further, into the bushes in front of your house, you saw \"Rachel!\", a ball of hair and hot pink skin entangled in the thick shrubbery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stumbled backwards on wobbly knees and shaking feet, your terrified yet still horny body struggling to figure out where it wanted to send your blood and evidently your legs were very far down the priorities list.  You scrambled around the room throwing on whatever clothes you could find, doing your best to avoid the few errant slivers of glass that had somehow been blown backwards during Rachel's violent ejection.  After fiddling with your pants for a good minute and finding your raging stiffie was in no mood to go down, you tucked it up into the waistband of your pants and threw on a t-shirt and flip-flops before waddling out of your room, down the stairs, down the hall, and out the front door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel!\"  You shout, completely forgetting not to draw attention to yourself as you retrieved your cousin's living severed head that had just been catapulted out of your bedroom window.  You shuffled towards bush she had landed in and hefted her head out of the foliage, her cheeks so hot, wet, and sticky against your palms that you were worried her face had been slashed to hell and back by the glass and against the branches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs it turns out, your fears were largely unfounded.  While Rachel's face did indeed sport a few scrapes and nicks from pointy branches and splintering glas, she seemed to have come out of this ordeal relatively unharmed.  The heat was merely a byproduct of her intense climax, while the wetness and stickiness was mostly her sweat.  The only notable damage seemed to be a sizable lump on her scalp, a bruise forming where her head had first made contact with the window.  That said, your cousin did look pretty out of it, her eyes half glazed over and her lips twitching like she was trying to form words but couldn't quite remember the process.  Wanting to make sure that she wasn't suffering any serious brain damage, you asked \"Rachel, are you okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"muhmnurrhh.\"  Was her first response, not exactly filling you with confidence, but after a few seconds of noiseless lip flapping she managed to get out a few coherent albeit drunken sounding words.  \"Fuuuuuuuuck, man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Rachel, can you hear me?\"  You ask her, shaking her a little before you realized that that probably wouldn't alleviate whatever concussion she may or may not have suffered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yessss, MOM!\"  She said sarcastically, causing you to chuckle half with relief and half with continued nervousness.  \"Man, that was the most intense fucking fuck I've ever fucked!\"  She shamelessly announced, grinning ear to ear as her eyes regained enough focus to meet your gaze.  \"Serious, that was amazeballs!  We gotta do that again sometime.  Like, right now time!\"  Her mouth continued to move wordlessly, then she laughed and said \"Though, maybe next time we should put up a net or something to catch me.  Or at least give me a helmet.  Cuz that FUCKING hurt!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I bet, you just headbutt through my window!\"  You said, laughing with her.  Your laughter stopped shortly afterwards, however, when you realized what you had just said and what had just happened.  \"Oh shit, my window!  My mom is gonna kill me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Relaaaaax!\"  Rachel said, attempting to roll her eyes but only managing a sort of janky flick to the right.  \"I'll take the blame.  Say I slipped while getting changed or something and hit the window while falling.  Doenwurry about it!  I gotchu!  Just bring me back to my body and leuss git ready for round two!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer continued slurring of words made you fell like maybe she wasn't in the most lucid state of mind right now and maybe you should be calling the shots for the time being.  On the other hand, your constricted and still engorged cock were certainly on her side.  Either way, getting inside as soon as possible probably wasn't the worst idea, and since her body was inside you decided that you could at least start get a start on her plan and reevaluate the specifics along the way.  Clutching her both literally and metaphorically hot head to your chest and leaning over just in case any of your neighbors hadn't taken a look out their window when they'd heard a massive crash but decided to do so now for no reason, you quickly made your way back inside and shut the door behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell?\"  You and Rachel asked in unison.  You had said that because Rachel's headless, naked body was standing at the bottom of the stairs, the long sword dangling limply from one hand while its other hand rubbed its sopping groin.  Rachel had said that because... \"Wait, what do you mean 'what the hell'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I mean I didn't make my body come down here.\"  Rachel said, her voice much more clear than before.  She blinked, squinted, closed her eyes, then opened them as wide as they would go.  \"In fact, I can't actually make it move at all.  I can feel it, if I concentrate, but moving it... someone else is doing that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who the hell else would be controlling you?  The Jack-in-the-box?\"  You asked, confused but not doubting her.  She was way too terrible of a liar for her to be making that up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body, somehow hearing you without ears, poked itself in the boob.  It then shifted its still pointing finger up to the empty space above its shoulders, before finally waving.  You were at a loss, but Rachel seemed to understand her body's attempt at sign language.  \"I think it's controlling itself.\"  She scrunched her face in concentrating.  \"Yeah, I... yeah.  Yes.  But... huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Very informative.\"  You said, lightly slapping her cheek.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, sorry.  Uh, yeah.  So if I concentrate, I can feel the body, and I can feel that the body can feel me, if that makes sense.\"  She said.  After a long pause that indicated that no, it didn't make any sense, she clarified \"Like if I don't concentrate, I can't feel my body and I'm pretty sure it can't feel me.  But, if I do concentrate, I can feel what the body feels and I feel a sort of connection with it, one that lets me know it can feel me too.  So like, she sees out of my eyes and ears when I concentrate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And when you aren't concentrating?  How can she see and hear when you aren't concentrating?\"  You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body raised its free and and fluttered its fingers as it made a wide arc through the air.  \"Maaaagic!\"  Rachel translated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, so... not only did you gain the power to have your head shot off whenever you have an orgasm, and the power of magically amplified horniness, but after hitting your head really hard you've lost control of your body.\"  You recapped, your brain barely able to keep up with the insanity of magic's rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically.\"  Rachel said.  \"But... not exactly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please, be more cryptic.\"  You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's still pressure in my neck, but nowhere for it to go.  What with my head already being detached\"  She said, her body rubbing itself silly as Rachel concentrated.  She started panting, her ability to concentrate broke, and then she said with a completely neutral voice.  \"Yeah, my body WANTS to cum, but it's stuck on the edge.  So it's less that my head shoots off whenever I cum, but more like my head has to shoot off FOR ME to cum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fascinating.\"  You say, barely hearing Rachel's words as your concentration was commandeered by the sweaty headless body squirming and shuddering as it tried and failed to get off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, why don't you put me back on and we'll start round two then?\"  Rachel asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You sure?  Didn't you say your body was stuck right on the edge?\"  You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, So?\"  She asked.  After a pause, she realized \"Oh yeah, I'd shoot off as soon as I got attached.  Better get a helmet or something so that I don't splatter myself on your ceiling.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRachel's body ceases its rubbing, its shoulders violently shaking as unbearable pressure built up beneath them, and it...</span></div></div>",

Despite taking hits directly to the brain that would concuss if not outright kill any mortal, she didn't look much worse for wear.  A little disoriented and lightheaded, hardy har har, but she was certainly alive.  You got confirmation of this fact when Rachel smiled, and said \"Hehehe, that was a real mindblowing orgasm!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHardy har har.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking over to your wastebin, you see the large and wrinkly pink blob that was, from a certain philosophical point of view, the real Rachel.  Reaching in and picking her up, wincing as you brushed off an old piece of gum and a peculiar smelling tissue, you found that her brain felt pretty close to how you were expecting it to.  It was a little less slimy, a little more solid, and a bit heavier than you thought a brain would be, but it basically felt like what it looked like.  Walking over to Rachel's body, who seemed surprisingly serene for someone who'd just had their brains blown out, you handed Rachel over to her body and took a gander inside her head.  You noticed first that the hinge that connected her skullcap to the rest of her skull was, much like the spring that jutted from the center of her otherwise emptied head, metal, and accompanied by a sliding latch on the other side.  You assumed that once you flipped the cap over and pressed down, the latch would catch and lock her head back up until she came again, though you didn't want to test that until Rachel's brain was back in her head as you didn't want to lock the organ out.  Observing the spring, you noticed that it seemed to be coming from inside Rachel's spinal collumn, poking through the hole in her skull where her brain stem once slotted in.  It also seems like the spring wasn't really supposed to launch Rachel's brain entirely out of her skull, and bits of what looked like glue appeared to be stuck to the last few coils of the spring, which looked just wide enough to put Rachel's brain stem in.  \"Well, not only is magic arbitrary, it's also really cheap.\"  You say, poking the dried glue and watching it flake off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ohohohoh.\"  Rachel half moaned, half stuttered, her body shaking quivering wildly and the music starting up anew as you prodded her spring.  You pulled your hand away when you saw the effect it was having on Rachel, though apparently the effect was very much appreciated by your cousin as she immediately dropped her brain (technically, her body dropped her) and began playing with her spring, her tongue lolling out like one of those ridiculous anime porn characters that you definitely knew absolutely nothing about.  \"Ohoh mmyy g-god!  It's like I'm ticking my entire spine!  Oh, this must be what having a dick is like!\"  She moaned, jerking her spring and giggling as the music filled the room.  It was louder than before, and you realized the noise was coming from inside her head.  Magic, man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It probably doesn't.\"  You said, truthfully.  Picking up Rachel's brain for the second time, you say \"Now come on, let's get this back in your head.  Can't have you taking any more brain damage.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pshh, I'm fine!  Did you see how hard I hit that wall?  The magic is definitely protecting me.\"  Rachel said, completely nonchalant about the fact that, had the magic not protected her, which she couldn't have possibly known it would, she would be the deadest thing since sliced bread.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's not what I meant.\"  You said, rolling your eyes at your insane cousin.  \"Now come on, in you go!  This experiment is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou try to plop Rachel's brain back in her head...</span></div></div>",

You sit on the bench waiting to find out if you'll actually be the ball with the rest of the team. Jenna then runs back, \"We got the okay, guys! He's the ball\" <br>\r\nThey give a little cheer. You wonder how that conversation must've gone with the refs..<br>\r\n<i>Hey, so my brother decapitated himself and now his head is bouncy, can we use him as a ball?</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the game is getting started you two see your parents in the crowd, who seem to be accompanied by your headless body. It was cheering you guys on. You both laugh as the game begins.<br>\r\nIt goes on rather intense. For you it was just about the same as practice. You try to talk to the opposing team to slip them up. You hear things like \"Oh my god, its a head!\" and \"Its talking to me\", all of which just amuse you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch as the score stays close most the game. Neck and neck one might say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen with the final point, Jenna's team wins!<br>\r\nAs part of winning...</span></div></div>",

You lifted the car off, and then grabbed the controller, and noticed some major changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor starters, there was a microphone now attached where the antenna was, and there was also a whole slew of new buttons.

There was also a slew of buttons on the back, each with a different emotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tested out the dual joysticks the controller had, only to discover that each controlled a different eye, making you see in different directions.

Really needed a nap before we went anywhere.\"  You said, rubbing some sleep out of your eye with one hand and stroking Michelle's hair with the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hurry up and get dressed, we're going to miss our reservation if we wait any longer!\"  She said.  To celebrate your last day of highschool, and to reduce the awkwardness of the conversation you two would have to have about the status of your relationship after the summer ended, when you would each go to different colleges in different states, you and Michelle had made a reservation at an upscale steakhouse.  The restaurant's waiting list was about as long as a moderately ambitious novel on an average day, and on days like this where everyone and their mother was out celebrating that list stretched to about the size of an encyclopedia set.  You'd had to book months in advance, and while you were confident in your ability to drive fast and arrive on time you were equally confident that if you were so much as ten minutes late your seats would be gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, wait here.\"  You said, setting Michelle's head on the ground as you walked over to your closet.  As you pulled out your one and only suit and changed, you noticed two things about Michelle's head.  The first was that she was eyeing you a bit more coyly than usual as you switched pants and pulled off your shirt, her gaze flicking between your (admittedly mediocre) abs and your (pretty good) thighs and not too subtle passing over the boxered bulge in between.  There was a very good chance that, after you'd had a very expensive meal and talked over the possibility of splitting up after the summer, you were going to get lucky.  You just hoped that it would be the first of a summer long frenzy and not a farewell fuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second thing you noticed was that Michelle's nose itched.  Her upper lip was twitching, her face scrunched up, and whenever she wasn't looking at you she was crossing her eyes and staring at the tip of her nose with a frustration.  You listened carefully, and could hear her body making noise downstairs, but it didn't seem to be coming upstairs.  You realized that Michelle probably didn't know where in the house her body was, since she'd fallen asleep the instant you cut her head off, so she couldn't get up here and scratch it.  Since she couldn't scratch it, and the magic wouldn't allow her to notice why, she was left in a state of annoyed limbo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you'd finished dressing yourself, straightening your bow tie with a satisfied tug, you approached Michelle's head and furiously scratched her nose.  \"Thanks, that was killing me!\"  She said, without addressing what was bothering her and why she couldn't handle it.  \"Well, come on, let's get a move on!\"  She said.  You picked Michelle up and carried her downstairs to your living room, where you saw her body tapping its foot nervously and pulling out its phone to check the time despite not having any eyes nearby to actually read the numbers.  Seeing Michelle's body and head like this, obliviously following her normal routines even in this bizarre state, you decide to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Since you were going to a steakhouse and Michelle needed her head to eat steak, leaving that behind would be a bit dickish, and since she went to so much effort to doll herself up in her Sunday best (on a Friday) you'd feel guilty if no one else got to see her.  So, your only option was to bring along both her head and her body.  \"Alright, let's go!\"  You said, casually handing over Michelle's head to her unsuspecting body.  Michelle followed you to your car (which you just so happened to share with your sister.  But it was definitely your car no matter what she said) and climbed into the passenger seat, buckling herself in before placing her head on the floorboard between her feet and holding it in place with her ankles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBuckling yourself in, you look down at Michelle's head and ask \"Ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drive!\"  She shouted, excited and annoyed.  You obeyed her request and sped off, Michelle's ankles barely able to keep her head from rolling around as you flew out of your family's driveway and gunned it for the steakhouse.  While you only had two and a half years of driving experience, you had a natural gift for navigating the roads and made it to the restaurant with time to spare.  Looking over at Michelle, it seems as though you'd need to spare it.  Her body was deathly pale, both of her hands were clasped tightly over her stomach, and while you couldn't see much of her face from your angle, you could see her pale cheeks bloated out to either side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, Michelle?  You're not gonna throw up, are you?\"  You ask, your concern split evenly between your girlfriend's well being and your car's upholstery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a worryingly long pause, but eventually you heard a gulping sound and Michelle's shoulders relaxed.  \"Ugh, remind me why I let you drive?\"  She asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because, you can't even see over the dashboard!\"  You say, curious to see whether or not the magic would keep her in the dark about her headlessness if you referenced it indirectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, wow, a short joke.  Never heard one of those before.\"  Michelle said, completely missing your point.  Looks like you'd have to tell her directly.  \"Come on, I think I've gotten my lunch back where it's supposed to go.  I can get some dinner in me, now.\"  Taking the hint, you quickly unbuckle, throw open your door, and run around to Michelle's side to open her door for her.  You be a smart mouthed prankster with no sense of shame, but you were still a gentleman!  Stepping out of the car, her purse tucked beneath one shoulder and her head the other, Michelle remarked \"Aw, you forgot your fedora at home!  Now what will you tip?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the snark, that cute little dimpled smile of her showed that the gesture was appreciated.  Locking your car up, you and Michelle enter the steakhouse, packed to capacity with waiting guests and dining customers, and only now do you realize that you had absolutely no idea whether or not the longsword's magic kept everyone oblivious to Michelle's condition, or only herself.  You kind of assumed everyone, but thinking back on it the note didn't actually specify that.  You quickly discover that...</span></div></div>",

You laughed aless enthusiastically, looking around the room and nodding at the gawkers as if to say \"Yes, I know she's headless.  Roll with it.\"  A few joined in on the laughter, albeit nervously and noncommittally.  It seemed as though the magic only deceived the those directly touched by it, and had no effect on anyone else.  That did put a damper on your plans, as the likelihood that someone would point out Michelle's condition had risen astronomically, but worst case scenario you just press the button on the long sword, pause time, reattach her head, and play the whole thing off as one of those stupid viral prank videos.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, you didn't bring the long sword with you.  She was stuck like this until you got back home.  Shit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle had finished laughing, and the two of you approached the hostess' desk.  \"Hello, we have a reservation under 'John Conner', party of two.\"  You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hostess wordlessly stared at the two of you for a few seconds, then nodded, motioning for you to follow.  Lifting her head to your ear, Michelle whispered \"Seriously, what is up with these people?  They act like they've never seen a couple on a date before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably the name.\"  You say, shrugging.  \"Everyone thinks I'm joking when I tell them I'm John Conner, or I'm trying to pull a prank or something.  They don't even care that it's not spelled the same.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, you can't really tell when it's spoken.\"  Michelle pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArriving at an empty table near the back, the hostess motions for the two of you to sit.  \"Uh, w-uh.  You...?\"  She stammered.  You shot her a look like she better get her act together and not offend your date, and she took in a deep breath and tried again.  \"Hello, my name is Sally.  Your server will be with you momentarily to get your drink orders.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter retreating back to her desk, Michelle set her head down on the table and got right down to business.  \"So, have you thought about us?  What comes next?\"  After so much headless shenanigans, you'd almost forgotten why you two had come here in the first place.  You were leaving for different colleges at the end of the summer, and neither of you knew if a long distance relationship would work, so you needed to figure out what would be best for both of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou gulped heavily, suddenly wishing that you'd taken this more seriously before and not decapitating her as a joke before having a very serious conversation.</span></div></div>",

Sure you enjoyed your fair share of exotic erotica, most of all the kind in which body parts or whole sections of the body get removed.  It was just the idea of rendering someone so helpless, reducing them to a pile of pieces to play with was absolutely exhilarating to you, especially if the divided person got to watch what happened to them and enjoy it themselves.  With that in mind you'd always imagined yourself getting to chop up your girlfriend but had never acted on those feelings for quite obvious ethical (and legal) reasons.  Now that you had a magical sword that gave you the ability to chop her up free of consequence or pain however you suddenly felt the insatiable urge to do just that.  Setting aside your new favorite object to ever exist momentarily you pick up your phone and quickly dial up your girlfriend Michelle.  A curvy and cute brunette on the taller side you'd been together long enough for her to pick up the hints that you were a tad on the strange side when it came to the bedroom but not long enough for her to know exactly what said strangeness was.  After a few rings she picked up, her harmonious voice flowing through the speaker.  \"Hey Johnny boy, what's up?\"<br>\r\nShe knew you hated that nickname but you were in such a state of excitement you hardly even registered the teasing and simply said.  \"Get over here.  Now.\"<br>\r\n\"Wow, sounds like you've got something big to show me.\"  She said, pausing to giggle.  \"I'll be over soon, just gotta finish up some emails.\"<br>\r\nYou thought about how you'd go about introducing the concept of a magical gore sword to her and decided that the best way would be to just throw her into the deep end as any kind of explanation sans demonstration would be met with nothing but disbelief.  Taking up the sword you walked downstairs, pacing as you came up with a gag.  After a few moments you decided on one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwenty five minutes passed before you heard the doorbell ring.  \"It's open!\"  You say, standing just a few feet away from the door with your hands behind your back.  The door opens and you're greeted by the sight of Michelle, dressed casually in simple jeans and a t-shirt, likely due to how easy said articles were to remove.  \"Sorry about that, I'd have opened the door myself but I'm a bit shorthanded at the moment!\"  You say, bringing your right arm forward.  Clutched in your right hand was your left hand, blood dripping from its open wrist as the hand waved at her vigorously.<br>\r\nMichelle stared, unable to comprehend what was happening.  She stared at your severed hand, observing it as it moved and turned in normal controlled fashion despite no longer being connected to your wrist and still bleeding from its fresh stump.  She then turned to you, staring at your jovial face.  Finally she spoke.  \"What the fuck?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what you're telling me is that not only did you find this magic sword on the street but that you also have a fetish for people getting chopped up?  Wow, sounds like you won the lottery today.\"  Michelle said, inspecting the sword as you finished cleaning your blood off the floor and yourself.  You'd have to buy a lot more new rags in the future or maybe just get floors and linens that were easily cleaned and difficult to stain but for now you'd make do.<br>\r\nTossing the rags into your washer and setting it to speed wash (for you'd likely need those puppies again soon) you nodded.  \"Lottery?  I'd say even that's putting it lightly.  If I won the lottery I'd just have a mansion or a boat or something.  Instead I got a reality altering magical artifact.\"  You turned back to her.  \"So, you're not creeped out or anything by my... proclivities?\"<br>\r\nMichelle shrugged.  \"Well, everyone has some weird fantasy or fetish.  So long as you're not actually hurting anyone I can't see the harm in it, and since you've restrained yourself from harming anyone thusfar I trust you not to do it now.  So, how's about we see what else this thing can do?\"<br>\r\nYou leer.  \"You just read my mind!\"  Taking the sword from Michelle you ponder what to cut off first, your girlfriend posing herself as you thought.  Eventually you decide to...</span></div></div>",

Wanting to get the most out of it you say \"Would you mind waiting here for a minute?  I just want to set something up in the garage.\"<br>\r\nWhile curious Michelle still agrees, showing a degree of cooperation and trust you'd never before witnessed.  \"Er, alright.  Is there anything you need me to do to help?\"<br>\r\n\"Just... arrive naked I guess.  I don't want your clothes getting all messy.  Also, if you could... well, I know this is going to sound stupid but could you wear that witch hat my sister got for Halloween?  It's... I kind of...\"  You fail to find the words.<br>\r\nLuckily Michelle is able to pick up on your intent and laughs.  \"Want to do a bit of role playing?\"  She asks.  \"Alright, I'll leave you to set the stage while I get my 'costume' ready.\"<br>\r\nYou swear, once you got the cash you were going to slap the biggest fattest diamond ring onto her finger and call her your Mrs.  After thanking her profusely and promising to do whatever she wanted to do once your fantasy was fulfilled you sprint down to the garage with the longsword in hand.  Setting the blade aside for a moment you scramble to set up your little scene, grabbing an old tarp and laying it over the ground so as not to stain the concrete.  Next you found an old tree stump from a long forgotten gardening project and set it down in the middle of the tarp.  You considered spreading some dirt around over the tarp for a more authentic 'woodsy' feeling but decided against it as it wouldn't be that pleasant once the actual sexings went down so you called your scene a day before calling down Michelle.<br>\r\nIt seems Michelle had in fact figured out what you were plotting much more specifically than you had guessed as not only was she wearing the witch hat but she'd also gotten a length of rope from your parent's room (your dad being a rock climber in his spare time) and had loosely tied her wrists together.  Putting on the best stern face you could manage given just how giddy you are you announce \"Michelle, you stand accused of witchcraft, adultery, and the murder of this town's mayor.  As such you are to be executed via beheading.  Do you have anything to say in your defense?\"<br>\r\nShe thought, smirked, and shrugged.  \"In my defense I had a hell of a good time doing all of it and I'd do it all again.  I live with no regrets.\"<br>\r\n\"Let's see if you will die with none.  Kneel before the block.\"  You command, pointing to the wooden log in the center of the room.  Michelle complied, sauntering over with pep in her step before getting on her knees and placing her head sideways on the block, facing you.  Raising your sword you ask \"Any last words, she devil?\"<br>\r\n\"Three.  Calvcid Fallhem!\"  She said, using her half remembered latin class to bastardize some vaguely mystical sounding words.<br>\r\nContinuing the act you quickly bring the blade down shouting \"Die witch!\"  You watch as the blade cleaves effortlessly through the middle of her neck before slamming into the wooden block beneath.  Blood pools under the blade as her head rolls to the floor and her body slumps back slightly, Michelle playing dead for a moment and allowing her tongue to droop out the side of her mouth.  Reaching down and tossing the hat aside you take a big handful of hair you bring her head to eye level, your girlfriend wincing in pain as you rough handled her.  \"At last, the witch is slain.\"<br>\r\nMichelle continues to play possum for a little longer, either attempting to psych you out or just getting wrapped up in the role but soon enough her eyes snap open and she retracts her tongue.  \"I don't know, 'slain' is kind of a strong word.  Personally I'd go with... 'shortened' instead.\"<br>\r\n\"You still live?!\"  You say in mock surprise, stumbling back while holding her head at arm's length.<br>\r\n\"Indeed, and while that little execution attempt did annoy me somewhat I'm not about to lose my head just yet.\"  She said, her body standing up and easily undoing the knot around its wrists.  \"I mean, you were just following the priest's orders.  Not to mention you are pretty cute.  Look, I'll cut you a deal.  If you show me a good time... an adultery kind of good time mind you... I'm willing to let you walk away from this.  If you refuse, I'll put a curse on you and every other rotten villager in that town of yours!\"<br>\r\nYou smile, ready to get things started.  \"Is that all?  Well I suppose there are worse fates.  Alright, you have yourself a deal.\"  With that you...</span></div></div>",

Before she could say anything you move her neck down and shove your erect cock into her bleeding neck hole, causing the strangest and simultaneously most satisfying slurping noise to echo off the garage walls as her sticky blood and slippery phlegm caused both grinding and lubrication respectively.<br>\r\nMichelle doesn't respond immediately, her eyes wide and mouth agape as she struggled to process what was going on.  After a few more pumps though her lips curved into a wicked smile.  \"I'm not so sure about that.\"  She said without even so much as a gag despite your meat filling the entirety of her tight throat.  \"It seems that with my wind pipe halved I don't need to breathe.  Looks like this little witchy is going to have a fun time with you.\"  Suddenly you feel nails digging into your rump as Michelle wraps her arms around your pelvis and begins pumping her neck onto you, throat constricting and loosening as she laughed gleefully at the new sensations.  She twisted and rubbed her neck against your body, the exposed top of her spine apparently acting like a makeshift clitoris judging by the way she pressed and flicked it over your skin while shuddering.<br>\r\nWhile she had deepthroated you before on occasion this was taking it to a whole new level, one that made you laugh along with her.  That is until the two of you locked eyes, her perverted head in your perverted hand with both of you staring with lust more intense than anything you'd felt before.<br>\r\nYou hands shift, left hand cradling the back of her skull while the the right held the base of her neck, two fingers sliding up into the neck still attached to her head.  \"FUCKING HELL!\"  She squealed, the completely alien feeling catching her off guard and causing her spine to shiver, an action you could actually pick up with your fingers mere millimeters away from it.  You brought her in for a kiss and you swear she was trying to gnaw your lips off with how intense she was.<br>\r\nDespite this being your fetish and despite lack of any penetration Michelle was the first to climax, her body shoving you up to the base as her knees threatened to give out from under her.  Luckily for you she managed to stay upright long enough for your own orgasm, white load mixing with red blood as she toppled onto her ass moments before you did likewise.  You broke off the kiss, withdrawing your soaked fingers from her neck so you could hold her practically glow in the dark cheeks.  \"Thanks!\"  You pant out.<br>\r\n\"Heh, I was about to say the same thing.\"  She said.  \"That was the best I've ever had, it was like... I mean you were in... I mean I never...\"  Michelle trailed off, only to return with a mere three words.  \"That was intense.\"<br>\r\n\"Tell me about it.\"  You say, setting her head stump down on your belly without even worrying about the mess it was no doubt making on you.  \"So, that was my fetish satisfied.  Do you have any ideas?\"  You ask, dropping the role play.<br>\r\n\"Oh, believe me.  I'm just getting started my lovely Johnny-boy!\"  She said, her body rising into a sitting position.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Taking back her head, careful to hold herself by the cheeks and not her blood dripping stump, Michelle asked with a slightly squished voice \u201cSo, while I certainly enjoyed our little tryst I must admit, your garage is not the most romantic venue.  Is there any chance we could take this anywhere else?  Say, a bed?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI dunno, we\u2019re kind of a mess.\u201d  You said, grimacing as you took in the sight of yourself.  Michelle's stump had acted almost like a stamp on your stomach, leaving a large sticky bloodstain in the shape of her neck's cross section.  On top of that, everything below your belt line looked like you\u2019d\u2026 well, it looked exactly like what you\u2019d expect it to look like given what you did.  You were absolutely drenched in your girlfriend\u2019s blood from the waist down, and while the sight wasn\u2019t nearly as horrifying as it would\u2019ve been in any other context, it was still kind of gross.  Getting through the house without tracking blood on the floor would be a challenge in and of itself, and that was only for you.  Michelle was on a whole different level of messy, her shoulders, chest, and upper back caked in glistening crimson and long thin streaks of red running down her stomach, butt, and thighs.  Watching her body\u2019s neck and the severed head she held below her breasts, you saw burbling pumps of fresh blood emerging every second, dripping onto her hair and into her lap respectively.  While the flow had slowed down since you'd decapitated her, her body hadn't run out and may in fact have a magically infinite supply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We could shower!  Find something to cover my stumps.\"  Michelle said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou raised an eyebrow.  \"Cover your stumps?  You plan on staying like this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you want me to go back to normal?\"  She asked, just as surprised as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shrugged.  \"No, I just didn't think you'd be that into this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Neither did I, but you learn something new every day.  You learned about a magic sword that allowed you to carry out your weird secret fetish, I learned that touching my magic spine stump feels so damn good that I'll happily indulge your weird secret fetish.  Crazy how things work out.\"  She said, neatly describing the bizarre set of improbable and serendipitous coincidences leading up to this conversation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding not to question your luck, you looked around your garage for some way of getting back into the house without tracking blood everywhere.  Eventually you found a ratty old doormat, and an old beach towel that no one would miss, and figured that these would have to do.  Setting the smaller doormat under your own feet and the wider towel under Michelle's, the two of you shuffled and wiggled your way out of the garage, blood dripping onto the absorbent materials beneath your feet rather than onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMostly without getting it on the floor.  Near the end you noticed that Michelle's towel was starting to soak through, leaving a gristly (not to mention grisly) sheen in her wake.  You'd have to clean that up later, but for now the two of you reached the bathroom and hopped onto its tiled floor, slamming the door shut behind you.  \"Seriously, how much blood do I have?\"  Michelle wondered, closing one eye as a thick glob of the red stuff rolled across her eyelid.  Her hair by now was soaked, as was every other part of her.  If she weren't walking, talking, and for some unknown reason breathing, she'd look like a prop straight out of a Tarantino movie.  This would be a long shower, you guessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Five liters, I think?\"  You said, vaguely remembering a biology class you think you were awake in.  \"Honestly, your body might produce an endless supply, the magic is taking care of your breathing after all and your body isn't getting any colder or stiffer without that blood.  No rigor-mortis or dead coldness.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds both convenient and annoying.  \"Michelle said.  \"If that's how it works, showering might be kinda pointless, huh?  If it's going to keep coming out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That depends.  How long do you think you can handstand?\"  You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Handstand, what are... oh.\"  Michelle said, giggling a little as she understood your joke.  \"Well, my record is fifteen seconds.  But who knows?  Maybe I can bump that up to fifteen hours and sleep upside down with a bucket under my neck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Anything's possible if you put your mind to it!  Even if that mind isn't presently with you.\"  You said, snatching up Michelle's head and passionately kissing her.  While the taste of copper and the possibility of bloodborne illness did detract a little from the kissing  experience, the passion you two shared still put it solidly in your top 5 best kisses ever.  \"Come on, we can at least get your hair and face cleaned up.  If you do in fact bleed forever, we can put you back together until we can think of a more permanent solution.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrying Michelle's head into the shower and turning the water on a little colder than normal since you didn't know how well hot water would play with Michelle's raw stump, you begin your long and thorough clean by dumping, by your own estimate, all of the shampoo in the observable universe into her hair and scrubbing until a bubbly afro hid her unnaturally maroon locks from view.  Humming contently as you worked your fingers deeply into her scalp, Michelle walked her body into the shower behind you and allowed the water to roll over her shoulders.  \"Oooooh, the water feels so nice on my spine!\"  She said, angling her neck to allow one particular stream of the shower's head to wash over her exposed nerves.  While you couldn't see the headless body behind you, judging by the warmth of her somehow blushing cheeks against your palms and the squishing sound coming from around waist level you could safely assume that she was enjoying herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Say, Michelle?  Should we be covering up your windpipe?  I mean, I know you don't need to breath right now, but getting water in your lungs... can you feel it going in?\"  You ask, stopping your scalp massage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can, and it does feel really weird.\"  She said, speaking with no difficulty even as she said it.  \"But they were already getting some blood in them before, and I think the magic is either numbing the pain or changing the way my lungs work.  Like, I'm pretty sure I couldn't do this before.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could ask what she couldn't do or how she knew she could do it now, your butt was blasted by a surprisingly high pressure geyser of water, sending you stumbling forward and yelping with Michelle's cackling head gripped to your chest like a teddy bear.  Turning around, you saw Michelle's body bent forward at a 90 degree angle, her open neck hole level with your butt and the strike it had received.  \"NOT FUNNY!\"  You said, rubbing your butt which admittedly wasn't really hurt.  Watching Michelle's body double over with delight and hearing her head laugh its metaphorical ass off, however, you couldn't help but join in.  \"Okay, it was a little funny.  But how'd you know you could do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know.\"  Michelle said.  \"I mean, I knew I could, but I don't know how I knew.  I just felt like I could.  My lungs feel... different.  A lot of my body does, in fact.  I don't think the magic only affects the area it directly cuts, I think it does a lot more behind the scenes stuff to make you not die.  Stuff like...\"  She tilted her throat back up at the showerhead, then stood up straight and released a smaller and much less powerful fountain of slightly pinkish water as she said \"Watergun lungs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And they say I'm the immature one.\"  You say, pinching Michelle's cute little cheek.  Continuing your shower in relative piece, a few playful nudges and some kissing (not all of it on the lips) notwithstanding, your body and Michelle's head are eventually cleaned.  As for Michelle's body and her neck stump, as it turns out her blood supply...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Out of nowhere an idea pops into your head.  An evil idea.  An idea so evil you just had to do it.  Practically skipping out to the garage you quickly begin digging through an old box of Halloween stuff, searching for the costume you wore to Michelle's party last year.  Shoving aside a pile of plastic pumpkins you strike paydirt, a bright orange convict outfit and black prison slippers to go with it.  Changing out of your normal clothes and into the costume you check yourself in the mirror.  You frown, the costume not as convincing nor as frightening as you remembered.  The serial numbers printed on the shirt were a tacky #000666, the orange color was a bit too bright and shiny compared to the real deal, and overall it was just... missing something.<br>\r\nSearching around the garage for nothing specific you stumble across your dad's old metal working tools.  An airplane mechanic by trade your dad had plenty of tools from arc welders to industrial shears, and while most of it had been sold off after he died to take care of whatever bills the life insurance didn't cover a few pieces remained, such as his welding mask and gloves.  Picking up the heavy black mask and thick brown gloves, both stained extensively with grease and scorch marks, you smiled.  \"I know you don't like me touching your work equipment, but seeing as how you're not using it any time soon I hope you don't mind if I borrow some of it for a little bit.\"  You slip the gloves on and pull the mask over your face, checking the mirror again.  Better, but still not good enough.<br>\r\nYou're about to go looking around some more when you realize what you're looking for is LITERALLY in your hands.  Holding up the longsword you set to work, the fine blade carving clean through the fabric of your costume and the flesh beneath.  You slice one sleeve off right at the shoulder, making sure to nick and scrape your arm along the way to draw blood.  You tear gashes into your pant legs, stabbing into the flesh beneath and exposing the muscles in your leg for added effect.  Finally for the coup de grace you stab the blade deep into the left side of your gut, then pull a few handfuls of intestines out which you dangle like the chain of a pocket watch down to your thigh.  You check the mirror.<br>\r\nBleeding like a stuck pig, dressed in huge gloves and a mask that obscured your eyes, weilding a giant sword dripping with blood, you looked like a perfect dime-store slasher villain.  You were ready.  Walking into the house you begin wheezing profusely, dragging one foot along the floor in a fake limp.  You made it all the way down the hall to the base of the stairs before you heard her.  \"John?  Is something wrong?\"  Your sister Jenna calls out from her room.<br>\r\nIn response you give a loud retching cough and begin climbing up the stairs, making sure to stomp your feet as hard as you can for added effect.  \"John seriously, what's up?\"  She asked, worry entering her voice as you refuse to say anything.  As you reach the top of the stairs she opens the door to her room.  \"John would you just-\" she sees you.  The look on her face is absolutely priceless.  Eyes wide as saucers, jaw dropping like a sack of bricks, every muscle pulling backwards as though trying to escape her head and run on their own.  You wish you'd thought to record this.  \"EEEEEAAAAAAAGGGHHHH!\"  She screams, stumbling backwards and falling flat onto her ass with all her limbs flailing in different directions.<br>\r\nYou...</span></div></div>",

You start off by slowly approaching her, waving the longsword around with each step you take towards her. As you get closer, she manages to duck to avoid one of your swings just before it hit her. She then turned heel and start running in the opposite direction from you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't want to make things easy for her, so you pick up the pace too, swinging wildly as you went. As your sister turns to check how far behind you are, you take a lunge at her and manage to slash at her left shoulder, leaving a deep cut and also tearing through the strap of her top. The fabric falls away from her shoulder, leaving it exposed. She pulls arches her shoulder away from you as she feels the blade make contact, screaming as she notices the blood pouring down her arm, but she doesn't seem to notice that her wound doesn't hurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, you let your sister run around some more. She occasionally throws something back at you, which gets a bit annoying, but it doesn't stop your pursuit. As you grow bored of chasing her, you decide to bring an end to it. As you push forward to catch up to your sister, you take a low swing, catching her ankle enough so that her foot was hanging loosely and causing her to fall to the floor. Shortly after the fall, she turns to face you, backing away as quickly as she could on the floor. You then take one more swing at her, which she raises her right arm to block out of instinct.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe longsword makes contact with your sister's wrist, completely severing her hand from her arm. As she stares at the bloody stump where her hand was just moments before, your sister lets out a shriek of terror. Defeated, she stares down at her severed hand before turning her attention back to you as you tower over her. She still doesn't seem to notice the lack of pain from her \"injuries\" as she begs you for mercy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take a look at the longsword in your hand, dripping with blood, then back at your sister's horrified face...</span></div></div>",

You decide to simply text your sister to come help pick you up from the gym.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter steering your body back to some seating you feel the bag being picked up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou go on a bit of a ride. You get set down again in the locker room while it sounds like she showers, then carried over to the lockers themselves. Her hand reaches into the bag for clothes, but instead touches your face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can tell she's alarmed before she reaches in both hands and pulls you out. Well, more like throwing you out as you land on the bench. She recoils realizing she has yet to put on any of her clothes. She quickly grabs them from her bag to cover herself. She then turns around and slips everything on. She turns back to you, pulls her phone out once more, \"What the hell is going on?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, its your bag I fell into, glad its at least someone I know\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't think for a second I 'm going to believe you didn't put yourself there. Where's your body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well\" you start to say, ready to proclaim its waiting for pickup. You then realize you can't feel it anymore. \"Uh, I don't know\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you controlled it\" she typed quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I did too, I had it walk over to the bench to wait for pickup, but I can't feel it anymore\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slaps her hand against her vacant neck stump. \"Ugh, this is why I don't wear heads. Now I've got to get you back to your body\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I'm guessing we're not just headed to your place\" you keep a smile on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to laugh a bit. \"Damnit, I'm helping because some part of me likes you. I'm not sure if throwing your head in my bag makes you cute or a perv\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just laugh as she picks you up. You had to admit, it was much nicer being carried by her than your own body. She brought you out of the locker room to see...</span></div></div>",

She set the blade down on the bed, then put her hands beside herself and pushed up.  She laughed as her upper body lifted away from her torso, the underside swinging softly as she tried to steady herself.

She then made her way back to her legs and with some difficult repositioned herself atop them.  She undid her belt from her jeans and tied it tightly around the cut surface.  Afterward she hooked the suspenders to her belt loops and strapped them over her shoulders, fully securing her to herself.  Finally she put her shirt back on.  \"Eh?  You can't even tell right?\"  She bragged, hopping up and down to prove how sturdy she was.<br>\r\n\"I'm impressed, maybe you did put more thought into this than I thought you did.\"  You concede.<br>\r\n\"Alright, well, now I'd like to try something else.\"  She said.

In fact, would you mind just following my lower half around while I explore?  Just for the sake of safety.\"  She said.  You agreed and she began her journey.  Her legs walked out of the room and you followed them, closing the door behind you so the Michelle couldn't cheat by looking at her legs walk down the stairs.

Finally her toes found the edge, and she made her way down.<br>\r\nStep by step she made her way down, with you right beside her to catch her if something went wrong.  It was weird, you had always been a fair bit taller than your girlfriend and now you towered over her delicate and vulnerable body.  She made it down the stairs safely and began exploring the house.  It took almost no time at all for things to go haywire.  She took a few steps forward and ran directly into the wall, though luckily you were able to catch her before she fell.  She turned and tried to navigate her way to the kitchen, but overshot it and ran into the wall next to it.  The next fifteen minutes were spent with you stifling laughter as Michelle's lower body failed to traverse your house.  You could tell that she was totally lost by the end of it and had no idea that she was in the living room.  Her legs seemed to come to a stop in the middle of the room, her waist bowing forward a little in defeat.  You laugh and pat her on top of the stump in a sort of \"there there\" gesture.<br>\r\nShe then did something that caught you by surprise.  She took a step towards you, pressing up against your left thigh and began slowly but steadily grinding up and down, both of her legs wrapping around your left.  You watched for a long time, feeling her jeans tolling over your skin and getting  increasingly hard.  She then stopped and began slipping out of her pants, jumping up and down without her belt on to loosen them before shaking her hips side to side sliding them down.  Once on the floor she stepped out of her pants, brushing them to the side with her foot.  She had now only her white panties, which you could tell were absolutely soaked.  She then sat down on the floor, lowering herself onto her rear softly before spreading her legs readily.  This really was a dream come true.<br>\r\nYou practically got rope burn as you ripped your pants of  in record time, your boxers going with them seconds later.  You dropped to your knees and grabbed Michelle's panties, dragging them off of her legs and launching them across the room.  She opened herself up again once you were done and you readily took her thighs and began working your way into her.  She was already well lubricated in excitement and with each thrust you traveled deeper, causing her legs to quiver madly.  Soon you were nearly down to your base, drawing in and out in an ever quickening cycle as her legs clenched around you.  You let go of her hips and reached around to her ass, squeezing it tightly as you got a good hold of Michelle.  You stood up with her still impaled on you, her much lighter form and supportive legs making for much easier transport.  You carry her to the nearby couch and set her down on her stump, her upside down body resting perfectly flat on its new surface.  Taking hold of her legs again and spreading them out as widely as possibly, nearly a full splits, you ram yourself into her cunt again at an angle that was wholly new to both of you.  Neither of you can last much longer and soon you climax, continuing to pump as you felt Michelle tighten around you in a barrage of orgasms.  After you are totally spent you step back and draw yourself out, causing Michelle to collapse with her ass in the air and knees on the cushions as she was no longer supported.  You smiled at your handiwork, watching her belly rise and fall shortly despite not having lungs connected.<br>\r\nYou rest momentarily before taking a hold of her right ankle and dragging her behind you like a caveman, her bum dragging across the floor and up the stairs with a sweaty slippery sound.  You open the door and see Michelle on the bed, arms outstretched and panting deeply.  \"Dreams... do come true... after all.\"  She said playfully, causing you to chuckle.  \"So... care to fulfill... another dream of mine?\"  She asked, her head turning up as she asked.  \"Could you...</span></div></div>",

She then attacks the severed parts, slicing them at the knee, ankle, elbow, and wrist, then proceeding to hack the divided parts into progressively smaller, useless chunks. Finally, using and awkward backwards slice, Michelle removes her right arm as well, leaving her completely, permanently limbless. \"There, that's better! Would you do the honers?\" She asks, using her detached arm to present the sword to you hilt first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching out to accept it, you inquire \"Wait, are you saying you want me to....?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hack up this arm like the rest of them?\" Michelle replies, waving her sole remaining limb at you. \"Of course! I'd do it myself, but, well, you know.\" She adds, shrugging her armless shoulders for emphasis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're sure? You'll be totally helpless for the rest of your life afterwards.\" you pointed out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure I'm sure. Besides, it's really too late anyway, I'm already limbless, and really, how much help could a detached arm really be?\" Michelle pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, alright then.\" you said with a shrug. It was her body after all, and as she'd said, it was already far too late for you to bother to protest, so, with only a small amount of reluctance, you did as your girlfriend requested, separating her remaining arm at wrist and elbow, and removing the fingers from the hand, before hacking away madly at them, reducing your girlfriends sole remaining limb into a pile of tiny chunks of flesh, which you then mix with what remains of the rest of her parts and scoop into an old laundry bag which you shove to the back of your closet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to your limbless girlfriend, you inquire \"Okay, that's done, now what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling seductively, Michelle replies \"Why, whatever you like. I'm totally helpless now, obviously your to do whatever you want with. Though, I am feeling more than a little horny.\" she adds, shimmying her limbless torso a little, causing her breasts to wobble enticingly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I can handle that.\" you said, a huge shit eating grin on your face as you strip yourself and your girlfriend in record time, before scooping her up in your arms bridle style and kissing her passionately, before tossing her down on the bed, Michelle letting out a brief shriek of surprise before landing on the mattress where she bounces a couple of times before coming to rest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling she says \"That was fun! Lets do it again!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe later.\" you said, sliding into bed beside her. \"Right now I have other plans for you.\" you add, bringing your face down between her tits and motorboating them before taking one of her nipples in your mouth and sucking on it, groping and squeezing her other breast as Michelle coos in pleasure, thoroughly enjoying your ministrations even as she continues to get off on the total helplessness her limbless condition provides her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh Johnny, it feels so good having you play with my tits like that. Especially since there's no way I can possibly play with them myself now.\" she encourages.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou merely grunt, continuing to suck on her breasts for a moment before flipping her over on her front, raising her ass up and impaling her pussy from behind, fucking her doggy style, pistoning in and out of the living fuck toy your girlfriend has willingly become. Michelle's cries of passion spur you on, causing you to redouble your efforts, pounding the limbless girl hard and fast, causing her to orgasm twice before you begin to feel your own release fast approaching. You don't even consider pulling out, far too lost in the haze of lust and desire to even think of such a thing as you blow your load, your cum thoroughly filling your girlfriends sopping wet pussy and flowing out the sides as you release far more cum that you can ever remember producing before, Michelle's limbless condition having had a profound effect on your libido as well as hers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you've finished, you pause for a moment to catch your breath, but you're only allowed a moment's respite, as_____________________________?</span></div></div>",

As you walked over, your foot slips on one of Michelle's no useless shoes and you trip forward. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aIt happens so fast that you can't even react. The sword slices right through your neck! Severing your head from your shoulders! The momentum of your trip sends your head sailing though the air where it lands facing the wall on the bed next to your limbless girlfriend. The sword slips from your hand and also is sent flying, before coming back down and catching you right at the waist! \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aIn an instant you've been divided into three pieces! Permanently! \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aYou and Michelle are stunned silent. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"D-did that really just happen?\" You ask, while still looking at the wall.\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Wow... that was like some Final Destination shit.\" Your limbless girlfriend flatly states. On the floor, you prop your headless upper body up on your hands. Your legs uneasily stand up.\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck.\" Your legs pace back and forth in the room as you begin to panic. The sword was set on permanent mode! Your girlfriend tries to calm you down.\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"It's okay, it's okay. Maybe there's some kind of undo button on the blade or something. Bring it over to me.\"\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aYou try to calm yourself down. Maybe she's right and there's some kind of failsafe. Best not to lose your head. Well...\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aYou stop pacing your legs and pat around on the floor blindly for the long sword. You can't see what you're doing, but you manage to grab a hold of the hilt of the sword. You pick it up, it's a lot heavier now than when you had your whole body and you weren't prepared for the weight. Your upper body falls backwards as you swing the sword up... and it slices right through your legs at the thighs! \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aYour hips drop to the ground and both of your legs with nothing to support them fall on either side of them. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Fuck!\" You yell at the wall again. Michelle is just kind of amazed at how you've managed to blunder this. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Well... okay. Don't worry, we still might be able to fix this. Just bring me the sword.\"\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aYou take hold of the handle again and tuck the sword under your right arm pit. You prop yourself up on your hands and begin to \"walk\" towards the bed and Michelle. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aYour hand catches the shoe and your upper body trips and falls, the sword passing through your right arm! \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Oh come on!\" You exclaim. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Wow you're bad at this.\"\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aWith a grunt you pick the sword up with your left hand. You slide it across the floor, and then drag your upper body towards it. It's slow going but finally you make it to the bed. You pick the sword up and place it on the edge of the bed. You extend your arm to being your torso up with you, but the sword wasn't exactly stable and it tumbles off the bed, severing your left arm at the shoulder as it falls to the floor.\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"You have got to be fucking kidding me.\" \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aMichelle, permanently limbless thanks to the sword lets out an exasperated sigh as she looks around at our permanently scattered pieces. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"I mean, I know your a klutz and everything, but Jesus. That was almost impressive.\"\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"You can do... anything?!\" You snap. Michelle in her limbless state manages to roll over onto her stomach and moving like an inchworm, makes her way to your head. It's not easy as she extends her neck and crunches her abs, but she manages to make it to the back of your head. Using her head, she manages to turn you around so that your facing her. She nudges your head and pushes it away from the wall before taking some of your hair into her mouth and doing as best as she can to hold you. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Ow!\" \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aMichelle mumbles something unintelligible as she inch worms her way to the edge of the bed with your head in her mouth. Finally she makes it and spits you out. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Phew. That was a work out.\" She says as she tries to catch her breath, panting and sweating. Your sideways on the bed, looking at the mess you've made.\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aTwo legs, two arms, a torso and a pair of hips are scattered about. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"What the hell are we going to do now?\" You ask.\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"I don't think there's much we can do. We're going to have to call for help.\" Michelle looks at her cellphone on the bedside table. \"Can you inch one of your arms to my phone?\"\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"I'm going to have to try.\" You work your right hand to the nightstand. It's a lot easier now that you can see where you are. You watch as your arm scales the table and your hand grabs hold of the phone. You manage to slide the phone onto the bed. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aMichelle looks down at the phone's lock screen. \"You're going to have to type in my code and dial. I don't have fingerprints anymore.\" You forgot about that. Michelle directs you in unlocking her phone and getting to her contacts. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Right there! Hit it!\" The phone starts ringing, you have no idea who Michelle has called until ________ answers. \u202c</span></div></div>",

But first,Michelle grabs a mouthful of your hair and picks your head up. \"Can you put me on the bed?\" she says with her jaw clenched. Katie lays her nude and limbless best friend and her disembodied head of a boyfriend on your bed. She spits you out and you roll down her chest and onto her stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so.

The brush tickles and your limbs buck involuntarily. She stands you two legs up, puts some glue on both of your thighs and places your hips on top. From the bed, you blush as her face comes close to your nude lower body. Katie moves on to your torso, and repeats the process with both of your arms. Eventually, your nude body stands in the middle of the room and Katie grabs your head. She puts a little bit of glue on the underside of your jaw and then sets you down on top of your neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There!\" She says. \"Good as new!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wiggle your toes, and flex your fingers, but when you try to move your larger joints like your shoulders or hips, you find your unable to.

What is it?\" Katie turns you around to face her. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"My parents are going to be home soon! How the hell am I going to explain this?!\"\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Well, maybe they can help?\" Katie says apprehensively. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"No, no way. I am not letting anyone else see me like this. We gotta get out of here.\" \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aMichelle nods in agreement. \"Katie, can you take us to your place? I don't really think going home to my mom and dad like this\", She shrugs her armless shoulders for emphasis, \"is a good idea.\"\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aKatie sets your head down on the bed next to your limbless girlfriend. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Of course! We can all hang at my place while we sort this... mess out. First things first, we need a bag.\"\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aKatie walks to the closet and removes the old laundry bag. She peeks inside.\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"What the hell is all this?\" She asks as she scoops up a handful of fleshy chunks.\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"That's my arms and legs!\"\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aKatie abruptly drops the chunks back into the bag and wipes her hands on her shirt.\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Little uh, excessive, don't you think?\" \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Yeah I kind of... lost it a little there.\" \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aKatie shrugs and sets the bag down in the middle your bed room. He first thing she grabs is your torso, which landed by your dresser and then your hips by the foot of your bed, causing you to blush. Katie packs your parts away and you watch as she begins collecting your limbs. She grabs your arms and legs like a bundle of firewood and dumps them into the laundry bag. They don't appear to fit. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aShe tries to fold your limbs at the joints by even still, they don't really fit. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"You wouldn't happen to have another bag, would you?\" \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aYou instinctively try to shake your head, but nothing happens. You sigh and say, \"No.\" \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Hmm...\" Katie ponders for a moment, snaps her fingers with an \"A-ha!\" And picks up the Longsword. Before you can protest she cuts your legs off at the knees!\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Hey! What the hell are you doing?!\"\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"What? You're already in pieces, it's not like a couple more are going to hurt.\" \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"She's got a point. It's not like you're that much better off..\" says Michelle.\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Ugh, fine.\" Katie takes your arms apart at the elbow and then for good measure, your hands off at the wrist. Now you fit nice and neatly with Michelle's diced limbs. She sets the sword down.\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Okay, now... you.\" She says, pointing to Michelle. \"Let's get you decent.\" \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aShe grabs Michelle's clothes from your bed room floor and flips her onto her back. Your head rolls over after the displaced pressure on the mattress and you catch a sideways view of Katie dressing a giggling Michelle. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Will you stop squirming?\"\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"I can't help it! It tickles!\"\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aKatie slides Michelle's panties over her legless hips. Followed by her skirt. She sits her up and then fastens Michelle's bra and sets her large breasts just right before tossing her shirt over her head. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aYou must admit, seeing her dressed again with her sleeves dangling uselessly and the once short-skirt billowing out around her legless pelvis; the way she doesn't fill out her clothes anymore, turns you own. You can feel yourself growing hard from inside the laundry bag. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Okay, I think we got everything.\" She says.\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Don't forget the sword!\" Michelle says. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Oh right. Looks like we're going to need two trips. Be right back!\" And with that, she throws the laundry bag over her shoulder, takes the sword in her hand and walks out, leaving you and Michelle alone in the room. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"How you doing baby?\" She asks.\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Great. Just. Great.\" You tell her. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Look try not to worry, we'll figure something out.\" She leans down and kisses your cheek. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"I hope so. Otherwise your going to be limbless forever, and I'm going to be nothing but a bunch of bits for the rest of my life.\"\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Well, I wouldn't mind it.\"\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"What being limbless or the bunch of bits for a boyfriend thing?\"\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aWith her head, she rolls you onto your back and gives you a long, hot kiss. \"Either.\" She sefuctively says. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aKatie enters the room and Michelle straightens up. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Okay, we're all packed up. Let's move out.\" She picks up Michelle first, her hand on her bottom for support before grabbing you by your hair.\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Ow! Watch the hair!\"\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aKatie sandwiches you in between her and Michelle's breasts. This is better. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aMichelle is put into the passenger seat and you're placed on the seat in front of her. And with that, you guys are off. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aFrom the seat, you can't see the windshield. You're not sure where Katie lives, and with you feeling so helpless and vulnerable what with your body parts sitting in Katie's trunk, you're growing impatient. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aMichelle cranes her neck to look over the dash. Katie chuckles.\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"If I had known you were going to make yourself so short I would have grabbed a booster seat. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"I kind of like it,\" she says. \"Makes me feel, I dunno... cute?\"\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"You are cute.\" Katie pats her head and smiles at her. \"Stupid, but cute.\"\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aKatie gasps suddenly and her foot hits the brakes. Her arm shoots out to keep Michelle from tipping over as the car comes to a screech. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aYour head isn't so lucky. \"Ah!\" You fly off the seat and smack your noggin against the dash, land on your face and then roll under the seat. \"Ow! God damn it!\"\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Phew, that was close. You guys okay?\"\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Yeah.\" Michelle says from the confines of the comfy passenger seat.\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"No!\" You say from your spot on be floor, surrounded by pennies and old French fries. You feel Katie grab your hair and pull you up. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Here I'll hold on to you.\" She puts you in your lap while she keeps driving. You're looking up, watching Katie drive. You never really noticed how big Katie's boobs were. Maybe it's the angle, or the fact that you're so small now. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aMichelle must have caught you looking, and you hear her loudly clear her throat.\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Little close, don't you think?\" \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"You're right. Here, let me set him in your lap, OH WAIT.\" She smirks at Michelle. \"We're here anyway.\"\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aYou feel the car lurch into park and Katie turning the engine off. She picks you up and holds you to Michelle. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"You mind?\" \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aMichelle takes a mouthful of your hair and holds you in her teeth. Your head getting a view down her shirt. Katie leans over and hoists up Michelle. You swing slightly as Katie carries Michelle into her apartment. Brought into the living room, Michelle gets set down on the sofa and you get placed on the coffee table in front of her. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aShe then leaves through the front door, and comes back with the Longsword and the laundry bag. She drops them both on to the floor and let's out a loud sigh. She holds her lower back.\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"After today, one of you owes me a back massage.\"\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Sorry, no hands.\" Michelle grins.\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Guess it's on you, clumsy.\"\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aYou roll your eyes. \"Alright, well we're here. So now what?\"\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Well...\" Katie looks to the sword and laundry bag. \u202c<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You shiver, all twelve pieces of you trembling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Michelle watch, there's little else you two can do, as Katie picks up your torso. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eww, you're all sticky.\" She says as she runs her finger across your next stump. \"I think we should probably clean all of you up before we try and get you together. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's a good idea, but you look towards Michelle. After all, getting a bath by your girlfriend's best friend seems like crossing a line and the last thing you want to do is piss off the woman who cut her arms and legs off for you.<br>\r\nMichelle however, nods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, a bath would probably help. You think you could give me one too, Katie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course! I'll go get it ready.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie takes your torso with her. While she's out of the room, you ask Michelle, \"Are you sure you're okay with this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why wouldn't I be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because your best friend has been practically fondling me all day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I mean, it's not like I can do it anymore.\" She says with a somewhat proud smile.  \"I'm loving this.\" She shimmies her limbless trunk for emphasis. \"It feels so... I dunno... sexy. Like I'm nothing but some kind of... pet, getting pampered and taken care of. It's everything I wanted!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugs, and bobs her head towards the pile of your body parts. \"I guess not everything. I wanted it to be you taking care of me. But hey, now you get to enjoy this too!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enjoy this? How the hell am I possibly going to enjoy this, Michelle?  I'm going to be spending the rest of my life like some kind of human Lego set!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're being too negative. You'll start to enjoy this by the end of the night. Trust me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie enters the living room. \"Okay, you guys ready?\" She says with a smile. She scoops up your limbs and hips in her arms and carries you away. From the other room, you feel your body parts being dropped into the tub and the soothing warm water washes over you. After a moment, she returns for the rest of you and Michelle, once again sandwiching you in between the two of them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the bathroom, Michelle is set down on top of the toilet seat and your head is placed on the edge of the bath. You watch as Katie lifts Michelle up and quickly slides her skirt and panties off of her legless hips with ease. It's quickly followed by Michelle's shirt being pulled up, leaving her clad only in her bra. Katie pulls her straps down, off of her armless shoulders and slides the bra down your girlfriend's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man this is so much easier without limbs in the way\" Katie muses. \"Hmm... were your boobs always this big?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they just look bigger without my arms.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie grabs a handful of your girlfriend, who responds with a giggle.  \"You gotta be careful. You can't be too too heavy, otherwise you'll be tipping over all the time.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch from the edge of the tub as your girlfriend is groped by her best friend and feel yourself getting hard from underneath the water. Katie picks Michelle up and gently sets her down in the bath. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou and Michelle have tried to take baths together before but you could never get comfortable. Now thought you must admit it feels kind of nice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie lathers up a sponge and you feel her take it to your neck stump. It feels amazing and soon, despite your predicament, you find yourself starting to relax. She picks up different pieces of you and scrubs the left over glue off of your ends. When she picks up your hips, you're fully erect, a sight which brings a stifled snicker from Michelle and blushing from both you and Katie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess someone is starting to enjoy this.\" Michelle slyly says. Katie clears her throat and goes back to work, scrubbing your hips and your junk till they're squeaky clean. Her hands on your member causes you to nearly explode, but before that can happen, she sets your hips back down into the bath and you secretly wish for release. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, your turn.\" She says to Michelle, who winks at you. Katie lathers up the sponge and rubs the back of her neck. A pleasurable moan escapes her lips as Katie rubs her back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm that feels so good...\" she coos. \"I could so get used to this.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie takes the sponge across Michelle's shoulders and down her chest, soaping up her breasts which elicits more moans from your girlfriend. You look up at Katie, to see her biting her lip as she takes especially good care of making sure Michelle's breasts are cleaned. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lower...\" Michelle mutters and Katie slowly takes the sponge to her stomach. \"Lower...\" she says again, this time more of a hush whisper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michelle... I don't know...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...\" Michelle begs. \"I can't do it myself\" she says innocently and looks up at Katie with the biggest, puppy dog eyes. Katie swallows hard and lowers the sponge. Michelle smiles and lets out a little squeal as Katie's hand disappears under the water.  You watch from the edge of the tub as Katie's hand moves faster and faster and Michelle pants faster and faster. Katie leans over, and Michelle nibbles lightly on her friend's earlobe. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michelle, what are you...\" Katie turns to face Michelle, who plants a long kiss on her lips. Katie reciprocates and returns the favor, her hand working more feverishly under the water. You can feel the blood rushing to both of your heads as you watch the scene in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Michelle let's out a gasp and her little body convulses. Water splashes, surprising Katie and causing her to jump and knock your head into the tub! You sink to the bottom, getting a close up view of Michelle's crotch before you're quickly fished out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry about that.\" Katie says with a clear of her throat and puts you back down on the edge. Michelle looks to be awash in ecstasy as she looks up at Katie. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was amazing...\" she says blissfully. \"Oh no, it looks like you got a little wet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I- uh...\" Katie stammers. Michelle chuckles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your shirt.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah, uh that. Let's... get you out of there.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie drains the tub and wraps Michelle in a towel before lifting her up out of the tub. She sets her down on the toilet again. The water lowers and exposes your body parts to the cool air and you once again shiver. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie kneels down and begins fishing out your pieces and setting them down on a towel on the floor. When all of your parts are out of the tub, Katie pats you dry, bundles your body up and takes it out of the bathroom. Michelle leans back against the toilet tank and let's out a sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like you're having fun.\" You say sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm loving it.\" She says with a smile. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about I have some of that fun?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel your body parts being dropped down on a soft surface. You assume it's Katie's bed. From the other room, you feel Katie tentatively poke your still erect penis. The poke turns to a full fist and a slight pull. In the bathroom, you raise your eyebrows. Michelle notices. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on there?\" She says slyly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think Katie is uh...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou trail off as you feel lips wrap around your shaft.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Katie!\" Michelle calls out, \"I think you forgot a few things!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou feel Katie cease her sucking and after a minute or two, she walks back into the bathroom, now completely nude. Wordlessly, she grabs you by your hair, and with her free hand, scoops Michelle up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarrying you both to her bedroom, she tosses Michelle onto her bed, where she bounces giggling amongst your dismembered body. She throws your head next to her, and you land next to  your girlfriend's head. Michelle turns and starts making out with you.  While this is going on, you feel Katie grab a hold of your hips and she lays down next to your girlfriend. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle turns her head and begins to make out with Katie, who begins to position your hips next to her crouch. Michelle breaks off her kiss. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh,  no. I want that one.\" She nods her head in the direction of yours. \"You can get that one.\"  Katie shrugs and sits up, still holding your hips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKatie sets your hips towards your girlfriend's snatch and picks your head up. A quick kiss and then you're lowered towards her crotch. Getting the message, you set to work. While you're eating Katie out, you feel her grab a hold of your hips and you feel yourself slip inside of Michelle. You hear Michelle gasp from between Katie's legs and you let out a muffled moan of your own as you continue to lick away. Katie pumps your hips in and out of Michelle, who squirms and writhes in pleasure, some of your pieces falling off the bed in the process. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA little while later, you feel Katie's thighs quiver around your head. Michelle let's out a scream. You can't contain yourself any longer and all three of you climax at the same time. Katie pulls your spasming hips out of Michelle and collapses onto the bed, letting your head roll away. All three of you lay there, sweating and panting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was... that was...\" Katie trails off, unable to catch her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh huh.\" Michelle agrees with a nod.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, little help here?\" You call out from the foot of the bed, your rapidly deflating dick and balls in your clear line of sight. Katie groans and with great effort sits up, grabs your hair for purchase and then flops back down to the bed, setting your head in between her and Michelle. Your head tilts sideways and you come face to face with your smiling girlfriend. A few moments later, you hear Katie lightly snoring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Still not enjoying this?\" She asks playfully. Before you can answer, she cuts you off with a kiss. In your post-sex bliss, you temporarily forget your predicament. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, you both fall asleep. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the morning, you wake to see:</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>John and Wendy had broken for a laundry list of reasons, with plenty of blame for both parties to share.  John made shortsighted decisions that ended up biting him in the ass, whenever he actually did try to think through a decision he would be riddled with indecision and let other people make choices for him, he was ridiculously petty, he always played the victim, and he objectified every halfway attractive woman he came across.  For her part, Wendy was selfish, greedy, dishonest, used people, and was manipulative to an almost certainly psychotic degree.  In a twisted way, they were a perfect match for each other, assuming the goal was to make a relationship more toxic than arsenic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat said, despite the multitude reasons for their eventual breakup, John didn\u2019t seem to mind Wendy dabbling in being a cam-girl or selling erotic pictures of herself off of her private blog.  Mostly because he never found out about it.  Wendy didn't post regularly as she didn't need the money, she just needed the occasional confidence boost and enjoyed watching thirsty men lust over her from time to time and message her desperately asking when her next performance or photdump would be.  She wasn't dumb enough to use her real name for such activities, going under the alias \"Jenna Jamma\" as playing bass in the buff was her first video and she'd done a lot of nude jam sessions solo and with her guitar playing friend Cori (Strum Sista).  All videos and photos were shot from her home's \"Utility Closet\", actually a guest bedroom that Wendy told all guests was a utility closet so that they'd either have sleep on the couch or in her room depending on the guest, meaning that no one other than her, Cori, her parents, and maybe a repairman knew what the inside of that room looked like.  Most importantly for her anonymity, however, was that she shaved all of her body hair so as not to reveal her hair color, and all photos and videos were shot from the neck down, with all mirrors and reflective surfaces in the room covered or moved out of the shot before filming, meaning her face never came into view.  While Wendy (or, \"Jenna\") got a lot of request to show her face on camera, her body so beautiful that everyone (correctly) assumed she had a face beautiful enough to match it, and there was a running joke among her small but dedicated band of followers that she was either secretly a medusa or she'd lost her head in some sort of bizarre bass-solo accident... the more she thought about it, the more Wendy was beginning to believe that her decapitation was a blessing in disguise rather than a curse.  Not only did her headlessness give her the ability to record without worrying about camera angles or mirrors or whatever, it gave her a new gimmick.  There were plenty of women who played instruments naked, many of whom were far more talented than Wendy was (not that she was bad, she was just average in this respect), but how many of them made videos quite literally headless?  Very few, Wendy had to imagine.  She'd have a whole niche all to herself, an audience that could come to her and only her for their content, her fanbase would explode without her even needing to increase the amount she posted, she could still get away with posting only a handful of photos and one short video a week, maybe one long jam session every month or so, and still rake in the attention and moolah!  It was perfect!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, John.  You ridiculously petty, shortsighted dick.\"  Wendy muttered, picking her head, laptop, and webcam and carrying all three to her guest room.  Setting up her webcam and laptop on the desk, facing the large pink couch in the middle of the room, and her head beside her laptop facing the screen, Wendy set up her camera in the usual position that would've kept her head out of view and her bare breasts in the center of the frame while sitting at the desk's chair.  Wendy set a repeating 30 second timer on the webcam and placed both hands over her chest in a heart shape, snapping a photo of her shoulders to her upper midriff.  Next, she got up, took a few steps back so that her head would be in frame were it on her shoulders, and held out her hand in front of her far enough that the forced perspective of her palm blocked out the empty space where her head should be.  Finally, she turned around, bent over, and showed her plump butt and cute cunt to the camera at angle where her hard buns blocked out just about every other part of her upper body including her \"head\".  After checking to make sure that the pictures were good enough (it was \"Jenna\", so of course they were), she posted the three pictures to her blog along with the short message \"{i]A quick heads up!  After, thinking it over, I've decided to do a long awaited face reveal!  Tune into my channel in 20 minutes for the mind-blowing reveal!  Excitement ahead![/i}\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting up her stream to start automatically in 20 minutes, Wendy grabbed her bass and pick and did a quick bit of practicing, figuring out which songs she'd want to play.  Her fingers trembled with excitement as she strummed, reducing her average bass playing to slightly sub-average, though with all of the excitement that was doubtless to pour in due to her reveal, she doubted the audience would care.  Watching the chat, Wendy saw a collection of about 20 regulars and a few new people/bots, not bad given the short notice of her update, the fact that this wasn't a scheduled streaming date or time, and the fact that she was a pretty obscure girl on a site flooded with big names.  The chat seemed abuzz with excitement, everyone encouraging her and begging her to start the stream early.  Wendy smiled, smugly, lapping up their desire.  As show-time drew nearer Wendy ceased playing, flipping her bass around and angling it so that the headstock strategically covered her coochie and the body blocked her \"head\" from view.  The seconds ticked down, and just as Wendy took a long, deep, excited breath, the orange light turned green.  She was on air!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy did nothing, her body standing stock still as the suspense mounted.  She watched the chat, only one or two messages popping up every dozen or so seconds as the entire audience seemed to be holding their collective breaths.  Just as the suspense was growing unbearable for her titillated audience, as the comments began pouring in calling her a tease and a cheeky bitch and wondering if this was some kind of troll and wondering if a Rick-Roll was about to pop up, Wendy flipped the guitar dramatically into position and started playing, her shoulders and hips swaying rhythmically and her headless neck stump revealed for the world to see.  Or, at least the 23 people in the world who happened to be watching this particular stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo Wendy's surprise, and slight annoyance, audience reaction was decidedly mixed.  Some were laughing their asses off, saying this was a great troll and a fun way to continue her chat's running jokes, others asked what green screen or editing software she was using as it was \"pretty good\", and some called her a \"lame-baiting tease\" and left the chat.  A few, however, gave her exactly the results she was looking for.  They called her the hottest thing they'd ever seen, they asked where her head was or if she ever had one to begin with, they called her amazing, said she was sexier without her head, asked if she'd ever eaten herself out (an idea that hadn't crossed Wendy's mind up to that point, but was now filed away for later), saying they knew some people who would love this, and heaping praise on her headless shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna played three songs over fifteen minutes, switching poses between each song.  Her first was played with body standing, facing the camera, and swaying her hips and shoulders so that her free boob (the one that didn't have a guitar strap over it and restricting its movement) bounced playfully side to side.  For her second song she turned around, her butt facing the camera and her body bouncing on the balls of her foot causing her cheeks to jiggle up and down and for the outermost folds of her vagina to teasingly peak out from behind them every once in a while.  For the finale, Jenna sat on the edge of her large pink bed with the bass in her lap and her legs spread wide, giving everyone a nice full view of her clean shaven and glistening cooch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen \"Jenna\" finished playing, she gingerly slid the bass' strap across her shoulders, making sure to rub the strap against her empty neck stump to prove that there was nothing there and that this wasn't some kind of cheap effect, set the guitar aside, and approached her camera with one hand sensually rubbing her bare stump and the other rubbing her pussy's dripping outer lips with equal tenderness.  Reaching the keyboard, she quickly typed \"<i>Happy I was finally able to get this secret off my shoulders!  Hope it was everything you'd imagined!  Until next week, Jenna Jamma signing off!</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before she turned off her camera and shut her laptop, Wendy observed the chat again.  She had to restrain a giggle when she saw that the vieweship had more than tripled, from 24 to 81 people, and that the comments had shifted from almost pure skepticism to excited debate on whether or not this could be real, elated cheers declaring Jenna the hottest thing ever, some pretty big tips, and a laundry list of erotic requests and promises of large donations on their completion.  Not bad for a first day's work!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShutting off the laptop and unplugging the camera, Wendy picked up her head and kissed her empty neck stump, the sensation sending a shiver down her abbreviated spine.  \"Jenna, you did good!\"  She said, squeezing herself against her chest.  It was getting late, and not feeling like going all the way back to her room, Jenna simply crawled into the guest bed and snuggled her head like a teddy bear.  She grinned contently, and within minutes she was fast asleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Wendy checks Jenna's blog to find...</span></div></div>",

I hope you know that 3rd graders aren't allowed on this site.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWeeeeeeeeeb:  <i>Huh, never knew I had this fetish.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading through the comments, following each link posted by both old fans and newcomers, and slowly spooning dry cereal into her mouth as her permanently detached head rested in her lap, Wendy couldn't help but feel a little cheated.  She was the first headless streamer, and had accrued more tips for yesterday's performance than she had on any other day of streaming (a modest $500 after taxes, but when you considered the fact that only 81 people had been watching at the height of the stream's popularity and the fact that she only streamed for a little over 15 minutes, it was quite a sum), but she was the ONLY headless streamer for less than two hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn had evidently been very busy with his blade, as no fewer than six separate people had recorded themselves in various states of disassembly and to various degrees of lewdness.  Wendy recognized most of them.  John's twin sister Jenna (who by pure coincidence shared Wendy's stage name, and who had stupidly decided to use her real name for her sex tapes) was the most easily identifiable, as she spent half an hour eating herself out with her own severed head in various poses, stopping only to mug at the camera and make the most cringe inducing puns conceivable.  John's girlfriend Michelle was also easy to recognize, as while her head was out of frame and she used an alias for her account, it was a video of John (who's upper body was out of frame the entire video, so Wendy had no idea if he'd done anything to himself) bending her headless body over his own bed and pounding her ass senseless while Michelle moaned just behind the camera.  Wendy was very familiar with that room, and that cock inside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next woman was a surprise to Wendy, her and John's woodworking teacher Ms. Kane.  Well, it was a surprise to see a recording of HER TEACHER'S very distinct headless body with her wrists and ankles tied to (presumably) her bedposts while a train of dudes formed an orderly queue to ream her (and a few spent some time in the line exploring the hole of the man in front of them).  Though, it wasn't necessarily a surprise that someone as hot as Ms. Kane would have guys lining up to fuck her.  She was fucking gorgeous, with almost cartoonishly proportioned curves, milk chocolate skin that was unnaturally youthful due to her lack of kids and strict diet &amp; exercise regimen, and the fact that she always seemed to get a little too \"cute\" with her students making her very memorable.  Her video was by far the most popular, and while she'd hidden the donation numbers, if Wendy'd gotten $500 for  only 15 minutes of naked guitar playing, she could only imagine what Ms Kane gotten for nearly two hours of non-stop reaming.  Other than STI's, if any of the guys' condoms ripped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next woman was a hispanic girl Wendy vaguely knew of from school, someone on the women's soccer team she couldn't remember the name of, but she definitely knew her face which was both on camera the whole video and was the only one of the women to have it firmly attached to her body.  Unlike the other streamers, this girl (who ironically went by the very suggestive \"Ball-Kicking-Dom\") had an entirely non-sexual stream.  It was just her in her backyard practicing footwork and taking trickshots into a soccer net, her uniform was maybe a size too small but it wasn't really exposing anything to the audience and it looked worn enough to have just been bought when she was younger and smaller.  She was very good, Wendy thought, her legs moving in ways that would surely cause Wendy's own ankles to instantly and violently explode, and judging by the modifications John had made this B-K-D, she had likely requested the changes herself.  Both of her arms now ended right above the elbow, leaving her with no way of accidentally touching the ball with her hands and getting penalized while also lightening herself up considerably allowing her to move a little quicker than before.  Damn, she must be really serious about her soccer career prospects, if she was willing to have both of her arms chopped off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last of the streamers \"Jenna's\" fans had linked her two was a pair, most likely boyfriend and girlfriend judging by the activities they got up to.  Both boyfriend and girlfriend had similar body types, lean and slender with pale skin and tons of hair around their genitals and in their pits but basically none anywhere else.  While neither of their heads made an appearance, Wendy would guess that the two were both East Asian, especially since there was a poster of some anime or... whatever the Korean equivalent was called behind them, with words written in an East Asian language.  While both boyfriend and Girlfriend lacked a head, the boyfriend was otherwise intact, whereas the girl had been absolutely hacked to pieces by John's blade.  Her feet had been removed from her ankles, her ankles from her calves, her calves from her knees, her knees from her thighs, her thighs from her hips, her hips from her waist, her waist from her bust, her bust from her neck and shoulders, and her arms had been sliced at the wrists, both sides of the elbow, and the shoulders.  She was nothing more than a pile of pieces spread over the floor, which her boyfriend teased and enjoyed one by one with methodical but passionate gusto.  How John convinced this woman, IF John did this to her willingly, Wendy had no idea, but she did find it fascinating and of all the videos she watched that one for the longest amount of time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen she'd finished, Wendy frowned.  Not only was she no longer unique, as John had sliced no fewer than 6 other women and who knows how many hadn't recorded themselves or were keeping a low profile.  Wendy was much more likely to be identified now that people would be sharing videos of these other headless girls, many of whom were much less secretive about their identities.  One of John's victims could be sent one of Jenna's videos, recognize her figure, and then start talking, the whole world would know who Jenna Jamma really is!  Maybe this was a good time for Jenna to retire, for Wendy to nuke all of her recorded streams and bury the evidence, find some way to hide her headlessness...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen again, was it so bad if people knew?  After all, Wendy could get John in some serious trouble if this damaged her reputation.  Whether or not she liked her headlessness, what John did was still permanent disfigurement, and surely some lawyer or another would be willing to help Wendy sue him for all he's worth... oh, right.  He ain't worth shit.  Still, now that so many women were doing this, it might become normalized.  She'd be just another headless streamer, and with its normalization the money and fans would be far more forthcoming.  Wendy had already received more money than ever before, and her viewer count was extremely good for a spur of the moment unscheduled broadcast at a weird time of day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end, Wendy decides to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Apparently John had been <i>very</i> busy since Wendy had least seen that loser.  Curious to see how far John's little chopping spree had gone, and to see if there were any more cut apart streamers other than the ones her fans had told her about, she began to search.  With her head sat upon her desk and her fingers typing away, she felt her jaw hit the table as she saw no less than five more people had been chopped up by John and were now streaming their detached bodies for all the internet to see.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first new streamer she found was none other than her friend and sometimes stream partner Cori!  The buxom blonde had her fat pillowy ass pointed at the camera, her ass-cheeks spread before the void of the internet.  But, rather than having her stomach resting on her bed like she should in that position, her severed upper body was behind her lower half, hugging her the flat plane of her hips to her large beasts.  She was doing a parody instructional video of how a woman's anatomy works.  She flipped her legs over and opened them spread eagle, then maneuvered her torso to the floor so her her face was right next to her snatch.  She pointed out each anatomical feature of the vagina, then explained, in detail and with visuals, how to please a vagina a she began to eat herself out.  Wendy clicked away, semi disgusted that her friend took a deal with John, but nonetheless impressed with her knowledge of anatomy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next person to stream after being affected by the blade was someone Wendy had seen on the track and field team.  Or, at least, she had sen most of her.  Whereas Cori had had herself split in half, and the soccer girl had merely had part of her arms removed, this crazy woman had decided to completely remove the upper half of her body!  Wendy was in shock, unable to understand how someone could do this to themselves.  In fact, the only reason she could tell who it was was due to the rose tattoo on the legs ankle.  She watch, as the pair of legs, nude with large muscular thighs, toned calves, and a round tight ass, sat cross-legged in front of a keyboard with a smoothie and banana next to her feet.  The legs clumsily typed away at the keyboard, excitedly telling viewers about how she was able to run faster without, as she put it, 'all that dead weight' on her.  Many were asking how she was even alive, or able to eat.  She soon answered their questions as her feet carefully, yet shakily, lifted the tip of the straw in the smoothie to her unshaven pussy.  Her lips seemed to tremble a bit as the straw was grasped, and then a sucking sound could be heard.  Wendy had to click away, it was just too weird.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that she saw a random woman she did not know.  She was tall, skinny and black, with a very cute looking face.  Her detached head was in the front of the screen, while her nude headless body sat on the bed in the background with her head obscuring its crotch.  She seemed to be sucking on something in her mouth, and doing so also seemed to be causing her great pleasure.  She winked and her body stood up as she spit something fleshy and wet from her mouth with a low moan.  Her crotch was empty, and the thing that rested near her detached head was her saliva soaked and twitching cunt.  Wendy was getting a little unnerved at how easily these women were devolving into such erotic acts, but it also made her realize she may have to step up her game to keep any followers for her own stream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last two streamers, a lesbian couple, had to be the weirdest of the bunch.  Even with all the weird things Wendy had just seen, this took the cake.  The couple were mixed race, a very tan Latina woman and a pasty white redhead.  The first thing that Wendy noticed was that the skin tones were all wrong.  The Latina's arms, legs and breasts were too pale, and the redheads were too tan.  That, and they had each other's faces somehow attached to each others crotch, which Wendy thought was impossible for the blade.  Adding onto that, where their face should have been was a patch of Velcro, and attached the that were each others anus and vagina.  She pieced it together pretty quick after that.  The pair had sort of gotten around the no attaching clause by adhering Velcro to their bodies, and after Jon chopped off their respective parts, they were able to swap parts between them quite easily.  Although, to Wendy's eyes, it was obvious the Velcro wouldn't hold forever and as well, the limbs on the torsos were in control making each girl move around somewhat oddly as they were remotely piloting each other's torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWendy huffed, upset that John had not only messed up her perfect body, but that he had also cut into her revenue stream!  She had to get back with him, somehow...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You quickly decide that there was no one you would like better to explore the abilities of your new toy with than your girlfriend Michelle. A long time fan of natural body magic, Michelle is a beautiful girl, standing five foot eight with olive skin, long dark brown, almost black hair, long dark lashes, big beautiful emerald green eyes, full kissable lips and a heart shaped face, set atop a slender athletic figure, with ling sexy legs, tight butt, narrow waist, and a an impressive set of full but perky natural D-cup tits, all of which makes you often wonder how you ever managed to get lucky enough to gain the attentions of such an exceptional beauty. Quickly you text <i>\"Hey babe, just got an interesting item that I know you'll want to try. Would it be alright for me to come over?\"</i>  then set down to wait for your girlfriends response, which isn't long in coming. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Sure honey, come right over. My parents are gone for the weekend, so we won't be disturbed.\"</i> Michelle texts back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>\"Sounds good, be right over.\"</i> you replied before hoping up and rushing over to your girlfriends house, making sure to grab the sword on your way out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMaking your way over to your girlfriends house in record time, you ring the doorbell and wait for her to answer. Almost immediately, the door's flung open and you feel yourself being grabbed and dragged inside, which you don't really mind much once you see what it is your girlfriend's wearing. Her outfit doesn't amount to much, just a lacy bra and pantie set a set of back nylon stockings, and a pair of matching high heels, a combination that shows off her womanly charms in a way that you could enjoy for hours if you both didn't have more pressing business. \"So lover boy, tell me about this new toy you were so excited about.\" Michelle requests as soon as the door shuts behind you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager to obey, Answer \"Just wait till you see it Michelle, you'll never believe what it can do!\" While rummaging around in the duffle bag you'd brought over and coming up with the long sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing what it is that you've pulled out, Michelle's excited expression turns to one of disappointment. \"John, another magic prop, really? Don't you think this sort of thing gets a little boring after a while?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one's different.\" you insist. \"This one does real magic!\" you explain, handing Michelle the note that came with the long sword.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReading the note, Michelle looks over at you skeptically. \"You know this doesn't really prove anything don't you? I mean, it would be great if this were true, but have you actually tested this thing?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, no, not really.\" you answered sheepishly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right. Well then, don't you think that just maybe we should try testing it before we go hacking arms and legs off without knowing whether or not we'll bleed to death of whether they can be reattached or not if we do survive?\" she continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, yea, that, that would probably be best.\" you acknowledged. \"But if not us, then what are we suppose to test it on?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle seems to think about it for a moment. \"Hmm, well, Mrs. Piedmont's got about a zillion cats running around her place, at least one of which is usually wandering around in our backyard, so.... \" she suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want us to experiment on the cat? What if something goes wrong?\" you asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle shrugged. \"It's a risk I admit, but she has so many it's not like she's likely to miss just one. Besides, who would you rather experiment on, yourself or the cat?\" she asked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, okay, the cat it is. Now, lets see if we can find one of the little fur balls.\" you replied, going to Michelle's backdoor and stepping outside in search of any stray felines that might be around. Sure enough, you almost immediately spot a grey and white tabby asleep on the back of a lawn chair soaking up the sun. Not wanting to wake the feline, you stealthy approach, sword in hand. You needn't have bothered, as the cat is so domesticated and friendly, that as you'r shadow falls over it, rather than making any effort to escape, the cat merely glances up at you before rolling over on it's back and waiting for you to scratch it's belly. This expression of trust is almost enough to dissuade you from the experiment you're about to attempt, as you've no real desire to hurt the poor kitty, even by accident. Only almost however, as while petting the cats stomach you carefully position the blade over it's tail before swinging hard, slicing cleanly through the furry appendage in a single smooth motion. Extremely startled by this, the car takes off, clawing you a little in the process, the absence of it's tale making it clumsier than it otherwise would be, leaving it's tail lying on the ground. Fortunately it doesn't go far, only a few feet or so before sitting down and cleaning it's butt, glaring reproachfully at you all the while. Seeing that there doesn't seem to be any blood coming out, either from the tail or the feline, you pick it up and attempt to make your way over, only for for the cat to hiss and retreat into the bushes. This will require strategy you thin to yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Michelle, do you have any an's of tuna or anything lying around? The cat doesn't want to come out.\" you said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we might. Let me check.\" your girlfriend says, disappearing back into the kitchen in search of any tasty tidbits the cat might enjoy, coming back a couple of minutes latter with a can of canned ham. \"This is the best I could find.\" she said half apologetically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShrugging, you reply \"It'll have to do. Lets see if we can get the cat to go for it.\" you said before putting the can out and backing away slightly, though not too much as you still wanted to be able to catch the cat when it comes close enough. Smelling the food, the cat soon comes trotting out and begins devouring the unexpected treat, allowing you to get close enough to grab it. Quickly, before it can struggle free, you manage to find it's tail stub, and pressing the severed ends together, watch in amazement as the severed tail reattaches, though you quickly become distracted when the cat claws you, causing you to drop it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou curse a bit before turning to your girlfriend. Smiling you explain \"Operation Cat was a complete success, ready to move on to phase two?\" while holding up the long sword. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling nervously, your girlfriend replies \"Well, if it worked on the cat, i guess there's no real reason to put it off any longer is there? Though I have to admit, a part of me is still bit nervous.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like for me to test the sword first?\" you offered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaving away your offer Michelle answers \"No, no, I still want to be the first to try it. I am a little nervous, but I'm a lot more excited than anythig else now that we know it works. So, with that in mind, I want you to ___________________________?</span></div></div>",

I'm sure everything will be fine.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, okay, if it's really what you want...\" you said answered reluctantly before doing as Michelle asked, the sword slicing through her neck like a hot knife through butter, severing her head completely in a single blow, causing it to fall off and go rolling across the floor for a little ways, a blank expression on it's face as though nobody was home. Noting there was no blood, something that you took as a good sign, you turned your attention to your girlfriends body. The space where her head originally attached having been covered with a smooth layer of skin, Michelle's body just sits there, seemingly totally unaware and unresponsive to it's surroundings, something you confirm by calling her name and waving your hand in front of her a few times, and getting absolutely no reaction. You're just about to try touching her when she finally starts to move, one hand reaching up and feeling around between her shoulders where her head and neck used to attach. Finding nothing, Michelle begins massaging the area, apparently an intense sensation as she suddenly stiffens up for a moment as though she'd stuck her finger in a light socket. After a moment of inactivity, Michelle continues for a moment, more cautiously this time, before placing her hands out in front of her as though reaching for something, her head most likely, though it could be you she was after. Reaching down to retrieve her head, you're about to give it to her when you wonder, what would it be like to have two heads for a change? In all likelihood you should probably give Michelle her head back and ask her permission before doing such a thing, but then, where's the fun in that? </span></div></div>",

It's an interesting experience being headless, but not something you really feel like exploring right now, and so you soon replace your head, slightly off center this time, your senses returning to you as you do so, allowing you to see your girlfriend, still aimlessly wandering around in search of her missing head. \"<i>Well, she won't be finding it anytime soon.\"</i> you think to yourself, picking up Michelle's disembodied head and placing it on your shoulders, just to the left of your original head. Opening your second set of eyes and looking around the room, you notice two things. First, Michelle's eyesight is better than yours, and second, that for some reason, when you put on Michelle's head, you somehow also gained access to her memories, something that you weren't expecting. There's far to much for you to go through all at once, but a quick scan of her most recent thoughts reveals that, far from wanting her head back, Michelle had actually been hoping you would do something like this, the thought of having no head whatsoever highly arousing to her, for whatever reason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than her head, she must be searching for you instead, probably wanting to thank you for this wonderful experience. Well, who are you to deny her? Walking over, you grab hold of her wrists, bringing her hands up, one to each face, allowing her to feel what you've done, and to know that, until you decide otherwise, she truly is headless now, with all that that imply's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nrealizing what you've done, Michelle becomes excited, throwing her arms around your necks and pulling in close, hugging you for all she's worth before she begins fumbling with your clothes, practically ripping them off in her haste, before doing the same to her own, before reaching down and grabbing your cock, jacking you off until your full hard, something that doesn't take long at all as you're highly aroused already, the sight of your headless girlfriend and the knowledge of just how kinky she actually is doing wonders for your libido.</span></div></div>",

Turning one of your heads to look at her, you sigh softly, knowing it was time for you to return her head, but oddly reluctant to do so. Perhaps you were getting used to having two heads, or maybe you simply enjoyed seeing Michelle without one, but you knew you shouldn't try and keep her this way any longer. with this in mind, you begin tracing words on your girlfriends bare skin, hoping she'll understand the message that you're trying to convey. After several attempts at it, you realize that it doesn't seem to be working, your efforts to communicate only causing Michelle to wiggle and squirm, something not entirely unexpected, as she's always been rather ticklish. You'll have to try something a little more direct in order to get your point across. reaching over and taking hold of her wrist, you guide her hand over to her original face, letting her feel it until you were satisfied she knows what it is, before moving her hand to the space where her head should have been, manipulating her fingers so that she was making a thumbs up gesture, then reversing it, figuring that maybe she would understand this message at least.

Did Michelle get your message, only to decide to play with the sword herself instead of helping you to restore herself, or is this someone else who, through whatever means has either discovered the power of the sword, or somehow ran afoul of someone else who had? Regardless she seems to be enjoying your touch, rubbing her neck stump against your hand like a cat in heat, meanwhile continuing to rub away at your own neck stub, something that you enjoy very much, the space where your head would normally be having somehow been transformed into an erogenous zone. Shrugging, you decide that, while you'd certainly rather have your head back, this wasn't so bad, placing both hands on the headless girls shoulders, giving her a slow sensual neck massage, causing her body to shudder in pleasure as she continues working away at your own stump. Already you can feel your dick pressing hard against your pants, almost painfully erect and crying out for release. Perhaps it's time to see just how far this headless lady is willing to go with your impromptu grope session?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring there's little to lose and much to gain under the circumstances, you allow one of your hands to dip lower, down towards the headless woman's cleavage, softly stroking her breasts through her shirt. Much to your delight she offers no protest, instead seizing your wrist and pressing it firmly against her sizable mounds, easily D- cups if you had to guess, maybe even bigger, though that might just be wishful thinking on your part. In any event they certainly seem large, as well as warm and soft, fitting into your hand almost as though they belonged there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmboldened, you reach down to the bottom of the girls shirt, grabbing the edge and attempting to remove it. Obviously just as eager as you in regards to what's to come, the girl makes no move to stop you, instead aiding you in your task lifting her arms up, allowing you to lift the shirt up over her shoulders and off, before tossing it aside. Returning your hands to her breasts you discover that, much to your delight, that she's not wearing a bra, her sizable breasts exposed in all their glory. You wish you could see them, or better yet suck on them, but sadly without your head it simply isn't meant to be. You know you can still have plenty of fun playing with them however, and proceed to do so, kneading and squeezing the sensitive mounds of flesh to your hearts content. Meanwhile, the headless girl decides to return the favor, reaching down and unfastening your pants before reaching into your underwear and grasping your already rock hard shaft, softly stroking up and down the sensitive rod of flesh, the girls cunning fingers driving you wild as you struggle not to cum. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding to hell with the foreplay you drop you pants and boxers to the floor and step out of them before seizing the girl around the waist and practically ripping her clothes off, panties and all, before grabbing her and, after a quick bit of feeling around, forcing her down onto your bed and plowing into her. Shocked by this rough treatment the headless girl begins to struggle, but only for a moment, as she soon gets into it, wrapping her arms and legs around you, holding you tight as you seek to use her tight wet cunt to slake your burning lust, the two of you moving together in a symphony of lust as old as humanity. The unknown headless woman shudders beneath you, her sexy body wracked by orgasm after another as you pound away at her, cumming several times yourself in the process, but in spite of that your dick is still as hard as a rock, and you feel like you could go on like this all day if not for the fatigue you can feel coming on from your marathon fuck session. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, though neither of you want to, you're eventually forced to halt your lovemaking, to exhausted to go on any longer. Rolling off of your headless lover and onto your back you lie there in bed, struggling to catch your breath, something that strangely enough you seem to still be capable of, despite your lack of any obvious means to do so. Not ready to leave you alone just yet, the headless girl snuggles up next to you, your right arm wrapped around her shoulders, her position such that, had she still had a head it would likely have been resting on your chest. Enjoying the closeness, your energy largely spent, you relax, slowly drifting off to sleep. When you awaken, you find_____________________?</span></div></div>",

You decided to try cutting off both of your arms for the time being, just to try out the capabilities of the blade.  The first thing you do is pull out your cell phone and text your girlfriend.  You tell her that you want to try something kinky with her and that she should come over, which she responds with an enthusiastic yes, stating that she would be at your house in ten minutes (she lives pretty close and can drive her mom's car).  Next you remove your shirt and socks, leaving you dressed only in your jeans.  You realized that without your hands you might have to substitute your toes for fingers.<br>\r\nNext you hold you left arm out straight and take up the long sword with your right hand.  You carefully bring the blade up through your shoulder, the area around the cut tingling with a strange but not unpleasant sensation.  When the blade finally finished cutting through your shoulder your arm dropped to the bed.  You noticed immediately that you had lost all control of the limb, the space where it had once occupied now just space.  It didn't feel like you had ever had a left arm, which was a very bizarre feeling indeed because you obviously knew for a fact that you had had a left arm before.  Ignoring the weird mix of emotions and feelings you position the blade underneath your right arm, wedged in the arm pit, and awkwardly sawed it forward.  it took longer than the other arm, but with one last twist the blade topples forward through the front of your shoulder, falling to the floor as your arm thumps onto the bed and rolls off the side.  You look in the full length mirror mounted to you room's closet and spot yourself lying on the bed, half naked and half limbless!  You stand up and walk over to it, inspecting the cut surfaces.  Both of your shoulders now ended in flattened skin, a little more pink than the rest of your skin.  Despite the fact that you were generally a pretty masculine guy, you looked... cute?  Not really the right word, but you couldn't think of a substitute for it.  You walk over and inspect your now numb arms, poking them with your feet and feeling only your toe.<br>\r\nAfter another few minutes you hear a knock on your front door.  Presuming it's your girlfriend you call down \"It's open, come in!\"<br>\r\nThe door opens, then closes, and you can hear high heels on the tiling.  \"Hello?  John?\"  You hear your hot bodied girlfriend Michelle call out.<br>\r\n\"I'm in my room, come in!\"  You respond, sitting on your bed and spreading your legs a bit.<br>\r\n\"Uh, okay.  John I'd just like to remind you that I have a taser in this purse.  If this is another stupid prank like that one time you're going to get a good taste of .03 amps to the dick.\"  She threatens you, remembering the trick you pulled on her last Halloween that literally made her cry for an hour and not talk to you for a week.  She opens the door slowly, peeking her head in first.  Her eyes bulge and her jaw drops as she sees you, to which you simply smile.  Michelle is so taken aback at the sight before her that the only word she can utter is \"What...\"<br>\r\nYou respond \"You always complained that I was too commanding in bed.  I thought I'd let you take the reigns on this one... though I do hope you'll return the favor for me later and let me do the same to you!\"<br>\r\nMichelle stepped forward, dropping her purse and inspecting your disarmed shoulders.  She pokes and prods the skin, which admittedly feels pretty nice.  \"How did you do this?  What did you do?!\"  She asked, still looking over your shoulders.<br>\r\n\"Do you see that big sword on the ground?  It's actually a magical blade!  Anything it cuts is harmlessly removed from a person and made numb, though anything cut off can be reattached without any problems, even if they're not put back on the same spot!\"  You inform her.  She looks from the blade, to your discarded arms on the floor and bed, then to you.<br>\r\n\"John, we're gonna have some fun!\"  You smile as her eyes light up passionately.

Michelle smiles at her handiwork, setting the sword down on the floor.  \"Man, you would not believe how hot this is making me!\"  She said, feeling up your blank shoulders.  Her hands felt rather nice on your new skin, the skin more acute than your original skin.  \"I always had a thing for helpless people, and now that you're like this, totally at my mercy... it feels nice!\"<br>\r\n\"Uh, you remember that this is temporary, right?\"  You inquire, your eyes digging into her own glistening ones.<br>\r\n\"But of course!  I want to try being helpless too you know?  You'll be restored once I've had my fun, and then it'll be your turn to play with me!\"  She told you.  You were very relieved to hear this, and the thought of Michelle being limbless made you as stiff as a board.  Michelle glanced down and laughed, the sight of your regained excitement making her even hornier.  She brought your head up and began kissing you roughly, her fingers wrapping through your hair and pulling tightly.  She eventually relaxed her grip and stepped back, leaving you breathing deeply on the bed.  \"Wait right here, I'll be back.\"  She said, turning around and sauntering towards the door.<br>\r\n\"Wait, you can't leave me here like this!\"  You protest.<br>\r\nShe continues out the door.  \"Can and did.

You are mortified to here her car start up and pull away, stranding you on the bed.<br>\r\nYou don't know how long Michelle is gone, the clock in your room having been broken for a solid month now.  You sat there, your swollen cock pressing uncomfortably against your jeans, begging to be released in more ways than one.  You couldn't help but fear someone coming in that wasn't Michelle, knowing that even if you could explain this to whoever found you you'd never be able to live it down.<br>\r\nFinally you hear a car pull up.

Thin black cloth bordered by frilly white lace, a skirt cut so short that from your slightly lowered position you swear you could see the edge of her white cotton panties, and a shirt so tight that her buxom threatened to spill out over the top of it.

It was a laughably bad imitation but added immensely to the charm and the fact that she was doing a little role playing was very exciting for you.<br>\r\n\"Indeed I am, though I must say I'm rather annoyed by your lateness, you were supposed to arrive twenty minutes ago.\"  You responded, playing along while simultaneously showing your annoyance.<br>\r\n\"Forgive me sir, I had difficulty finding my outfit.  It will not happen again.\"  She responded, bowing her head in pretend shame.<br>\r\n\"I should hope not.  Now, as my servant you must do anything I say, is that correct?\"  You ask, establishing rules whilst continuing the act.<br>\r\n\"Yes sir, anything and everything you ask me to do.\"  She confirms.<br>\r\n\"Excellent.  As you may be able to tell I'm slightly shorthanded at the moment, and I am going to need you to take care of me, in every way.\"  You say, nearly laughing aloud at your own stupid pun but managing to hold back.<br>\r\n\"I understand sir.\"  She responds, nodding respectfully.<br>\r\n\"Good.  Now, the first thing I want you to do is remove my shorts and my underwear.  Don't worry, you're going to have to see it sooner or later, I have nothing to hide.\"  You say, the pain from your compressed dick too much to ignore in her presence.<br>\r\n\"Yes sir.\"  She responds without a flinch, bowing her head before stepping towards you.  She first unbuttons your trousers and unzips them, slower than you would like but still very relieving as you got more fresh air.  She pulled the shorts off, folded them neatly, then set them down on the bed beside you.  Next she took a hold of your underwear by the elastic and sliding it off of you in one short pull, unleashing your fully erect cock.  You breathed a sigh of relief as Michelle folded your underwear and set them atop your shorts.<br>\r\nMichelle stood at attention and awaited another command, smiling as her eyes wandered down to your crotch.  You looked behind her, noticing her coat on the ground.  \"You left your coat on the ground.  If I'm not mistaken your job is to clean, not to make a mess.\"  You said in pretend anger.<br>\r\n\"Forgive me sir, I'll fix that right away!\"  She said.  Just as you wanted she turned and bent over, revealing her skin clutching cotton panties to you in full.  She was slow to pick it up, likely enjoying the attention you gave her and knowing in full what you were doing.  She eventually stood back up, folded her coat, and set it on the bed beside your clothes.<br>\r\nWhat do you tell her to do next?</span></div></div>",

If you generally like my work I think you'll like this.  Anyway, back to this story!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You would not believe how hard it is to get rid of my excess energy like this.\"  You say, using your eyes to motion at your lack of arms.  \"I've been sitting here for a good while now without any sort of relief and it's starting to get me on edge.  With that in mind your first order as my newest maid is to, shall we say, help with my libido.\"  You say in your most sleazy voice possible, getting further excited by the role you were playing.<br>\r\nFor her part Michelle nodded eagerly and gave an enthused smile \"But of course I'll help you with that my patron!  You may be a bit surprised to hear this, but I think you're really cute like this.  I was hoping you'd ask for that!\"  She chirped.<br>\r\nMaking sure she hadn't forgot her previous statement you said in character \"Yes well don't get too attached to this.  I'm going to get my arms and legs back sooner or late-!\"  You stop mid sentence as Michele gingerly runs her left hand up from the bottom of your ball sack up the underside of your shaft and finishes by flicking the tip, sending shivers down your spine.<br>\r\n\"You were saying?\" she asked with her index finger balanced on the tip of your member.<br>\r\nThrough gritted teeth one desperate word slipped out.  \"Proceed.\"  Her smile grew to a massive leer as she brought the left hand back down to your jewels and began softly fondling them while her right hand lowered itself down your member, gliding down your quaking tool.  She worked at a snails pace, pumping as slowly as she could get away with.  You wanted release but she wanted this to last, and as much as the two of you acted as though you were in charge she was in control.  After nearly two minutes lowered herself to her knees,placing her hands on the sensitive patches of flesh where your legs had resided and causing your hips to squirm reflexively.  She brought her head down and began licking her way in circles down you, her thumbs rubbing your stumps and strangely arousing you further.  When she completed her trip down she began bobbing her head up and down on your manhood, taking herself nearly to the base all the while looking you in the eyes, her gaze passionate and pleading.<br>\r\nBefore you could get off you made a command, you wanted her to get something out of this too for all that she was putting in.  \"Wait!\"  Melissa's eyes flash with confusion and a hint of betrayal, but she obeys your command and removes you from her mouth.  \"Take off your panties.\"  You command in labored breaths, stomach rising and falling as quickly as it ever had before.  Melissa complied, a unsure of what you were planning but happy that it was still something naughty.  Once she had dropped her panties to the floor you said simply and authoritatively \"Bring your cunt up here!\"  Michelle now beamed, nearly jumping with excitement.<br>\r\n\"But of course sir, anything for you sir!\"  Melissa leaped into bed and swiveled herself around, her absolutely soaked womanhood now centimeters from your awaiting mouth.  With one motion she lowered herself.  The two of you were in absolute heaven, Melissa kissing the head of your dick while you dived directly into the center of her folds with your tongue, each of you making an effort to bring yourselves to climax simultaneously despite your head start.  Within a few minutes you are incapable of holding out any longer and blow what had to be a record setting load into Melissa's mouth, your girlfriend struggling to keep as much of it in as she could.  You struggled for air as you continued to lick her, moving the whole of your head as she rocked her pelvis on your face.  She climaxed a short while later, pressing herself roughly against you as she did, and with continued pleasure she reached a second cataclysmic climax.  When you couldn't breathe anymore you mumbled something unintelligible and Melissa rolled off of you, arm splaying over your stomach while panting almost as deeply as you.<br>\r\nYou are barely conscious, so relaxed from your long awaited release.  You nearly fell asleep but managed to say \"That... was great!...\"  Melissa merely nods.  The two of you sit in silence save for labored breaths and content giggles for almost twenty minutes before she asks...</span></div></div>",

Before you can voice your concerns Michelle lashes out with the long sword and everything goes black, all of your primary senses save for touch vanishing.  You feel something tumble forward and brush against your bare chest before tumbling off into the unknown black abyss beyond your sense of touch.  Michelle had just chopped your head off, leaving you only a torso.<br>\r\nA strange mix of feelings arise in you as you gauge the situation.  On the one hand you're slightly terrified out of your god damned mind as this was easily the most helpless you've ever been in your life.  You couldn't move before, now you couldn't even talk or hear anything.  On the other hand Michelle had lifted you up and was currently grabbing a handful of your ass as she carried you, your dick pressing into her cloth wrapped stomach.  You are set down on something rather cold and hard, which you soon judge to be a bathtub by the warm water that slowly rises up around you.  You feel yourself float to the surface, the lack of the dense bones in your limbs making your body rather buoyant.  Something rubs against you, your body bobbing up and down as water is displaced.  You deduce that Michelle had entered the tub to clean herself off as well as you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your almost complete sensory deprivation you eventually lose track of time, minutes and hours meaningless terms as each slipped into the next.  You know that you are moved around a bunch, bathed many times, and often you are mounted and fucked like crazy.  You do notice on occasion that Michelle feels weird, her body not feeling quite the same as it normally did.  You could almost swear... nah.  Either way you do eventually recover your lost senses, everything coming back in a jarring rush leaving you panting and staring at an unfamiliar ceiling.  \"Michelle?\"  You call out, unable to crane your head enough to see her.<br>\r\n\"I'm here.\"  She answers, though she doesn't come into view.<br>\r\n\"Michelle, what the hell was that about?\"  You demand.<br>\r\n\"What?  You didn't like being my little pet boy?\"  She inquires.<br>\r\n\"I... well... it's not that I didn't.\"  You vaguely answer.  In truth you did enjoy it, you just would've liked some warning first.  \"Look, just tell me how long I've been out okay?

And I did kind of enjoy being your \"pet boy\", you admit. Michelle smile and comes closer to you. It's around this time that you notice where you are. No longer in your bedroom, you're now sitting on top of Michelle's bed. You're still without clothes and still without your limbs. You look around the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, so... where are my arms and legs?\" You don't seem to spot them anywhere. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh don't worry about that, I got them stored away in a safe place.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell that's a relief, you think.

I  wasn't exactly planning on giving you your head back so soon, but I just wanted to tell you something.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh? What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... while you were out, I sort of... went through your phone. I used your fingerprint to unlock it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"....oh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and well, I read some things. You know, meant for some other people. You know, people not me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUh oh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And well, I brought you back just so I could tell you that I'm sorry.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... sorry for what?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can get an answer, everything goes black as Michelle slices your head off again! You feel your head land on the mattress right next to your hip. \"What hell?\" you think, completely confused as to what just happened. You had just gotten used to having a head back when Michelle snatched it away. You move what little you can, your limbless torso bucking until it teeters over the side of Michelle's bed and lands hard on the floor. You can feel what can only be your head fall with you and land on your back before rolling off into the void beyond your minimal sense of touch. You feel Michelle's hands pick you up and hug you to her chest. This isn't good. You never knew Michelle to be the jealous type. She must have read something she really didn't like in your phone. I mean, it was just some harmless flirting. No way she would keep you like this as some sort of punishment for that, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you still had a  throat, you'd gulp at the prospect. There's nothing you can really do. You're completely at her mercy. You just hope she doesn't keep you like this... forever. You shudder table prospect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle sets you down on the bed. You feel what's left of your body shiver again. Your sense of touch being the only active one, it seems to amplify the chill. You wiggle and squirm as you feel Michelle rest a warm hand on your stomach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle then</span></div></div>",

You then feel another piece of cloth draped over you and you guess that Michelle has stored what was left of you in her underwear drawer, where she plans to stow you away for safe keeping. The word around you shifts as Michelle apparently closes the drawer and hides you away.\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aFuck, you think to yourself. You really did it this time. You thought being a reduced to a headless torso was bad enough, but this is much worse! You've never felt so helpless; being reduced to just a palm sized portion of yourself. Michelle was rather vague but you can only really guess that she saw some of your flirtatious texts to one of her girlfriends and has decided to punish you. For how long, you can't be sure, you just hope it's not going to be too long. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aYou can do little else but sit and wait for Michelle while thinking about your current situation, which is rather dire as you've been reduced to nothing but your manhood. Mentally, you scream to Michelle to release you from your prison, but it doesn't appear to be happening any time soon. And so you take stock of your current predicament. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aYou're just a dick. Your dick. Nothing else remains of you and you wonder what Michelle has done with the rest of your body. Will you ever even see it again? How long does she plan on keeping you like this exactly? Eventually, your mind wanders and you imagine how great it's going to feel when she touches you again, or even better, when she uses you again. Sitting in her underwear draw amidst all of your girlfriend's unmentionables, you find yourself growing stiff.\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aIt's so weird to think that this is all of you that remains. You're entire consciousness reduced to a small, but not too small, pile of flesh. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aYou lose track of time due to the complete loss of basically all of your senses. Occasionally, you feel the void around you shift and you guess that Michelle has opened the drawer. These moments happen periodically, and she appears to make it a point to not pay you any mind. You feel her hands rummaging through the pieces of fabric around you and you surmise that she's looking for something to wear. These moments are brief and eventually you feel the drawer close again. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aLeft in the dark, alone, all six inches of your existence wait for the moment that michelle decides to restore you, or at the very least, holds you. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aYou have no idea how long it's been when you feel Michelle's hands wrap around you. Immediately, you find yourself growing erect at her touch. You feel yourself being carried away, to where, you don't know, but you feel Michelle's grip on you change and then, you feel your entire form inserted into her moist pussy. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Oh my god!\" You think to yourself as you feel pleasure like you've never get before. With your entire form reduced to just your penis, there's no other distractions and no other outside interference. There's only the feeling of Michelle pumping you in and out of her. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aYou cum and it's the greatest orgasm you've ever had. You don't know if Michelle enjoyed it as much as you did and you don't even know how long you lasted, but you don't care. You're completely lost in the throes of ecstasy. Michelle takes your rapidly shriveling member out of her and carries you away. You feel warm water wash over you and Michelle's hands scrub you clean in the sink. She towel dries you and eventually your set back down on the lacey fabric of her underwear drawer. You feel the drawer close and you once again go back to your void. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aThis routine occurs a great number of times and you guess that a good amount of time has passed. It's a constant blur of waiting and pleasure. You don't know if you're ever going to get restored, but to be honest, as long as she keeps using you like this, you don't really mind. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aYou feel the dresser drawer open again and you immediately get hard at the prospect of being used again.

You're picked up, shoved into a warm and moist hole, you're cleaned up and then set down. Again. And again. And again. Multiple times a day? Maybe. You have no way of knowing. You seem to only exist when you're being held. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aYou're on a solid surface again, waiting for the hands.

Your ears are ringing but you have ears! \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Welcome back, dick.\" You hear an old familiar voice. You squint your eyes to see Michelle towering over you, hands on her hips.

It's extremely slow, and hard for her to control what direction she's going, ending up moving backwards almost as much as she goes forwards until she sort of gets the hang of it, but after nearly fifteen minutes of trying, the two of you are face to face, with Michelle laying next to you, a sheen of sweat glistening on her forehead. Panting a little she says \"See, <i>huff huff</i>, that wasn't so hard!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea, it was really easy. It only took you a quarter of an hour to cover two feet.\" you answered sarcastically. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll be worth it, trust me!\" Michelle said brightly, before leaning in and planting a kiss full on your lips, a kiss you eagerly returned, figuring that, so long as the two of you were stuck this way you might as well get <i>some</i> sort of enjoyment out of this. the two of you continue kissing for several minutes, your tongues intertwined, before Michelle eventually breaks contact. \"Okay, enough of that, help me get that thing of yours in me.\" she orders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, I'm not really sure how.\" you admitted. \"Can't you like, I don't know, climb on top or something?\" you asked hopefully. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no fun if I'm having to do all the work.

Now, once it's done. I want you pick your head up and put it on the shelf behind you. Then I want you to come back to the bed and finish what you started. Understood?\"\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aMichelle nods one last time and brings the sword up. She takes a deep breath and then swings. The blade cuts cleanly through her neck and her head tumbles off of her shoulders and lands on the bedroom floor with a loud THUD. Michelle stands in the middle of the room for a moment, completely still, taking in the experiencing of being completely without senses save for touch. After a few quiet moments, she sets the Longsword on the ground by her feet. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aFrom the bed, you become stiff as a board watching as your headless girlfriend gets on her hands and knees and blindly searches for her head. Eventually, Michelle's fingers find her hair and she picks her head up from the ground. She traces her fingers along her face, which is wearing a serene expression. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aRemembering her orders, Michelle hugs her dormant head to her chest with one arm and with the other held out in front of her, blindly makes her way to the bookshelf on the other side of the room. Her hand catches the shelf and she rather clumsily sets her head down so that it's facing you. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aSlowly, Michelle turns her body around. And begins to cautiously walk back to you. You watch as your sexy headless French maid makes her way to the other end of the room, waving her hands out in front of her. She seems to have her bearings as she walks passed the center of the room where the Longsword is.\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Easy!\" You say, even though your warning falls on the deafest of ears. Michelle trips over one of your numb legs on the floor and falls to the ground with a bump. Michelle rolls over into her hands and knees again and it appears that she has become lost. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aShe crawls around the room. She bumps into your bookshelf, her head toppling over and again falling to the floor. Michelle is completely unaware of this as she gets back up. She turns her body around, and with hands outstretched and feet shuffling, she starts to walk back towards you. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aHer foot catches her head as she shuffles and she inadvertently sends it rolling across the floor and underneath your bed. That might not be good... you have no way of getting it yourself and no way of communicating this to Michelle. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aMichelle is clearly frustrated and she stomps her foot. She walks towards you again with the same hand waving and foot shuffling method and finally, she places her hand on your face. You get one of her fingers into your mouth and give it a light suck. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aMichelle shoves you back on the bed and you try to wave your nonexistent arms to keep your balance. Your girlfriend wastes no time in ripping off of her French maid costume and practically jumps on top of you. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aYou do your best with what little you have left. You buck your hips upwards, a lot harder to do without legs and take one of Michelle's nipples in your mouth. Already excited from the sight of your headless girlfriend fumbling around your bedroom, you don't last very long. It doesn't seem like Michelle really cares though, as she continues to ride you. Squeezing both of her breasts and rubbing the skin between her shoulders. Eventually, you feel Michelle's whole body spasm on top of you, twitching and convulsing. You imagine she'd be screaming if she still had her head. Your girlfriend collapses on the bed next to you, both of you completely spent. Michelle hugs your limbless body close to hers and eventually you find yourself drifting off to sleep. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aYou awake a short while later when you feel Michelle get out of bed. You watch as she once again stumbles around your bedroom, towards the bookshelf. Completely unaware that her head is now underneath your bed, Michelle pats around the shelf where she had set it down. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aWhen her hands come up empty, her whole body tenses up. She turns back to you and points to her empty neck. You can't exactly tell her where her head is, so you just watch as she angrily points to the empty air where her head used to be. Your girlfriend starts to panic, turning around and fumbling through the book shelf and knocking several books on to be floor. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aShe starts to frantically make her way around the bedroom, knocking more things to the floor as she searches.\u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Man for a maid you sure do make a mess.\" You joke to yourself. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202aMichelle suddenly stops and for a second you worry that she somehow might of heard you. Instead you see that Michelle has her hand wrapped around the handle of the Longsword. She stands up and turns back to you. \u202c<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u202a\"Wait, Michelle. Michelle! Michelle!\" You useless plead with her as she makes her way towards you with the sword. She appears ready to strike! You futilely attempt to get away, but all you manage to do is squirm on the bed. Michelle blindly swings the Longsword and...\u202c<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The fact that he's gone on business most of the time doesn't help. And like I said the two of you are hot! Obviously you got that from me!\" Erica said with a giggle. \"And now that you've got that neat little toy it adds a whole new aspect of adventure to the whole thing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinning from ear to ear, your dick's rock hard at the mere thought of fucking your hot mom Erica. Still flush with youth and vitality, not to mention beauty and sex appeal. Standing five foot five with smooth unblemished lightly tanned skin, a delicate heart shaped face, small pert nose, and large expressive dark blue eyes, her brilliant red hair styled in an attractive yet manageable Bob cut. That's not even mentioning her rocking body, your mom possessing a figure that, while slender is curvy in all the right places, with long sexy legs, flaring hips, a pert bubble butt, and perky D cup breasts. There's no way you're about to turn her down and you doubt your sister Jenna will either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm in!\" You replied. \"We'll have to talk to Jenna, but I doubt she'll have any objections.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's go talk to her then. The sooner the better right?\" Your mom suggested, turning and walking towards the stairs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGlancing from Erica, to her arms laying discarded on the floor and back, you clear your throat. \"Um, Erica, aren't you, you know, forgetting something?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? Oh! I can't believe I forget my arms! I'd probably forget my head if....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Jenna merely smiles, continuing to lick and suck at her mom's wonderful D cup breasts, slowly working her fingers Erica's dripping cunt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou meanwhile are busy running your hands over every inch of your mother's perfect skin, cupping her tight sexy ass with your other hand while licking, kissing and nibbling away at the space between her shoulders where her head should be, but upon noticing what your twin is doing you change your priorities, crouching down, grabbing hold Erica's other tit, squeezing and fondling it, your lips clamping down on her rock hard nipple, bitting and tugging at it, teasing the tip with your tongue, the head of your steelly shaft pressing hard against your mom's leg, something she doesn't fail to notice or take advantage of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching down with her right hand the headless beauty wraps her soft hand around your cock, her long slender fingers stroking slowly up and down your shaft, pausing briefly at the tip to massage your plans.

Delicious as always brother dear. It's only a pity that mom isn't able to taste this.\" She said sadly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Believe me sis, she'll have plenty more chances if I have anything to say about it!\" You said with a chuckle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can definitely agree with that! And the fact that she doesn't have a head right now just means that much more of this tasty cum for me!\" Jenna giggles as she uses her tongue to clean the splotches of sperm from your mother's luscious form as Erica wiggles and squirms. Finishing giving your mom her tongue bath your twin turns her attention to you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nClimbing on top of you, staring deeply into your eyes, your sister breathlessly asks \"So Johnny, ready for round two?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing how eager Jenna is you can't help but laugh. \"Heh!

The budge protruded from the base of your neck, where it met your left shoulder. You stared in fascination as it began to grow, and strands of brown hair sprouted from the top. It quickly took on a lightbulb like shape, two distinct parts that looked like a head and new neck. A pale, veiny began forming on the growth as well. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, a pain like several hundred pen needles drilled into the spot between your neck and the new growth. Your left arm suddenly gave out on you, causing you fall backwards onto your bed. The sword clattered as it hit the metal bed frame before landing on the carpet with a thud. You looked past the growth towards your left shoulder and arm. The hand rested on the bed beside you, completely out of your control. Your left arm and leg were clearly there, but you had no sensation of them. The growth made a mumbling sound. It was now almost as large as your own head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watched as it moved, appearing to be looking around the room. It finally turned and looked towards you. The head, now fully formed, looked exactly like you. You and he stared at each other for a few long moments before the newcomer said, \"Hey uh... brother?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat answered one question. Even though you two looked alike, this new head was different, separate from you. \"Uh... Hi...\" you responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave you a hesitant smile. It was eerie seeing someone with your face smiling at you, and even more strange this this person shared your body. He spoke again, \"John, right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How?\" you started, but he continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I just... know. I have these memories...\" He closed his eyes for a second and if he was pondering something important. \"I think they're yours.

During the trip, the group found another magical sword that cut body parts off but did not kill the user (not duplicate the parts like the first longsword) and five of them cut their heads off. The heads have been replaced with those of a German Shepherd, a Golden Retriever, a Doberman Pinscher, a Collie and a Beagle, and they bring with them a box containing 25 living, breathing dog heads - you hope they were all taken from strays. The cynocephalic husky cuts the heads off the huskies that had guarded you with the other sword. The husky heads control their old bodies as they move to the box. A two-player game of luck dip occurs, as the bodies reach in and pull out and put on an Akita head and an Old English Sheepdog head respectively. The new heads take control of the bodies. As Apollo watches, the husky cuts up the dispensed husky heads with the other sword and throws the pieces out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApollo runs to your side.

The German Shepherd cuts at the Golden Retriever with the first longsword, copying his human body, then the Beagle and Collie assemble the resulting parts. The German Shepherd sets the longsword aside and the Golden Retriever guides the new naked and headless body to the box. It reaches in and pulls out a Labrador Retriever's head, which it puts on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look at the longsword, and spot a new button on the hilt. It must have the cutting the German Shepherd made seconds ago. You decide to move to get it, but the Doberman gets there first. He takes the longsword, and cuts at the Collie, copying his human body before setting the sword aside. The Akita and the Sheepdog assemble the parts generated into a new naked and headless human body. The Collie leads it to the box. You move closer to the longsword with Apollo. The body reaches in and grabs a Great Dane head, which it puts on. You move in the longsword. You wonder what happens when you hit the new button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Choice ideas</b>:<br>\r\n- Before you can hit the button, your sister comes in.<br>\r\n- You don't find out; a cynocephali takes the longsword before you do.<br>\r\n- You hit the wrong button and the cynocephali vanish!</span></div></div>",

You turn, ready to strike at whoever it is, but are relieved to see your sister Jenna walking into the house. She had been out walking the other dog of the house, Kat, a Siberian Retriever (Labardor x Siberian Husky mix).<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, John, were you okay while I had been out?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou want to mention nothing of a magical longsword that can duplicate whatever body parts its blade cuts through. You simply say: \"Nothing much of note.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see. Anyone call to the house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No-one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok, so we're good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yep.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna leaves Kat in the room and walks into the kitchen. She feels like having a snack. Apollo joins Kat in the next room and rests. He is eager to rest after what he just went through. You rest on the sofa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna is just about finishing her snack when she feels something behind her. She turns around and is shocked by what she sees - it's the naked cynocephalic huskies! She panics, at their form primarily but also at the sword, as husky 1 (the first one created) takes a swing at her; but she is surprised to see that not does she survive, but an exact copy of her arm appears. Husky 1 cuts at her further, resulting in a pile of copies of all her body parts sans head on the floor. Huskies 2 and 3 assemble them into a naked female human body, and husky 1 copies husky 5's head, which husky 4 places on the new body. This creates a new cynocephalic husky, husky 7, which has your sister's body. Husky 1 cuts at husky 7 five times, and huskies 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 assemble new huskies, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. Stunned, Jenna comes into the room you are in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, what's going?!\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said no-one called, but I just found myself face-to-face with dog-headed men!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of them had this sword on me, and took a swing at me. I thought he was going to decapitate me, but he instead copied my arm for some reason. Then he copied everything except the head, and within a minute there was a dog-headed woman with them. Within a few more minutes there were 6 more of them!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many of them were there initially?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Six! The number of dog-headed women who they crafted. They were all naked, as if they had no shame!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really? What did their heads look like? What breed?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huskies! Apollo's head, to be precise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, they followed you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenna turns around, and sure enough, the twelve huskies have followed her from the kitchen. This time, they ignore you, Jenna and Apollo but walk towards Kat. You are both shocked - you realize she's next. Husky 1 copies Kat's Siberian Retriever head fourteen times, and then copies his companions fourteen times; two copies of the parts of husky 2, two of husky 3, one of husky 4, one of husky 5, one of husky 6, two of husky 7, one of husky 8, one of husky 9, one of husky 10, one of husky 11, one of husky 12. You, Jenna, Apollo and Kat look on thinking of what to do as the huskies build fourteen cynocephalic Siberian Retrievers out of the body parts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe there is something we could do about them,\" Jenna says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like what,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on, bro, we should be able to outsmart a group of dogs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But they have human bodies, and outnumber us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but we have human intelligence, and two regular dogs to help us,\" Jenna says.</span></div></div>",

You are my boyfriend after all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks.\"  You say, walking over to your bed and sitting down, the sword hidden beneath your blankets.  \"Now then, the first thing I'm going to need you to do is to take off your jacket, shirt, and bra.  Everything above the belt, basically.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle rolls her eyes and scoffs playfully.  \"Wow, seriously John?  If you wanted me to come over for a booty call you can just say so.  You don't have to act like you discovered the ark of the covenant or anything.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just trust me, alright?\"  You say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\"  Michelle says.  \"But seriously, if it turns out all of this hype you're building up is all about your dick or some new move you saw in a porno you're aching to try out I'm going to kick it when you whip it out.\"  Michelle leans backwards while bending her shoulders back and straightens her arms out towards the floor.  Bobbing her knees up and down a little allows gravity to pull her jacket off of her while also not so unintentionally bouncing her thrust out chest for you.  While she still seems to think you're simply making a prolonged sexual proposition (which, you suppose she's technically correct about.  It was probably number 2 or number 3 on your list of things to do) she seems to be into it despite her protests.  Once her jacket was lying in a heap behind her Michelle stood up straight and pulled her short sleeved shirt over her head, revealing her basic but comfortable black sports bra.  With a playful smirk she tosses her shirt right into your face, the red cloth blinding you for no more than three seconds but still giving Michelle plenty of time.  By the time you can see again Michelle is already holding her bra at arms length, her left arm crossed over her chest and hiding her nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're really good at that.\"  You say, still impressed by the trick despite seeing it a half dozen times already.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks!\"  She says, dropping her bra to the floor and dropping her right arm to her side.  \"So, what do you need me to do next before you 'show me something incredible'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment, judging the angles of her body in relation to the angle of your desired cut.  \"Alright, I want you to take a tit in each hand and move them up and out towards your sides.\"  Michelle gives you a look, but complies without questioning.  While her boobs weren't massive by any stretch, lying somewhere between a large B and a small C cup, you still needed to make as much space as possible for the cut you had in mind.  Keeping her arms busy and out of the blade's path was also a plus as you didn't want to cut them off quite yet.  Satisfied in her stance you reach under the sheets and quickly pull out the longsword.  Michelle's eyes go wide but she doesn't move an inch as you swing the blade directly at her, subconsciously remembering her promise to trust you no matter what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blade carves cleanly into her right shoulder, halfway between her neck and the shoulder's end.  The blade continues at a diagonal angle, passing through the middle of her chest before exiting just below the bottom most of her ribs on the left side.  It was a cut you'd seen a million times in movies, games, and cartoons but thought you'd never see in real life.  The amount of resistance, the placement of the bones, the sharpness of a sword, everything about the cut made it completely impossible with a conventional blade.  This blade was anything but conventional, however, and as such you were able to do the impossible and slice Michelle in half diagonally right between the breasts with almost no effort.  The smaller piece of Michelle, now reduced to one arm, one boob, and her head, looked up from her place on the floor.  She saw the rest of her, stumbling back and forth as it tried to adjust to the massive change in its center of gravity but clearly alive, with completely smooth skin over the area you cut through and with its torso still holding its shape despite missing half of its spine and having shoulder bones which no longer connected to anything.  \"What the fuck.\"  Is all she can manage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michelle, I'd like to show you my magic sword.  Which is actually not a euphemism for my penis this time.\"  You say, holding the sword out for her to study.  \"It can cut through anyone without hurting them, instead making any sliced off parts sentient, with a copy of their original owner's consciousness. You can reattach anything without a problem but the parts will still have their own minds even when reconnected.  Unless I press this button on the hilt, which makes you completely whole again like nothing even happened.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd tell you to stop pulling my leg, but seeing as how it's over there and I can't even control or feel it I guess I have to believe you.\"  Michelle says,propping herself up on her elbow.  \"You really weren't kidding, this is fucking amazing!  That being said, I wish you would've told me what you were planning before you did it.  I would've told you to cut through the other shoulder instead.  I'm right handed, remember?  And seeing as how I've only got the one limb while she's go three I think it's only fair that I get the arm I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.\"  You say, bending over and hoisting the much lighter Michelle off of the ground. She wraps her arm around your shoulders while you hold onto the slanted underside of her torso with one hand, Michelle laughing as you brush against her apparently sensitive new layer of skin.  \"But at least you've got the lips.\"  You bring her in for a kiss, Michelle passionately reciprocating as her fingers dig into your shoulder.  After a few seconds you pull her away, smiling as Michelle's bright blue eyes practically glowed with excitement.  \"And the eyes.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe remark got Michelle thinking.  \"Wait, so is my body blind?  I mean, she doesn't have a head any more, but that doesn't stop her from thinking.  And I don't have... most of my organs, but that doesn't stop me from being alive.  How far does the magic go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking over at Michelle's body you see she'd adjusted to her lopsidedness rather quickly, standing up straight as she ran her hand along the perfectly straight cut surface where the rest of her torso once resided.  She didn't seem to be panicking, though you weren't sure if that's because she'd heard you explain the sword to Michelle's upper half or if it was just because she was still alive and well after being bisected and therefor deduced that nothing was wrong.  Deciding to check which it was you shout.  \"Hey, Michelle's body, can you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurns out Michelle's other half...</span></div></div>",

Or, was?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body inverted its gesture, pointing its thumb at the ground.  It then brought its hand up to its former eye level, pointed two fingers at the air where Michelle's eyes had previously been situated, then brought its hand lower without changing its gesture.  Her fingers eventually came to rest over the body's remaining nipple.  \"You see out of my nipple?!  Why?  How does that even work?\"  Michelle asked, giggling and incredulous.  The body responded with a clueless shrug, before cupping its hand and bringing it to Michelle's former ear level.  It held its hand there for a second or two before pointing to its armpit.  \"And you hear out of my armpit?  Man, magic is some crazy shit.\"  Michelle said, to which her body held up its thumb and rocked it, as though nodding.  \"so you're basically blind and deaf on your left side, huh?  Well, I suppose that makes this 75/25 split feel a little bit fairer, though I still should've gotten the dominant hand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I was excited, I forgot, sue me!\"  You say playfully, you and your girlfriend's top laughing while her body clutched its side and silently shook pantomiming laughter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, lower me, now that there's two Michelles and we know you can listen to us, if not talk with us directly, what should we call you?\"  Michelle's top asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle's body scratched its cut surface near the sternum, its best approximation to scratching its chin, and after a few seconds dug out its phone which was luckily in its right pocket.  Michelle's body raised the phone up to her eye-approximation nipple and typed for a short while, its single hand reducing its speed somewhat.  Turning the phone around, you and Michelle read \"<u>Well, since we r both u and I'm more of u than u, I think I should technically be 'Michelle' while we find another name for u.</u>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou laughed, while Michelle blushed with embarrassment and stammered \"What?  B-but I've got the head!  That's where all our thoughts came from so I'm the original!  I get to be Michelle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body turned the phone back to its tit and typed further, its thumb moving a bit faster in frustration.  Turning the phone back, the two of you read \"<i>I produced the hormones and comical signals that shaped ur thoughts that shaped us.  We're equally the original, I'm just more of it.  So I get to be Michelle.</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That so doesn't count!\"  Michelle shot back, regretting taking biology and doubly regretting not paying more attention in that class so that she could refute those claims.  Or, if she did pay more attention, she supposed that her body wouldn't have made that argument in the first place since it would've known why that was wrong.  Or was it right?  Ugh, of all the classes to get a C- in why did it have to be that one?  \"And it's chemical, not comical!\"  She added, knowing exactly what the body meant and knowing it was probably auto-correct's fault but feeling the need to be petty regardless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michelles, listen.\"  You said, trying to suppress your laughter at the ridiculousness of your girlfriend finding a way to argue with herself within minutes of becoming two of her.  She wasn't normally this headstrong, at least not with others.  \"Why don't we just split the difference.\"  Michelle's top rolled her eyes at your lame pun, while her body dropped its arm limply to its side and leaned forward, mimicking a groan of disgust.  \"We'll just split the name like we split you two.  Michelle top, you can be... Mica.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds like a dog's name.\"  Michelle's top weakly complained, though she did seem to like the idea of getting to keep the first part of her name to reflect her claims to being the original.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot addressing her critique, you turned your attention to the topless bottom of Michelle and said \"And Michelle bottom, you can be... Hellen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle's body typed for a long time, composing what seemed to be a rather wordy complaint, then stopped out of nowhere as she came to a sudden and unknown realization.  Silently sighing her one shoulder, she deleted everything and responded to your suggestion with a simple \"<i>K</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, see?  Now everyone's happy!\"  You said, ignoring Mica's peeved look and Hellen's annoyed posture.  \"So, Mica, Hellen, now that we've sorted that out what do my two beautiful girlfriends want to do next?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMica and Hellen...</span></div></div>",

You use your free hand to hold Michelle's head in place. Once you are ready, you slowly drive the longsword upward into Michelle's head. You carve through only the surface of her head, since you only want the face. You find it surprisingly easy to cut with the longsword, finding that it takes very little effort at all. You finish the cut at the top of Michelle's forehead, just below the hairline and then peel her face off.<br>\r\nTo your surprise, Michelle's face still has a slight bone structure to it, allowing to keep her facial features intact. Her eyes, nose and mouth are all there. For a few moments, Michelle's eyes look glazed over before life suddenly returns to them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" Michelle's face asks. \"I can't feel my body, and my head feels strange...You chopped my head off, didn't you?\" She adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, not exactly.\" You tell her. You then turn her face around. Her now faceless body stands there, running her hands over the blank patch of skin where her face used to be. From observing her, Michelle's faceless body now appears to be blind, however since she still has her ears, she should still be able to hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god! That's me! You cut my face off!\" Michelle's face exclaims in a mixed tone of amazement, fear and excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The longsword can cut things off harmlessly, but also makes any severed part that's not connected to the brain sentient.\" You inform the two Michelle's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, I'm not the original me then?\" Michelle's face asks you. \"What happens to me when I'm reattached to my body?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically, no, but you still have Michelle's personality as well as all of her memories.\" You tell her. \"When you are reattached, you will still be sentient until I press the button on the longsword's hilt, then you will become whole again.\" you add.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you hold Michelle's face in your hands, you notice that the bone structure of her face is very flexible. You start playing around with her face, bending and stretching it. You bend her face inward until both of her eyes are facing each other, and then the opposite way until the seams touch. Michelle's face protests against your little experiment, but the further you bend her face, the harder it is for her to speak. When you're done, you let go of one side and her face springs back into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not funny!\" She yells at you. You laugh at her and then bring her in for a kiss. Her lips still feel the same, though you have to hold her face flat, otherwise it folds over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and see Michelle's body standing there with her hands on her hips. She may not be able to see, but she can hear you kissing her face. She must feel left out and maybe a bit jealous that her face is getting all of the attention. You sit Michelle's face down and approach her body. You put one hand on her cheek and lean in to kiss the spot where her mouth once was. It feels just like you're kissing other parts of her, like her arm or her thigh, but she appears to appreciate it because she wraps her arms around you. When the kiss ends, you brush her hair out of the spot where her eyes would be and go to retrieve her face<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do we do now?\" Michelle's face asks.</span></div></div>",

Michelle's body gives you a thumbs up to signify that she's okay with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That sounds awesome! Let's do it!\" Michelle's face replies. You take Michelle's hand and then place the longsword in it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll need you to do it for me. I'm not sure how well I could cut my own face off.\" You tell her. She nods her faceless head and then raises the longsword up. She positions her free hand on your head to keep it steady, just like you did with her.

You can't say you didn't expect that kind of reaction from her, seeing as you didn't tell her what the sword can do in advance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's okay, Michelle! You're okay. The sword is magic. It can't hurt you.\" You reassure her. Even with this knowledge, she still isn't pleased that you stabbed her without warning. You will likely pay for that later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving the Longsword embedded in Michelle's chest for now, you walk behind her to have a closer look at the blade sticking out of her back. To your surprise you find a strange glowing orb stuck on the tip of the blade. It appears white &amp; gives off a bright light that is difficult to look at directly. You pick it off the tip of the blade and hold it in your hand. It feels warm but soft. You worry that you might damage it if you are not careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou take the glowing orb over to your desk &amp; place it down carefully on a cushion you had laying around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh hello!!\" You hear Michelle yelling to get your attention. Turning around, you see her standing there with her arms wide, the Longsword still embedded in her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get this thing out of me!!\" She demands. Not wanting to endure her wrath later, you quickly retract The Longsword from her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle lets out a gasp followed by a sigh of relief as the blade exits her body. Checking herself over, Michelle finds no trace of the blade ever being there; even her clothes appear to be undamaged by the blade.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMichelle soon approaches the desk where you are inspecting the orb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that? She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not entirely sure, but it came from you. I think it might be your soul or something related to it.\" You tell her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My soul? But that's impossible! I'm still standing right here. I don't feel any different.\" Michelle inforns you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then tell Michelle about The Longsword's Sentience Mode and how it works. You believe that if the orb is Michelle's soul, then her body would continue to function without it, thanks to the Sentience Mode.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decide that you want to test out a few theories you have surrounding Michelle &amp; the orb.</span></div></div>",

What is our null hypothesis?\"<br>\r\n \"Null hypothesis is the sword will act like an ordinary blade and there will be some juice on these newspapers\".<br>\r\n \"It could be more accurate, but fine. Slice it already\".<br>\r\n  She carefully arranged the sword over the watermelon and then tried to saw it. To her surprise, the blade went through the fruit like through jelly. Second later you both stare at the result of your experiment - two watermelon hemispheres.<br>\r\n \"We just have got some data\" you say, breaking the silence.<br>\r\n \"Well...\" She looked confused \"It created a new layer of rind on a slice surface, that's what I can say for sure\".<br>\r\n You catch yourself on a thought, that you expected to see red pulp of a fruit rather then its new rind. What was narrow-minded - you have already seen a surface of your sliced neck, and there was skin, not dissected bones, muscles and blood vessels. <br>\r\n  Meanwhile Melinda took one of half-melons and passed her hand over the slice surface. \"it's not an illusion\" she stated.<br>\r\n  \"So, we got some data and now it's time to prove the null hypothesis to be right or wrong\"<br>\r\n  \"Clearly wrong, I must admit. What's next?\"<br>\r\n  Seem like you're in charge now. <br>\r\n  \"We should test if the halves could be reconnected. If it is true, the sword's cuts would be confirmed as reversible\"<br>\r\n  Melinda agrees. \"Pretty obvious. We have to just bring the halves close to each other and press, I guess\". Saying this, Melinda brings the halves together.<br>\r\n  \"Well\"<br>\r\n  \"Is it really whole again?\"<br>\r\n  She pulls the halves apart. \"It was not\".<br>\r\n  \"Wait. Assemble it again. We forgot about the button\".<br>\r\n  This time the fruit remains whole and bears no trace of any damage.<br>\r\n  \"Oka-a-ay...\" Melinda mutters. \"Now we...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I don't have any genitals, or any real features that define my gender other than the shape and size of my head. She adds, while her body continues to write her reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i></i> \"I was a little shocked at first. I expected my mind to stay inside my head, but then I found that I could still control my body and my head was right behind me. All of my senses feel the same, despite no longer having a head. My shoulders feel more relaxed now that I don't have the weight of my head on them, so I guess that's a good thing.\" Her body says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i></i> \"That's exactly how I felt, body. As for you, head, I'll never really know how you feel as long as I remain as the body when my head is cut off.\" Your body says. \"Why don't you both see if you remember and agree to the idea you wrote down while I go get my head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body then gets up and leaves the room to retrieve your head. \"Took you long enough.\" Your head says, as you body picks it up and heads back to join Melinda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you got Melinda to try it out!\" Your head said, having seen Melinda headless for the first time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah! It feels really strange, but I like it.\" Her head says. \"We've discussed what I wrote down before my head was cut off.

Just recently.<br>\r\n\"So?\" John's head smirked.<br>\r\n\"Hmmm... It is like I could recall something, but forgot, what. Don't know... Better to return to my previous state, I think.\"<br>\r\nAfter these words Melinda's body suddenly lifted John's head and attached it to the neck. \"Hey...\" said the head, but then the button was pressed and the phrase aborted.<br>\r\n\"Well\" - said Melinda with you head. Or was it John using your body? Or?..<br>\r\n\"There is a picture\" said that person. \"I am in some round room... The walls look metallic. And there is a pillar in the middle, with cords and wires\"<br>\r\nAfter these words something unlocked inside your mind.

It swings and your head falls down. You see, how John's head is cut off Melinda's body...<br>\r\nThe body caught you.<br>\r\n\"What\" you say astonished. \"Am I Melinda's head now?\"<br>\r\n\"As true as I am John's\" his head replies.<br>\r\n\"But I was John's body!\"<br>\r\n\"It's an illusion. I am also confused a little\"<br>\r\n\"We are getting rough\" you assume. \"I am severed head, a part of a greater personality that now is absent, split between me and the body, and it is ok for me. But I still cannot take that I am not the body... that's holding me.\"<br>\r\n\"Deal with it\"<br>\r\nMeanwhile your body (weird!) begins to write something.<br>\r\n\"We have something to discuss\" the message reads.<br>\r\n\"Oka-a-y\" you say, still trying to shake all the weird feelings off. Melinda's body stands up, carefully passes John's head to his body and takes you with both hands.<br>\r\n\"Well, if you need a private conversation...\" John's head says, while his body shows that he's not against it.<br>\r\n\"Sort of\" you say. \"We'll be back\"<br>\r\nShe carries you to another room and than places you on the desk, facing forward herself.<br>\r\n\"Aren't you a former John's head?\" you ask, voice down, while the body types a new message on her phone. \"Have that feeling, you are very bright\"<br>\r\n\"But his head seems not to think this is true\".<br>\r\n\"And me too. Look, if you feel like you were John's body, and I feel like I was his head, what happen if we rejoin?\"<br>\r\nYou laughed.<br>\r\n\"Would I Imagine that to the end of the day I will be a disembodied head, talking with my headless body?\"<br>\r\nMelinda's body silently laughed with her hand on her chest.<br>\r\n\"Guess you could say the same\" you assumed.<br>\r\nThe body then stands up, takes you and walks back to the living room, where the sword was left.</span></div></div>",

Checking the number, you recognize it as belonging to your snobbish social climbing ex girlfriend Wendy VanChelson. \"What does that bitch want?\" you grumble. You seriously consider ignoring it, as any affecting you might have had for your ex is long gone, primarily due to her ditching you in favor of a rich pretty boy every bit as shallow as she is, and that after everything you'd done for her, giving up friends, hobbies, allowance, hell, you'd even stolen for her, nearly winding up in jail for it, all just to please her, only for her to stab you in the back as soon as someone richer came around she could sink her claws into. Of course, even that would have been somewhat acceptable if she had actually bothered to tell you that the two of you were breaking up, but no, that would have been to much to ask of the skuzzy bitch. Instead, she had started cheating on you, avoiding your offers for a date so she could go out with her rich pretty boy, all the while bleeding you for every dime she could manage. If you hadn't caught the two of them kissing in an out of the way corner of the hallway there's no telling how long she would have continued stringing you along for!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you glance down at the sword however, you have an evil thought. What if Wendy's parts were to become sentient, each of them with thoughts and personalities of their own? Wendy would be forced to live with herself, subject to the whims of a conglomerate of parts, each one possibly just as shallow and selfish as Wendy herself.<br>\r\nIt seems like the perfect revenge, and whatever Wendy wants may well provide you with an opportunity to achieve it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou answer the phone. \"What the hell do you want Wendy?!\" you growled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I was planning on offering you a job, but if you're going to be like that...\" Wendy replied arrogantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite your dislike, no outright hatred for the girl in question, the mention of a job has you curious. \"What sort of job, and how much does it pay?\" you demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've got a plumbing problem, a couple of the pipes burst in my new apartment, and now water's running everywhere. I thought with your know how...\" Wendy explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My dads the plumber, not me, why not call him?\" you asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I tried, but he said he's busy, and I need this done now! Come on John, I know you know how to fix this. Help me out here, just for old times sake?\" Wendy wheedled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Old times huh?\" you growled. \"You mean like the time I caught you cheating on me? Or maybe the time you stole that I pod and put it in my backpack? It was all I could do not to get arrested! Or maybe...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I get it, I betrayed your trust, blah blah blah! I've heard it all before. Can't we just put the past behind us and move on?\" Wendy pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fat chance! I still haven't forgiven you you know. If you want my help with this, I expect to be well paid, you get me?\" you said, laying out your ultimatum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh alright, fine! I'm sure I can come up with <i>something</i> I can pay you with.\" Wendy reluctantly conceded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'd better bitch, otherwise there will be hell to pay!\" you threatened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea yea. Anyway, I need you to come to.......\" Wendy said, rattling off her address, which you copy down on a piece of paper so you won't forget it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEnding the call, you begin gathering the tools you think you'll need for job in question, dumping the lot of them into a large duffel bag you've acquired for just that purpose, one that is, incidentally, also perfect for concealing the longsword until such time as you're ready to use it. That done, you grab your keys and head outside to your old blue pickup sitting outside in the driveway and make your way across town to your ex's apartment. Finding the correct number, you knock on the door and wait, though not for long, as Wendy quickly opens it and snarls \"Well, it's about time! I was starting to think you didn't want this money!\" she said, waving a short stack of twenty's under your nose. you grab for the bills, only for her to pull them back out of reach. \"Uh uh, not until the jobs done. How else can i trust you to do it properly?\" Wendy says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but you'd better not try and stiff me. Now, where's the leak?\" you questioned her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right this way.\" she says, leading you into the apartment. Despite your general loathing for her as a person, you still find yourself watching your ex's ass intently as she walks in front of you, her hips and buttocks gently swaying back and forth. Then again, Wendy's always been beautiful, on the outside at least, probably one of the most beautiful girls in high school, with long blonde hair, big blue eyes, full kissable lips, broad hips, narrow waist, and a pair of the biggest perkiest jugs you've ever seen outside of a porn movie, double D's at the very least, as that's what they were back when the two of you were dating, though from the looks of it, they may have grown even bigger since then, it's hard to be sure without a closer look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt doesn't take you long to find the source of the leak and fix it, a simple job as the pipe isn't actually ruptured, but merely has a loose connection, which you quickly repair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, leaks fixed, where's my money?\" you demand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hah! You actually think I'm going to pay you for ten minutes work?! Oh, that's just precious! Now, get out of here before I call the cops!\" Wendy threatens.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd actually been expecting this sort of response, and had come prepared. \"Fine, I'll go, but this isn't over!\" you growled, turning away from your ex and crouching down, pretending to put away your tools while stealthily withdrawing the sword from the duffel bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's over alright! Maybe next time you'll think twice before insulting and threatening your customers.\" Wendy gloated. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There won't be a next time. Not for you at least.\" you replied, standing up, using your body to hide the sword from her while you ready yourself, before suddenly spinning around, slicing through Wendy's_________________________?</span></div></div>",

Laughing uproariously, you tell her \"Good job Wenbod, or whatever I should call you. Give that bitch what she deserves!

Seeing her body standing there with the tape and scissors, Wendy's head ceases it's cursing, looking at you with real fear in her eyes, and begins begging and pleading with you not to do this. \"Please John, I know I screwed up, that I've been a bad girl, but I've never done anything to deserve something like this!

Not before I can think of a better way of using it any way.\"  The two of you left your room, giggling madly as you did so.  Closing your bedroom door behind you carry your girlfriend's giddy head to your living room.  You set her down on yout couch for a moment and walked over to the windows\"It's pretty bright in here don't you think?\"  You say, pulling the curtains over the windows.<br>\r\n\"Yeah, definitely!  The sun is right in my eye!\"  Michelle says, her sarcastic tone and lack of any direct light on her face indicating she knew exactly what you were getting at and approved of it wholeheartedly.  She watched from her position on the couch as you went around the room covering one window after another until all view of the outside world was cut off, leaving the two of you alone in the now darkened living room.  \"Thanks John, I was helpless to block out the light on my own!  How will I ever repay you?\"<br>\r\nTaking your cue without hesitation you say \"I can think of a few ways.\"  Picking up Michelle's head you bring her to eye level, her cheeks warming up like cute little squishy furnaces in your palms.  Bringing her in for a kiss the two of you lock lips for a good minute, you savoring the flavor of Michelle's peach flavored lipstick while she simply enjoyed the feeling of your lips against hers, your tongue dancing around in her mouth, and your fingers softly rubbing the smooth patch of skin at the base of her neck.  Turning yourself around you flop down on the couch, Michele laughing as she rapidly descends in a flurry of waving hair.  Pulling her away from your mouth you ask \"Are you ready for part two?\"<br>\r\nMichelle's neck twitches, in her version of a shoulderless nod.  \"I'm more than ready for your part, if that's what you mean!\"<br>\r\n\"How very perceptive of you.\"  You joke, setting her head down on the coffee table in front of you.  You quickly undo your belt and pull your trousers and trunks down to your ankles, causing Michelle to cartoonishly lick her lips as though awaiting a meal as your swollen cock sprung into view.  Picking her back up you give her one last peck on the lips before dropping her down to your groin, her tongue wasting no time showing you exactly what she could do as only a head.<br>\r\nA lot, was the answer to that.  You could hardly keep hold on her head as she sucked; her deft lip, rapid tongue movements, and constant moaning of enjoyment as she serviced you causing your hands to shudder violently in pleasure.  You swear she wasn't this good before, perhaps more of the longsword's magic?  Either way after only a minute of being down on you you're about ready to burst, your fingers digging into the base of her neck so tightly that if she still had lungs she'd probably be choking though without them it seemed to only make her moan louder as you squeezed her sensitive new coating of flesh.<br>\r\nJust as you were about to unload however something caught your eye, making you pull Monica off your dick in surprise.  \"Hey, what the hell John?  I was enjoying that!\"  Michelle said in an annoyed tone before catching sight of what you saw.  \"Oh.  Uh, hey sis!  I was just... uh...\"<br>\r\nIndeed Michelle's body was standing in the doorway of the living room, able to see and hear despite her lack of a head just like Wendy's body.

Quickly you take it, afraid that she might change her mind if you hesitate, then wait as she reaches into her pocket and pulls out her cell phone, which she immediately begins typing on. Finished, she holds it out where you can see the screen, you read \"Thanks for Helping me get away from that bitchy head of mine John.

Sure Wendy's family is wealthy, and she likely has access to at least a small portion of that wealth, so she may be speaking monetarily, but somehow you don't think so. Truthfully, it seems more as though she's coming on to you, something that, while certainly an exciting prospect, as Wendy's always been an exceptionally hot girl, her missing head only making her more attractive to your way of thinking, but did you really want to get involved with her again? True Wendy's head could have been the one behind all the pain and suffering you'd endured at her hands, but then again her body could be every bit as bad, and her current nice streak just a ruse meant to draw you in so she can use you again. And even if she really has changed now that her head is gone, that very fact that her head is missing is sure to draw all sorts of unwanted attention, most of which you're not at all sure you want to deal with. Not to mention you current girlfriend Michelle. What would her reaction be to this situation? After puzzling things over for a moment, you reply____________________?</span></div></div>",

Not sure what to make of this, you halt your attempt to leave before turning to face her, a questioning expression on your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that she had your attention, Wendy lets go of you with one arm, and begins busily typing away on her phone once again. \"Please don't go!\" she writes. \"I'm afraid to be alone right now, Afraid of what will happen to me when someone finds me here without my head.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling softly down at her, taking the headless girl in your arms you explain, \"Wendy, you know I can't stay.

Please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if that's such a good idea either Wendy. I don't think my girlfriend Michelle would like it if she caught me sneaking around with another woman behind her back.\" you explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then why not just tell her? Maybe she would be interested in sharing?\" Wendy wrote in a last ditch effort to stop you from abandoning her completely. This one actually gives you pause. Wendy without her head seemed like a totally different person than her head was, as well as seeming genuinely frightened of being left alone, something you can't much blame her for, and it had taken all your willpower up to this point not to give in to her requests to stay with her. This however is something else entirely. Michelle has long been interested in anything having to do with magic, especially that having to do with the separation or vanishing of body parts, and a girl like Wendy is now would definitely spark her interest. On the other hand, the idea of sharing you with and having sex with said woman... You didn't know, and that scared you. Still, having two hot girls all to yourself, one of them headless.... it's an interesting idea to say the least.</span></div></div>",

Grabbing the sword and standing it doesn't take long to notice their is someone else here. The sound of new age meditation music fills the air. The hair on the back of your neck stands as you see lawn chair laying out flat on a patio set up for some relaxation. You see Ms. Michelle stretched out on the chair, her head on a pillow and her eyes closed, breathing deeply. She doesn't react to you in the slightest, and all your muscles untense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     You approach slowly and carefully, no point in giving her a warning. You are given a chance to admire her form without her being aware in the slightest. She was an aspiring actress in her late 40's. She must of been gorgeous in her youth, and age had treated her kindly. She was small framed, but curvy and soft in the right places, in every sense of the word a MILF. Her long brown hair was in a bun on top of her head, and she wore a simple blue cardigan over a white tanktop. Her legs where clad in black capris, and her small mature feet sat nestled in flip flops. Her toes are short but well defined. You smile at a nostril piercing, typically befitting someone much younger. You could tell she had no desire to turn the big five-O just yet. She inhales and sighs, heavy breast rising and falling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     She isn't asleep, but maybe mediating or just relaxing deeply. You see her index finger tracing lightly on her other hand rested on her stomach, and her toes move sightly every once in awhile. This could not be going any better.

The neck ends half way up, the flesh smooth a light shade of pink and a white circle in the middle. It looks like a cartoon almost, but is most definitely real.

Despite the cliche, you couldn't really critique the nickname's accuracy.  Bertha was plump, curvy, and was generously endowed in the chest, hips, thighs, butt, and a cute little pot-belly that was peaking between her too-short tank top and too-low sweatpants as the garments struggled valiantly to contain her boobs and butt.  She was sweating profusely, her grey shirt stained in patterns that left little to the imagination.  How or why she managed to workout without a sports-bra you had no idea, though you weren't complaining.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"ELISE!\"  She half shouted and half wheezed, leaning against the living room couch and taking a long swig on her water bottle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"MOTHER!\"  Elise shouted back, mimicking her mother's inflection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Get your sassy ass in here!\"  Bertha shouted, rolling her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat followed was the world's most indescribably exasperated groan, followed by plodding footsteps so heavy with teenage angst that they shook the entire house.  This was especially remarkable, given the fact that when the girl these footsteps were carrying entered the room, it was clear that she couldn't have weighed much more than the ironic t-shirt and over-priced thrift store jeans she was wearing.  This was 16 year old Elise Lutz, who was somehow related to the woman she looked nothing like.  From her sharp angular features to her taller than average lithe build to her light brown hair, she seemed to take everything from her father apart from his gender.  \"Can I help you?\"  She asked, placing one hand on her hip as the other dangled off her shoulder like a stray strand of hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBertha pointed to the living room TV, which was on at full blast, which would explain why she'd had to shout to be heard.  \"Yes, you can help me!  What did I tell you about turning off the TV when you're not watching it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I WAS watching it!\"  Elise replied, switching which hand was on her hip and which dangled.  \"Until you shooed me off because apparently running on a treadmill while having a TV on in an entirely different room is too hard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's distracting!\"  Bertha said, defensively.  \"I need to be in a certain headspace when I work out... and leaving it on wastes electricity!\"  She said, snatching up the remote and turning the TV off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.  Am I dismissed?\"  Elise asked, switching hand-on-hip position yet again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBertha groaned and gave a weak wave, excusing her daughter from the rant.  Elise stomped off to her room once more, while Elise went back into the storage room that doubled as her workout space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour grip tightened on the sword.  Perfect, they were separating themselves.  Elise was probably going to pop in some headphones, and the whir of Bertha's treadmill would definitely drown out your footsteps.  This was just too easy!  Now all you had to do is figure out which one you wanted to use the sword on first...</span></div></div>",

The strong urge to scream your lungs out seized you, but with your blood now the consistency of concrete you could do nothing but twitch your terrified pupils as the voice continued \"I knew it would happen some day.  The signs were everywhere.  So, what was it that sent poor old Johnny over the edge of madness?  Was it Mrs. Carlisle's last final math test?  Not getting into the same University as your girlfriend?  Or did something inside you just...\" the owner of the voice grabbed your shoulder, forcing enough terror into your lungs to let out a wheezy gasp \"Snap!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus, Steve!\"  You said, swatting your friend's heart away before clutching your heart.  It had gone from 0bpm to 100,000,000 in what had to be record time.  \"Don't fucking scare me like that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...Says the stalker hiding in the bushes outside of my house with a giant sword?\"  Stefan ask, lightly kicking your calf with his shoe.  \"Seriously dude, what are you doing?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up and brush yourself off, doing your best to straighten out your thoroughly scrambled train of thought and come up with an appropriate response.  You clear your throat twice, making eye contact with your bemused friend and immediately taking a keen interest in the grass next to your shoe.  You really didn't have a good answer.  The silence dragged on, and you suppose you had to consider yourself lucky that Stefan was so perpetually chill about everything.  If any of your other friends had caught you in this position they'd have probably tackled you to the ground or called the police by now.  Not without reason, in fairness. <br>\r\n When a twitch of Stefan's mouth implied that he was about to speak, you interrupted whatever he was about to say with \"I've got a magic sword.\" and thrust the weapon out to him sideways with the point facing the street.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...what?\"  He asked flatly, glancing at the completely normal looking weapon before returning his gaze to his quite possibly insane friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The sword.  It's magic.  In can cut through things without hurting them.  And if it cuts parts off of people, then both parts will remain alive and have a mind of their own.\"  You explained.  \"Look, I have a note.\"  You added, digging around in your pocket and producing the note.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStefan took it, read it, paused, read it again, then said \"Uh-huh.  And where exactly did you find this sword and this note?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The woods near my house.  I was taking the long way home from school and I saw some kids playing around a sword stuck halfway into a rock.  I shooed them away, and pulled the sword out myself. When I got home... I dunno, the note just sort of fell out of my pocket.  Like it just appeared there magically.\"  You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see.\"  Stefan said, not seeing.  \"So you pulled this sword out of a stone conveniently close to your house that you conveniently never saw before and now... what?  You're rightwise king born of all England?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stefan, I'm dead serious right now.\"  You said, using Stefan's full name to prove just how serious you were being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStefan frowned, you having pushed one of the very few buttons he had.  According to him, everyone assumed that everyone named Stefan was gay, and while he had no problems with the gay community he hated people automatically assuming that of him.  You had never made that assumption, so whether you were some statistical outlier or if he was just paranoid, insecure, or had been bullied at some point in the past you had no idea.  All you did know is that now Stefan looked serious.  \"Do you have any proof?  Besides a crazy story and a note written in handwriting suspiciously similar to your sister's?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait, did it look like your sister's?  Wait, how did Stefan know what your sister's handwriting looked like?  You'd have to find answers to those questions later, for right now you had a much more pressing question to answer.  DID you have any proof?  \"Yes.\"  You answered, deciding who your first test subject would be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStefan only had time to stumble back one step and let out a sharp yelp as you swung the blade full force at his neck, your friend reacting too slow to dodge the weapon.  Now would have been a VERY bad time for Stefan to be proven right, but luckily for both of you your instinctual trust of the weapon was vindicated, and a smooth layer of skin had formed over the empty shoulders that Stefan's head toppled off of.  Stefan's body fell hard on its ass, catching his head in his lap and tensing up slightly as the back of his head hit his junk.  \"Fuck!\"  Stefan shouted, then froze.  \"Fuck...\"  He whispered, realizing that he was completely numb from the neck down, yet he could still talk and didn't seem to be dying any quicker than he was pre-decapitation.  He felt one of his hands lift away from his cheek, out of his control, and his body felt around the area where his head had been.  \"I'm... is this... uh... T-Turn me around!\"  He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were about to reach down and grab him by the hair when Stefan's own body took hold of its head in both hands and turned him around to face it.  \"You can hear me?!\"  He asked his own body, incredulous.  The body tilted him up and down in a surrogate nod.  \"Can you see, too?  Talk?\"  The body nodded Stefan again, waited a few seconds, then turned him side to side.  \"So you can see and hear without eyes and ears, but can't talk without a mouth?  What kind of sense does that make?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic, man.\"  You say, shrugging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I... wow.  You... wow.\"  he said, his pride prohibiting him from expressing the idea 'You were right and I was wrong.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, right?  Crazy.\"  You said, understating the gravity of what had just happened by several orders of magnitude.  \"But we should probably get off the streets.  We look a bit... conspicuous right now.\"  You said, looking around nervously.  No one seemed to be out and about, but you knew it was only a matter of time before someone looked out their window or came out to walk their dog and saw a sword wielding teen standing over a headless body and got the wrong ideas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStefan's body sprang to its feet, hunching over and holding its head close to its waist in an attempt to conceal its condition.  \"Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Let's go...</span></div></div>",

Sure.\"  You said, disappointed.  You'd come here to test the blade on Stefan's milf mom or cute sister.  You considered arguing with Stefan about this, but decided against it.  Your motives for wanting to chop his hot family members apart (man, that made you sound even more fucked up) and give their bodyparts minds of their own weren't exactly pure, and you doubted your ability to maintain a facade of innocence while intensely staring at, and possibly even touching, his family members' parts.  He probably wouldn't approve of that.  Not yet, anyways.  Best to come back later when he wasn't around and<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You coming or what?!\"  Stefan asked, his body and head halfway up the street leading to your house and gaining distance by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShit, no wonder he'd been able to sneak up on you.  Either you had the situational awareness of a brick, or Stefan was secretly a ninja.  Running after your friend's two parts, doing your best to hide the long sword in broad daylight with no way of actually hiding it, the two of you manage to make it back to your house without anyone noticing you.  You think.  You HOPE.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the door behind the two and/or three of you, you and Stefan and Stefan's body stand in silence in your front hall for a few seconds before Stefan asks \"So, body, how are you doing right now?  Are you having an existential freakout?\"  The body thought for a few moments, then shook Stefan's head side to side.  \"Really?  Huh.  I mean, I'm not having one either, which I admit is a bit surprising, but I thought that maybe you, being new to the whole 'being conscious' thing, might be handling this a bit more roughly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body didn't know how to pantomime its complex series of thoughts through waggles of its former head or shrugging of its shoulders, so it pointed to its pocket before offering Stefan's head to you.  You took it, nearly dropping your helpless friend as you severely underestimated the weight of a severed head, and turned him around so that the two of you were both facing his body, which produced his phone and began typing as quickly as it could.  Many minutes passed, enough time for your arms to begin feeling a little sore and for the warmth of Stefan's cheeks against your palms to start to feel a uncomfortable.  Either the body was writing the sequel to <b>War &amp; Peace</b> or was struggling to find the right words to describe its existence.  Just as you were getting antsy and Stefan was clearing his throat, which now constituted about 1/3rd of him, the body turned the phone around for the two of you to see.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i><b>Well I have all your memories, thoughts, emotions pre-decap, but they feel little different.  Like I was just watching them while you were doing them.  Like I was always there but in background.  Dunno, sort of feel like I always existed but was dreaming, but now I'm awake.</b></i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh.  Cool.  Anyway, what do you wanna do now?\"  Stefan said, his nonchalance more confusing to you than the body's vague spam of barely comprehensible gibberish.  You suppose it made sense that Stefan's body would speak in a language only comprehensible to Stefan's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe body turned the phone around, then paused.  Its shoulders twitched a little but its thumbs remained immobile.  It pocketed the phone, then motioned for you to return Stefan's head and you accepted, your arms suddenly feeling much lighter than the 8-12lbs that the head weighed.  Stefan's body tucked his head under one arm and held up a hand with an index finger pointing towards the ceiling.  \"Uh, what?\"  You asked.  The body pointed to you, then held its hand up with all fingers extended and held together as it took a step back.  Recognizing the gesture as one you often gave your dog, but not sure that the body had actually meant that, you ask \"You want me to stay here?\"  The body gave you a thumbs up.  \"Why?\"  The body pointed to the head, then to itself, then made a talking motion with its hands.  It seemed like Stefan's body wanted to have a private conversation with its head.  \"Uh, okay then.  I guess I'll just... be in my room.  Come get me whenever you're ready.\"  You say, stepping past the two of them and heading up the stairs to your room, careful not to nick the narrow walls, floor, or ceiling of the stairwell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had discovered a magic sword, how the hell was Stefan's behavior the weirdest thing about this whole situation?  Whatever, maybe his body is totally freaking out and is too proud to show it in front of you.  Or maybe the two Stefans are plotting some horrible prank on you to take revenge on you for the whole decapitation without consent thing.  Whatever, at least now you knew that the blade worked as advertised.  You could always find more volunteers (or victims) if Stephan was going to be weird about this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nActually, who WOULD be your next victim?  The possibilities were endless!  There were of course Stefan's mother and sister, your original two targets.  There was also your girlfriend, Michelle.  She had always been an adventurous girl and with a toy like this the possibilities for 'adventure' were all but endless, especially since she proposed the idea of an 'open' relationship for your last summer together, to prep you two for being separated by different colleges several states apart.  Before the idea of missing Michelle could bring down your mood, your brain reminded you that your sister Jenna was a prime target, though what with her being your sister you'd probably limit your mischief to just pranks rather than anything sexual (probably...).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the list of potential volunteers and/or victims grew and grew, your brain's ability to keep track of them all and figure out which order to  began to dwindle.  Not wanting to let any of your brilliant ideas go to waste, you leapt out of bed, fired up your laptop, and opened up a word document.  You began typing out an ordered list of who you'd use the sword on and what sorts of things you'd ideally do with each person, ranking them numerically and swapping them around as new ideas and considerations came to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou'd almost forgotten that Stefan was even there, right up until...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Heads up!\"  Stefan says, giving you just enough time to turn and see his body swinging his arms in your direction before the entire world starts spinning wildly.  You fall, hit something soft, roll, fall, hit something harder, roll, and finally bump into something harder still.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter blinking several times, the world comes back into focus sideways and at a much lower angle than before, and you realize what had happened.  \"What the hell, Steve?!\"  You demand, watching your headless body stand up and shove Stefan in annoyance.  While that's certainly what you wanted it to do, you hadn't made it do that.  Just like Stephan, your head and body were now two distinct entities and you were left controlling nothing but your neck and head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, it was my body's idea!\"  Stefan said, sounding genuine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSounding genuine didn't make you any less decapitated, however.  \"Well you could've made some noise while you were coming up the stairs!  Given me more than a second of warning before you let him... you... whatever.  Do that!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, like how you gave me a bunch of warning?\"  Stefan flatly retorted.  \"Anyway, I said it was the body's IDEA, I never said I had strong objections to it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever.\"  You said.  Your body approached you, moving very slowly and somewhat nervously despite the fact that, if it was anything like Stephan's body, it could see just fine.  Reaching down, you felt your hands wrap gingerly around your cheeks before you were hefted into the air.  Your grip felt weirdly uncomfortable, your palms pressed into your cheeks at an odd angle as you were held at what would have been eye level, had your body any eyes.  You weren't sure where to look, the empty shoulders or the empty air, and your body seemed equally unsure what to do with you.  \"Seems like my body is a bit more introspective than yours.\"  You say, your voice slightly 'squished' as your head was held tightly.  Your body adjusted its grip slightly, its fingers jittery against your skin.  Yup, even without saying a word or having an expression to read, it was obvious that your body was definitely handling this more roughly than Stefan's did.  \"Alright, you've gotten your sweet revenge.  Can my body put me back on and have this reversed or are you gonna be a dick and just cut me off again?\"  You ask, your own mind doing its best to suppress the existential dread of what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Actually, uh, it's...\"  Stefan stammered, your friend's normally nonchalant tone surprisingly chalant (assuming that was a word).  \"It's not revenge.  It's... uh... you maybe should sit down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were surprised to feel yourself descending, and when you were turned around and felt your apparently quite sensitive neck stump come to rest on something you saw that you were now resting on your body's lap.  It had taken Stefan's advice and sat in your computer chair which it had turned around to face Stefan who was now sitting Indian style with his head resting between his legs, his chin propped up on his ankles.  If you'd been in control of your body in that moment, you probably would have remained standing.  You liked to be standing when people said weird shit to you.  Was your body's mind already diverging from yours, or was it just so shaken by what was going on inside its mind (wherever that was) that it was just going along with anything?  \"So, if this isn't revenge, what are you calling it?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm bi.\"  Stefan blurted out, his body's back erecting as though an electric current had passed through it.  It apparently expected to hear that as much as you were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What?\"  Was your only response to that uncomfortable non-sequitur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a bisexual.  I like both men and women.\"  He clarified.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I know what fucking bi means.\"  You said, suddenly annoyed for reasons you couldn't adequately explain.  \"What I mean is... wait a minute, what's up with all that Steve shit?  You said you didn't want people to think you were gay because you were called Stefan, and now you're telling me you're straight up not straight this entire time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm NOT gay.\"  He said, defensively.  \"And yeah, I didn't want people to ASSUME things about me.  If they get to know me and I TELL them things about me that's totally different.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And why ARE you telling me this?  Now, of all times, why is this your first priority?  And why did you need to cut my head off to tell me that?  What does any of this have to do with anything?\"  You rapidly ask, confusion and frustration mounting at your friend's seemingly nonsensical behavior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My body doesn't think exactly like me.\"  He said, giving you precisely no answers to any of your questions.  You were about to say something when Stefan continued \"It's similar.  It has all the same memories, emotions, and hormones, after all.  But it's not EXACTLY like me.  It has less reservations about stuff.  It... and believe me, I hate to say this, because I know it sounds so stupid, but... it thinks more with its heart than its brain.  Because it's less reserved, it was going to tell you about me.. you know... but I convinced it that if it REALLY wanted you to know, I would tell you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OK.\"  You said.  \"But that still doesn't explain why you cut my head off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, uh, about that...\"  Stefan stammered.  After a long pause, his body reached for its phone and loudly began typing.  This prodded Stefan to say \"I have a crush on you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...What?\"  You said in the same monotone you'd used for the last uncomfortable non-sequitur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've had a crush on you, for like, a year now.\"  Your friend of three years informed you.  \"And it's been eating me up inside that I could never tell you, because I know you're... you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Straight.\"  You reply, firmly but without anger or judgement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right.\"  Stefan replied, looking down at his body's ankles sheepishly before returning his gaze to you.  \"But maybe not as much as you think you are?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finally got it.  \"So, under the assumption that my headless body would have fewer reservations just like your headless body, your body cut my head off to see if I have supressed or repressed or heretofore unknown bi-curiosity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Basically, yeah.\"  Stefan answered, his body patting him on the head as a way of congratulating him on his bravery.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suppose there was only one more thing to ask.  \"Well?\"  You ask your body, tilting your neck back and looking up as high as you could.  You were pretty sure you knew what was going to happen next.  You were straight.  Your body would say no.  You were a bit nervous about how all this would impact your friendship with Stefan, but you think you could work this out.  You've had female friends you've crushed on before and never got, and that didn't destroy your friendship with them.  Things would probably be awkward for a few weeks, and maybe he wouldn't want to play with the longsword with you any more, but things would be back to normal in the end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body makes its move, and...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Your body carried your heads over to your dresser, setting you and Stefan side by side on your stumps facing your bed.  A shiver ran up the nub of spine still connected to you, the faux-polished faux-wood much colder against your stump than you had anticipated.  While your stump shook from the cold, your cheeks and forehead burned with apprehension.  \"Body, me, whatever, seriously.  You don't have to do this.  If you feel pressured or something you can just-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou didn't have time to finish your thought, your body placing a finger over your lips in a shushing gesture.  It waited until it knew you wouldn't interrupt, then it gestured.  It pointed back at Stefan's body, sitting on the edge of the bed like a dog awaiting a bone (an analogy you cursed your brain for using as soon as you thought it), and it shrugged with its hands low and its palms facing the ceiling.  Just like Stefan, you seemed to be able read your body's movements with surprising ease, and knew exactly the message it was trying to convey.  \"What's the worst that could happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you could think of the worst thing that could happen and answer your body, it had turned around and approached Stefan's body.  \"Don't worry, it'll be fine!  If it's not your thing, we'll pretend this never happened.\" Stefan said, though whether he was speaking to you, your body, or both, wasn't entirely clear.  If he was speaking to your body, his reassurances did the opposite of reassure, your body freezing in front of Stefan's with one hand at its own chest and the other limply hanging from its side.  It had no idea how to proceed, and as it awkwardly twitched and fidgeted, you could tell that doubt had entered whatever was the equivalent of its mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing that you were about to say something that could kill the already feeble mood, Stefan's body took action.  It grabbed both of your body's hands and guided them onto itself, placing your right hand on its smooth and soft neck stump and your body's left on his hip.  Your body was clearly surprised, its shoulder's flinching, but it did not recoil.  Slowly, it began rubbing the stump, and tentatively it began squeezing Stefan's hip.  Releasing your body's hands, trusting that they would stay where he had left them, Stefan placed his hand on your body's own hips, your sides shivering plainly even through your loose t-shirt.  Your body seemed to be studying Stefan's body more than it was fondling it, comparing the flesh to that of the women it had felt up.  Stefan, meanwhile, was squeezing with far more sexual intent, running his somewhat daintier hands with their longer fingers up to the the first of your ribs and down to the hem of your jeans.  It squeezed softly only on your body's more firm sections of flesh, while over your more tender stomach it glided weightlessly across the surface.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you couldn't feel Stafan's touch, nor his body, you could tell that your body was, for lack of a better word, fascinated.  It rubbed at his neck stump with increasing vigor, the soft skin pulling and compressing with ease under your body's medium length and thick fingers, and to your discomfort you saw that your hand had slowly traveled further and further down and behind Stefan's hip, until it was unambiguously groping his ass.  It seemed to like what it was feeling, the denim stretching as your grip tightened.  The more your body felt him, and the more Stefan massaged your body, the more comfortable it seemed to be getting.  You gulped, your neck shifting beneath you as you did.  Was it really going to do this?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour body's hand traced down the front of Stephan's significantly abbreviated throat, the body shaking with excitement as your own body seemed to take charge.  Its hand traced down Stefan's sternum, his build thinner and more lithe than your own.  Your body paused, and you could tell by the way it squeezed Stefan's chest and allowed its elbows to go a little slack that it was disappointed with what it found.  You liked tits, as most men do, and while you had dated a few flat chested women before none came close to the flatness that was the slightly thin and very male Stefan.  You hoped that this reaffirmation of your heterosexual preferences would cause your body to lose its curiosity, but after a short pause it somewhat less enthusiastically continued down Stefan's flat abdomen and onto his jeans.  You heard the unfastening of a belt, and soon afterwards your body stepped back in surprise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Jesus!\"  You shout, mirroring your body's shock as Stefan's cock rose up and bounced gaily (or, bisexually) at its long awaited freedom.  You had caught sight of a disrobed Stefan once or twice in the boy's locker room after gym (and thought nothing of it, by the way) and had seen his smooth shaven junk a few times.  The circumcised cock that hung over his closely tucked balls was a bit thick, but wasn't that impressive lengthwise.  You had never, however, seen it hard, and apparently Stefan was quite the grower.  From a pasty 4 inch limp noodle to a towering pink rod that had to be at least 7.5 inches, if not an even 8, and jutting from your leaner friend's crotch it seemed even bigger.  Your body's reflexively covered its own crotch, clearly feeling a little emasculated by the sight of your suddenly larger friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou, however weren't really feeling that.  You were feeling... well, you wouldn't call it jealous, because unlike your more emotion driven body you knew that your statistically average (slightly less than) 6 inch cock had never been a problem with any of your girlfriends, and as such had proven perfectly serviceable.  You also wouldn't call the feeling admiration, because that would be a pretty grandiose reaction to seeing a somewhat large dick.  No, it was more... impressed?  Yeah, that was a good way to describe it, you were impressed.  It was an impressive cock.  Tall, straight, smooth save for one or two large blue veins, an enticingly bright head, it was a cock any man would be proud to have.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blinked twice.  Did you just think his cock was 'enticing'?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing that he'd embarrassed your body (though you doubted he paid any attention to your embarrassment), Stefan's body slid off the bed and onto its knees in front of your body while simultaneously pulling its shirt off.  It had clearly performed this maneuver many times before,  and without a head to worry about the body found it easier than usual.  Naked from the waist up and with its cock still jutting out of his unzipped jeans, Stefan unbuckled your body's belt before it could protest and dropped your pants down to your ankles, revealing your own (slightly less than) 6 inch dick, your well groomed but not clean shaven pubes, and your somewhat hairy bare ass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn, and I thought I had a cute butt!\"  Stefan said, grinning from ear to ear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey!\"  you said, your voice cracking with embarrassment.  You'd heard your girlfriend Michelle make that verbatim remark before, and all of your girlfriends were quite fond of squeezing your rear, but hearing your male friend say it... didn't feel as different as you thought it should.  And the lack of weird feelings somehow made you feel weirder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStefan's body rubbed its hands together, and you could tell from its body language that it was imagining licking its lips at the sight before it.  Lacking a mouth of any kind, or at least a mouth within easy reach, Stefan's body gripped your shaft and balls with one hand apiece and pressed its baby-smooth stump against the head of your dick.  It slowly rocked its shoulders back and forth, gently squeezing your balls and tugging your cock with firm but fluid flicks of the wrist.  While you couldn't feel it, you didn't need even need to to tell that Stefan was a natural.  Having a dick of his own to practice on, Stefan moved with a familiarity that no woman could hope to emulate, applying such precise pressure and moving so confidently that even without any sensations you could feel exactly how good he was.  You bit your lip, wishing you could feel it.  Wishing you could feel him.  Gah!

Knowing this, you freeze, not daring to move a muscle, lest she see you and retreat back inside without giving you the full show you so richly desire. Wandering over to her deck chair, Felecia takes a quick glance around, making sure that no one's watching her, though she apparently manages to miss you, most likely due to the energy efficient tinted windows your dad had installed a few years ago. Satisfied that she's alone, Felecia reaches down, grabbing the hem of her T-shirt and pulling it up, over her head, and off, revealing her magnificent body in all it's naked glory, as she's not wearing anything under it. With her perfect tan, lustrous long blonde hair, beautiful face, long sexy legs, hour glass figure, and full perky double D tits, it's no wonder you find your neighbor attractive. Already hard just from the sight of Felecia's incredible bod, you're about to get even harder, as the blonde haired beauty lays back in the chair, grabs the bottle of sun screen, and begins to apply it to herself, slowly and sensuously coating every inch of her perfect pulchritude with an oily sheen. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you're enjoying the show, though you really wish you could jack off right now, or better yet, go and grab your cell phone so that you could record all this, but tinted windows or not, you're pretty sure that any sort of movement on your part would attract Felecia's attention, causing her to retreat back inside, and ending your show before you can really enjoy yourself. Instead, you simply watch, not daring to move, growing more and more uncomfortable by the moment as your erection strains against the confines of your trousers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she's finished applying the lotion, Felicia lays back, and closes her eyes, a small smile appearing as she enjoys the warmth of the suns rays on her bare skin. No longer worried about being spotted, you unzip your pants and pull down your boxers, allowing your straining member a much needed taste of freedom, before grasping in in one hand, slowly working your way up and down the shaft, bringing yourself closer and closer to a spectacular climax, as thoughts of all the perverted things you would do with the blonde beauty given the chance run rampant through your mindscape.</span></div></div>",

Which is why, despite knowing better, you can't help but question it. \"Wait, you mean you've been showing off for me all this time on purpose? Why didn't you ever say anything before?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Because before, you were still a minor. I mean, I'll admit you're kind of cute, but there's nothing about you that's worth going to jail over. Now that you're eighteen though, you're fair game. And since I'm between boyfriends right now... well, a girl can get lonely if you know what I mean?\" Felecia purred. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was true, you'd only turned eighteen a couple weeks ago, and this was the first time you'd seen Felecia sunning herself in the nude since then. It was the boyfriend part though that caught your attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, in that case, how about I be your boyfriend? That way you won't have to be lonely anymore?\" you suggested, your sex crazed hormones causing you to forget briefly that you already had a girlfriend, and that she probably wouldn't be happy to find out you were seeing another woman behind her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlacing a finger to her lips, Felecia seemed to think about your offer for a moment. \"Hmm, it's tempting, but no. You really are a little young for me.\" You're about to protest, as there's only five years difference between you, but before you have a chance, Felecia continues \"Besides, I'm not really interested in another relationship right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slump, sighing in defeat. Seeing your forlorn expression, Felecia adds \"There there, no need to be so broken up about it. I may not be interested in a relationship right now, but if you can make things interesting, maybe I'll let you be my fuck buddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHearing this, you can't help but smile. Patting the hilt of the magic sword you found you confidently reply \"Oh, I think I can make it interesting alright. Just give me a minute to get dressed and I'll be right over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sure hope so. Don't take too long though, I'd hate to have to find someone else.\" Felecia says with a giggle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPausing only long enough to slip on some shorts and a pair of flip flops, then snatching up the long sword, uncaring of who might see it, before racing downstairs, out the door, and down the street to the house next door. Stepping up to the door, you ring the door bell and wait, though not for long. Felecia, obviously expecting you, answers the door on the first ring, still as naked as the day she was born, not counting the shinny coating of suntan oil adorning her flawless skin. Now giving you time to utter so much as a word, she grabs you by the waistband of your shorts and drags you inside and slamming the door behind you, before dropping to her knees, using her grip on your waistband to pull your shorts down around your ankles, allowing your member to pop free, half hard again already just from the thought of what's about to occur between the two of you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mmmm, you're bigger than I thought you'd be.\" Felecia says, reaching up and cupping your balls. the feel of her soft hands lightly gripping your testicles causing you to shudder, your dick hardening even more from her ministrations. \"Hmm, somebody's happy to see me.\" Felecia says with a laugh, reaching up with her other hand and slowly massaging your dick. Bending over, she gives the head of it a little lick, examining the taste and texture of it. Apparently liking what she finds, Felecia wraps her lips around your dick, bobbing back and forth, her tongue swirling around and around the shaft as she sucks it like a lolly pop, and it's all you can do not to cum immediately. in fact, if you hadn't cum once already before coming over here, you doubt you could have managed to resist at all. As it is, you simply stand there and enjoy it, the sword dropping from nerveless fingers and clattering to the floor, the unexpected sound of it, causing Felecia to stop what she's doing and glance down, her eyes widening at the sight of the blade. Pulling back and releasing your dick from her mouth, she reaches down to grab it, her other hand still firmly clenched around your balls, applying just enough pressure to get your attention. Glaring angrily while waving the sword around, she snarls, \"What the hell is this? Are you some kind of psycho or something? A sicko who gets his jollies out of luring young unsuspecting women to have sex with him and then killing them? You won't get me so easy jerk!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou blink, totally confused by this sudden turn of events. \"What?! No! It's not like that at all! You have to believe me!\" you exclaim, reaching out for the sword, only to be stopped by a hard painful squeeze to your testicles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nu uh, I'm keeping this until I'm satisfied with your explanation. There better be a good reason for you to be carrying a sword around.\" Felecia replies, giving you another squeeze for emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Owe! Alright, alright, you can keep it for now. Look, you probably won't believe this, but the truth is, that sword you're holding is magic. Whatever is cut by it vanishes harmlessly, only to reappear whenever you press the button in the hilt.\" you explain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelecia looks at you blankly for a moment. \"You actually expect me to believe a cockamamie story like that?! I'm calling the cops!\" She threatens, using her grip on your balls to drag the both of you closer to the phone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop it, that hurts!\" you complain. \"Look, I know it's hard to believe, but I'll prove it to you. I'll let you hold onto the sword and everything.\" you insist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFelecia pauses for a moment and looks back at you. \"Alright, fine, prove it.\" she demands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, but I'll need you're cooperation.\" you reply, hoping that the sword works the way it's suppose to, and that this isn't all some horrible elaborate joke that someones playing at your expense. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cooperation like how? What do you expect me to do?\" Felecia inquires suspiciously. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's simple, all you have to do, is take that sword you're holding, and use it to cut my hand off.\" you order, trying to sound more confident in your decision than you felt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Felecia screeches, clearly unearned by your request.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just what i said, cut my hand off.\" you repeated, holding out your left hand for Felecia to take a swing at.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I know you're crazy, but whatever floats your boat, it's your funeral.\" Felecia says with a shrug. Though she still looks a little unnerved, she raises the sword, takes careful aim, and brings it down hard, slicing clean though your wrist in a single strike, causing said member to vanish into mist, leaving a skin covered wrist stump in it's place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she must have expected something like this on some level, the sight of your missing hand sends Felecia into a panic. \"Ahh! Oh my God, you're hand! I am <i>so</i> sorry! We have to stop the bleeding! We have to call an ambulance! Maybe if can get your hand on ice in time they can reattach it somehow.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh?\" You reply, staring down in fascination at your new wrist stump. Then as you register what Felecia just said, you quickly exclaim \"No! Don't call an ambulance! I'm fine, really. The sword made my hand vanish, just like I said it would. Here, see?\" you explained, holding your arm out for Felecia's inspection. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck? There's no blood?! I know you had a hand a minute ago, I saw it!\" Felecia exclaimed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like I said, the swords magic. Now why don't you go ahead and press the button on the hilt so that I can get my hand back?\" you suggest, hoping that this part of the swords powers will work just as well, as you've no desire to be one handed for the rest of your life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yea, that sounds like a good idea.\" Felecia replies, clearly non-pulsed by the whole thing, not that you can blame her, as she's just had her world view totally shattered by this incontrovertible proof of the existence of magic. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she presses the switch, a bright glow surrounds your wrist stump, then slowly fades, revealing that you're whole again, your left hand having reappeared just as it was before Felecia sliced it off. You wiggle your fingers a bit to make sure that everything is in good working order, but thankfully everything seems to work fine, as though your hand had never been missing in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking in the sight of your restored hand, Felecia can only stare for a moment. \"Shit, you weren't kidding, this sword really is magic!\" she breathes, before grinning  mischievously and adding \"Oh, this raises so many interesting possibilities! How will I ever decide what to try first?!\" clutching the longsword to her chest as though it were some sort of priceless relic. Which it probably is now that you think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So I take it you believe me now?\" you said with a mischievous grin of your own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's kind of hard not to after seeing the evidence for myself. Oh, and uh, sorry about hurting you earlier, but when I noticed the sword, I thought you were a serial killer!\" Felecia said with a laugh.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Eh, no harm done. So, what now?\" you ask.</span></div></div>",

I imagine sex will be so much better without them getting in the way.\" Felecia suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRather than reply, you simply took the sword from her and sliced through her legs without warning, just below her hips, causing both of them to vanish in a puff of smoke. Suddenly deprived of support, Felecia soon finds herself falling, although it's a short trip, only a couple of feet, before she lands hard, ass first, sinking deeply into the soft carpet covering the living room, causing her to squeal and begin to topple over, though she manages to catch herself with her arms before she falls over completely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, you ass, why the heck did you do that?! I could have been hurt!\" Felecia complains, holding herself upright with one hand, while rubbing her sore backside with the other. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, I guess I wasn't thinking.\" you lied, though in fact you had known exactly what you were doing, and had done it anyway deliberately, as you were still a bit sore from Felecia's earlier mistreatment of your member, both physically and emotionally, and a little subtle payback was just what you needed to correct that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fine, but be more careful next time, alright?\" Felecia replied. \"Now, lets see if I can make it to the kitchen from here.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The kitchen? Don't you mean the bedroom? Or at least the couch?\" you asked in confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiggling, Felecia replied \"Nope! The kitchen table is just the right height for what I have in mind, and besides, it annoys my roommate. She can be a real stick in the mud ya know?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm, alright then, I'm game. Lead the way pretty lady.\" you replied, watching in fascination as Felecia places both hands against the floor and presses down, lifting herself up into the air. She wobbles a bit for a moment while she regains her balance, unused to her altered center of gravity and this new form of locomotion, then begins hand walking herself across the floor towards the kitchen, her unrestrained tits and ass bobbing around wildly with her movements, and despite the lingering pain, you can feel yourself grow hard once more, your dick ready for action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's slow going, but it's not that far from the front door to the kitchen. Once the two of you arrive, Felecia plops down, reaching up and wiping her forehead, where a faint sheen of sweat is already forming. \"Whew! Talk about a workout! Hand walking is tougher than I thought, I'll have to start working out more if I'm going to keep doing it. For now though, how about helping me up? I'm feeling a bit too lazy to try and climb all the way up there on my own.\" Felecia requests, pointing up at the table top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure thing babe, whatever you want.\" you said, scooping up the legless beauty and placing her firmly on the table, face up with her crotch pointed towards you. Deciding that now's as good a time as any to take charge, you dive right in, licking and sucking away at one of Felecia's bodacious boobs, while squeezing and stroking the other. Meanwhile, your other hand dives down between her legs and goes to work on her pussy and clit, doing your best to make her wet enough for penetration, something that's pretty simple, as she's pretty wet already just at the thought of having sex with you in her new legless body. Once you judge her wet enough, you pull back, causing Felecia to release a short groan of protest, but she's not disappointed for long, as you immediately grab hold of your dick, take careful aim, and thrust into her hard, causing her to cry out. Then you begin moving, slow and steady at first, then faster once you've managed to get your rhythm down, furiously pounding away at your sexy neighbors pussy, struggling not to cum as Felecia's cunt grips down on you like a vise, massaging every inch of your man meat with every stroke of your cock, her lack of legs allowing you to drive yourself deeper than you ever thought possible. </span></div></div>",

Besides, this one's special. Wait till you see what he can do!\" Felecia said, looking back over your shoulder. Turning your head to look as well, you find yourself confronted with a rather angry looking, though very lovely young woman in her early twenties, with long, curly dark brown hair, tanned skin, and bright hazel eyes, hidden by a set of stylish reading glasses. Her body is good as well, not quite as curvy as Felecia's, Is impressive in it's own right, being taller, with full C-cup breasts inside of a low cut white button business blouse, a narrow waist, flaring hips and ass crammed into a tight black pencil, leading down to her long elegant legs encased in a set of nude colored pantyhose, the feet of which are in turn encased by a pair of sexy black pumps with a two inch heel. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you take in the appearance of the woman, presumably the roommate Felecia mentioned earlier, Felecia pushes back away from you, your dick slipping out of her with a wet slurp, then moving herself over to one side, giving the other girl an uninterrupted view of her legs, or rather where her legs where less than half an hour ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing this, the other woman's looks shocked, something she confirms a moment latter as she stammers out \"W-what happened to your legs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Isn't it neat!

Candice stands there for a moment, her lower half now clad in nothing more than her underwear though even that wasn't to last long, a she reached back behind her and unsnaps her bra, then wiggles out of the shoulder straps, holding it teasingly in front of her for a moment before sliding it off, revealing her breasts, which were round, full and perky, their large rose colored nipples standing proudly at attention, a clear indication of arousal you think as the room was far from chilly. <br>\r\nFinished with the bra, she then moves on to the grand finale of her little strip tease, turning around, giving you an excellent view of her full pert rear, grasps the waistband of her underwear slowly  pulling them down, exposing her luscious butt and tight pink pussy one inch at a time until it's fully exposed, then allowing them to drop the rest of the way. Still bent over, she gives a little wiggle, causing the cheeks of her ass to sway enticingly, then standing back up and stepping out of her panties before turning around, a brilliant smile on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only stand there silently for a moment, too stunned to move by the display you've just witnessed.

Seriously?\" you ask eventually.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"More than anything!\" Candice answered firmly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Felecia decided to pipe up. \"Wow Candice. I knew you liked bondage, but I never knew you were this kinky!\" She said, seemingly impressed by her roommates boldness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice looked at her, her expression unusually serious given the situation. \"It's not kinky, it's just the way I'm suppose to be alright.\" she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh? I don't get it?\" Felecia said. You were a little lost two, but you decided to stay silent for now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice sighed. \"Look, I've never told you this, hell, I've never told anyone this besides my ex boyfriend, but I have a medical condition called body integrity disorder, or BID for short. Basically what that means, at least in my case is that, I've never felt like my body was quite right, that my arms and legs aren't really a part of me, and shouldn't be there. Of course I know that loosing my limbs would be a terrible thing, even if I could find a surgeon willing to remove them, but knowing that doesn't make the feelings go away. In fact if anything it makes them worse. Now though, with John and his magic sword, I have a chance to live my dream while still maintaining a normal life outside of my home. To me this is like a gift from God!' Candice said, her smile wider and more brilliant than than you'd ever seen on anyone at the mere thought of loosing her limbs, even temporarily. Then her expression soured as she took in the stunned expression on her roommates face, an expression mirrored on your own face your certain. \"I bet now that the two of you know that though, you think I'm some sort of perverted freak and don't won't to have anything to do with me, isn't that right?\" she demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou manage to be the first to respond, as Felecia was still busy processing the the information her friend had just revealed. \"No Candice, I don't think you're a freak. You're a beautiful, presumably intelligent woman who just happens to think a little differently than most people, that's all. You can't help how you were made. And the thought of having your limbless, helpless torso to play with is a real turn on.\" you said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally finding her voice, Felecia replied \"I may not understand this BID stuff, and I certainly don't share it, but to me, It's just another kink, and I won't judge you for it. You've never judged me for acting like a slut and a bimbo all the time like the other girls do.\" then she smiled and added \"And just to show my support, i think I'll join you. John, I want you to make me limbless too! uh, just for now of course, I really don't want it to be permanent or anything.\" she added hastily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course not.\" you said with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCandice meanwhile was moved to tears by you and Felecia's acceptance. \"Thank you! Thank you both! You don't know how much your acceptance means to me!\" she said, hugging the both of you, first Felecia, then you, your rock hard erection pressing into her abdomen as her naked breasts ground against your equally naked chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, think nothing of it.\" you said, patting her on the back awkwardly, unused to dealing with such displays of emotion. Then as she releases you, you grin and say \"Of course, it's good that you got that out of your system now, because in a moment you won't be hugging anybody!\" and with that, you picked up the longsword, quickly chopping through both her arms at the shoulders, then shoving her back down onto the bed before doing the same to her legs, all four of her limbs vanishing into thin air, leaving Candice as nothing more than a head and limbless torso, just the way she'd wanted. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OH MY GOD! MY LIMBS ARE GONE!\" Candice said, her eyes shining with joy. \"OH THANKYOUTHANKYOUTHANKYOU!\" She said all in a rush her excitement totally overcoming her usual sense of decorum, causing her to act like a kid in a candy store.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ooh! Do me, do me!\" Felecia said, waving her hand in the air to get your attention. In response to this, you sliced through her shoulder, causing the had she was waving to vanish into the either, swiftly followed by the other arm, then her legs, leaving her every bit as limbless as her roommate, who was by this time wiggling and squirming around on the mattress, trying to get a feel for her new much more limited range of movement. The sight of it was too much to resist, and you climbed into bed between them, picking up Candice and impaling her on your dick, causing her to squeal then began bouncing her up and down raising your hips slightly to meet her on every thrust. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking on jealously from where she lay next to you, Felecia complained \"Hey, what am I, chopped liver? How about some action here?\" she demanded. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning, you grinned at her before replying \"Sorry, but I've got my hands full already. You'll just have to take care of yourself until I can get to you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What!\" she screeched. \"John you bastard! You know I can't! You just took away my limbs remember?!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmused by her reaction, you couldn't help but laugh. \"Ha! Just kidding, come here you!\" you said, reaching down with one hand and grabbing her by the hair, causing her to wince slightly, though with her reduced weight it wasn't enough to really hurt her, and depositing her on your chest face down, her crotch positioned over your face, then beginning to lick and suck away at her pussy, causing her to wiggle and squirm, her breath coming in quick gasps as you went to town on her clit, all the while continuing to bounce Candice up and down on your shaft, her own squeals and moans blending with Felecia's in a vibrant symphony of lust. </span></div></div>",

Well, aside from cheating on you that is.\" she added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not helping!\" you muttered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"While not exactly diplomatic, what my room mate's just told you is essentially correct.\" Candice replied, before looking at you and asking \"You forgot to tell her about the magic sword didn't you?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Magic sword? What are you talking about?!\" Michelle questioned, looking more lost and confused than ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's what I thought.\" Candice said, nodding knowingly. \"The truth is, though we are in fact limbless at the moment, it's a purely temporary situation caused by the effects of an enchanted sword that has somehow fallen into your boyfriends possession, the effects of which can be reversed at any time merely by pressing the button embedded into the bottom of the hilt.\" Candice explained. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh really? And where is this so called magic sword?\" Michelle asked sarcastically, obviously not believing a word of it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's on the floor on the other side of the bed.\" you answered. \"I know you won't believe anything I tell you, so why not press the button and see for yourself?\" you suggested. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh, sure, I'll do that.\" Michelle said, making her way slowly and cautiously around the bed, then reaching down and picking up the sword, all without ever taking her eyes off of you. \"Huh, it really is a sword. I still don't believe the magic part though.' she says as she reaches down and presses the button in the hilt. </span></div></div>",

Of course, you're hoping that she'll be willing to cooperate of her own free will, but if not... well, you'd rather not have to worry about going to jail for this little stunt you're about to pull. Aiming carefully, you raise the sword once more, before bringing it down, slicing through Felecia's neck, causing her head to vanish before your very eyes, only a small stump of a neck, the cut surface covered in skin remaining to show where it once was. Felecia still hasn't stirred, though, thankfully, she's still breathing, so you know that she's still alive. Looking over her headless form, you consider your options once more. You could of course go ahead and have fun with her in her new reduced state, or, you could go a bit further, testing out the sword on some of her other body parts before eventually having your way with her.</span></div></div>",

For obvious reasons, you've wanted to bang her since day one, not bothered in the least by the fact that she's legally your sister.

She'd never explained her reasoning, and you'd never asked, or even propositioned her really, just hinting around the bush, so you didn't know if it was because of your being her stepbrother, or if she just didn't think you were good enough for her, but you suspect the latter, as she can be sort of a stuck up bitch sometimes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow however, thanks to your recently acquired magic sword... well, she won't really have much of a choice will she? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSetting off in search for the attractive blonde girl, you first try the living room, finding her sitting on the couch eating popcorn and watching a movie, something she's fond of doing on the rare occasions when she doesn't have a date.

You deserve to be punished, and I'm just the guy to do it!\" you teased, giving Stacy's sexy ass a few more slaps for good measure, Stacy's body wiggling and squirming as though trying to escape, though not too hard, making it clear that she was only playing, acting out the scenario that you had chosen for her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrowing tired of spanking her, you move on.

Judging her to be more than wet enough to receive you, you have Stacy raise herself up onto her elbows, allowing you to get under her, grabbing a big double handful of her luscious tits as you carefully maneuver yourself, lining your dick up with her pussy before sliding your way in, taking your sexy stepsister from behind, thrusting in and out of her hard and fast, her pussy, still tight despite how much of a slut she was, clamping down around you, attempting to suck you. Getting into a good rhythm, you begin thrusting faster, harder, Stacy's sexy headless body rocking back and forth, her tits jiggling, your balls slapping against her ass, and try as you might to delay it, you can already feel yourself getting ready to cum, your balls tightening up as the first traces of precum begin to ooze from the tip of your cock. Trying to think of other things, boring things like curling and long division help only slightly, your stepsisters pussy just to good to resist for long. Knowing your on the edge, you pull out just in time, streams of cum shooting from your dick like a fire hose, covering Stacy's as and lower back with your hot sticky seed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAllowing her body to relax, Stacy's body slumps to the mattress, with you flopping down next to her mere seconds latter, slightly winded from your lovemaking efforts. Ordering Stacy's body to roll over, admiring her long sexy legs, taunt toned stomach and  gorgeous tits, not to mention her pretty pink pussy and the blonde triangle of pubic hair between her legs, still lightly splattered with your seed.

You answer nervously, before continuing \"And the reason was because, um, because...\" blushing a little and sweating with nervousness as you try to figure out a way to excuse your perverted behavior, either that or come up a believable lie that you can substitute. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, at just that moment, things seem to click into place for Stacy, as her eyes widen and she exclaims \"You were planning to rape me weren't you?! That's why you did it, you were going to rape your own stepsister!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider denying it, but given the expression of shock and remorse that you're wearing after Stacy's pronouncement, you know it would be a waste of effort. instead, you merely nod, eyes downcast, unable to look your stepsister in the eye as you want to hear what she thinks and what she has planned for you as punishment for your crime. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's not long in coming, as Stacy screams__________________________?</span></div></div>",

You're not naked right now, are you?\" Michelle asks, suspicious of your behaviour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm not naked, but it probably will shock you.\" You tell her as you invite her inside. As you close the door, Michelle turns towards you. In her immediate shock, she drops her phone, cupping her hands over her mouth as she screams.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michelle, It's okay! Don't be scared. I can explain!\" You tell her, trying to calm her down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck, John!? Why do you have two heads? This is prank, right?\" Michelle asks you, still in shock and disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's no joke Mich. It's real. This is what I wanted to show you.\" You tell her calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then explain to Michelle how you came into possession of the longsword and it's ability to regrow and duplicate any body part that has been severed. You tell her about how you chopped your head off and regrew two new ones and how your original head disintegrated into ash.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow. That's crazy! I wouldn't normally believe this sort of thing, but the proof is right in front of me.\" Michelle says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, do you want to try it out?\" You say with both heads in unison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. I don't want to try out your super cool longsword that can cut things without causing harm and regrow double of whatever was chopped off.\" Michelle replies, sarcastically. \"Of course I want to try it!!\" She adds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then. What do you want to try out then?\" You ask with both heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John, before I tell you, please stop talking with both heads at the same time. It freaks me out.\" Michelle tells you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. Sorry.\" Your right head replies. \"So, what will it be, then?\"</span></div></div>",

It gets really scary when your head is chopped off at first.\" Your left head tell Michelle. \"It'll feel like you are dying, but don't worry.

The blade glides through the air effortlessly before sending Michelle's head into a spin. It soon lands with a light thud and rolls across the floor. You approach her head and pick it up. She has a shocked expression on her face. Not so much in fear of what's happening, but more in surprise that she is still alive despite her decapitation. You then give her a quick kiss before taking her to get a closer look at her own body. You both watch as Michelle's neck stump splits in two and begins to regrow. As her new heads begin to form, you notice the expression on Michelle's original head turn blank. Lifeless. Within a few more minutes, Michelle's new heads are fully grown. Their eyes open and Michelle soon comes to terms with what just happened to her. She turns her heads to face each other, then both flinch in surprise at seeing the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa! This feels very different from what I was expecting.\" Michelle says with both heads. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should try making your heads do different things at the same time.\" Your right it says. \"It's more fun that way\" Your left head chips in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. I'll try speaking with one head while the other keeps its mouth shut.\" Michelle mocks you again, using only her right head to speak this time while her left sticks its tongue out at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you wanna do first?\" You ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have an idea.\" Michelle says before stepping closer to you, placing each of her hands on your heads before kissing you. It's a really strange sensation as the four heads kiss together. Keeping the flow going between each pair also takes a bit more effort and concentration. As the kissing comes to an end, the four heads stare at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now that that's out of the way, what should we do now?\"</span></div></div>",

She seems surprised by her decapitation, but unhurt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, you both notice at the same time, the layers of her skin peeling away at an alarming rate. The skin flakes off and disintegrates in the air, piece by piece. Soon, the surface layers are all gone, revealing the thick layer of muscle that was hidden underneath. As it too starts peeling away, Michelle lets out a panicked scream. As the muscle mass decreases, her eyes are the next to go, vanishing from their sockets. By the time the muscle is gone, Michelle's screams have been silenced. The last thing to go is her silky hair, which just seems to flake off and land in a heap on the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are now standing there, holding the skull of your girlfriend.

You think about what else you could use; something that you'd be willing to lose in the worst case scenario. A foot? No. You would rather still be able to walk properly. A finger? No. It's too subtle. It would be almost impossible to tell if it changed. Your head? It's a bit too early for that, plus you'd rather not die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make the final decision that you will chop off one of your hands. If it goes wrong, at least you'll still have one, and you may even be able to have it reattached if you get to hospital fast enough. You decide to take your left hand. It is your weaker hand, and you always write with your right hand anyway. You position it one the table and raise the longsword. You then take a big swing with the sword, closing your eyes just before it makes contact with your wrist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your hand comes off, the first thing you notice is that it doesn't hurt. The second thing is that there's no blood, instead there is a smooth layer of skin on each stump. Lastly, you realise that you can still control your severed hand. You make a fist, then wiggle your fingers, confirming that you really were in control. Shortly after, you feel a tingling in your hand and watch as it begins to transform. Your palm shrink down in size, while your finger become longer and thinner. Your nailer suddenly grow and your skin becomes smoother. When the transformation is done, you barely recognise your hand. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou put your other hand on the table next to it, to compare them. The changes are incredible. The severed hand is now much smaller and slender. It really does look like a female hand. You pick it up and place it against your wrist. It immediately reattaches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you know that the Longsword works, you decide on your next move.</span></div></div>",

Interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How many of your family are dog-headed, Max?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All of them.\" Max explains: \"You're in a gated community, where every resident with a human body also has a dog-head. I suppose you could call us anthropomorphic or cynocephalic.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou never imagined that a community of dog-headed humans existed within a mile of your home, never mind end up as an accidental visitor. \"That's amazing,\" you say. \"Just out of curiosity, how old are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"23.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guessed you were young based on your body. What was the purpose of the pool party?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was my birthday party,\" Max reveals, \"My parents let me decide what way to celebrate my birthday and I decided to throw the pool party based on that. Those dogs out there are my friends, whom I invited down. By the way, my dad is the head of security in this community.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax goes over and takes a photo of his family, who all have German Shepherd heads. He shows the picture to you. You see his father in a security outfit, with his mother beside him. You see that Max has three siblings, one brothers, two sisters. It is clear Max is the eldest, while his first sister appears to be a teenager, his brother seems to be a child, and his second sister appears to be a puppy-headed baby. In fact, all of Max's siblings are puppy headed. He then tells you about the facilitates in the community:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we have our own supermarket, our own restaurants, our own general store, our own schools, our own healthcare, our own beauty salons, our own security agreements, our own volunteer fire department.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is an interesting list of services you hear, causing you to picture dog headed residents working for the better of their fellow dogs. You imagine the volunteer fire department to consist of mostly Dalmatian volunteers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou now wonder about the other dogs out there. \"Who are the other dogs in that yard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The other German Shepherd is Gwen, my girlfriend,\" Max explains. \"The others are all dogs I met at school and youth club. I could list them all, but I prefer you got introduced to them individually.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that moment, the German Shepherd you deduce must be Gwen comes in. She is wearing a black two-piece bikini and a towel around herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you got the human head talking, didn't you, Max?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Quite talkative, even for a disembodied head,\" Max comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess so. What's his name?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"John.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello, John.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi,\" you say to Gwen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like you have another question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes I do,\" you say. \"How come you and everyone in this community all have dog heads?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, before I answer that, I have a question of my own,\" Max says. \"How did you end up here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I found this sword, and when I cut myself along the neck, my head shot off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, then it landed in my family pool. I guess your body must have become a temporary dullahan, looking for its head.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought it would. Now, can you answer my question, please?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax's answer to your question on why he, his girlfriend, his family and everyone else in the gated community is dog headed is...</span></div></div>",

It just so happened, the exact moment WWIII had destroyed the earth, the sword chose to check its surroundings. Seeing the death, pestilence, and plague that had arose due to the simple actions of a young boy not choosing what he wanted to use, the sword reversed time to moments before the boy picked up the sword...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are John, a 18-year old fresh out of high school. After a boring day of classes, you decide to take the scenic route on your way back to your house in the suburbs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile walking, you see a group of kids huddling around a rock, and trying to pull something out. After shooing the kids away, you look at what they were hiding and upon closer examination, you find a mediaeval-styled longsword. So, enacting out one of your favorite scenes from <b>The Sword in the Stone</b> you attempt to yank the sword out. However, it stays thoroughly lodged in the stone. \"C'mon\" you say, attempting to take a better position to yank out the sword, but to no avail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" you say to nobody in particular, \"I have a lot of homework to do, this is not worth wasting 30 minutes of my time for.\" You proceed to follow the path back to your house. Once there, you feel an overwhelming desire to  thank your family. You find them all in the living room, and say, \"Thank all of you for existing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why would you say something crazy like that?\" your mother says. \"I don't know, I just had a weird feeling that this day could have gone drastically different, and that something bad could have happened to all of you,\" you reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whatever,\" your brother Todd says, and goes back to playing his video game. You decide to head back to your room and finish doing the homework that you felt you haven't done in ages. About two hours later, your mother opens your door and brings in both your girlfriend, Michelle, and best friend, Anna, who had came over to study for the test you were supposed to have the following day. After studying (and kissing Michelle goodbye) you sit down and have a nice uneventful dinner with your family.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYears later, you look back and site this as one of the best days as your life, but you can't pinpoint why. You and Michelle have a loving family, 2 sons and 2 daughters. You never heard anyone else talk about a sword in a stone near your town, nor did you really care, as it was probably still lodged in that stone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWho knows? Maybe somebody else will find it one day?</span></div></div>",

What started out as a mistake nuclear missile launch, caused by a scientist being distracted by a mass murder case on TV from his home town, quickly escalated to the destruction of the entire multiverse. First, the waters became polluted with radiation, while nuclear fallout slowly killed all those left alive, wiping out nearly 90% of the world population. Those that were left struggled to avoid radiation, and to find supplies in their ever dwindling rations. Animals mutated, but quickly died out as well, leaving even less food source available. Next, the plants died out, and it was eventually the loss of oxygen that caused the last humans to die.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd the world remained this way for hundreds, if not thousands of years, until the sword awoke it's true nature. After the first one hundred years had passed, the sword reset itself, just as the never read manual had said. After an undeterminable amount of time, (Everyone had stopped keeping track of time long before 100 years had passed) the sword activated the failsafe installed by Wsxol thousands of years before. If it could not detect a master, the sword was to return to Wsxol.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWsxol, being the wizard that he was, did not realize that he, just like all of humanity, was mortal. So, the sword, looking desperately for its master began doing what it did best. It began slicing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sliced between the bonds between universes, searching desperately for one that held its master. It passed through 10, 20, 50, 100, 1,000 universes, with no luck. And for infinity, it sliced onwards, always looking, always hoping, never finding what it so desperately required. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what the sword was unaware of, is that the bonds between universes are very fragile, and that the destruction of these bonds would have cataclysmic effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey would start out as something simple. A person slipping through the cracks into a world they don't belong in. Technology from the future falling through time into the past. The revival of extinct species. However, these events continued to compound and compound, until the very structure of the multiverse itself collapse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInfinite amounts of innocent life forms died. Infinite towns, worlds, planets were demolished in seconds. Chaos reigned supreme. Nobody in any multiverse was safe until the sword found what it was looking for, which it never did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd all because, you, the reader, could not make a simple choice.</span></div></div>",

I have added the maximum allowed 5 options to every single chapter (because I'm insane), have deleted as many short \"more options\" style chapters that I reasonably could (because the new 5 options makes those chapters somewhat redundant), and I have combined many short chapters with uninteresting choices (ones that would never be taken) into longer continuous chapters to reduce bloat.  Before this update, this story had 881 chapters.  Now, that has been reduced to 678, over 200 chapters.  I would like to emphasize that very few chapters were truly \"lost\".  Most of the reduction was simply compiling \"options\" chapters where possible (there were a lot of those), combining very long strings of very short chapters into a smaller number of more substantial chapters, and of the few that were well and truly deleted they were all less than a paragraph and had very low view counts, and were only deleted because reposting them after the branches leading up to them were compiled or moved felt like more work than the reader enjoyment would justify.  If one of these well and truly lost chapters was yours, and you take offense, I am sorry.  I hope I have not offended you and that you will not be discouraged from adding more chapters to this story in the future.  I will not be doing another large-scale update pass on this story for a long time, if ever, as this process was time consuming, exhausting, and I still have 3 more stories to get to (and they will be got to, in descending order of chapter count).  That said, I will be implementing a new rule, or rather I will be updating an existing rule:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--From now on I will update all chapters posted without 5 branches to have 5 branches.  If you have specific ideas for what you want the extra branches to be, please email me with a link to the chapter you posted and the options you would like added.  If you do not do this within 24 hours, I will create the options myself.  If you do not like the options I created, email me what changes you'd like me to make at any time and I will update the choices, assuming they haven't been taken.--<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere will obviously be exemptions to this rule, such as when you are ending a particular storyline or if there really is no reasonable way to make more than a certain number of options (even with \"Reader's choice\"), but overall I hope to expand the freedom and possibilities people can take in my stories by providing more choices, while also reducing the guff people have to go through to reach content by eliminating as many repetitive \"options\" chapters as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf you have any questions, comments, or concerns, let me know.  Happy writing, and keep the posts coming!</b></span></div></div>",

You levitate the blade up above you towards the ceiling and stuck your right arm out, making sure it was in line with the sword.  You released your psychic grip on the weapon and just as planned it dropped to the floor cleaving your remaining limb right off at the shoulder.  You feel another great surge of power rush through you as you lose feeling in your arm, and testing your abilities out you immediately see the results.  You concentrate on the sword once more and it lifts with ease, the same amount of effort it would take to actually carry it, and what's more you could maneuver it in ways that would be impossible if you still had your arms.  Moving your concentration to your t-shirt you easily bring it over your head and redress yourself, the empty sleeves dangling off your shoulders in a way that you inexplicably found amusing.  Getting an idea you lift the sword with your mind and hack your severed arms into further pieces, severing the hands at the wrists before levitating a pair of gloves out of your drawer and placing them on your hands before levitating your hands up to approximately where they would naturally hang from your body.

That's crazy!\"  She says, taking a sip of water.<br>\r\n\"Psychokinesis\"  You correct.  \"You can't read minds or anything, you can just move physical objects.\"<br>\r\nMichelle shrugs.  \"You know what I meant, nerd.  Anyway I have a great idea for what I want to do with the sword.\"  She announces.  What does she plan to do with it?</span></div></div>",

I remember meeting her a couple of times when she was hanging out with you but in the last few weeks of school it seemed as though she just dropped off of the map.  I don't even remember seeing her at graduation.\"  You muse.<br>\r\nMichelle frowned.  \"Well there's a reason for that.  Amber got into a car accident three weeks before the end of school.  She survived, but got terrible burns and scars all over her arms, legs, and some on her body and had to sit out the graduation while she was in the hospital.  The only reason it wasn't highly publicized around school was due to the circumstances of the accident, something about one of the drivers being the son of some rich politician and on drugs or something.  Really hushed up the whole thing.\"<br>\r\n\"I see, sorry to hear that.  But how does this relate to the long sword?\"  You ask.<br>\r\n\"Because, Amber could use it to become mobile and independent again!  She lost most of her fingers and can hardly move her limbs ever since the accident, but this sword could give her her life back!\"  She announced.<br>\r\n\"That's... really altruistic of you.\"  You say, feeling a bit guilty that you were just going to use the sword to have fun.<br>\r\nMichelle smiles.  \"Plus I've known her for years and can tell you right now that she's... a bit freaky, if you catch my drift.\"<br>\r\nYou now return her smile.  \"Alright, sounds like a plan then!\"  Rather than reconnecting your arms you levitate a jacket over and position your hands so that they are coming out of the sleeves, giving the illusion that you had arms in case someone looked your way.  Next you grab one of your dad's old golf bags and stuff the sword and your arms into it before slinging it over your back and walking out the door with Michelle following right behind you.  You begin driving while she directs you to her friend Amber's house, finding it a bit tricky at times to keep the sleeves up and your hands moving right and concentrate on the road AND listen to Michelle's directions all at once, your psychic powers straining somewhat, but you manage to get there without incident.  The two of you walk up to the door and knock, then proceed to wait almost a whole minute as a slow, electric sound edges towards the door.  \"Who is it?\"  Calls the voice inside, one belonging to a teenage girl.<br>\r\n\"It's me, Michelle.  Are your parents home?\"  She inquired.<br>\r\n\"Oh, hi Michelle!\"  She chirps giddily.  \"No, my parents are away right now, won't be back for another two hours or so.  It's been the first time in a while they've left me home alone, probably because I'm more mobile now!\"  She say, the door opening electronically to show Amber and her new mobility, an electric wheelchair.<br>\r\nYou and Amber studied one another, Amber not expecting anyone to be with Michelle and you not really having understood how severe the damage was.  Amber was dressed in a sleeveless blue shin length skirt, its material rather thin and showing off all manner of scars.  Her arms were scarred, misshapen, and ended with only one or two warped fingers on each.  Her legs were withered and bent at odd angles.  Amber's body looked to be in rather good shape, you imagine she was on a sports team of some kind before the accident as it still looked pretty toned despite putting on a little bit of weight due to the inactivity of the past few weeks.  Her face was untouched save for a set of scars on her right cheek past where the right earlobe probably resided before the accident, and one big red splotch on her chin.  It was a pretty face, its beauty shining through the damage.  \"Who's he?\"  Amber asked hesitantly.<br>\r\n\"Hi, I'm Michelle's boyfriend John.\"  You say.  \"What if I told you that you could have even more mobility back?\"  You ask,using your powers to drop your jacket off revealing your floating hands.<br>\r\nAmber is stunned.  \"I... how?\"<br>\r\n\"May we come in?\"  You ask, not wanting to stay outside too long like this.  Amber rolls her chair back and both you and Michelle enter her home, Michelle closing the door behind her.  You drop the golf bag on the ground and allow your hands out of your psychic grip to really show Amber what you could do.  \"Earlier today I found a sword.  Not just any sword, a magic one.  One that could grant the user incredible powers.\"  You explain, unzipping the bag and levitating the sword in the air.  \"Whatever part of someone gets cut off by this sword goes numb, BUT they gain the ability to move things with their mind!  The more parts they cut off, the stronger their powers get.  Mind over matter, if you will.\"  You explain.  \"As well, anything cut off can be reattached, even if it's on the wrong spot or on the wrong person!  It'll work just as well as the real thing, but it also makes you easier to be moved by psychokinetics.  Sort of a balance thing if you will.\"  You explain to her.<br>\r\nAmber stares at the sword, her eyes filling with emotion.  \"So, I could move like I used to?\"<br>\r\nYou smile.  \"Better.\"  You toss the bag across the room on a whim, then lift each piece of furniture one by one (though you struggle with some of the heavier stuff).<br>\r\n\"THAT'S AMAZING!\"  She squeals.  \"COULD YOU USE IT ON ME?!\"<br>\r\n\"That's the plan.\"  Michelle says.  \"So, what would you like cut off?\"<br>\r\nAmber answers...</span></div></div>",

While it's true that you didn't NEED them per se what with your powers you may want them back one day for various reasons and didn't want to have to take them from Amber.  Michelle, either sensing your hesitance or simply offering an alternative out of genuine care, gave Amber a new offer.  \"How about my arms?\"  This caught Amber by surprise.  \"I mean, I know they may still be a little too long since I'm taller than you, but they'll be a lot closer in size and more effeminate to go with the rest of your body.  Plus, if you got my arms me and John could be armless twins!\"<br>\r\nAmber thought about it, considering the pros of your stronger arms and the pros of Michelle's more fitting arms.  She thought for quite some time, the decision apparently not an easy one.  She looked at your arms quite a lot, seemingly fixated on having them.
