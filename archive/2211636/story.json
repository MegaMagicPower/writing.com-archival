            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>My name is Janelle Lee, and I'm 17.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLet me tell you about my life before I graduated high school. I lived in a two-story contemporary with my parents, Stephen and Anita, and my younger sister, Courtney. My bedroom, like Courtney's, was on the second floor. I got my red hair from Mom, and my brown eyes from Dad. In high school, I was a cheerleader (Go Cats!), and I was dating Brad Butler, captain of the football team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, before you go thinking this sounds too cliche, there are a couple of differences from the typical story. First, I wasn't head cheerleader. That was my friend, Mindy Kier. She wasn't jealous of me, because she already had a girlfriend, Zooey Hirsch. I was her friend, too. That's right, I was the straight best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe second difference from the usual is that I was a vegetarian. I wasn't one of those protest-the-lunch-room-for-serving-meat vegetarians, but I did take pride in refusing to eat or drink anything that came from something with a face. Mom joined me in eating vegetarian, Dad learned how to cook veggie burgers and veggie dogs on the grill, and Courtney left me to it, even sticking up for me when my uncle would mockingly ask if I could hear the cow screaming as he bit into his burger. As for my friends, they were supportive, and Brad didn't even mind my intestinal gas.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, that was my life before graduation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>After</i> graduation, I can safely say, it sucked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the graduation ceremony, I went out to celebrate my first night of freedom. That's what I called it, anyway, as if I didn't have college to get ready for at the end of summer. But hey, that was months away, and I could still have fun and go to the movies for a good solid month or two. On this night, my curfew was extended to midnight, and I wanted to let loose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at this underground rave that I'd snuck into where I met <i>him.</i> He said his name was Micah, and he was chill with the fact that I wasn't invited. We danced for a while, then he brought me a soda, for which I thanked him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't occur to me for half an hour that maybe I should have gotten my own drink. By then, of course, I was feeling the effects of whatever he'd slipped into it. As I started reeling, Micah and three of his buddies began half leading, half carrying me somewhere private. I vaguely remember them taking off some of my clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut I vividly remember them biting me. Micah at my throat, one buddy at each arm, and one sinking his teeth into my thigh. <i>My God,</i> I thought, <i>I'm being eaten alive!</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the darkness pulled me down, I remember thinking, <i>Please, God, don't let me die... </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next thing I remember was water washing over me. It was too little to be a river, but the fact that I was lying on my back meant it couldn't be a shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water stopped, and I heard a woman's voice: \"... name is Janelle Lee, 17 years of age. What are you doing here, Janelle?\" Her words were addressed to me, but her tone sounded like she was talking to herself. \"You should be starting a summer job, or going to a movie with your friends. What happened to put you here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Four guys,\" I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat reaction surprised me, so I opened my eyes and sat up. The woman was about Mom's age, and she was trying to compose herself. That's when I noticed that I was naked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly one way to get the answers I needed. \"Who are you? Where am I? Why am I naked? What's going on?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded. \"I'm Dr. Joanna Kinski, the county coroner. You are in the morgue. I cut your clothing off your body. And I was about to perform an autopsy on you.\"</span></div></div>",

After telling them what had happened and where I was, she handed the phone to me. \"Daddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sweetie, thank God you're alright!\" Dad said. \"I got a call that the car was impounded, nobody knew where you were. You gave us quite a scare, young lady.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Me, too, Daddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think we'll chalk this one up to a lesson learned. We'll discuss it further when we're all home. We'll see you soon. Love you, honey.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Love you, too, Daddy. Goodbye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter I hung up the phone, I turned to Dr. Kinski. \"I know this may sound strange, but something smells awfully good, and I'm starving.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe pointed to a corner. \"I've got some pad Thai. You're welcome to half, if you don't mind vegan food.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI paused just long enough to kiss her on the lips, then went over to the corner and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI put one forkful into my mouth when I realized that something was wrong. Pad Thai has a lot of flavors; it shouldn't taste like Styrofoam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI swallowed, and immediately regretted it. I ran to the sink and threw up. \"What's wrong with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt a gentle squeeze on each shoulder. \"I'm a doctor,\" Dr. Kinski said. \"Let's see if we can find out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter sitting me down, Dr. Kinski put a thermometer in my mouth, wrapped a blood pressure cuff around my left arm, and clamped a sensor on my right index finger. Then she turned on the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was done, she looked even more afraid than when I spoke on the slab. \"What is it?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned the machine in my direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTemperature: 55\u00b0.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeart rate: 0.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood pressure: 0/0.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood oxygen level: 0.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would expect these readings,\" she said, \"if I had hooked this up to one of the people in the drawers.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy jaw dropped. \"How could this happen?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If I may ask,\" she asked, \"how long have you had <i>those?</i>\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked in a mirror. If my heart rate weren't already zero, it would have stopped. \"My God.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI woke up in the morgue. My vital signs said I was dead. And I had fangs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPut it all together, and it spells <i>vampire</i>.</span></div></div>",

But I've narrowed down the appetizing smell I mentioned earlier.\" I pointed to a mini-fridge. \"You haven't opened it since I woke up, but I'm betting there's blood in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked defeated. \"I guess there's just one thing left to verify, then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe opened the fridge and took out a bag of blood, then tossed it to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sipped some of it. It was coppery and sweet. It was the first thing I'd had in my mouth since I was 12 that wasn't plant-based.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd it was the best thing I'd ever tasted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened a hole at the other end and shotgunned the blood into my mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's when my family walked in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad looked like he was going to be sick.

There was a part of me that wanted to go out, to explore the city after all the normal people were in bed. But I stayed home. After all, I had gone out last night, and got turned into a vampire. Mom and Dad had tabled the discussion of whether I should be disciplined for scaring them once. If I did it again, I might come home to find the blanket taken down, letting sunlight in while I needed rest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily for me, I found some movies to watch late at night. And they weren't horror movies, so I didn't have to look at make-believe vampires while I was dealing with being a real one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I watched, I heard a noise that didn't belong. <i>Someone</i> had entered the house, while Mom and Dad slept, if fitfully, and Courtney snored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI stood up. <i>Wrong house, wrong night,</i> I thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI crept up the stairs, marveling at how quiet I was being. Even the creaky stair wasn't giving me away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI opened the basement door a crack and peeked out. There he was, getting the lay of the land. No doubt congratulating himself on not arousing the homeowners.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stepped toward the big screen TV, I made my move. I ran right up into his face and hissed, fangs bared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI can't say which felt more rewarding: his high-pitched scream, him running for his life, or the unmistakable odor that signaled that he had voided his bladder and bowels simultaneously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA light went on down the hall. \"Who's there?\" Dad called out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just me, now, Daddy,\" I called back. \"We had a burglar, but I scared him off.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter closing up the house again, I went back down to the basement. I smiled, thinking about Courtney's poem: The burglar had gone bump in the night, and I had certainly bumped back.</span></div></div>",

Turning to me, she asked, \"Are you okay, Janelle?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not sure how to answer that. Will I get better? You don't get better from being undead. Am I happy? Not by a long shot. I've gone from 'None of my food has a face' to 'All my food has faces, and names, and jobs they hate.'\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were quiet for a long time. Then they put their arms around me, Mindy first, then Zooey.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can't go out during the day,\" Mindy said, \"so we'll come back after the sun goes down, and take you out to a movie. How's that sound?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled. \"I think I'd like that. What's the movie?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a surprise.\"</span></div></div>",

But I guess he still wanted to feel like he was protecting me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, you don't have to keep calling me Daddy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You used to think it was cute.\" I turned to Mom. \"How long did you call Grandpa Daddy?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All the way through college,\" she replied.

It was an entertaining movie, and it almost took my mind off the conversation I'd had with my parents right before I left.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad had said that I didn't need to call him Daddy anymore, and Mom had said she had called her father Daddy until she graduated college. The thing was, of course, I wouldn't be going to college anymore. College was for people who could walk in the sunshine. College was for people who could eat in the cafeteria. College was for people who were still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then, of course, my not going to college was a reminder that I hadn't seen Brad since grad night, and I hadn't talked to him on the phone, either. Sooner or later, I would have to sit down and talk with him, like I did with Mindy and Zooey, and tell him how things had changed. How <i>I</i> had changed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls dropped me off in front of the house, and we promised we'd do this again soon. I walked into the house, prepared to resume our discussion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI didn't get the chance, however. Mom wasn't in the living room, and three strangers dressed in black were. Two men and a woman. The woman had hair as red as mine. \"Janelle Lee?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. Where's Mom?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She went off to her bedroom,\" the woman said, her voice with just a touch of an Irish accent. \"She didn't want to be party to this discussion.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at Dad, and he nodded. The woman was telling the truth. \"You have me at a disadvantage, Miss... ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Finola,\" she said. \"These are my associates, Llewellyn and Blackwell.\" Then, showing her fangs, she said, \"It's part of my job to deal with those like you.\"</span></div></div>",

I know everything is different for you, and I know why. I haven't been using the words, not because I'm ashamed of you, but because... Part of me feels like, if I start calling you those things, it's like I'm abandoning you.

I will say, however, that you won't want bagged blood once you have fed directly from a human being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should I practice on animals?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The blood of animals doesn't nourish us as well as human blood, so you would need much more.

Of course, the thing about forgetting something is that knowing you've forgotten it doesn't help you remember. So I finished getting ready, all the while listening to the whispers in the rec room, and wondering what had slipped my mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, I opened my bedroom door, and everyone jumped out and yelled, \"SURPRISE!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, them being there wasn't a surprise - I could hear and smell them, for God's sake - but what came next hit me right between the eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey sang \"Happy Birthday\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Mom gave me a birthday hug, I whispered to her, \"I forgot all about my birthday.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she replied, \"a lot has happened in the past two weeks. But your friends all remembered.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIndeed they had. Dr. Kinski was there. Mindy and Zooey were there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Brad was there.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe took me into his arms and kissed me. \"That's an unusual taste,\" he said. \"What is it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you really want to know?\" I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably not,\" he answered, and kissed me again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe gifts were vampire-related. Dr. Kinski gave me a T-shirt with a picture of a cat with bat wings, and also brought me blood. Courtney gave me a vampire bat plushie. Brad gave me bat earrings and a matching bat necklace. Zooey gave me a T-shirt that said, \"Careful, I Bite\". Mindy gave me a hoodie decorated with a picture of a skull with a ribbon on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you all,\" I said. \"I'm grateful for your gifts. I'm more grateful for your presence here today. I wouldn't have blamed any of you for suddenly remembering dental appointments.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I watched them all enjoying cake and ice cream, it occurred to me that this ought to be my last birthday celebration.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot because I couldn't have cake and ice cream, mind you, but because birthday parties didn't mean much when you were immortal. My friends and family would grow older, and I would stay the same age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do you like the party?\" Brad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice,\" I replied. \"I guess you've made up your mind about me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even though we can't go to college together, like we planned?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Haven't you heard? I'm going to college here in town. We may not be going to classes together, but we can still be together.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Same here,\" Mindy said. \"Friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Best</i> friends,\" said Zooey.</span></div></div>",

We decided to see <i>Expecting the Unexpected</i>, the story of a teenage girl who found herself pregnant, even though she'd never had sex. It was an entertaining little movie, and we all enjoyed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the way home, I said to the others, \"Thanks, guys. I couldn't have asked for more for my last birthday party.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Last birthday party?\" asked Mindy. \"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean that you don't need to celebrate the birthday of someone who will never get older. Do you really want to sit around wishing me a happy 65th birthday, when I won't look a day older than I do now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay,\" Zooey said, \"no more parties. But can we still get together and have a good time? And maybe sometimes, we get you something that you'd like, but you wouldn't normally buy for yourself?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI thought that was only delaying the inevitable, but I said, \"I'd like that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen we got back to the house, Mindy and Zooey left for their homes, but Brad decided to stay for a while, and asked me if he could see my bedroom. I agreed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take long to show him everything I had. Which was fine, because he quickly let me know what I'd half suspected; that he had something else in mind when he asked for permission to enter my bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd, frankly, I welcomed it. We kissed, passionately, removing our clothes as it felt right to do so. When we were both naked, I climbed into bed, he climbed on top of me, and our bodies became one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSex brought with it one reaction I wasn't expecting: as we built to a climax, I could hear, smell, <i>feel</i> the blood pulsing in his throat. It took everything I had not to bite him in the throes of my passion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen it was over, he lay next to me. \"How was it for you?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I almost bit you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe someday I'll <i>want</i> you to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what if I don't want to?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What if you do?\" He kissed me. \"I'm dating a vampire, it seems like something we should talk about.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay. From now on, when we make love, we ask each other about biting, and I won't bite until we both agree.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, he got dressed, and promised to call the next night.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he left, I had two bags of blood.</span></div></div>",

Anna, these are my friends, Mindy and Zooey. They're together. Girls, this is Anna and her daughter, Lindsay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four of us spent the afternoon in the basement, hanging out. Four outcasts who decided to be outcasts together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, you wanted to know about what I thought of the fireworks show? Well, they set off fireworks they purchased themselves, and I was glad I was in the basement. Fireworks and vampire hearing are not a happy combination.</span></div></div>",

So, my question is, why does the richest man in town want you to drive a cab?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know,\" I replied. \"The other day, I mentioned to a friend that I needed something to do.

Well, maybe I have to hire you, but I can and will fire your ass if you can't cut it. Let me show you around.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe led me to the garage. \"These are our machines.

Didn't think so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>2) Cooperate fully.</b> For the reasons stated above, you need to play this like you're a mortal who would be hurt by a bullet to the face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>3) As you watch which way he runs, pull the cab over and park.</b> You wouldn't want to get a ticket while you're following the next steps. Those things cost money. Plus, the courts run in daylight hours, so you can't plead it down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>4) Get out and run the little bastard down.</b> You can outrun them, so they haven't gotten far.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>5) Kick the robber's ass.</b> I beat the perp like a government mule. If you're inclined to draining them dry, so be it. Just remember to call the cleaning crew to take care of the body before anyone sees it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>6) Collect the cashbox and run back to your cab.</b> Eyes on the prize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLater, at Nouri's, Greene was buying, and he offered me a cup of coffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"Sensitive stomach.\" Holding up the bottle, I added, \"My doctor gives me this stuff to keep me going. It's all I can eat or drink without it doubling back on me.\" All of which was true. I just didn't mention that my doctor was a coroner, or that the contents of the bottle came in varieties like B-positive and O-negative.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was good enough for Greene, though. He drank to my health, and I to his.</span></div></div>",

Maybe it's the whole I'll-never-see-you-again vibe we've got going on, but we're privy to the inner lives of so many individuals who you wouldn't look twice at. Here are some of the things I heard in my first week as a professional driver: <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">\"I could have had her. I wanted her. And she wanted me. But my folks didn't like her. 'Not our sort, dear.' So I married someone else. Five years, and she's binging and purging, and whether I touch her or not depends on astrology or some shit. Let me tell you: If you ever find the one, you hold on like your life depends on it. Damn straight your sanity will.\"</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">\"Love conquers all, they say. No, it doesn't. It doesn't conquer his hold on your joint account, where your money is. It doesn't conquer his jealousy if you talk to anyone who isn't him. And it damn sure doesn't conquer his fists if you ever put one goddamn toe out of line. Eventually, you start looking for something that will conquer his ass. And here's hoping you're not seven months knocked up when you find it. If it's not too late for you, remember: When you look at the world through rose-colored glasses, red flags just look like flags.\"</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">\"Everything seems so simple, right up until you've actually got to do it. Everybody says, if it's them or me, I'm looking out for numero uno. Even if it means killing somebody, they say. Well, every now and then, somebody finds himself in that him-or-me-somebody's-got-to-die situation. And let me tell you, the first sentence to run through your mind will be, Well, what's so special about me, that I should live and he shouldn't?\"</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">\"Not all of us are God's creatures. Some of us are demons from the pit of Hell. They wear our faces, but they don't live as we do. To exist, they must take from us. And I'll bet you, if I told you that I knew how to find them and send them to God's Judgment, you'd probably say I was crazy.\"</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">******************************</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">\"The club scene's changed since those guys disappeared.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, it got better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard somebody killed them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I heard those guys killed a whole bunch of people, so acceptable losses.\"</div></span></div></div>",

Blasko was first, telling us of how he had Leonardo DiCaprio in his cab. I'm inclined to believe him, because he told the star that he had no idea who he was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKaptan was next. \"I pick up this old couple. You think nothing would happen, but they start going at it, right in my back seat, with me driving. I was good with ladies when I was young, and they put me to shame.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\" I asked. \"About the older couple, I mean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see cop car next to me. So I ask cops, Is it okay if they do this in my cab? And cops get on loud speaker, they say, You, get off of man.\" We all laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I picked up these two guys at the bank,\" Greene said, \"and they gave me directions to a specific place. Then, I found out the police were looking for two guys who robbed a bank, and guess which one. So I drove the police right to them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How about you, Lee?\" Kaptan asked. \"You got good story to tell?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wasn't about to tell them about how I beat up a robber, since I was supposed to be as petite as I looked, so I said, \"Sorry, I haven't been driving long enough for any good stories.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, there's gotta be something you can share,\" Greene said. \"Maybe something from before you got your hack license.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"There's a story, but not one you guys want to hear.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now I must know,\" Blasko said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"It was right after graduation, and I mean right after. I snuck into this underground rave, and I bumped right into the guy who ran it. But he acted cool, so I thought I'd be okay, you know? Then he slipped something into my drink, and he called three of his friends over. They did what they wanted with me, then they left me for dead in the alley.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich goes to show that vampires can also kill the mood. \"Told you you didn't want to hear it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreene put a hand on my bottle. \"These rave guys,\" he said, \"you get a good look at 'em? Could you tell me where they were?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom the looks on the other two guys' faces, they were thinking the same thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They've been taken care of,\" I promised. \"And I'd appreciate it if I didn't hear this story anywhere else, okay? I just want to move on.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody will hear it from us,\" Greene promised. \"If anyone else gives you any trouble, let us know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We cabbies stick together,\" Blasko added. \"Anyone gives one of us trouble, we give them <i>real</i> trouble.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks, guys.

Some people tip better than others; some people make a mess in the back seat, which I have to clean up; and some people are just jerks.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it true,\" Zooey asked, \"that cab drivers turn on the meter before you get in?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sometimes. If I have to drive out a long way to pick you up, I'll turn the meter on along the way. Otherwise, that drive - and the gas I burn getting there - are on me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how about Ub- \"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do not discuss The App Which Must Not Be Named,\" I said in a loud voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.

We won't laugh at you. Throwing up in the car sucks for both of us: You have to pay a $200 sanitation fee, and I have to clean it up.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is there anything good about dealing with a bad customer?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The A-hole button.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Technically, it's the extra passenger button, and it's supposed to tell the meter that there's more than two passengers getting in. But sometimes, I use it to make some jerk <i>literally pay</i> for being a jerk. I had this one guy, everything he said, if it wasn't sexist, it was racist. So I warn him, if he doesn't watch his tongue, it's going to cost him. He keeps it up, and I start hitting the A-hole button.

Be hard to maintain the Masquerade in the middle of a war.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, there's a cleaning crew for werewolves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not like the one for vampires, I'm sure.

That much was true. I don't know if Stoker changed the rest deliberately, or if Van Helsing sought to make himself and his allies look better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You said you were there,\" I said. \"Which character was based on you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think the closest was Mina. However, I was not some attorney's wife. I believe the current terminology is sex worker. I had gone to London to become an actress, but my skills did not impress anyone. And I was rubbish at cooking and cleaning, which, at the time, left me with precisely one marketable skill.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how did you get involved in the story?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They brought me and my twin sister along to... service them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds awful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That wasn't the worst of it. The young doctor, called Seward in the novel, brought the latest wonder drug with him: cocaine. What he didn't know, of course, was the effect of cocaine on a man's... <i>capabilities,</i> let's say. It also made them short-tempered, which made them more inclined to take out their frustrations on my sister and myself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Needless to say, when they finally reached Castle Dracula, they were hardly in a fit state to take on the King Vampire. The Englishmen and the Texan died quickly. Van Helsing survived by turning tail and running. My sister and I were freed, and we welcomed the Dark Gift when our time came.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It sounds like I would have, too.\" I changed the subject. \"What can you tell me about werewolves?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Werewolves? Werewolves and vampires fought bitterly for centuries. Now, though, we have a truce in place, the better to safeguard the Masquerade. If you see any werewolves, leave them alone, unless they attack you. That's all you need to do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How will I know them?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll know them by sight and scent, as they will know you.

To my surprise, it was Tasha.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce we were on our way, she said, \"So you're a cab driver, now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're a waitress,\" I replied. \"How's the food? Tourists are always asking for recommendations.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The food is wonderful,\" she said, \"and I'm not just saying that because they pay me the medium-sized bucks. For people of more modest means, give Manganiello's a try.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she changed the subject to what had been on her mind since we saw each other at the movies. \"How long have you been a vampire?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You remember graduation night, when I went off to dance the night away? I snuck into this underground rave, four guys bit me, and I woke up in the morgue.\" With the ice broken, I asked, \"When did you become a werewolf?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Prom night,\" she replied. \"The guy who took me wanted to dance with someone else, so I went home early. I was walking through the park, and I saw this beast eating somebody. It attacked me, and I used my pepper spray on it. It ran off, but not before it bit me. As I recovered, I realized I was going through some changes. Then this guy shows up, says he's a werewolf, and he was the one who attacked me, so now <i>I'm</i> a werewolf, too.\" After a pause, she asked, \"What do I look like to you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Truth? You're covered with fur, and you smell like an animal. What do I look like?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like death warmed over, and you smell even worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe drove in silence for a while, then I said, \"I envy you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You envy me? What for?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can walk in the sunshine like it's no big deal. You can eat food. You can have children. All that was taken away from me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can run around every night of the month. No matter when, you always think like yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Twilight</i> made us look stupid.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Trust me, <i>nobody</i> looked good in <i>Twilight</i>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs we pulled up to her house, I asked, \"Would you like for me to make sure you get in safely?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not necessary. Thanks for the ride.\" She tipped me $10.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I hope your car is out of the shop soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My car is fine,\" she said with a smile. \"But you and I got to talk this way.\"</span></div></div>",

But, just like I'm not that fertile that any physical contact will get me pregnant, I'm not that fragile, either. And even if it goes bad, I've got to go through that, too. Just like you had your rough patches with Brad. How many arguments did you have with him over the years, over what he did when he wasn't with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Too many,\" I replied, remembering them all. Eventually, I learned to accept that there were things Brad couldn't tell me, but that didn't mean he was cheating on me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then I remembered something Tasha had mentioned in passing, about a thrall to werewolves who was dating a vampire.

Eventually, I came across this underground rave and snuck in. I met a guy, we had some pleasant conversation, then he drugged my drink.

The next thing I know, I'm in the morgue, waking up just in time to interrupt my own autopsy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you working for me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shrugged. \"I needed a job where I wouldn't have to show up before the sun went down, or stick around after the sun came up.

Is my being a vampire going to be a problem?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed. \"When you walked in, I had my doubts. Some kid, still wet behind the ears, walks in and wants to drive? I literally expected you to either quit within a week or just stop showing up. But you stayed with it. You proved you were reliable, and I haven't had anybody complain about you. If I let you go, I'd have to be batshit. No offense.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None taken. So we're good?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe checked her watch. \"You're running late.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry.

Keep your nose out of other people's business, while you still have one leg.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Watch it, buddy,\" I said. \"If you'll tear yourself away from yourself, you'll notice the glyph on my friend's neck. That's right, he works for the master vampire of New York City, and you just threatened to harm him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat made an impression on him. \"Sorry, gentlemen,\" he said. \"This guy's been leading me on a chase, and it's getting on my nerves.

His name's Dennis Dugan, and he skipped out on his bail. He's been able to dodge me for a while, and I'm getting tired of it. If any of you see him, let me know. It's worth $500 to me.

Those who know of us hunt us so the less people know of you, the better.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why did you do this to me?\" Tearing up, I asked. \"Why me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why not?\" Flatly, Micah countered. \"I could have simply allowed you to figure it all out on your own and I still can. For your sake, I suggest you listen.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed though I had a thousand questions. \"I'm listening...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You will either become a vampire like myself or a 'half-dead' which is basically vampire/human hybrid.\" Serious, Micah explained. \"Either way, only blood will stay down. Animal blood will do in a pinch, but you will find the taste most unsatisfactory. That, and it will not sustain you quite as long as human blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why does the sun hurt?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Being undead, you no longer have any resistance to UV radiation, you will sunburn and then burn rather quickly.

Then, I spoke in a tone deeper than I ever thought I could achieve. \"Touch my family and I will hunt you all...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a long pause before Micah replied, \"Your will and nerve are far stronger than I had anticipated, interesting....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, he ended the call.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I said all that, every word!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is no going back, once you become a dhampir, Janelle Lee.\" Serious, Blackwell said. \"Try to understand that it is likely only a matter of time before your sister will become one as well, despite your father's careful precautions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What will happen to Dad?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He will be held accountable, but his punishment is of his own creation.\" Patiently, Finola said. \"He must teach you and, if necessary, Courtney the way of the dhampir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He must also consider confessing to his wife.\" Darkly, Llewellyn said. \"Many pure-blood vampires consider dhampir to be a subspecies. Thus, she will become a target, if word were to get out that she had married one, let alone spawned two more.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad seemed dead to the world at that point, not responding to anything, but Finola was not giving him any pity or mercy. \"You knew the risks when you decided to deny and cast out who and what you were, for the woman you fell in love with.\" Serious, she said. \"Now, you must face the consequences of that decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What of me...\" Sadly, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinola sat down on the bed next to me. \"You mentioned that you had a lot of questions.\" Patiently, she said. \"Let's go over them, one at a time.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I have heard stories of female vampires mating with male humans but they are very rare.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced, thinking of Brad. \"I have a boyfriend named Brad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinola nodded. \"We know.\" Calmly, she said. \"First, neither female dhampirs or vampires will ever carry children, as their need for blood to sustain them will literally starve any child that may be conceived within them.\" She placed a reassuring hand onto my shoulder. \"Only one in a billion actually survive long enough to be born, they are the true blood vampires.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped at that. \"And second... ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Second, there is always the off chance that the passion of intercourse will lead you into draining your lover dry.\" Serious, Finola replied. \"This is why female vampires are often referred to as 'black widows'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, uncertain if I should continue seeing Brad, or even letting him and my friends know I am still alive. Then, I asked, \"Am I immortal?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You have what is called Nigh-Immortality.\" Calmly, Finola said. \"Dhampirs do not age at the same pace humans do, but they are immune to disease. Still, they are not true immortals, and they can be killed much more easily than a true vampire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How long will I live, then?\" worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are two answers to that question.\" Serious, Finola said. \"If you remain a dhampir all your life, you will live up to about four hundred years. If you are completely turned, you will become immortal with the normal weaknesses of a true vampire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unlike vampires, dhampirs are less affected, but not immune to the sun.\" Patiently, Finola said. \"They are allergic to silver, but holy implements...\"  She smiled. \"Those are mere folklore, stories to make children feel more secure in the presence of the church.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mentioned if I were fully turned...\" Wincing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinola nodded. \"You can become a full true vampire if you give in to bloodlust.\" Serious, she replied. \"This is the goal of certain vampires who discover a dhampir, to convince them to embrace the dark gift.\" She raised a finger of warning. \"If you wish to hang on to what little humanity you have left, do not fall to bloodlust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have met humans who are monsters.\" Sadly, I countered. \"Humanity is a relative term.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlackwell smiled. \"Well put, child.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Courtney entered my bedroom and froze, seeing three strangers, with me and Dad looking pale and sick. \"Um... did I come in at a bad time?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, dear child.\" Patiently, Finola said. \"You are just in time.\" She briefly introduced herself and her colleagues. \"I was explaining to Janelle what is like to be a dhampir... that is what you are as well. Does this frighten you, child?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney shook her head. \"Not really.\" Honestly, she said. \"I read all about vampires in many, many novels. I even wrote a poem about them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe handed Finola a piece of paper. Upon reading it, a hint of a smile touched the corners of her mouth. Llewellyn and Blackwell also gave hints of a bemused smile upon reading the poem as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div class=\"bquote\">The vampire looked down on the city below.<br>\r\nHe was once like them, fearful, but did not know.<br>\r\nMost of his kind do not kill those whom they choose to feed.<br>\r\nThey give a cure to what ails them for the blood they need.<br>\r\nHe was near dead when the vampire gave him the dark gift.<br>\r\nRevealing they are dark guardians gave him a lift.<br>\r\nVampires stand guard when the skies turn black.<br>\r\nWhen things go bump in the night, they are the ones who bump back.</div><br>\r\n  <br>\r\n\"Your innocent arrogance is refreshing, child.\" Bemused, she said. \"May I assume you read all about vampires in romance novels?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney seemed confused by the question. \"Yes, why...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinola shook her head. \"Forget everything you think you know, child.\" Softly, she warned. \"There is a dangerous difference between fantasy and reality.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

For a moment, I thought he was going to walk out on me, only he surprised me with a deep, passionate kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shortly after graduation, my grandfather and father led me out to our hundred acre forest summer home where I met a pack of werewolves.\" Ruefully, he explained. \"It seems my entire bloodline are Lycan thralls.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finola told me you were one.\"  wincing, I said. \"She's with...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The vampire cleaning crew.\" Calmly, Brad interrupted. \"Her twin sister, Aoife, leads the werewolf cleaning crew, with my father, Slade, and his partner, Cain.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you know...?\" surprised, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad shook his head. \"I did not know you were a dhampir, but I did know you were attacked by rogue vampires.\" Serious, he said. \"I thought they had killed you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did your family become Lycan thralls?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad sighed. \"Long story short, our ancestors took sides in the war between the two powers, and offered King Lycaon and his great pack safe hunting grounds in exchange for their protection.\" Calmly, he said. \"These days, we help maintain the Masquerade.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who...?\" confused, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"King Lycaon.\" Serious, Brad said. \"The brutal ruler of ancient Arcadia, and the first werewolf.\" He sighed. \"He is just as immortal as Dracula, but legends state that he cheats to achieve this. Werewolves live very long lives, but they are not immortal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Something tells me I don't want to know...\" Wincing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No one knows how he cheats death.\" Serious, Brad replied. \"Many werewolves have obsessed over discovering the secret, but none speak of what they find...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sensed Brad was feeling uncomfortable so I changed the subject. \"Where does all of this put us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad smiled. \"Well, as long as I am dating a dhampir, I will not be inducted into the pack anytime soon.\" Calmly, he replied. \"However, I can assure you that no rogue, vampire or otherwise, will threaten you again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe kissed me again and, before long, we were making love on my bed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When the sun went down, Brad asked if he could take me out somewhere. Of course I agreed. I had my fill of blood, then put a few bags in a cooler to go out on my first date with Brad since the night I became a dhampir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Be home before dusk.\" Serious, Dad ordered. \"Don't make me come looking for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad smiled. \"You sound like my dad.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad smiled back. \"Good fathers think alike.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad led me to his car, a sleek black custom-built muscle car. He had built it from the ground up, with all the best parts from the best vehicles. It was one of the things I admired in him. He built what he needed, rather than settling for what was offered in the markets. \"Where are you taking me?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To meet the family.\" Calmly, Brad said. \"Them, and a friend who might need advice from someone who knows how it feels to be violated.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another victim of a rogue vampire?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad shook his head. \"It's... Tasha Lyall.\" softly, he explained. \"She was the victim of a rogue werewolf, though not directly.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, not directly?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad sighed. \"King Lycaon had ordered the death of a woman who threatened the masquerade.\" Darkly, he said. \"Tasha was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and was attacked, only she was ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Her pepper spray.\" softly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad nodded. \"She survived, but, because of it, she is now a werewolf.\" Softly, he said. \"What is troubling is that this latest order has both sides questioning King Lycaon's sanity and fitness to lead the packs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I see...\" Worried, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad was silent after that, driving me out of town and into the dark forest of his hundred acre property. Looking out, I found that the forest would be in near complete darkness even during the day. <i>\"I can see why people call this the midnight forest.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe drove for what seemed like an eternity before Brad stopped in front of a large cabin where a woman who looked much like Finola was waiting with two tall, muscular men. Behind them was a large number of muscular men standing in a neutral pose. \"Your... pack?\" Nervous, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrad nodded. \"They wanted to meet you.\" Calmly, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly stepped out of the car, with me cautiously following. \"I had a feeling you would bring her here, buachaill.\" Flatly, the woman said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The pack was curious to know her, Aoife.\" In the same tone, Brad replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... is everything okay?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just setting up boundaries.\" Calmly, Brad said. \"Both cleaning crews are very wary of vampires and werewolves meeting each other.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is for the best that both sides avoid each other, and do not trespass upon their occupied territories.\" Calmly, Aoife said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" Nodding, Brad said. \"However, Janelle was invited, and you were informed of the meeting.\" He smiled. \"Had you disapproved, Finola would have intercepted us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We do not disapprove.\" Starting me, Finola said. \"We are, as you said, wary of this meeting... anything can go wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janelle...?\" Timidly, a familiar voice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to find Tasha Lyall emerge from behind Aoife and her two associates. \"Tasha.\" Nodding, I replied. \"You look well...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You look like death warmed over.\" Wincing, Tasha said. \"Sorry, but you smell worse.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get used to it.\" Wincing back, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTasha and I slowly approached each other, then, in a surprise move, we hugged each other, crying on each other's shoulders.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I saw a werewolf eating a woman, and got bit trying to get away from it.\" She blushed. \"Turns out he has a crush on me... You...?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"After graduation... I went out to dance the night away and well, stumbled upon an underground rave.\" Softly, I replied. \"I got feasted on by four vampires, and, well, now I'm one too.\" I shrugged. \"I'm taking an apprenticeship to learn to be a private investigator, likely for the cleaning crew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll soon be starting as a waitress and work my way up to being a chef.\" With a slight smile, Tasha said. She sighed as a boy I recognized as Colin Channing cleared his throat. \"Janelle, this is the pack... they wanted to meet you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teenage boys and girls walked up to me and sniffed before giving me a slight bow and walking away. The last one to sniff me spoke. \"I am Randall Woolsey.\" Calmly, he said. \"As you are a friend to Tasha, we wanted to know your scent, so as not to confuse you for a trespasser or threat should you decide to visit her.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just make certain you announce your visit before coming.\" Serious, Aoife warned. \"Werewolves can be rather impulsive when surprised.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As can vampires...\" Calmly, Randall said. \"So be certain you announce your visits to Janelle in advance as well, Tasha.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTasha and I both nodded, and I was escorted back to Brian's car. He did not speak until we were out of the forest. \"It is rare for a vampire and werewolf to have a relationship.\" Softly, he said. \"Do not be surprised or hurt if it does not last long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean...?\" wincing, I asked. \"If they wanted me away from them, why did they want to... sniff me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To avoid a re-spark of the war over turned friends.\" Calmly, Brad replied. \"Expect many vampires to try to talk you out of ever seeing her again. i have no doubt the pack is telling Tasha the same thing.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"But why...?\" confused, I demanded. \"I- I don't understand.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is a reason the two powers avoid each other.\" Darkly, Brad replied. \"The war never really ended... they have no treaty, just a mutually beneficial cease fire.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He nodded at me, then led me to his car, a modified 1933 Straight eight. \"It's not exactly top of the line, but it will give any sports car a good run for its money.\" Serious, he explained. \"I had modified it further to ward off certain attacks since joining the cleaning crew.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where do we start?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We start at the mall.\" Calmly, Mike said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis surprised me. \"What...? Why there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Before I teach you how to be a detective for the cleaning crew, you need to know and understand how people tick.\" Serious, Mike replied. \"You will catch on soon enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, Mike drove me to the local mall which was open late most nights. We both walked into the main hall then just stood there, watching the people walk by. At first, I did not get what any of it had to do with detective work, until Mike pointed out a young couple walking by. \"Take a quick close look at that lovely couple there.\" Whispering, he said. \"What is the first thing that strikes you as odd?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked at the man and woman as they passed and whispered, \"There is a strange tattoo on the side of her neck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike nodded. \"Good eye.\" Calmly, he said. \"She is a thrall, a servant to a vampire. But, what you did not notice is that the man had a tan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's not a vampire, but a human.\" Worried, I whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain, Mike nodded. \"This could mean several things.\" Calmly, he said. \"From being seduced for information, to this being his last night on Earth, at least as a human.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do we investigate?\" Curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike shook his head. \"We do not investigate anyone, human, vampire or werewolf, unless so ordered by the cleaning crew.\" Calmly, he replied. \"Try to remember that I'm only human. I can only match another human alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike and I spent the next few hours watching people with him, pointing out subtle details that were warning signs that they were either vampires, werewolves, or humans up to no good. It was near midnight when Mike suddenly grabbed my arm and roughly pulled me behind an advertisement wall. \"What...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut up!\" Harshly, Mike whispered. \"Don't move a muscle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike's sudden change in demeanor startled me into obeying, and I froze like a statue, with his iron grip on my shoulder. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a tall man wearing all black, including his boots, with a long black jacket over it all. He had long, matted brown hair under a  brown cowboy hat that hid much of his face. Still, I could see that it was very tan, windburned with a number of scars. As he turned my way, I caught a glimpse of his eyes. They were black, cold and calculating, reminding me of a dark pit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he had passed and walked deeper into the mall, Mike cautiously pulled me out from behind the advertisement wall and nudged me towards the door. \"We are done here for the night, Janelle.\" Serious, he said. \"Get back to the car as fast as you can, I will be with you in a moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who... who was that?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike answered with a glare that would have turned my blood cold it it weren't already that way, and I ran for the car. I was there almost in an instant, and felt somehow relieved once I was inside its armored interior. Mike joined me a moment later, then sped away from the mall, before grabbing a cellphone and dialing a number.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finola,... Victor Van Helsing is on the prowl again.\" Serious, he said. \"Target unknown. I am taking the apprentice home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Negative, Sutherland.\" Calmly, Finola replied. \"Bring her to the office. I will arrange for the rest of her family to join us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Care to tell me what happened?\" Darkly, Mike demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Victor is the last of the clan.\" Gravely, Finola replied. \"Someone has murdered his family... we need to solve this case, before he goes on a killing spree to avenge them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike sighed. \"Understood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the call ended, and Mike turned to me. \"Just one rule, kid.\" Softly, he said. \"Once inside the office, remain calm... for your own good.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Finola was hoping they would simply peacefully die out from old age, but this changes things.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any ideas who killed his family?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike shook his head. \"The line starts with Dracula and goes around the block, twice.\" Serious, he replied. \"It was only the Masquerade that was preventing them from being directly targeted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, we arrived at a modern office complex, where Mike drove into an underground parking area before parking and stepping out.

Finola prefers a stress-free environment in her dwellings.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, and Blackwell hit a twenty-digit code on a panel. The elevator took us several levels underground, to a spacious, well decorated office. There, I saw my mom, dad, and Courtney passed out on three couches. \"They are merely asleep.\" Calmly, Finola said. \"When they awake, we will explain the situation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Does Mom know about... us?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinola nodded. \"She knows... she had been studying our kind since childhood and, like Mr. Sutherland, has a nose for finding us.\" She allowed herself a soft giggle. \"It was her who proposed, knowing who and what your father was.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis surprised me, but, upon realizing what it meant, I smiled, revealing my own fangs. \"That is a relief.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinola nodded the motioned me to follow her. \"The city you were born in rests upon an extensive underground cave system.\" Calmly, she said. \"This is where we go to sleep during the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked out a window, expecting nothing and was shocked to find what could only be an underground city. \"Curiouser and curiouser,\" Stunned, I muttered. \"How deep does the rabbit hole go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How deep indeed.\" Nodding, Finola said. \"These hidden cave systems are among our most closely guarded secrets.\" She looked me in the eye. \"I am trusting you, Janelle Lee.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Out of anger, he slaughtered the entire pack, to make them serve as an example...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only it had the opposite effect.\" Softly, Blackwell said. \"It enraged the entire werewolf community, and their revolution began.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was enough to pull us humans into the fray, turning it into a war of three armies.\" Gravely, Mike said. \"It lasted for nearly a century, an era you know as the Dark Ages.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was not until the beginning of the Italian Renaissance that both powers agreed to a cease fire and begin the Masquerade.\" Serious, Finola said. \"It has been an uneasy peace ever since.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Janelle Lee, you can see why we need this friendship to not only last, but to strengthen, and build the foundation of a more stable peace.\" Calmly, Blackwell said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I understand.\" Nodding, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinola smiled. \"Good girl.\" She then turned to the others. \"Now then, what can we do about Mr. Victor Van Helsing?\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It will be dawn soon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will talk to your family when they awake.\" Calmly, Mike said. \"However, until this meeting is over, you and your family must stay here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I will arrange for sleeping quarters.\" Calmly, Finola said. \"My thralls will see to your family's needs for the day.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, I was escorted to an ordinary bedroom with no windows. \"Sleep well, Janelle Lee.\" Softly, Mike said. \"I will wake you at dusk.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Instinctively, I threw off the sheets and ran out to find Courtney screaming with her hands shaking and two pearl white fangs slowly growing in her mouth. \"It hurts! It hurts!\" Screaming, she cried.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned to Finola, my eyes demanding an explanation. She merely pointed to my father, who had a trembling young man off the floor by the throat on the other side of the room. \"Give me one reason not to drink you dry!\" Enraged, Dad roared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Honest mistake...\" Gasping for air, the man said. \"Forgive me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad grunted and literally threw the man like a rag doll across the room into one of the couches, before giving an unnatural hiss like scream. Blackwell and Llewellyn moved in and restrained him as Finola then approached Courtney who had fainted. I walked up to her, fearful, and turned to Mom, who was frozen in a state of fear. \"What you have just witnessed is the first stage of bloodlust.\" Softly, she said. \"The unrestrained rage of a dhampir.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You mean Dad... ?\" gulping, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinola shook her head. \"No, he did not drain him.\" Calmly, she said. \"Still, this man's life as a thrall is over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to Courtney?\" Wincing, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This thrall mistook her for an awakened dhampir, and left her real blood wine to drink.\" Calmly, Blackwell explained. \"Being half awake, she accepted it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was the first part of the catalyst.\" Serious, Llewellyn added. \"The second was her desire to be like you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the end... she got her wish.\" Darkly, Finola said. \"Only being awake and alert for the transformation, it is excruciatingly painful.\" She sighed, eyeing the thrall. \"When she wakes up, she will need blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed, seeing the thrall turn white. He and I sensed that his fate had been sealed. Only Finola walked off, returning shortly with a bag of blood and a drink. She gave me the bag of blood, then handed the man the drink. \"Take it.\" Sternly, she ordered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHesitantly, the man drank the drink, and soon passed out. Another thrall then dragged him away. \"He will remember nothing.\" Softly, she said. \"He will wake up with a scar where the tattoo was, and no memory of his past... a clean slate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is the price of being kicked out.\" Darkly, Blackwell said. \"An inescapable void of who you are and where you are from in a place where no one knows you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A fate worse than death.\" Whispering, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinola nodded. \"This punishment is not given lightly.\" Serious, she said. \"Only those who ruin the life of another have their lives ruined.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I winced seeing her bleeding from every orifice and turned to Finola, who gave a solemn nod. \"When a dhampir awakens, he or she bleeds almost completely dry, another reason the transformation is so painful.\" Serious, she explained. \"Consider yourself fortunate.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon closing the door, I gently placed Courtney onto the bed and thrust a straw through the bag of blood, just as her eyes began to flicker open. They were blood red, just like mine were when I first awakened. She gave out a muffled scream of pain, her hands still shaking. I gripped her hand and thrust the bag of blood under her nose with my free hand. Courtney sniffed the bag then turned to me, shaking, her eyes filled with both uncertainty and desperation. \"Drink it.\" Firmly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking and in tears, Courtney took the bag of blood and took a sip. After that, she drew the blood in as if she were starved for anything liquid. Upon finishing the bag of blood, she wiped her mouth clean and turned to me as I still held her hand. \"What's happening to me, sis... I'm hurting so bad...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI felt pity for my little sister and forced a smile. \"You have awakened as a dhampir.\" Softly, I explained. \"Only the transformation is excruciatingly painful, and you were awake for it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That drink I found when I woke up...\" Crying, Courtney said. \"Did I do something wrong to be punished like this?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head. \"No, one of Finola's servants mistook you for an awakened dhampir and left you real blood wine instead of fruit juice.\" Calmly, I replied. \"He has paid for that mistake in spades.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So,... what now?\" Still trembling, Courtney asked. \"I still have school to go to.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not anymore.\" Sadly, I said. \"You will be home schooled now, with everyone being told you got the same condition of photosensitivity I have.\"  I sighed. \"Like me, you will only be able to drink blood, and will not be able to walk out in the sun.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"None of my novels prepared me for this.\" Shaking, Courtney said. \"I am so throwing them all away when I get home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI managed a smile. \"Truth is stranger than fiction.\" Calmly, I said. \"At least you didn't have four disgusting boys sucking on you like a meat lollipop.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney gave a hiccup-like laugh before asking, \"Did anything happen to Mom or Dad? Are they okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI winced. \"Dad went completely postal, and almost drank the one responsible dry.\" Softly, I replied. \"Mom is terrified... bloodlust.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney sighed. \"Is she scared of us?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she is more scared of Dad's rage.\" honestly, I said. \"Frankly, so am I, and I would not be surprised if it scares him too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney was silent for a moment before knotting her jaws. \"Then I guess the first thing we need to do is to calm Mom down, so she can calm Dad down.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, the first thing you need to do is rest.\" Serious, I said. \"I will bring you another bag of blood, and then we can talk about converting a bedroom for you in the basement.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney opened her mouth to protest but I was not about to give her the chance. \"You are weak right now, I don't want to see you get hurt any worse.\" Firmly, I barked. I pointed at her. \"Stay in here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlbeit reluctantly, Courtney nodded, and I walked out to find Dad sitting in a chair, with a furious look on his face, with Blackwell watching over him. \"It would be in your best interest if you avoided eye contact.\" Calmly, he said. \"Your father is unstable at this time, he could cross the threshold before too long.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped, then turned to Finola, who was consoling Mom on the other side of the room, with Llewellyn at her side. \"Are you going to turn me?\" Trembling, Mom asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That would be inappropriate.\" Serious, Finola replied. \"While it is true you are aware of our existence, you are the wife of a dhampir who may soon become a true vampire. Fate will decide if you turn or not.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom nodded, her eyes turning dead, as she turned to me. \"What am I to do, Janelle?\" Crying, she asked. \"I feel so lost right now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI walked up to Mom, and knelt by her side. \"You are the mother of two dhampirs, one of whom needs your strength more than ever.\" Softly, I said. \"You are more than a mere human, I think you know that, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinola raised a single eyebrow, to which Mom sighed. \"It's just a family legend, it means nothing...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Vampires and werewolves are 'legends', Mrs. Lee.\" Calmly, Finola said. \"What is this family legend, and why have I not heard any whispers of it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some secrets are best kept secret.\" Serious, Mom said. \"However, now that the cat is out of the bag, I was adopted and given the maiden name of Jones, but my true maiden name is...\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I threw Mike a questioning look, only to be given an almost sinister grin. \"I want you to read and memorize every last page, young lady.\" Smiling, he said. \"Knowledge is the key to power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're joking, right?\" Scoffing, I said. \"Do you have any idea how long it will take for me to memorize all of this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dhampirs live up to four hundred years.\" Calmly, Mike said. \"You have the time.\" His grin returned. \"You must learn patience before moving on to the actual studies.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that said, Mike quietly left the room. Judging by the grin on his face, I knew he was enjoying this. I turned to the huge stack of books and sighed. Only upon opening the first book, I realized that I had read the entire first page by merely glancing at it, and turned to the second, only to learn that I had read that just as fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What...?!\" confused, I blurted out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo my surprise and inner delight, I had read the entire book in less than a minute. What was more surprising was that I could recite the entire book, page for page, as if I had read it a thousand times. As I moved from book to book, I realized a new power of the vampire. Speed reading and instant memorization. \"This is incredible!\" Smiling, I said to myself. \"At this rate, I'll be done in a half hour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI moved through the books at an impressive rate, and was done in half an hour, as I had predicted. As I closed the last book, Mike walked in, smiling. \"I take it you found that you can speed read as a dhampir.\" Calmly, he said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was incredible.\" Smiling, I said. \"I didn't know I had it in me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"One of the many powers of the vampire and dhampir.\" Calmly, Mike said. \"Now that you had memorized all of the books, you are ready to move on to the basics.\" He became serious. \"The advanced classes are more, shall we say... involved.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Worried, I asked. \"More books...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Speak with authority!\" Firmly, Mike snapped. \"You are a dhampir, and the direct descendant of Dracula himself, not a delicate human rose!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat irritated me, though I jumped slightly at his voice, and I snapped back, \"Even roses have thorns!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike scoffed. \"Then show them when you speak to me.\" Serious, he said. \"A dhampir and vampire are confident in all aspects of their lives.\" He sighed. \"A timid anything is not taken seriously in our line of work. You must show you have confidence in all that you do and say.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is all new territory to me.\" Pouting, i said. \"I'm at a disadvantage here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bullshit.\" Frowning, Mike said. \"I'm a mere human, and it only took the power of my voice to make you jump and tremble. The only disadvantage you have is your fear to apply your knowledge to break new grounds.\" He grinned and added, \"Grow a backbone... <i>little girl</i>!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow I was insulted. I bared my fangs with a hiss and, before I could stop myself, I blurted out \"I'll show you backbone...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike chuckled, surprising me. \"Finola was right about your potential.\" More kindly, he said. \"All it took was to put a fire under your ego.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What?!\" Taken back, I asked. \"I could have drunk you dry!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike shook his head. \"Book twenty, chapter four.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a thought, I gasped. \"You are a Legendary...?\" Stunned, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike nodded. \"I am... if you believe in that nonsense.\" Calmly, he said. \"According to Finola, I am the direct descendant of Galatea, an ivory statue brought to life by the Roman goddess, Venus.\" he chuckled. \"According to her, I could hold my own against any dhampir or werewolf, if I had to, but I have no intention to test that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which is why you are teaching me now.\" Softly, I said. \"Finola seems to be confident that you can handle us.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike grunted. \"Knowing how to face a vampire, werewolf, or powerful human in the books is a far cry from actually doing it in real time.\" Serious, he explained. \"I have taken on a rogue vampire, and let me tell you... once they grab hold, you are screwed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you survive?\" wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike smiled. \"The cleaning crew saved me.\" Calmly, he replied. \"They seemed impressed that I was able to ring the vampire's bells long enough for them to step in.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He drew in a breath and began... \"It was about three years back, then I was just as clueless as the rest of the world about the Masquerade. I was a hardcore private investigator, among the best in the business. Still, the police did not like anyone stepping on their toes, especially not anyone from the private sector. They kept a sharp eye on me, if nothing else to make my job difficult.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aren't you all on the same side?\" Confused, Courtney asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are supposed to be.\" Nodding, Mike replied. \"That's another story, though. I got wind of people's dogs and cats going missing in the city park. They were later found bled dry, presumably by some sicko who hated domesticated animals.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A vampire...?\" Curious, Courtney asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or werewolf...\" Wincing, I added.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If it were a werewolf, you would not have found anything other than some drops of blood and fur.\" Serious, Mike said. \"Only I had not considered that, then. I found grains of charred concrete in the matted fur of the dead animals, and guessed that they had been taken to a old building that had recently burned out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Did you find the culprit there?\" Softly, I asked. \"Who was it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike frowned. \"A little girl, no older than ten.\" Sadly, he replied. \"She was drained and left to die, by a mutual acquaintance of yours, Janelle.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gasped, then frowned, angry.  \"Micah...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike nodded. \"He will not be causing any further trouble, though.\" Darkly, he said. \"His greedy mistakes have caught the attention of the master.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dracula....\" Wide eyed, Courtney whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Micah has been shipped to Transylvania, where he will need to tread far more lightly if he wishes to remain alive.\" Serious, Mike said. \"Monster hunters are in far greater numbers there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to the little girl?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike sighed. \"Her name was Tia Storm. The poor child had no idea what she had become, and was far too innocent to drink from humans.\" Sadly, he said. \"Although it seemed impossible, I knew that I had met my first vampire.\" He chuckled. \"It's ironic, as I lived in a house that once belonged to the Van Helsing clan.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What did you do with her?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt this point, both Courtney and I were hanging onto every word, not wanting to miss a single detail of Mike's story as he continued. \"I convinced her to come with me, and I took her to my car, only I sensed we were not alone.\" Serious, he said. \"It is nothing a human gains at birth, it is something they develop, after years of being in dangerous situations... I knew we were not alone, and we were being watched.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Micah.\" Softly, Courtney said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I got Tia into the car and rushed to get in myself.\" Calmly, Mike said. \"The second I shut the car door, someone had landed onto the roof of the car.\" He frowned. \"It was Micah, though I did not know his name then. He looked down into the window with a sadistic smile on his face, baring his fangs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney took my hand, as if she were frightened, though I knew it was just her excitement from the story. \"Did you get out to fight him?\" Anxious, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike shook his head. \"He wasn't the first perp to jump onto my car.\" With a grin, he said. \"I hit the accelerator and took him for a ride. After hitting a certain speed, I threw the car into a spin and sent him flying into a building.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney winced, only I frowned. \"I doubt that slowed him down in the least.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Any normal human would have been too stunned to even move.\" Calmly, Mike said. \"Only I was dealing with a vampire, something I had never dealt with before. I rolled down the passenger side window as he got up, and let him have it in the shoulder with my .357 special. It knocked him back, but he only smiled more, and I knew conventional weapons were not going to cut it, so I hit the accelerator and hauled ass out of there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw...!\" Disappointed, Courtney wailed. \"I thought you fought him!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not finished yet.\" Serious, Mike said. \"I took her to my house, which no, you will not be visiting anytime soon. There, I got my less conventional weapons for nonlethal conflicts on other cases.  My favorite was a bo staff made of Schinopsis wood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of what...?!\" Confused, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The hardest wood on Earth.\" Calmly, Mike replied. \"The name comes from Spanish <i>quebrar hacha</i>, which literally means axe breaker.\" He sighed. \"Now, don't scoff, but I had to do a lot of my own doctoring back in the day, so I had some of my own donated blood on hand, in case I needed to give myself a transfusion. I gave her one of the bags to drink.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are hardcore....\" Stunned, Courtney said. \"They need to write a romance novel about your cases.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike cleared his throat, hiding a slight blush. \"I don't know about that, kid.\" Gruffly, he said. \"Anyway, Micah came calling, and I stepped out to face him with my bo staff. The little punk was fast, but he didn't know shit about fighting. Each time he tried to get past me, I got him with my staff. I even managed to clock him one, throwing him off of his feet...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm guessing that was when he got ahold of you.\" Wincing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike nodded. \"He got ahold of me, and I couldn't break his grip to save my life.\" Serious, he said. \"I could feel his hot breath on my neck, then he yelled out as if in pain, though I felt nothing. That was when the cleaning crew entered the scene. Seeing them, he released me, and I clocked him with the last of my strength, throwing him clear off me.\" He chuckled. \"I had somehow managed knock the bastard senseless.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney and I applauded, to which Mike shook his head. \"I got lucky.\" Calmly, he said. \"I was spent by the time Finola and her team arrived.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So they took Tia off your hands and made you join.\" Softly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike nodded. \"In a nutshell,... yeah.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened to Tia?\" Wincing, Courtney asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Finola adopted her.\" Simply, Mike replied. \"She is here, but she will not come out until she is ready.\" He smiled. \"Now then,... let's talk about putting you two to work.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

They just talked, and are now fast friends.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat only caused me to sigh. \"Which means they are now diplomats, too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAoife grinned. \"Precisely.\" She again giggled. \"That is, if Matt's first crush allows it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI could only shake my head.<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

It was the fact I knew how crazy a jealous girl can get when she even suspects she has competition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore driving home, I stopped at an old haunt, a coffee shop called Nouri's. Upon entering, I jumped slightly as I heard a chorus of voices calling out, \"Janelle!\" I looked about and smiled, seeing familiar faces from my old paper route. Upon finishing my route,  just after sunrise, I would always meet the same number of friendly cabbies in the coffee shop, to get myself a brew to stay awake at school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I saw that you had joined us cabbies.\" Smiling, a man wearing a turban said. \"Tired of the petty tips from customers?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled at the man.

He had brown crew-cut hair and green eyes, but the softest smile, that always seemed to put me at ease. \"So we heard...\" softly, he said. \"We have all learned the world is more than it seems.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to ask him what he meant, but I fell silent as he showed me a thrall glyph on his neck. I turned to Kaptan and he showed me the same tattoo, before turning to the barista. \"Give her the gore special.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um... I'm on a strict diet.\" Wincing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe barista chuckled. \"Why do you think this coffee house is in such an isolated location, colleen?\" In an Irish accent, he inquired. He handed me a steaming cup of a reddish coffee before smiling, showing a pair of fangs as he added, \"On the house.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gave a nervous smile. \"Th-Thank you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI carefully took a sip, expecting to vomit it right back up, only to find that the 'gore special' was blood with a hint of coffee for flavor. Surprised, I turned to the cabbies who nodded, smiling. \"This is a vampire run coffee shop?\" Surprised, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, we also serve regular customers, such as our local friendly paper girl.\" Kindly, a short but stocky man said. Blasko brushed his black hair aside, showing me the same tattoo, his hazel eyes watering slightly. \"Finola told us the news of you becoming an awakened dhampir, the moment you were rushed to the emergency room that fateful morning.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We cornered that cocky kid, Micah, the very next night.\" Serious, the barista said. \"The name is Finn... Finola gave me the dark gift over ten years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, you guys were looking out for me, even before all this happened.\" Tearing up, I said. I gave a grateful smile. \"Thank you, Blasko,... thank you all.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlasko waved it off with a scoff. \"Bah, we all considered you one of us the moment you first walked in, wearing that ridiculous bicycle helmet, three years ago.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI blushed at that, as the cabbies chuckled.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Albeit against my better judgement, I took Courtney along with me. We met at the old church ruins just outside of the city, which werewolves and vampires alike considered neutral ground. Any and all fighting between the two powers was strictly forbidden in such locations. The church ruins were a monument to a citywide fire disaster decades ago.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon meeting Tasha there, I spotted her little brother, Matt, nervously standing at her side, just as Courtney was beside me. \"I see they made you bring your sibling along too.\" Flatly, Tasha said. \"I guess they are part of the team.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I guess...\" sighing, I replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen we both said, in unison, \"You won't believe what I learned about my family...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe paused then gave a nervous giggle. \"You first.\" Nodding, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My mom and dad are berserkers.\" Softly, Tasha said. \"Descendants of legendary Old Norse warriors with insane speed, strength, and endurance.\" She paused, looking uncomfortable. \"They have been offered to join the pack on more than one occasion, but will only do so if they lose control.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is deep.\" Surprised, I said. I remembered reading Mom's many books on the paranormal. \"Berserkers were considered demons of war, incredibly skilled and dangerous warriors, associated with the god Odin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTasha nodded. \"Which makes me a berserker werewolf. I have to work on controlling my temper more than ever.\" She sighed. \"Your turn.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I learned that my mother is a psychic vampire, as in she feeds off of life energy of people, rather than blood.\" Quietly, I explained. \"She is also the granddaughter of Dracula... <i>The Dracula</i>.\" I gulped, feeling nervous. \"I'm almost expecting Courtney and me to be offered to cross the threshold any day...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That makes you his great-granddaughter.\" Gulping, Tasha said. \"That beats me...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI shook my head, hoping to make her feel more at ease and said, \"I don't know about that... I'm related to the Alpha vampire, your powers are the work of two gods.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe both paused and turned to Matt and Courtney, who had been silent all this time, to find them awkwardly smiling at each other, giving an occasional shrug or giggle rather than talking. To the casual observer, they looked like a good couple, but I sensed they did not see anything beyond friendship. \"Do either of you two have anything to add to this?\" Curtly, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt and Courtney jumped slightly and said in unison, \"We weren't doing anything...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is not what she asked.\" Calmly, Tasha said. \"Do you two have anything to add?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, he's cute... for a werewolf.\" Blushing, Courtney said. \"I would not mind having him as a friend...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMatt blushed. \"She is pretty... for a vampire.\" Shuffling his feet, he countered. \"Only, I already have a werewolf girl who likes me, and...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney responded with \"I said friend, not boyfriend.\" She scoffed. \"Typical boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTasha and I giggled. \"I don't think we have to worry about any love triangles here.\" Bemused, Tasha said. \"Courtney seems to just like my brother as a friend.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Agreed.\" Smiling, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>I'm glad a female werewolf had already gained interest in Tasha's little brother.</i> Relieved, I thought. <i>A love triangle could jeopardize the entire diplomatic effort.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnknown to us until later, Mom and Mrs. Lyall had followed us. They were having a conversation of their own, downwind of us, until...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Zooey, Mindy, and I attended with my little sister, Courtney, as we did every year before. Only my sister and I were finding the smell of the carnival food leaving much to be desired. We both carried our own little thermoses of 'type O' while taking in the sights and an occasional ride and game or two.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that Matt Lyall?\" Looking into the crowd, Mindy asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI turned just in time to see Matt kiss a small girl on the cheek and giggled. \"Yup...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fancy meeting you all here.\" Smiling, I said. \"Enjoying the carnival?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTasha nodded, giggling. \"We are, but not as much as Matt and Luna.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI smiled, seeing the two holding hands, then laughed as Luna threw Courtney a look of warning, pulling Matt closer to her. \"Mine!\" Sharply, she barked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCourtney laughed, raising both hands. \"He's all yours, kid.\" Bemused, she said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We heard you and Matt are werewolves.\" Quietly, Mindy said. \"Does it hurt when you, well,... change?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes and no.\" Wincing, Tasha replied. \"It hurts, but it's also a rush, like... sex.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's an interesting way to put it.\" Bemused, Susi said. \"It's accurate, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have so many questions...\" Wide eyed, Zooey whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As do we.\" wincing, Sarah said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You four can meet somewhere privately and discuss it later.\" Serious, Susi said. \"Just do not share what you know.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We've been warned.\" Gulping, Mindy said.

Then, I saw a large timber wolf at the edge of the forest, with its pack behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is nothing to be worried about.\" Calmly, Susi said. \"The wolf pack never leaves the safety of the forest. They howl every night before the full moon, to remind our pack it is nearly time to lock ourselves up for the night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's a relief.\" Smiling, Mindy said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, Luna ran up, looking worried and frightened. \"Mommy...

I think she had become attached to him, though not romantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreene called me shortly after dusk, worried about me. \"Is everything okay, kid?\" Firmly but kindly, he demanded. \"Nothing major, I hope?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tasha Lyall's little brother, Matt, has gone missing.\" Worried, I replied. \"He ran off to the calling of a timber wolf pack, and has not been seen since.\" I sighed. \"He is not with them, so he could be anywhere...\" I gulped. \"We found a small pool of his blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll tell the other cabbies to keep an eye out for the lad.\" Serious, Greene said. \"We don't need his parents going full on berserk looking for him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know about them...?\" Wincing, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Remember the great fire decades ago?\" Darkly, Greene said. \"A biker gang came into town and tried to burn everything down for being kicked out of the coffee shop... none of them were ever seen again, nor does anyone really talk about it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped, gaining a better picture of just how dangerous Tasha's parents could be, and why a non-interference pact was made with them through Finola and Aoife. \"Call Finola if you happen to see him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Will do, kiddo.\" Calmly, Greene said. \"We'll see you after the Fourth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs darkness fell, Finola and I entered the midnight forest again, keeping our senses sharp for any movement or noise that would tip us off of a werewolf nearby. \"Be on your guard, colleen.\" Serious, Finola warned. \"Most werewolves lock themselves up during a full moon, but some relish the hunt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe heard the werewolves howl from the Woolsey estate, then paused as we heard Matt howl back somewhere close.  The howls came again in a chorus, with Matt howling back, coming closer. \"Use extreme caution, colleen.\" Whispering, Finola warned. \"Werewolves lose nearly all of their cognitive thinking in wolf form.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI gulped before nodding, then paused as a wolf standing on its hind legs jumped out from behind some bushes with a bark... it was Matt. Finola pushed me behind her, but paused as a small red ball rolled towards her. She looked at the ball, then turned to Matt to find him on all fours, panting with an air of excitement. He gave another bark, ran in a circle, then barked again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's acting just like a wolf cub.\" Smiling slightly, I stated. <i>\"How cute...\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course...\" Smiling, Finola said. \"Being raised by wolves, his first transformation made him think much like one.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a bemused smile, she picked up the ball and gave it a light toss. Matt gave a happy bark and chased after the ball before returning it. Upon doing so, Finola handed Matt what looked like a doggy treat, which he devoured. Shortly after, he was fast asleep in a little ball at my feet. \"He's actually kind of cute like this.\" Calmly, I said. \"What do you think happened to him last night?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We had determined that he fell into a ravine and hit his head.\" Calmly, Finola replied. She motioned to the goose egg on Matt's head. \"He must have wandered around, dazed, then found himself here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI looked, then moaned. \"We should have guessed...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the cabin where Tasha and I had our first meeting.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Mike had tipped me $200 plus his fare before leaving me, and I went back to work. It was a rough night, to say the least. Most of my fares were young vampires, some with an unsuspecting human escort. To be fair, they were all gentlemen, but those alone had words for me regarding my talks with Tasha Lyall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them was a teenage girl I had heard of from detective Mike Sutherland. Her name was Abby Vamp. She was about a year older than me, with shoulder-length red hair and deep green eyes. She wore a strange school uniform I did not recognize, with a cloak too big for her covering it. I guessed she had borrowed it from her mother. Abby was well known for stirring up trouble among normal teenage boys. She would seduce them into doing all sorts of crazy things for nothing more than her own twisted amusement. I pressed a button near the fare counter, something Abby noticed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is an order for your capture, Vamp.\" Darkly, I said. \"You have about three minutes before detective Sutherland, or worse, the cleaning crew arrive and take proper action.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your precious cleaning crew is busy dealing with my two new little friends, who are right now visiting your werewolf friend.\" Grinning, Abby countered. \"Normal boys are annoying, but they are at least useful as a few minutes of distraction.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you want, Vamp?\" Ice in my voice, I demanded. \"I doubt it's a ride...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I want to know if you are really willing to decline the dark gift.\" Grinning, Abby said. \"You know there are many vampires who frown upon a dhampir being directly related to the dark lord, Dracula.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They also frown upon the dark gift being forced.\" Unimpressed, I said. \"The choice must be mine and mine alone.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There are many vampires who would see the dark gift forced upon Mr and Mrs Lyall to gain a foothold in their campaign to take Lycaon's throne.\" Frowning, Abby said. \"You need to think about what is right for your own kind.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My own kind...\" Annoyed, I asked. \"What do you mean by that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You are Tasha's best friend, perhaps the only friend she has.\" Grinning, Abby said. \"She listens to you. That said, if she takes the werewolf throne, the vampire world can take back what is rightfully theirs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I know where this is going.\" Becoming angered, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm running out of time.\" Stepping out, Abby said. \"Think about this, you know I am right. Your werewolf friend and her cub brother are the keys to making us rulers of this world again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, she was gone. I found I had to count to ten to control my anger, feeling my blood beginning to boil. Fortunately, my night was almost over, and I turned my cab in early, to Ham's surprise. \"Rough night?\" Softly, she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"Yeah but I got my usual quota in.\" Softly, I replied. \"I need a stiff drink...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What happened?\" Firmly, Greene demanded. \"Someone give you trouble?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"Abby Vamp is up to no good again.\" Frustrated, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI went on to describe the conversation, to which Kaptan chuckled. \"Good luck to her on that one.\" Bemused, he said. \"Only an experienced vampire can take on a berserker alone, and these two have the protection of the pack.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There is one other thing...\" Wincing, I said. \"Matt Lyall....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreene chuckled. \"Matt is known to run off in the middle of the night to the call of the timber wolf pack.\" Bemused, he said. \"He occasionally pops in at the coffee shop for a brew with his allowance.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know that.\" surprised, I said. \"Only I was told that...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, he's the Alpha Cub.\" Nodding, Blasko said. He grinned. \"Who do you think took him to the timber wolves when he was but an infant?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You guys...?\" Surprised, I asked...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGreene nodded. \"It was my first year as a thrall.\" Serious, he explained. \"Dracula himself ordered me to take the infant to a safe place, far away from the Van Helsing family, who had decided to gun for the werewolves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But why...?\" confused, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"To rekindle the war.\" Darkly, Ham replied. \"Vampires were hard pressed to fight a war on two fronts, as were the werewolves...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They wanted to get the humans back into the fray.\" Horrified, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Another reason why a peace treaty is more important than ever.\" Softly, Kaptan said.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Still, I would warn them to be on their guard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You be careful yourself.\" Serious, Tasha said. \"We both know from history class that where there is a king, there is one or more wanting to dethrone him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon ending the call, I sighed, sensing Finola appearing. \"I am doing what I believe is right for the peace effort.\" Serious, I said. \"Communication is key.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm not here to berate, colleen.\" Calmly, Finola said. \"In fact, I applaud your actions thus far. We are here to brief you on Abby Vamp.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How serious of a threat is she?\" Darkly curious, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Abby Vamp is was granted the dark gift seventy years ago by Akasha, the self proclaimed 'queen of the damned,' whom she killed shortly after.\" Serious, Finola explained. \"She is intelligent and manipulative, with a core hatred for werewolves, as they were seen as our servants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What am I to do if she approaches me again?\" Worried, I asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do not engage her unless you are forced.\" Serious, Finola replied. \"As the direct descendant of Dracula, you have strengths and powers you are yet unaware of.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I take it you do not want those powers to surface.\" Frowning, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Without proper training to control them, no.\" Frowning back, Finola said. \"It would be like allowing Tasha to unleash her berserker powers under a full moon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"How do we proceed from here?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You get some rest, then arrange your next meeting with Tasha.\" Calmly, Finola said. \"Both of you will be bringing your boyfriends along, to begin talks between the thralls of both powers.\" With that, she and her escorts were gone.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A simple test will prove who her biological father is without question.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMom sighed. \"The sun test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDad nodded. \"It is likely that Crystal was sheltered from the sun since birth.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Only I saw two fangs when she was angry... \" Confused, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All werewolves show fangs when they are angry.\" Calmly, Mom said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI sighed. \"I think I better bring this new information to Finola's attention.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It was as if he were part werewolf, though I was assured by Finola it was neither. Abby was standing outside of a small cemetery when we caught up with her. \"We need to talk, Abby D'Arcy.\" Flatly, Mike said. \"It would be wise of you not to run.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby scoffed. \"Why would I run from a mere mortal man?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMike gave an odd smile, which caused Abby to take a step back. \"You're not... ?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am.\" Flatly, Mike replied. \"I have already spoken to your father on this matter and he is very... displeased.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbby frowned. \"What do you want?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Information.\" Calmly, Mike replied. \"It's no secret that the last of the Van Helsing clan wants to rekindle the old war between vampires and werewolves. The question is, who roped you into the scheme?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Give me one reason why I should give you anything?\" Boldly, Abby demanded. \"My father is the one and only...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was about to speak only Mike spoke first, motioning to me. \"Her grandfather is Dracula, and her mother is the daughter of Carmilla Karnstein, his first wife.\" Ice in his voice, he interrupted. \"You are nothing but a spoiled rich girl who happens to be a vampire.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And the werewolf... ?\" Scowling, Abby demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTasha opened my mouth to speak, but Mike stopped her with a motion of his hand. \"You know very well that she is a berserker werewolf.\" Coldly, he said. \"She is the last girl any vampire with a lick of sense would wish to anger.\" He gave another odd smile. \"You really opened a can of worms talking Loveta into attacking her. Within a few generations, there could be an entire pack of berserker werewolves running amok.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTasha blushed at that though she tried to hide it. I hid a smile of my own, knowing where Mike was going with his questioning.

I went back to Nouri's, where I was greeted by the usual greeting, \"Janelle!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI giggled, then sighed, which brought more than a few raised eyebrows and curious looks. \"What has you out of sorts?\" Curious, Kaptan asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It would seem that one of the bikers who fell to Tasha's parents years ago got away.\" Darkly, I replied. \"An immortal named Vie Harris.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He's back in town?\" Raising and eyebrow, Finn asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"He's trying to rekindle the fight between the two powers.\" Frowning, I said. \"Apparently, that was his goal the last time he was here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So it's round two.\" Frowning, Greene said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded. \"Mike Sutherland wants him, and so do Tasha's parents.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You should have known you will eventually face a conflict of interests.\" Serious, Blasko said. \"Both powers want him, so it will be a race.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm going to need a drink.\" Sighing, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinn nodded and gave me a tall order of the gore special. \"Any idea of how you are going to handle this?\" Curious, he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could answer, a tall, dark man in a black business suit walked in and took a seat next to me. Ignoring the cold glares from the cabbies, he looked me square in the eye with a hint of a smile. \"Good evening, Miss Lee.\" Calmly, he said. \"My name is Vie Harris, and I would like to have a word with you, if I may.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cabbies did well to hide their surprise, as did I. \"My mentor, Detective Mike Sutherland, is more interested in a conversation with you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, yes, the immortal detective.\" Ruefully, Vie said. \"Our issues are rather... involved, but I am not here to discuss him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"State your business, immortal.\" Darkly, I said. \"Before I get thirsty enough for even your tasteless blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVie chuckled. \"You have your mother's temperament, I admire that.\" He then turned serious. \"I have lived long enough to know that a resistance left alone becomes a new empire, toppling the old. The werewolf empire is gaining strength, but I can help you topple that empire, by weakening it at its very foundation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was obvious that Vie was trying to manipulate me, but I found it comical, almost sad, that he did not know I was a part of the peace process. \"Keep talking.\" Softly, I said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVie smiled. \"I know the werewolf trying to manipulate the vampires into softening their position.\" Smiling, he said. \"She is the daughter of the king and queen of all berserkers, Tasha Lyall. She is young, inexperienced, and vulnerable.\" He chuckled. \"Clearly no match for the granddaughter of Dracula himself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's your plan?\" Frowning, I demanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can arrange for the two of you to meet at the masquerade festival, one day before the full moon.\" Darkly, Vie said. \"She will be at her weakest then, and you will be able to take her down swiftly, and gain the powers of the berserkers on top of your vampire strength through her blood.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had to bite my tongue to keep myself from laughing in the immortal's face. He clearly had no idea, and was almost literally giving himself to us. \"The festival will be filled with normals, immortal.\" Frowning, I pointed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVie smiled. \"True... but there will be plenty of distractions, so no one will raise an eyebrow at a girl dancing with the devil under the pale moonlight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI nodded, though I had no intention to follow his plan. Vie nodded back and casually walked out into the darkness of the night. After he was gone, I turned to Greene, who allowed a slight chuckle to escape his lips. \"This could be interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWe all shared a chuckle before I began to enjoy my gore special.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Also, how her family and friends deal with the new Janelle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, you've gotta have rules:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) I kill her in Chapter 1, so there's no need for you to kill her after that.<br>\r\n2) First person, past tense.<br>\r\n3) Remember proper spelling and punctuation.<br>\r\n4) Keep it PG-13. Nudity is fine. Strong language is okay, but don't go overboard. Sex is okay, but don't go into graphic detail.<br>\r\n5) Check out my other interactives to get an idea of what I do and what I find acceptable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that out of the way, let's dive right in.</td>",
