That last part wasn't what you were trying to say, but that's what came out, and not in your voice either.  \"What the flower is wrong with my voice?  I sound like a valley girl on downers.\"  You look down and realize that your voice is the least of your problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy Flowering Sherbert!  I'm a Flowering PONY!\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYep, it's true.  Your soft lavender body stretches out across the golden pile of straw, flowing to a cluster of pink daisy tattoos on your round marshmallow butt and ending with an impossible long and full horse tail that looks like a spun silver version of a Farah Fawcett wig, only less dignified.  You look around the unnaturally clean barn, past the strangely out of place heart-shaped hot tub to the girliest makeup table and mirror you ever saw in your life.  You get up somewhat unsteadily onto your brightly polished silver hooves and stumble over to the mirror, curious to see if your face matches your new body.  Unfortunately for you, it does.  \"Golly Flowering Daylight!!\"  A nauseatingly cute lavender pony head stares back at you with impossibly large lavender eyes, so big you wonder why they don't make a sound like two wet balloons being rubbed together when they move.  Your huge eyes have even larger eyelashes that curl out from under your drooping, purple-shaded eyelids.  Your mane is another silver Farah Fawcett wig, flowing down across your neck and alluringly down over your forehead, partially covering another pink Daisy tattoo, centered on a silver blaze that splashes down to the tip of your soft round nose.  The makeup table is crowded with a variety of perfume bottles and tortoise-shell brushes.  \"I wonder how I'm supposed to use this sherbert, if I don't have any flowering hands?\"  Then another thought occurs to you.  \"Am I as girly as I feel?\"  You dip your head down, trying to see if anything sticks down between your hind legs, but your soft round lavender belly is in the way.  Then you turn around, pointing your cute round ass at the mirror, lifting your silky tail and uncovering a soft puckering equine anus and just below it, a supple pouting vagina.  \"Oh, flower me....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, pony sister.  My name is Pony Daffodil.  What is your name?\"  Standing in the heart-shaped barn doorway is another pony, shaped identically to you, but with a sunshine yellow body and a pink flowing mane and tail.  She smiles sweetly, fluttering her long eyelashes as she waits patiently for you to answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My name is Pony Violet....No....Violet....Pony Violet....Daylight!\"  You try to say Bob, but your soft pouty mouth refuses to cooperate with you for some reason.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings, Pony Violet.  Are you a Pred, or are you Prey?\"  The sunshine yellow pony asks you innocently.  <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Where we indulge the wants and desires of all the hardworking ponies in Ponyville!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But- But I...\" You make to say something, but she cuts you off,<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure you must be confused, you see while most ponies here are born and raised in Ponyville, we have some who are from other places. Some people who slip through the cracks. We like to call them Outsiders. You probably just had a mishap that caused you to end up in our world instead of your own. But that's of no matter, you're Equestria public property now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean I'm public property?\" You object. You hardly want to be dumped into some strange land and forced against your will to serve these ponies!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, Our glorious goddess Princess Celestia instituted that law. Many ponies were upset that Outsiders would frequently show up and take Equestria born Pony's jobs or food, so at their request all Outsiders are rounded up and placed in the Pleasure House to serve as Fetish slaves. It's a wonderful institution, as ponies come to use your body for their personal whims, they donate money to government institutions! You help us build roads, and schoolhouses and parks. Isn't it great?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great? You're selling my flowering body against my will!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And it will be delightful!\" She walks around to your backside and slaps your rear with her hoof. \"You're still a virgin, aren't you? You're gonna have your cherry popped! Maybe even by the next pony who walks in here! I'm so happy for you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no way I'm going through with this! You can't make me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaffodil shrugged, and made for the door. She called over her shoulder, and in her chipper voice told you, \"Just so you know, if you DO choose to resist, this is a government funded operation. Meaning that going against us will be taken as an offense to Princess Celestia, the almighty. And FYI, she locked her sister in the moon for 1000 years just because she had a temper tantrum. So I'd be a nice little filly and get fucked.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the barn door slamms shut, and out of fear, you let out a cute little squeak. You're not sure how long you wait, but soon enough the barn door opens and another pony walks inside. It's....<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He wasn't sure what was going on.  The only thing he could remember is his name, Magma.  Dizzily, he got to his feet, and looked around.  He saw a giant grove of apple trees around himself, the name Sweet Apple Acres occurring to him.  He stretched, working the kinks out of his back, and confusedly walked towards the farmhouse, trying to remember things.  He vaguely recalled the names of the ponies (he was suddenly very sure that ponies are the ones that live here) that live here as Applejack, Big Macintosh, Apple Bloom, and Granny Smith.  He knocked on the door, rubbing his head, trying to clear the confusion. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGranny Smith pokes her head out, looking around confusedly.  She then noticed Magma and smiled..  \"Oh!  Howdy there young feller,\" she said.  \"You a cousin' o'Spike's?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe shook his head, frowning.  \"No, I don't think so,\" he said.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGranny Smith chuckled.  \"Well, if'n yer lookin' for Applejack, Apple Bloom, or Big Macintosh, they went into town.  Seems like everypony younger than me (not countin' Celestia and Luna o'course) got feelin' frisky n' gathered in Ponyville, mounting each other left and right,\" she said.  \"Me, ah'm content to just stay here and nap.  Ah'm too old fer all that sweatin' and stuff.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMagma nodded, and turned towards town.  He paused before leaving and said, \"...Would you like some company?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tGranny Smith chuckled, rubbing his head affectionately.  \"Aw, shoot, pardner.  That's right neighborly of you.  But naw, ah'm fine where I am.  Ah usually try to spend this time alone 'round this part o' the year anywho, thinkin' about my husband and my foals that died around this time.  Big Mac's, Applejack's, and Apple Bloom's folks they was, and mighty fine ponies at that.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"I'm sorry,\" Magma said frowning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\t\"Shucks,\" Granny Smith said.  \"Y'all didn't know.  Now go on, go into town.\"  She chuckled, and added, \"Frisky as everypony's feelin,' y'all might get some.  About the only ponies in town that ain't gettin' rutted is foals as young as the Cake twins or old nags like me.\"  She went back inside, muttering amusedly about 'frisky young people.'  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tMagma blushed a little.  He was starting to remember more names, and the idea of actually 'having some fun' with the locals was starting to sound appealing, even if he was confused as to why everypony would just start rutting at random like that.  And why he felt so blessedly hungry...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\tHe never noticed the long, slender figure behind and far above him, relaxing on a cloud of pink cotton candy, an amused expression on his face.  He wondered briefly how his 'experiment' would go, scooping some chocolate milk from the raincloud with a glass he manifested out of nowhere, and decided to just not think about it, letting the fun take its course...</span></div></div>",
