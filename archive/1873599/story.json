            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You feel a great warmth surrounding your body as you awake from your sleep. You notice your bed feels unusually hard as your consciousness returns, but then you realize that it is also covered with dirt. You open your eyes to see what the hell was going on, and you instantly think you must still be asleep, because you aren\u2019t in your bed at all. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTall golden trees surround you, and the is nothing underneath you but dirt. But as you look up, you see that these trees have no branches or leaves. That\u2019s because they aren\u2019t trees at all, they\u2019re grass. Somehow, you have shrunken greatly in size, like a grape left out in the sun. Judging by the height of the grass towering over you, you estimate yourself to be around two inches tall. Your sense of logic tells you this must be a dream, that\u2019s the only explanation there could possibly be. But if this was a dream, why is it so hot? The heat from the sun blazing in the sky seemed real enough to make you sweat. The ground begins to tremble slightly as you hear the surrounding grass rustle as though something very large were moving through it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA enormous shadow looms over you from behind. You are almost too scared to turn around to see what it is, until a blast of hot air hits you from behind, knocking you over onto your front. You immediately roll over onto your back, only to be staring into the face of a gigantic lion. It was apparently female due to its lack of a mane. It had golden fur covering its whole body, and a pink nose that continually blasted you with hot wind as it breathed. But there was something strange about the lioness. For one thing, it had long black hair in braids on top of its head like a human woman. It had hands instead of paws, with pads on the undersides and claws on the tips of each finger. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can only sit there, paralyzed, half in awe, half in fear. The lioness leans forward, pressing her nose against you, inhaling your scent. She licks you once, her pink, rough tongue sliding over your body, tickling you with her taste buds. Fear grips you as she licks her lips a few times. You pray that this beast doesn\u2019t decide to eat you. Finally, to your amazement, the lioness talks! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d You can\u2019t help but stutter in shock. \u201cI-I-I-I\u2019m a human.\u201d The lioness tilted her head in curiosity as she picked you up by your shirt between two fingers and plops back onto her rump, sitting like a human would. \u201cAre there anymore of you around here? Are you all so small?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPut me down and I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she places you in her palm, you get a look at the rest of her body. She wasn\u2019t like any other lion you had seen. She looked like a cross between a lion and human, an anthro, as you had heard such creatures called. Her torso was lean and sleek, perfect for running after prey. Her legs were shaped like a cat\u2019s, slanted slightly backwards for powerful springs and running, with regular paws for feet. A pair of medium sized breasts sat high on her chest, big enough to give her a feminine figure, but small enough so as not to slow her down. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo answer you questions, no, I have not seen any other humans around. I don\u2019t even know how I got here. Also, we are not supposed to be this small. As far as I know, I\u2019m dreaming all this, and will wake up any minute.\u201d The lioness smiles. \u201cI can tell you for a fact this is no dream. Since you\u2019re far too small to make a meal for me, and I couldn\u2019t just leave you out here to be stepped on, I\u2019ll bring you back with me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBack to where?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTo the others of course!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands up to her full height, and you can see that you were in the center of a vast savannah, stretching as far as the eye can see.  \u201cBy the way, my name is Kisha.\u201d \u201cJosh.\u201d You say as she places you on her shoulder and begins running like the wind. You are forced to hold onto her neck fur to keep yourself from falling off. Kisha may have been a lion, but she ran like a cheetah. At least the wind rushing past you helps cool you off after being in the sun all that time. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, Kisha comes to a stop at the mouth of a cave. As she enters, you can make out a light at the far end of the tunnel. As you get closer, you see a group of about thirty lions spread across a large chamber of the cave with a blazing fire in the center. You notice that there were about twenty adults, all female, while the rest were cubs, with maybe three of them male. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the lionesses approaches Kisha, clearly the leader of the group. Her fur was a darker tan than the rest of the lions, and her body was more muscular. Her torso was covered in several visible scars, some of which looked fresh. She was missing half her left ear, as well as her right eye, which was shut due to a large scar slanting across it. Her one good eye was shadowed with black fur and glowed neon green. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDid you find anything?\u201d Her voice was gruff and commanding. Kisha shhok her head. \u201cOnly this.\u201d She says as she plucks you from her shoulder and shows you to head lioness. \u201cDammit Kisha! You were supposed to bring back food for us! A gazelle, an antelope, a muskrat even! Instead you bring this\u2026thing\u2026that wouldn\u2019t even make a mouthful!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter chewing Kisha out for about ten minutes, the intimidating lioness went back to her spot in front of the fire. \u201cWho was that?\u201d You ask as Kisha sits down at the far end of the cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s Zena, the head of the pride.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s her problem?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIt was my turn to go hunting today, and I came back empty handed.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAren\u2019t lions supposed to be headed by a male?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe were. Zena\u2019s mate was our leader, but he was old and sick. Eventually he died, and the few males we have are far too young to lead us, so Zena took over. I don\u2019t think she likes you very much, so it might be best if you just stay away from her.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo what happens now?\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow\u2026.\u201d</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The mare beams down at you, though you can still see the barely hidden wonderment in her eyes.<br>\r\n\"Great! Would be a shame to have you just wander through my garden!\" She hesitates for a moment. \"Do you...\" she starts, \"do you mind if I pick you up? You can't really stay down there, I've still got some work to do.\"<br>\r\nNow that she mentions it, you notice the state of the ground around you. Though there is still a lot of the tall grass left, big piles of earth dot the landscape. They barely reach the mare's ankle but nonetheless dwarf you in size. When you look up to her again, you notice her leaning on a wooden sitck, ending in a dirty metal plate - a garden hoe. If she hadn't noticed you, this tool could have easily been your doom. You shudder at the thought of getting struck by it at your current size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe horse seems to be in the middle of getting her backyard ready for growing vegetables and you don't particularly fancy staying on the ground, while she works. You nod up to her and she smiles down at you again.<br>\r\n\"Good! I promise I'm going to be careful with you!\"<br>\r\nShe crouches down, reaching out and lays out her palm infront of you. You gulp. Her fingertips alone nearly reach your knees. As you try to step onto her hand, your foot sinks into her flesh and you stumble, barely catching your fall with your hands. You look up. She smiles at you patiently, though a little worried. A miracle, that she found you - and you're glad she did. Being on your own at this size... you don't even want to think about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou grip her finger again and pull yourself onto her palm. Having solid bone under your feet, you manage to balance your way down her hand, until you are in the center.<br>\r\n\"You should sit down.\"<br>\r\nYou do, and suddenly you feel as if you are riding an elevator going upwards way to fast. The sudden rush of air presses you into her palm and whistles in your ears. Rather than sitting, you instinctively throw yourself on the ground, gripping onto anything promising hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's over in a second. Still, you have to compose yourself for just a moment after rushing through the air at an -  to you - inhuman speed.<br>\r\n\"Oh, I'm sorry! I should have gone a bit slower - are you alright?\"<br>\r\nYour head stops spinning and you look up to her, nodding again. She smiles, reliefed.<br>\r\n\"Well, let's go inside. You look like you could use something to eat.\"<br>\r\nShe turns, slower this time, keeping her palm as till as possible. The first few steps nearly fling you face-down again, but you manage to keep your footing - though you do grab onto her fur a bit tighter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that you are off the ground, you can finally see your strange new surroundings. Below you is a giant patch of wild grass and hewn earth. It doesn't seem like a garden to you - more like a field. The furrows in the earth, which the mare must have been working on before she found you, stretch into all directions. Far away - at least you think so - trees seem to pierce the sky. Green hills roll in the distance. It's a nice day, barely a cloud in the sky.<br>\r\nThe only other thing you see, is a sturdy looking two-story house, with white walls, large windows, and a big, wooden terrace. A table sits in the center, surrounding by two big benches and a couple of chairs. A grill stands at the edge, a large, open sack of charcoal beside it. Finally, a glass door opens into the house - the mare heads straight towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCool air hits you, as you finally enter inside into a surprisingly modern looking kitchen. Another big table stands in one side of the room, the other being taken up by a large, L-shaped stone counter. Stove, oven, and sink take up one side, the other is clear, with only a bowl of various fruits and a cutting board lying on top.<br>\r\nThe mare sets you down onto the counter, right next to the fruit bowl. Despite her towering over you, you finally manage to get a good look at your saviour.<br>\r\nHer entire body is covered in fur, matted and damp by fresh sweat. Most of it is a friendly-looking hazelnut brown, only her belly and nose splotched by a brilliant white. A short-sleeved, red and green plaid shirt is knotted around her chest, leaving her midriff bare. Her legs are clad in very tight looking jeans. You can barely see a tail of golden hair behind her - the same colour as her flowing mane, both tied fast with bright pink hairbands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, you realize just how big she actually is and not just from your perspective. Even at your original size, she would still be at least a head bigger than you. Beneath the fur of her arms you see toned muscles - the result of years of hard field work. Her legs are the same - her pants seemingly only barely holding at the seams. You gulp and look up. Her chest would obscure a good part of her face, were she not leaning down to look at you. You catch a blush creeping onto your face - then shake your head. You've got other things to worry about for now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, do you want anything to eat? Drink? I've got more than enough for you, I'm sure,\" she says, a slight chuckle in her voice. \"But first of all: My name's Sally! And you?\"<br>\r\nYou tell her your name and quickly add that something to eat sounds wonderful. Mere moments later, she has cut an apple into tiny slices. It's big enough to last you a month...<br>\r\n\"Alright,\" Sally says as you munch on the gigantic fruit infront of you, \"you are a human. That's how it's called, right?\"<br>\r\nYou nod, then ask if she really doesn't know what you are. She shakes her head.<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but you are the first 'human' I've ever seen or heard of. How did you come here? Are you from some other region or country, maybe? I don't get around much, so maybe that's why I've not heard of you before.\"<br>\r\nYou blink, freezing for a moment. Where could you say, you were from? Would any answer, except 'The Planet Earth,' even make sense? Telling Sally your home town certainly wouldn't.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen you realize a far more important question... Where were you, exactly? Certainly not on the Earth you know. Had you been taken to another world? Slipped through into another dimension. How had you even gotten here? You strain to remember something, anything, from when you were still in your own world. You remember working late, enjoying a couple of drinks with your colleagues, being a bit tipsy as you crawled into bed. Closing your eyes... And then, a white flash and an incredibly deep voice, powerful and heavy like an earthquake. But for the life of you, you can't remember what it said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up to Sally, and ask her where you were.<br>\r\n\"Where we are? Well, in my house, for starters. The nearest city is <b>Livassa.</b> And, well, the country is called <b>Crenia!</b> \"<br>\r\nThese names... you have never heard them before. Sally's eyes fill with worry.<br>\r\n\"Guess, you're not from around here, are you?\"<br>\r\nYou nod, blankly. It was true. You had fallen into an entirely different world. With no idea, how to get back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, don't worry,\" Sally says, trying to be cheerful. \"I'm sure, we can figure this out. I may not know all that much about stuff like this, but I'm sure someone does. You've gotten here somehow, right? Then there must also be a way for you to get back home. Or at least figure out, where home is.\"<br>\r\nYou look up at her. She really does seem to genuinly care. Slowly, a small hope returns to you. At least, you were not alone.<br>\r\n\"That's the spirit!\" she shouts. \"We're going to take care of this and get you home in no time!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA beeping noise suddenly cuts through your conversation. Sally looks down, burying a hand in her pocket. She pulls out a vibrating smartphone. It's alarm is going off.<br>\r\n\"Well,\" she says, embarrassed, \"maybe we'll take a little time. I've still got stuff to do for the day. In fact, I've got to go really soon. I'm driving to Livassa - it's market day and I've got to buy some new tools. But say what, why don't you come with? Maybe we can find someone, who knows about you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(P.S.: I'm not a haiku kinda guy - but feel free to continue the style!)</span></div></div>",

No, you have to investigate yourself, if you want to have even the slightest chance of figuring out what happened to you. Even more, you don't want to loose sight of Sally anytime soon. She knows her way around in this world and she has been nothing but friendly. Though you are still intimidated by her sheer size, having her help you makes you feel infinitely more safe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great! I had hoped, that you would come with!\" She seems genuinly excited. \"I mean, I know it's probably scary for you, but think about it this way: I'm going to show you your first glimpse into a new world! Maybe even something, you've never seen before!\"<br>\r\nYou can't help being infected by her enthusiasm, despite having already had your fair share of the impossible for today. Sally's optimism isn't misplaced. you feel. Maybe you aren't lost, but rather on a grand adventure, of a kind no other human has ever even dreamed of. Your nervousness slowly gets drowned by an overwhelming desire to explore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally laughs, loudly. She must have seen your expression change.<br>\r\n\"Well, then lets head out!\" She lays down her palm next to you again, and this time you are much more secure in climbing onto her hand. On the way out, she grabs a big, black purse, swinging it around her shoulder. With a skip in her step she carries you out into the warm summer sun and immediatly towards a big, red pickup truck. The bright colour shows, it's well taken care of. The bed is covered with a mossy green tarp, though you see a few things poke out, making the surface uneven.<br>\r\nSally rummages through her purse, holding you in the other hand, and finally draws out a keyring. She fiddles some more with the lock, then the door swings open. As she gets behind the wheel, you are greeted by the hot, smothering air inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe inside of the truck looks as well as the outside. The seats are a dark brown, the black dashboard shines in the sunlight. Just as you spy the radio, Sally is already reaching for the On-switch. She browses through a few stations, settling on station playing classic rock songs.<br>\r\n\"It's not a long drive,\" she says as she reaches for her seatbelt, \"maybe fifteen minutes. Get comfortable!\"<br>\r\nShe stops for a moment. Then frowns.<br>\r\n\"Oh god. I'm sorry, I haven't even thought about where to put you while I drive.\" She suddenly shouts. \"I can't just hold you the entire time. And I don't think the seatbelts will fit you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look around the car. Sitting on the seat at your size with no security seems like a bad idea and the same goes for pretty much any surface inside. A sudden break would send you flying through the entire car and you aren't keen on testing out your durability. As you are checking out the cupholder, Sally suddenly speaks up again.<br>\r\n\"I think, there's nowhere in the car where you'd be safe, but...\" she says, slowly turning her head towards you, an embarrassed expression on her face. \"I can think of only two places. You could either ride along in my purse. It's going to be a little cramped, but it should be soft enough. Or, I could put you in my shirt pocket. Then, we can at least talk and you can see a bit of the scenery as we drive. It's your call.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou think for a moment. Where do you want to spend the ride?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Spending the whole ride in a dark, cramped container doesn't sound too appealing. You want to see this world, after all. And having more time to get to know your new friend sounds fun. You hardly know anything about her, after all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay then!\" Sally lifts you up and pulls open her pocket with one finger. Carefully, she lowers you in until your covered up to your shoulders in the soft cloth of her shirt. You lift your arms and put them over the edge, holding yourself up to make sure you can still see outside. The steering wheel right infront of you makes you crane your neck slightly, but you can finally get a good view of your new surroundings. It looks ordinary at first. The truck is parked in a gravel driveway. The ground looks dry, almost like sand. It leads into a thin asphalt road, cutting through uncared for grassland. A few trees line the sides. The most interesting thing you notice is the lack of other houses. In fact, this whole area seems pretty isolated, Sally's little home being the only structure for miles, apparently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I live a bit out of the way.\" Sally shrugs. \"I like it more this way. The city is nice, but it's hard to live at your own pace there. That, and the air here is so much cleaner.\"<br>\r\nShe turns the key and the engine roars to life. Your eyes widen. Sally doesn't seem to notice, it but the rumbling motor shakes the car ever so slightly. To the giant it's nothing, but you feel as if you had just sat into a very big massage chair. Your whole body is vibrating and you suddenly become a lot more consciouss of where exactly you are. The fabric of her shirt feels rough as it rubs against your skin and her body below you is very... soft. Soft enough that you can feel yourself sinking slightly into her chest. A blush creeps onto your face. You realize again, just how much bigger than you Sally is, that you're dwarfed even by her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou shake your head, banishing the thought, and look up to see Sally pulling out onto the driveway. Her hands grip the steering wheel, making it just a bit harder to look out. As she speeds up, the forest you'd seen earlier comes into view. You can't quite place the trees, but they are looking well cared for and orderly, more like a plantation than a natural forest. Strange fruits are hanging on some of them, pear shaped and with a blue, shimmering surface. They look big, almost a little to large for the trees. You make a mental note to ask Sally for some later.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally quickly starts chatting with you, asking you questions about your home world. She is surprised to hear how similar it is. After a short time, you conclude that your worlds seem to be roughly on the same technological level, though there are differences. The internet seems to have only been available for a few years and is still very basic, mostly being used by various universities for multiregional projects. On the other hand, the country of Crenia was apparently already planning a manned mission to another planet, with the goal of long term habitation. Your ears really peark up, when she mentions something called a <b>'Core Engine.'<br>\r\n</b><br>\r\n\"You don't have them?\" You shake your head. \"Well, you see that plantation over there? The big blue things?\" You nod, confused. What did these fruits have to do with it?<br>\r\n\"Those are <b>'Mora Trees.'</b> They're important, because a certain kind of bug really loves their resin. They eat it up and after a while, they form this kind of chrysalis. And those can, through a bunch of complicated chemistry stuff, make a whole lot of energy. Just one of them can make more heat than a full blown forest fire, so they have to be refined or they would just blow up in your face. This thing,\" she claps her hand on the dashboard, \"actually runs on that stuff. They last pretty long, had this one for three years now. As far as I know, that space mission is experimenting with using them in an unrefined state, to have a good source of power for all the survival stuff. Oh, look, Livassa's coming into view!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your head, still astonished by this enormous power source, to see a modern looking skyline emerging on the horizon. Glass and steel covered office buildings crowd the center. The cityscape looks dense, mostly covered by rowhouses. One building particularly catches your attention: a big stone tower, bigger than the others and white as marble, attached to what looks like an old timey castle.<br>\r\n\"That's the thing Livassa's famous for!\" Sally proclaims. \"It's the old university, the first in the country. It belonged to some noble, who sold it to the city after he bankrupted himself. They first turned it into a library and later into a school and now it seems half the country comes here just to see it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can't believe your luck. A university, and apparently one of the best of this country. Though you think, dimensonal science would have come up by now, maybe someone there knew how you got here.<br>\r\n\"We can stop there later, though it's hard to get an appointment if you aren't a student. It's probably our best lead. Now hold on, we're gonna be in town in just a second.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drive through a tunnel and after a few moments, you emerge into a bustling city. A cacophony of sounds fills the car, despite the windows being closed. The road is filled with all kinds of cars, the sidewalk is packed with people. A big looking bear-man is maintaining a hot-dog stand while glowering at his competitors on the opposite side. A fox woman rides past you on a bicycle, a big delivery bag on her shoulders. Tourists are strolling along and stressed looking workers run past them. The street is crammed with all sorts of houses, shops, bars, restaurants and apartments all seemingly randomly piled ontop of and next to each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally turns a few times, and then stops the car. In front of you is a wide, open plaza, crowded with people and stalls. Shops of all kinds have been set up, looking more like a basar than a farmers market. You can see at least five stalls, where the owner is argueing with a customer, presumably about the price.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks like a slow day today,\" Sally says, smirking. She grabs a bag from the backseat, as well as her purse. \"Well, time for you to really meet this city! I think you'll like it.\"<br>\r\nYou're filled with a mix of both excitement and nervousness. The market looks amazing and several stalls seem to offer things you have never seen before. But at the same time, the sight of all these gigantic people fills you with dread. Just one wrong move, one accident and you would be toast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally must have noticed your feelings somehow and looks down at you. \"Don't worry,\" she says, a gentle smile on her face, \"you can stay right where you are, if you're feeling nervous. I promise you'll be okay, I'll make sure of that.\"<br>\r\nYou smile back up, reliefed to have her at your side, and settle into her pocket, only poking out your head. With a nod you signal that you're ready.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise from before is nothing compared to the wall of sound hitting you as Sally opens the door. All around you, people talk, shout, argue, laugh. She sips into the crowd with ease, not afraid to bump into people blocking her path. The mass surrounding you makes it difficult to get a look at the actual shops as every stall seems to be crowded. It doesn't help, that every step of Sally's sends you bouncing up and down as her chest rises and falls. You instinctively grab onto her shirt harder, leaning back. You don't want to be flung out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally suddenly stops infront of a muscled, dark furred bull-man. Two great, grey horns poke out of his head and he smiles as his eyes fall onto her.<br>\r\n\"Ah, hey there, Sall'. Got your stuff ready in just a moment.\" He rummages around behind the counter, pulling out a box filled to the brim with various gardening equipment. Tools, seeds, earth, mulch. Sally seems satisfied and chats for a moment with the owner. They seem to know each other. While they are talking, you lean out of her pocket and look around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother stall piques your interest. It's one of the few without many people around it. The counter is filled with trinkets, amulets and pins and the like. They don't just look like the usual tacky merchandise you'd find in a place like this. An eerie feeling creeps onto your back as you look at the various charms - and onto their price tag. You don't know the currency here, but eight hundred of anything is probably not cheap, which is probably, why only few people even stop by. Still, you feel that there is something more to these trinkets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust a few meters next to this mysterious shop is a big white tent. A sign at the entrance displays it's purpose: 'University of Livassa - Information for starting your studies.' It's alot more crowded than anything else in the area. A young vixen is handing out pamphlets to passersby and an older man with an impressive brown lion mane is giving advice to a group of young men, looking like high school students. Maybe these people would know about your situation, or could at least put you and Sally in touch with someone who does.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally wraps up her conversations and as she says goodbye to the shop-owner, you sublty poke her. She looks down at you, a questioning look on her face.<br>\r\n\"What is it? Something you want to look at?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tell her about...</span></div></div>",

You adjust your eyes to the darkness to see that the ground you stepped on looked like a big blue piece of cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's this?\" you ask yourself. \"It looks like a giant handkerchief. What is..?\" You then yell before you slip and fall on something. It's a big and thick as a tree but it also seemed like it was spherical. Where exactly were you. Suddenly you hear a zipping noise and look to the big black sky to see that it was slowly being filled with light. As the light enters the room, you look around to see coins, a comb, a cellphone, a bottle of mints, all at least one hundred times bigger than you were. You look down and see that what you're holding onto appears to be a giant roll of lipstick. You were in a giant purse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then look up to see a large whitish gray hand with purple nail polish reaching down and grabbing the lipstick you're standing on as you gasp. You look up as the nail polish you're on is being raised into the air. You turn and see that the purse you were in belonged to a titanic white rhinoceros woman, thousands of feet tall.

Your entire body from the waist down is covered in lipstick and rhino spit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're panting because you could've been swallowed.

You even see a couple of hippo women walk past the rhino giantess and see several anthro girls of varying species laying in the sand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou then look and see you were in a bathing suit as well then you hear the rhino lady laughing. \"Well,\" she says. \"Looks like you're smeared again sweetie.

You dream of a strange glowing light right before you woke up. Strangely you weren't in bed anymore. In fact, it was dark you run to try and find where you are, but you bump into some kind of invisible wall and grunt. As you get up and rub your head off, you look forward and take a closer look. You tap on the invisible wall and then walk the other way for what feels like half an hour until you hit another invisible wall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's going on?\" you ask. \"Where am I?\" Suddenly the lights turn on and you look down to see that the floor underneath you was transparent and then look up to see the sky above you was a dark gray with small openings in the top. Then it occurred to you, you were in a giant jar on an even bigger coffee table. It was as if you were the size of a grain of rice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen something stopped forward and you looked up in absolutely shock. The figure that came forward was astronomically huge. You'd say at least a thousand times as big as you. The figure was an enormous hippopotamus woman with dark brown skin and reddish brown hair. She was predictably very obese with most of her fat going in her belly and butt. She was wearing a black thong that covered very little and was as thin as dental floss and no bra. Instead, she was wearing a towel that covered only the sides of her mountainous breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the giant hippo lady stomps towards you, the jar shakes and falls down with you having to push against the side of the jar to avoid a crash landing. Your glass prison rolls across the table and stops as it hits your hippo captor in the stomach.

The almost non-existent clothing was also a plus. Torn between all these reactions, you freeze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...And don't notice her opening the jar and reaching her fat fingers in until she's already pinched you between them and lifted you up to her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"YIPE! Um...hello there, ma'am. Um...nice to meet you?\" You choke out awkwardly, fitting in a nervous laugh. You want to rub the back of your head, but her grip has your arms pinned tight to your sides. This close to her face, you spot a pair of tusks the size of aircraft carriers. They were dulled, only just poked out over her lips,. and looked freshly-brushed, but they still rang alarm bells in your head. Ones about being eaten, to be precise. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAside from a little giggle and tilting her huge head, the hippo-girl has no response. You decide to try again, hoping to get some answers about just <i>what the helll is going on.</i> \"Nice place you have here, by the way.\" You comment, looking around the room. You weren't just making small-talk, this place <i>did</i> look nice--fancy wood furniture, a nice blue throw-rug on the floor, cream-painted walls, and an entertainment center that looked VERY expensive. If not for how impossibly gigantic everything was, it could be any upscale apartment you'd seen or been in before now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo-woman's smile brightens a bit at that and she winks at you again, but still no words are forthcoming. <br>\r\nDamn, at the mercy of a skyscraper-sized animal girl and she won't even chit-chat with you.

You let out a whistle. This place <i>was</i> upscale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever that's when you start to slip. \"Whoa! Whoa!\" The hippo woman smiles and then shifts her arm so that you slip out of her hand and land on the chair. You grunt as you slid across the cushion that had to go on for miles. You stand up and rub your head before you hear more giggling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and see the hippo giantess staring down at you and from the looks of it, she's pulling off her thong, leaving her completely naked. A multi-mile high dude beauty.

Don't!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the hippo giggles and shakes her rear faster. You run towards the back of the chair obviously not thinking and then you duck as the hippo lowers her rear.

You guess she was just kidding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou let out a laugh. Guess she wasn't going to... except that seconds later, she brings her massive rear down on you in seconds, like two galaxy destroying asteroids. You let out a muffled scream as the chocolate colored mountains pin you to the cushion. You expect to be turned into a pile of guts, but for some reason you're not being pulped. The softness of the cushion must be protecting you from being killed, but you can barely breath and even swallow some sweat that drips on you down from the cheeks before gagging.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippo giggles and wiggles her rear, causing you pain before she starts bouncing you up and down, further knocking you under her butt. How were you surviving and more importantly, <b>why</b> was this hippo toying with you like this. What kind of world were you in. You keep sinking until you're completely under hippo. You're groaning as she grinds you into the chair for 3 more hours. Then the giantess gets up and leaves you pinned to her...</span></div></div>",

Three hours of your silent captress merrily pancaking you under her overly-ample ass had left you tired, in pain and dull-witted, but having her weight suddenly lift off of you was somehow <i>worse</i> than being sat on: without any fear of being crushed to paste in the next instant, the sheer pain from the playful plump goddess grinding and bouncing her rear on you came to your attention full-force. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat, and you were smashed so badly by this plus-sized dominatrix's behind that when she stood up, you were plastered to her left cheek like a tattoo. Sweet gravity failed to pull you off, and simple instinct made you weakly grab onto the squishy flesh to avoid falling to your death. Not that it helped much; you could barely move your arms and you felt utterly flattened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll things considered, it was....unpleasant. Between groans of pain and mumbled profanity, you wonder what god you pissed off to deserve this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn all-too-familiar giggle hits your ears, and you crane your head up as much as you can. Though much of your view is swamped by the hippo woman's planetary cheeks, you can see her looking over her shoulder and smirking at you. She gives you a saucy wink, to which you respond with a garbled string of obscenities vile enough to make the devil cover his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she even heard you, your giggling tormentor wasn't phased by your trash-talk.

Then you yell as she painfully peels you off of her massive ass as it jiggles. After being sat on by that behemoth for three hours straight and used as a butt tattoo, you dread whatever the hippopotamus giantess is up to. However, as the hippopotamus woman peels you off her planet destroying heiny, you are flat like a cartoon character and flutter as you look at yourself in horror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hippopotamus woman then lets out a laugh and lifts you in front of her continental snout and gives a grin. She gives a snort that blows hot air from her massive nostrils right into your face. You begin to sweat and it goes faster down your body as usual given how flat your body is. Then the hippo opens her mouth and you scream because it looks like she is going to eat you. \"No!\" you yell. \"No! Don't do it! I thought hippos were supposed to be vegetarians!\" But the hippo then envelops your head in her massive lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith your head in the hippo's mouth, you look around in horror to see large vegetable stained fangs the size of mountains and an ocean sized tongue wet with saliva that was dripping down like water from the ceiling of a cave. The tongue was moving around in a splashing like motion and you're especially scared as you see the blackhole in the back that is the hippo's throat. You expect her to suck you in and down her esophagus to her planetary girth but instead a gust of wind comes from her throat and strikes you in the face. This inflates you back to normal as the hippo spits you, covered with saliva into her hand and lets out a girlish giggle that unnerves you as she looks down at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she does something that shocks you. She finally speaks to you. \"Sorry, Baby.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>      Earth, soft loamy soil, that was all he could smell, slowly turning his body he realized it wasn't just because his nose had been buried in the stuff, the scent permeated the very air surrounding him. \"What the fuck?\" he thought, slowly sitting up, he cracked his eyes open, looking around he realized he was in a massive cavern, large enough to hold a small city, the earthen smell coming from, well everywhere as the walls were made of dirt, a single hole in the roof of the cavern letting light in. AS he turned he realized that this cavern was in fact connected to another, larger one, that was also slightly illuminated, he figured by the same method. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"What the hell is going on here\" he muttered to himself, \"I remember going to bed, and now I'm...here\" he says sweeping his arms in a circle, judging by distance it'd take him a few minutes just to get from his current location into the other cavern, with a sigh he stared walking as there was no other real option. He spent this time muttering to himself thinking about every possibility. \"How does this cavern even exist, there's no way its man-made, there's nothing to hold the dirt back, and I believe I would have heard abut this place if it was natural, what exactly is going on?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      He didn't have long to think after that as the ground started to shake dislodging loose bits of earth from above him, \"fuck earthquake\" he looked around frantically but he was in the center of an open room, there was nowhere to duck and cover. The tremors increased in intensity although they continued in an almost pattern, about a 1 1/2 second pause between each. Finally the tremor's stopped as a massive shape blocked the light from the other cavern. He slowly looked up taking in the form of this...creature that had been causing the earthquakes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     It looked kind of like a rabbit, 3-toed feet, long ears, and he was guessing a cotton tail on her behind. He was pretty sure it was a her given the small (large for him) orbs sitting high on her chest as well as the distinct lack of any...male anatomy. She was completely naked, so he could see she light earthen brown fur, her hair was a much darker brown and fell to her shoulders, large amber eyes scanning the room. \"Oh my god\" he mutters as he was looking straight at her feet, and he wasn't any taller, he was only like an inch tall. This however was the wrong thing as she seemed to hear him, her eyes falling near instantly to the ground, he wasn't sure how, although the fact that her ears looked about a foot long, in comparison with the rest of her, may have something to do with it. Those large amber eyes focused straight on him as soon as she saw him, there was only one thing to do as she started to lean over, RUN.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n      He took off like a bat out of hell, running towards her rather than away as he was sure she was suspecting that, he was correct as he made it through her legs before she could even react, there was no screaming, no panicking, his entire being was focused on getting away from this giant rabbit. He skidded to a stop as her hand slammed to the floor in front of him creating a wall, turning and looking in horror as her other hand was already where he meant to run towards. Turning he realized she had dropped herself to the ground, sealing any other escape routes with her body. He slowly backed away from her face, slowly shaking his head back and forth, only one thought going through his head 'I don't want to die.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     He froze as he felt his back press against her hands and she looked at him almost confused, she opened her mouth, and he closed his eyes and held his hands up in the usual defensive pose, giant carnivore bunnies, it's possible. He was shocked however as he heard a voice, feminine yet booming due to her sheer size in comparison to him ask a question \"what are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slowly opened his eyes, \"I, I'm a human\" he replied meekly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain her head tilted, into what he assumed was a confused, or thinking pose, \"never heard of those\" she replies shaking her head as if to give her statement more emphasis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummm, could you please...let me go?\" he says, finding it hard to not let fear enter his voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't think that's a good idea, if I didn't hear you talking I might have stepped on you\" he found himself pushed forward and scooped him up into her palm, as this giant rabbit woman sat up and stared down at him. \"I'm Alyssa. who are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mathew\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice to meet you Mathew\" she seemed to notice that he was shivering, stopping as he felt one of her gigantic fingers gently press against him and start to stroke him \"hey there's nothing to be afraid of, I'm not going to hurt you, I promise.\" He slowly relaxed, the large, soft digit doing a lot to calm him, she seemed to be enjoying stroking him as she simply sat there, waiting for him to calm down. He slowly pushed back against her finger and she took this as a sign to stop, \"so, what are you doing in my house?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your house?\" he looked over the massive cavern he was in and out toward the other room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes my house, you're in the guest room, it's not finished yet, there's a kitchen, a master bedroom, living room, and the guest room\" she says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry for intruding\" replies quickly Alyssa almost looking sad that he was still fearful of her. \"As for why I'm here, I don't know, I just woke up here\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmm well that's a problem, because I did catch you trespassing and you don't have any good reason to be doing it, so I guess you're just going to have to stay with me for a while\" she says her voice keeping a more upbeat tone so as to keep you from worrying too much<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stay with you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yes stay with me, your a bit too small to go wandering, and well under law since I caught you trespassing in my home I have free reign over what to do with you. As I said your a little small for anything I can think of, save for one thing but that can wait till we're a bit better acquainted\" he swore he saw her blush as she thought about whatever the last thing was. his stomach choosing this time to speak up, this causing the gigantic rabbit to giggle, \"hungry?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I was just about to have breakfast before I heard you, so let's go eat, you ok with carrots?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n     \"Yeah\" he thought about nodding but was unsure if she'd even notice him doing it. Alyssa walked through the room he was had been heading towards, noting that there was in fact a couch and a TV against the far wall as well as a small lamp for reading, how he didn't see any of this before he wasn't sure. She walked into a modern looking kitchen, except for the fact the walls and floor were made of dirt, a stove, refrigerator, counters, cabinets, and a table that could seat up to 5 were everything of note in the room. He was placed down on the counter as Alyssa grabbed a carrot and began chopping it into ever smaller pieces. \"So do you live alone?\" he asked<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe turned and looked at him quite forlornly \"yes, although I've always wanted a family, the soft sound of little paws on the dirt floor, someone to cuddle with, their face being the first and last thing I see each day\" she sighed, a dreamy stare on her face as she zoned out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I hope you find that special someone\" his voice knocked her out of her reverie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"thanks\" she replied softly, after a minute more of chopping Alyssa divided the carrots onto 2 plates, one with regular sized pieces for her and one with minuscule pieces for him. She moved him and the plates to the table before sitting down herself, it was quite for a while till...</span></div></div>",

Then another one but stronger, and this pattern repeats until the giant figure enters the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking up at the figure that enters the room you had to second look just to make sure your eyes weren't playing tricks on you. Walking into the room was a giant\u00a0crocodile/girl/ thing? You had no clue what to call it. First off she was naked so it made it easier to see her whole body. The scales on her, and the tail with spikes told you she was a crocodile. As to tell how the giant was a girl was due to the c cups on her chest and her figure. If she was human, or normal size she would be a really hot looking woman.\u00a0<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she came closer the smaller you felt. And the closer she came the more frighten you became. You were so frighten of her size that the thought move as she came closer didn't even come to mind. By the time she took one more step that would have been on top of you, well you did what anyone else would have done. You screamed at the top of your lungs and it seems she heard you as she fell backwards from the shock of hearing something scream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow,\" she said rubbing her butt. She looked down to find you standing there in fear. Once your eyes locked one thought came to you, that should have been there before she nearly stepped on you. RUN!!!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince she blocked your path you turned around and ran as hard as you could, but she just moved her tail to block your escape. You had a hard time stopping so the impact to her tail stung a little, along with the falling on the floor. Pulling yourself up trying to stand up, two giant claws grabbed you. As you got higher in the air, the more you struggled, and once you were in front of her face you put all your might into struggling free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe uses her other hand to become a platform for you to land on and lets go of you. Once you land you curl up into a ball, not sure what to do. You can feel her look over you and once she was done she asked you, \"What are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough you were far too scared to answer her. She saw this though and started to rub you back with one of her claws. Though it frightened you at first after awhile you loosened up a bit. She saw this and asked again, \"What are you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh I'm a human.\" you answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A human? Never heard of that as a species.\" She stared at you and was trying to think of something. While she did this you just stared at her giant hand. Trying to figure out your height it had to be at most two inches compared to her. \"You know it's illegal to trespass in some's home. And when the owner of the house just got out of the shower.\" \u00a0She growled a bit at the end causing you to shiver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"S-sor-ry I didn't mean to break in!\" you said in a panic. \"I don't even know how I got here!\" You curled back into ball after that. Having a giant crocodile girl angry at you would bring a lot of fear into any man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sighed and rubbed your. Back again while she said, \"So you have no clue how you got here and your species is unknown? Hmmmmm. I have an idea with what to do with you.\" You start to uncurl as she got back up. She then started to walk out of that room and into another one. Though you may not have gotten a good look at the other room, you saw that this room was her bedroom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA large bed, twice the size of the she croc, was against the wall along with large dresser in front of it. As she got closer to the dresser you saw that there was a jewelry box on top. As you noticed it, she opened it, \"Now since I have to get dressed I'm going to put you in here, but don't worry it's only until I get dressed.\" With that you sat in the jewelry box. She left it open for you, so you were thankful. Turning your back to her as she got dressed you noticed that the walls were like made of wooden logs. As you sat there while she dressed you got kind of curious about why you were here or where you were. Though your thoughts were finished when she picked you up and onto the dresser, out of the jewelry box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a good look at her you noticed something weird right away, she was wearing glasses. Though the look gave her a liberian look. She had her long black hair in a flowing pony tail behind her shoulder. Her grayish green scales had a glow to them. As you looked down she seemed to be in some dress. But before you got to look at her breast she coughed to he your attention. Looking up she said, \"I don't mi d the staring but please don't drool. That's kind of over doing it a bit.\" She couldn't stop giggling once you wiped your mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry but I.. Uh never would think of a crocodile woman looking like a librarian,\" though when you said this she seemed to be kind of sad. \"But this makes you look like a goddess, I'm mean . U-h.\" Though you did mean to complement her, that wasn't what you meant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked at you shocked, \"Do you mean that?\" you nodded. \"Even if I enjoy reading more then anything else,\" you nod again. \"Or have breast smaller then the most Crocodiles.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou just kept on nodding, caught in her beauty ,in fact you said, \"You can't mess with perfection.\" Once you said that you blushed and covered your mouth feeling like a dumb ass. But you saying this made her get up and pull you into a deep hug. You just rubbed her as she hugged you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hug lasted for a while, but once it ended you deep in her cleavage, making her giggle a bit. \"Getting so comfy and we still don't know each others names.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"{Your name here}.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janet,\" she beamed down.\u00a0</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Uneasy dreams haunted you in your sleep. You weren't quite sure what it was... maybe you had eaten something bad or drank to much at that party the night before. But you felt as if you simply couldn't get any rest. Strange visions appeared as quickly as they melted away. Only one feeling was omnipresent in this primordial soup of your own thoughts: dread.<br>\r\nYou couldn't put your finger on why, but you were afraid. Afraid of something unimaginably massive. Something so large, it could crush you without a moments notice. Through the fog in your mind, a shape emerged. You could only make out its edges... but seeing it made your heart stop beating.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a start, you awoke from your nightmare, drenched in sweat and heaving. The air around you was damp. Not surprising, considering how hot it had been. Flailing around, you searched for the light switch. Maybe some TV would help you calm down.<br>\r\nBut as you reached forward to the familiar spot, your hand grabbed only air. You furrowed your brow. Had you moved this much in your sleep? Once more, you tried to flick on the lights, only to miss again. What was happening? You turned and reached out again. Still nothing - as if the wall wasn't even there...<br>\r\nAnother feeling came to the forefront of your mind. You were cold. Freezing, in fact. You hadn't noticed before since your brain had still been cumbered by your nightmares, but now were not able to ignore it even if you tried. Furthermore, neither your blanket nor your mattress were anywhere near you. Instead, you were lying on a cold, hard floor. Maybe you had fallen out of bed? But no, your floor was carpeted. This felt more like tiling...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, your eyes adjusted to the darkness. Shapes started to appear around you, but you couldn't make anything out, except that you definitely weren't in your room. But that was enough to make adrenaline kick in. If you weren't in your room, that raised the question on how you got here. And, of course, where exactly 'here' was.<br>\r\nYou got up an noticed with a start, that your clothes were missing as well. This was getting weirder by the second. Looking around, it seemed like you were somewhere outside. There were no walls you could see, and it was oppressively dark. If you hadn't been standing on a tiled floor, you would have assumed to be in some part of the wilderness. But that didn't make any sense... the closest space that was this free from civilization would have been miles away from your flat. You doubted you could have sleepwalked for that long. Maybe someone had kidnapped you? No, why would they just dump you here, then?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSighing, you gave up to find a rational explanation. It might become simpler in the daylight. For now, you had to figure out where you even were. The blackness around you was almost featureless, except for a tall shape in the distance. A tree, maybe. Whatever it was, it might help you orient yourself.<br>\r\nSetting one foot in front of the other, you dragged yourself over the tiled floor. Soon you noticed, that it wasn't stopping. The cold, hard floor stretched out seemingly endlessly all around you. An alarm bell tingled somewhere in your mind. Something was very, very wrong, you felt. You gulped and banished the thought. Losing your nerves was not something you could afford at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the shape you had been headed towards slowly became more defined, you couldn't help it. You yelped, a mixture of surprise and shock in your voice.<br>\r\nIt was, in fact a tree. Kind of. The thick leaves sprouting upwards at least made it look like one. The massive pot in which the plant stood, however, made it look more like an art installation.<br>\r\nIn your heart though, you knew that it wasn't a sculpture. Flashes of your nightmares returned, and once more you felt that massive being loom over you. All color fled from your face as the intense feeling of being crushed overcame you. It took all your might not to lose your composure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shapes around you slowly became clearer, and next to the flowerpot, you saw a massive structure emerging. It seemed to rise forever into the sky, dwarfing you utterly. Only barely, you could see some light refract of the top of it. Porcelain. It was a sink...<br>\r\nIt only took a few more seconds for the rest of the place to come into focus. A toilet was in the corner. On the other side, a gargantuan bathtub and a shower stall. And finally, a massive, wooden door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou tried to tell yourself it wasn't real, but you couldn't deny the evidence of your eyes. The question of how you had gotten here vanished from your head as you realized there couldn't be an explanation. There was no way you <i>rationally</i> ended up a mere two inches tall in some strangers bathroom, after all...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt might have been a minute you had stood there, stunned. It might have been hours. You couldn't keep track of time while your mind desperately tried to process your terrifying situation. Finally, you managed to move again, as one thought pierced through all the others.<br>\r\nYou needed a plan... However it had happened, this was real, and you needed to have your wits about you if you didn't want to be crushed by whoever was the owner of this bathroom. For now, it seemed safe... but when the morning came, you would have to be very careful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping this in mind, you decided to...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Without a thought in the world, the gigantic rex woman flicked on the light switch. The bulb exploded with yellow, electric light and you gasped as it stung in your eyes. The sudden change from complete darkness made your head hurt and tears stream down your face. Yet you couldn't just stand there. You had to...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<font class=\"size4\" style=\"\"><div align=\"center\"><b>Boom!</b></div></font><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer massive foot rose with a speed you wouldn't have thought possible for a creature this large. Before you could react, the meaty sole crashed down only inches away from you, the shock wave sending you flying backwards across the tiled bathroom floor. With ringing ears, your tried your best to get back on your feet, but as you looked up you saw her other foot hovering above you. Panic flooded your veins and instinct took over. In a desperate attempt to survive, you threw yourself to the side...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\"><b><font class=\"size45\" style=\"\">Boom!</font></b></div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd just in time. Had you reacted even a moment later, you would have been pulverized under her toes. Yet it was hard to relax. Being this close to her foot, the shock wave from her step picked you up and carried you forward. The few seconds of your flight felt like an eternity. The world blurred before your eyes, the bathroom fading into an undefinable blotch of whites and grays.<br>\r\nAnd with a sickening <i>clang</i>, pain exploded in your head as you hit something...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sound of rushing water greeted you once you regained your consciousness. The sharp pain your skull had subsided to a dull, but constant throb. Through tears, you forced open your eyes... and gasped!<br>\r\nDirectly next to you, both left and right, the giantess had planted her feet. Like Greek pillars, her legs rose into the sky above, finally molding together into her hips. And you, directly beneath her, couldn't help but stare...<br>\r\nShaking your head, you tore your eyes away from the rex' crotch. You doubt you could ever forget the sight, but you had more important things to worry about now! Looking around, you realized exactly where you were. When she had sent you flying, you had hit your head on the porcelain wall of her bathtub. The water you heard rushing out behind you had to be her filling it up, a fact that was only confirmed as you saw the thin mist of steam slowly fill the room. Obviously, the titan wanted to take a bath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich might be the best thing for you. If she got into the tub, you were absolutely free to leave. You doubted she would pay much attention to the floor while she was bathing. However, you could also try to make contact with the massive lizard. Even though just looking at her made your fight-or-flight instinct kick in, all signs pointed to her not just being a wild beast. After all, she was living it what could only be described as a normal, if over sized, house. Maybe it was better for the giantess to know you were there... if only to avoid her stepping on you, accidentally. But all of that rested on the assumption that she would actually treat you like a person once you showed yourself to her.<br>\r\nMaybe it would be better to observe her first. Get a picture of who she was, how she behaved. Then you would know if you should run or try to make contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rushing water stopped, and the gargantuan feet next to you rose up she slid into the hot bath. A sigh escaped the giantess, and a few drops of water spilled over the edge. The tub must have been filled to the brim.<br>\r\nAfter thinking for a moment, you finally decided to...</span></div></div>",

One day you were out of a walk, and a sharp pain raced through you head. It hurt so badly that you passed out. When you woke up you were lying on your back, and looking up directly at the blazing sun. There wasn't a cloud in the sky. You then got scared because you noticed you weren't where you were before. You were on a HUGE amount of sand, and you could here the sea. Using a nearby palm tree as comparison you think you've somehow shrunk to 4 inches in height. You start to panic at not knowing how you got to 4 inches tall, and how you got to what you thought was a beach. Luckily there wasn't anyone around. At least that's what you thought. Suddenly you felt slight tremors. You swiftly look around, only to see a giant otter girl. She looked to be only 10 years old. She had brown fur, webbed feet, blue eyes, long brown hair, a cream underbelly, and wore a blue bikini (If you can't get an idea<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dg9eKdfMA5o/T52S84rZqAI/AAAAAAAAAeE/Sce0PPl_gDM/s1600/lc_marina_otter.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-dg9eKdfMA5o/T5...</a>). She was holding a basket full of seashells, and was walking straight at you. You start to panic as she gets closer, and closer. Only thing is, you're too scared to run. As she gets closer you start to hear that she is humming a soothing melody. You then noticed something about your surroundings, there were TONS of seashells. \"Ooooh, that looks like a nice one!\" You hear her say in a cheerful voice. She was looking in your direction as she said this witch scared you. To make things worse she start walking a little faster. Once she reached where you were, you almost fainted from fear. She then bent over to pick something up, and you let out a small yelp of fear. You thought she was going to pick you up, but she was reaching for a seashell next to you. The quiet yelp startles her because she didn't know you were there. She freezes, and starts to look directly at you. You start to shiver in fear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, don't be afraid little guy.\" She says as she gently lifts you up by the back of your shirt. It's then that you realize how sharp her nails are. They were like claws, so if you struggled you would kill yourself. She then placed you in the basket she was carrying, and said \"I won't hurt you.\". After that she started walking again, but this time in the opposite direction. After about 10 minutes of her humming, and walking you heard a door open. \"Hi mom I'm back! I'll be in my room if you need me!\" The otter girl shouted. She then walked into her room, and sat on her bed. She took you out of the basket, and gently sat you on her palm. She felt you shaking, and...</span></div></div>",
