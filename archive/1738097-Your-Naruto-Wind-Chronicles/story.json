At least that's what a I believe I mean what if something happened tomorrow? What if the world ended? I live every day to the fullest I protect my loved ones and treat every day like it could be my last... what do you think of that sarah?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah:(hugs him) I think it's the greatest way to live, bree's lucky to have someone like you in her life, I just wish I had pursued you before maybe then I could be as happy as her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaruto:sa... sarah you like me?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSarah:not like, love!
