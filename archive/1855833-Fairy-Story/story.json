You've never gotten further than kissing. Every time you've made a move she's stopped you and said. \"I don't think we're ready.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou would have left her by now if not for one fact. She is completely out of your league. She has the most beautiful face you've ever seen and her body is perfect. You know that if you left her you'd never get a woman anywhere near as attractive as her again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTonight you are out at a club with Sandra and she has had a little too much to drink. One side-effect of this is that she has become a little more physically affectionate with you. This could be your lucky night.</span></div></div>",

By the time she finishes that one, she i practically ripping your clothes off so you quickly lead her outside and into your car.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou drive to your house because it's closer than hers and lead her quickly inside and to your bedroom. You kiss passionately as you undress each other. You lay her on the bed and explore her naked body with your hands. She arches her back and moans. Finally you slide your penis into her and begin to thrust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou both orgasm together and collapse on the bed panting. The alcohol and exhaustion finally too much for her, Sandra quickly falls asleep. You soon follow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wake up the next morning. Sandra is still sleeping off the alcohol next to you. Something seems wrong though. She seems larger. Actually the whole room seems larger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb out of bed and realise that it isn't the room that's wrong. It's you. Your body is slender and hairless. Quickly you run to the bathroom and look in the mirror. Looking back is the reflection of a young girl, about 10 years old.</span></div></div>",

She lays on the bed and you join her, exploring her naked body with your hands. She arches her back and moans.

You are laying in a single bed with a pink flowery bedspread. Around the room are shelves holding a number of dolls and teddy-bears. To one side you see a small white desk with a mirror. On it sits a small pink night light. For some reason that feels important. Then you realise, it must have been the source of the pink light under the door to Sandra's spare room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo the other side, you see something even stranger. A baby's changing table, except it is much too big for an infant or even a toddler.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou throw the covers back and find something else wrong. You are wearing a short pink cotton nightie. As you sit up you feel something thick between you legs and around your bottom.

You are the typical nice guy kind of man, which all women want to befriend with, because you always do the right thing but in the end they always date the good-looking assholes that break their hearts.

Much less gracefully, you remove your own clothes. She lays on the bed and you join her, exploring her naked body with your hands. She arches her back and moans.

You feel much smaller and you also feel wet and messy between your legs, as you look down you see that you wear a pink nightie and under neat that, a pair of pink plastic pants and, under those, a thick terry nappy, which smells like you  wet and messed yourself while being asleep. Now sitting upright you can see your reflection in a mirror that stands in a corner of the room, you almost freak out as you realize that you now look like a ten year old girl. Then you suddenly realize that Sandra must have told the truth about her being a fairy and that having sex with her would turn you into a baby fairy that appears to be a ten year old incontinent girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn one hand you are of course very angry at  Sandra because she took advantage of you to turn you into her baby fairy daughter but on the other hand you know that you have to stay with her now, because nobody would believe you and Sandra is the only person you know that can introduce you to your new life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter some time your thoughts are dawn back to the wet and messy diaper that you are wearing. At first you want to call out for Sandra to change your diaper, since she was the one that turned you into a incontinent baby fairy so she should change your messy diapers, but then you think that you might be too upset at moment to deal with Sandra, so that facing her now could cause you to say things that you might regret later, so maybe changing your own diaper on the changing table; where you see all the needed diapering supplies to do so would be the better idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the end you decided to\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You don't know it yet but Sandra is a fairy and sex with her will be life-changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image mankind has of fairies is almost completely wrong. This is mostly due to deliberate misinformation on the part of the fairies themselves. Most of the time, they live among us as apparently normal people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFairies are all female and look especially beautiful and do not age beyond what humans would consider their mid-20s. They do have wings, but generally keep them magically hidden. They have other magical abilities too, including shrinking themselves to the size of more traditionally recognised fairies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn order to reproduce, fairies must have sex with human males. The act magically transforms the men into young fairies, resembling human girls of about 10 years old. They are much more dependent on their new mothers than real human children of that age because technically, despite retaining their personality and memories of their old lives, they are babies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis includes being completely incontinent. Young fairies need to wear diapers until they are initiated as fully-fledged fairies, at which point they gain their wings and magical abilities.</td>",
