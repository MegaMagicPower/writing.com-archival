She had received as message from Shepard earlier in the afternoon asking her to meet him in shuttle 1 for a romantic rendezvous at midnight when most of the crew were asleep. She was so excited, as it had been a while since she and Shepard had had any alone time together, that she didn't bother to question why they were meeting in a shuttle and not his cabin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't matter now. It was almost midnight and Tali could barely contain her excitement. As she made her way to shuttle 1 she saw that its door was already open. Thinking Shepard might already be there, she quickened her pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shepard I'm here,\" Tali said as she stepped into the craft. She soon became confused however when she didn't see her boyfriend on board. \"Shepard?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, the shuttle door slammed shut behind her. She spun around startled by the sudden noise. Then she felt the shuttle start to move.<br>\r\n \"No, no, no , no!\" Tali cried as she tried to get the door open, but the system refused to obey any of her commands. She could hear the Normandy's hangar door opening outside. She was about to be launched into space! Tali immediately tried to reach the cockpit to avoid her fate, but it was to late. Once the hangar door was open the shuttle took off at such high speeds that she was thrown into the back wall of shuttle so hard it knocked her out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keelah,\" Tali said when she finally regained consciousness. Slowly, getting to her feet she noticed that the shuttle had sustained heavy damage. <i>The shuttle must have made a crash landing</i> Tali realized. There were wires hanging out everywhere and one of the shuttle doors was missing. It was obvious to Tali that the shuttle was completly inoperable. She was lucky to have to have survived unscathed. However, just where was she? Walking over to the missing door, Tali looked out and saw that was...</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Looking out the missing door Tali saw surroundings filled with tall trees and lush vegetation. Clearly she was in the middle of a jungle but a jungle on which planet? Taking a step outside Tali tried to scan for any identifiable land marks or unique vegetation that might tell her where she had landed. Then the quarian maiden froze as her eyes rested upon a particular flower no more the a twenty yards away. It was a large red flower with four petals and a hole in the center. The flower was easily twice as tall as Tali.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Keelah,\" Tali moaned as she stepped back into the shuttle. She recognized that from a documentary she once watched on the net. It was a rare carnivorous plant that only grew on one planet in the galaxy. Voresha! It was a planet were everything was evolved to eat and digest everything including dextro based lifeforms like Tali! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTali sat down in a corner of the shuttle and hugged her knees to her chest. Of all the places the quarian maiden could've landed she had to land on the jungle plant where she was at the bottom of the food chain. Tali looked over at the busted controls of the shuttle. Maybe if she could repair the systems maybe she could send out a distress signal, but there was no guarantee that help would arrive before Tali found herself digesting in the belly of a predator. Plus a shuttle with a missing door wasn't the most secure shelter, and there was the issue of food and water. Tali would eventually have to go in search of those things. Alternatively, Tali would most likely end up being eaten anyway and there was already a carnivorous plant a few yards away. She could just walk over to it and get things over with. Taking a deep breathe Tali stood up and decided to...</span></div></div>",
