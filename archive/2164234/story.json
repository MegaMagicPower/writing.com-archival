While she was still quite short, she was at least happy to be in the 5 foot range. You on the other hand were just left confused. Confused at how you seemingly were able to control your sisters height by simply accidentally measuring her above her current height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nToday, the now 5'1\" Emily had woken you up once again, seemingly more eager than ever to be measured again. Back already against the wall and standing tall, Emily awaited your marking. Marker in hand, you sigh and shake your head, smiling. Even if Emily had magically grew, she was the same as ever. As you are about to mark her height, you consider something, what if you were to mark below her height. She grew when you marked above her head, she logically, she might just shrink if you mark below her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeeing if Emily was paying attention to you, you mark just below an inch below her head. Determining that you were done, she twirled around to see the marking, only to turn towards you unamused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you trying to do, shrink me?\" She chuckles. You play it off by rolling your eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe, don't need you growing too much now.\" She playfully pushes you lightly as you both have a little laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon now, mark my actual height.\" She says, standing back up to the wall once more. You give in and decide to mark 2 inches above her head, watching as she grows to reach it, letting her know that she's 5'3\" now, which of course pleases her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Emily,\" you get her attention, \"did you notice or feel anything... strange when I marked your height?\" She looks at you confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, not really. Why? Did you do something?\" She smirks, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, just wondering.\" You wave it off. Emily shrugs after a moment before going to marvel at her new height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt seems that she doesn't notice the growth at all, seeming to think that she was that tall since she woke up. You guess that no matter how big you make her, she will never notice when you grow her, and think that the growth was natural. Finally accepting what you thought impossible, you go on with your day and living with your 'growing' sister.</span></div></div>",
