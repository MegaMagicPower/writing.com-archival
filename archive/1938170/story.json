            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Sometimes James really pissed Chad off, and today was such a day. The two brothers were twins. They shared almost everything, the same looks, height, and room. Chad was more muscular than James due to the fact that he loved sports while James loved videogames. Chad was bold and adventurous while James was shy and timid. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat had caused James to piss Chad off so bad was a violation of privacy. Chad had money he hid away in their room, and James had dug it up and stole it. Chad had caught him in the act, and James denied snooping in Chad's things. The boys began fighting, and it took both of their parents to sparate them. The boys were both punished, James more severely due to the fact he started the fight to begin with. As soon as he got the Chance, Chad snuck out and decided to explore the countryside to blow off some steam.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God James, sometimes you really piss me off!\" Chad grumbled to himself as he hiked through the medow behind his house. He wasn't sure how he'd sneak back in, but he'd find a way. Suddenly, he tripped and fell down into a hole in the ground. \"Agh! What the-- What just happened?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked around and saw strange patterns on the walls around him. He thought he recognized them from his history class, so he tried to get a better look. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God I wish I had payed attention in that class! I might be able to recognize these patterns and actually read them!\" Luckily there were pictures scratched onto the wall as well, giving Chad a better idea of what this place was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pictures seemed to depict a group of people worshipping what appeared to be one of their own. Another picture showed the person being worshipped putting his hands on one of the worshippers. He then appeared to vanish, with the people worshipping this new person. What was all this about?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext to the pictures was a small shrine of stone with a small, finger sized hole in it. Another inscription above it depicted a person inserting their finger into the hole, so Chad did the same. It was exciting! Being the explorer he was, Chad loved the idea of unearthing a new dicovery!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA surge of energy charged up Chad's hand as he inserted his finger into the hole. He suddenly became...aware. He felt like he knew exactly what had happened and he knew what he could do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could do almost anything he wanted!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a strange feeling. Its like he was told nonverbally exactly what to do to make anything he wanted to happen occur, and he knew his restrictions. He couldn't kill or change himself. He could change anything else he wanted about anybody or anything in the world!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst, he used his power to get out of the hole. Next, he planned what he wanted to do first. What to do?..</span></div></div>",

Chad and Luke had met in middle school and began  dating when one of their mutual friends told them both about how the other had a crush on them. Luke was similar to James in a few ways. Hhe was shy and had a tendency to blush if he met direct eye contact with someone. He liked to play videogames, but was also sporty. He and Chad were both on thhe school soccer team together. They had both tried for football, but Luke didn't make the cut on account of his size. Luke was more than a boyfriend to Chad, he was a best friend and was happy that both of their parents supported their relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing his powers to open a wormhole to Luke's home, Chad was at his doorstep in a matter of seconds. He knocked on the door, and Luke answered. \"Oh, hey Chad! What's up? Would you like to come in?\" Luke asked with a smile. \"Sure thing, Luke! I have the craziest thing to tell you.\" \"Well, lets go to the living room and you can tell me there. My parent's aren't home right now, just so you know, so majke sure you don't make a mess!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two sat down on Luke's couch as Chad explained what had happened that afternoon. Luke listened, occasionally nodding. \"So, hey,\" he asked when the story finished, \"You're like a god now almost?\" \"Sort of, I guess. I can do whatever I want now. Its bound to be super cool!\" \"Do something to me! Change me!\" \"How so? What to you want me to change about you? You know I think you're perfect the way you are!\" Chad smiled and Luke blushed bright red. \"Yeah, but you know I don't think I'm perfect. Far from it. Could you change something about me and make it so that everyone thinks I was always that way?\" \"I guess,\" Chad said, giving in, \"What do you ant me to change?\" \"I want you to make me-\"</span></div></div>",

How much are we talking about here?\" Chad asked, tilting his head slightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke shrugged, clutching his arm with his other hand. \"I dunno. I was thinking about another six inches or so? That would make me the second or third tallest boy in the school, I think.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding, Chad focused his powers on Luke, causing his boyfriend to gradually start inching up, making sure his clothes would grow with him (as much as his instincts urged him to otherwise). He passed six feet, and within fifteen seconds later got to the target height of 6' 4\", but Chad continued growing Luke taller, liking what he was seeing so far and not quite wanting to stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whoa, Chad!\" Luke exclaimed, looking down at his arms, legs, and torso that were stretching out before him, and he realized he was getting more than he asked for. \"Y-you can stop now!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad obliged, leaving Luke at a height of 6'7\". \"Now you ARE the tallest boy in the school,\" he said, grinning. Closing his eyes, he made sure history and everyone's minds were altered so that everyone but the two of them would think that Luke was naturally tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Y-yeah, I guess.\" Luke rose to his feet, nearly falling over at first, adjusting to his new height. Looking up, he stretched out his arm and easily was able to palm the ceiling, causing him to smile. As he did so, his t-shirt rode up, revealing the same lean stomach that Chad had seen before, just this time a bit bigger than he remembered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmiling, Chad reached out from his seated position and hugged Luke around his waist, pressing his face against Luke's stomach. He then stood up and compared his height to his new taller boyfriend, seeing that he only came up to just below his shoulder. \"I think that was a good suggestion, Luke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke chuckled, hugging Chad back. \"I'm just amazed at how your powers worked! Think of it; we could do anything from here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, I suppose we could!\" Chad nodded in agreement, as he thought of how he wanted to test his powers out next.</span></div></div>",

As soon as he went into the kitchen, Chad reached into Luke's mind. Not physically, mind you, mentally. He wanted to be certain that Luke was unaware of what Chad was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad focused closely on Luke's body, stretching it higher and filling it out as he grew. He didn't make Luke fatter or more muscular, he just filled out his frame so when he finished Luke wouldn't look like a stretched out peice of taffy. That would not be good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChad grew Luke until he was about 8 feet tall. Chad made sure to alter reality as well, and noticed that Luke's cielings were now just a bit higher. Chad wasn't quite sure if Luke remembered anything about his powers now, or if it was as if Chad had grown him the first time. He would have to wait and see what sort of effects this new growth had on reality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuke walked back in with a grin on his face. \"Here you go, little guy!\" He said cheerfully. For some reason, Chad found himself blushing. He wasn't sure why, but somehow being called little guy made him feel tingly inside. He loved it! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, what do you plan to do with these new powers? Havd you done anything with them yet?\" Ok, Luke remembered tgat Chad had powers but didn't remeber Chad growing him earlier. \"I don't kbow what I want to do,\" Chad replied, biting into one of the sandwiches Luke brought in, \"How about you decide?\" \"Ok,\" Luke said, \"Why don't we...\"</span></div></div>",

Both boys now had the same impressive phisique, and Luke should have no trouble getting on all the same sports teams as Chad. Both boys laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so small anymore, huh? Nobody will bother you in school now! Plus, we can easily do everything together now, even sports!\" Chad said with glee. \"Yeah! Thanks so much, Chad! But, wait.

Jennifer's eyes then brightened. School seemed so much easier now and she was grateful to Chad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJennifer said to him.  '  Let me read tonight on that History and we can go to that cave tomorrow.' Chad nodded but stayed with her. Jennifer and Chad discussed the other class topics in school, especially the ones that Chad had a harder time learning. He smiled, Jennifer was even becoming a gifted teacher at her own young age.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next day was the weekend. Jennifer walked to Chad's house first. They packed a picnic lunch and Chad took her to that cave.  He pointed to the ancient language on the wall and asked Jennifer if she understood it. He hoped that her increased  IQ and knowledge of that ancient history would help her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfidently she strolled to the wall in an attempt to read.

The thought of Jennifer with a big bust was followed by a thought with a wonderful round and big butt. Suddenly Jennifer also felt her panties digging into her hips. Her baggy pants were stretched by her expanding ass. Her hands moved from her bust to her butt. It grew until Jennifer looked like a model. The last thought Chad had was Jennifer without glasses.

Now it was like he had never been grounded!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe walked in through the front door and was greeted by his parents. \"Im so sorry James was so mean to you sweetie! He'll make it up to you by doing all your chores for a week, right James?\" Of course their mother would never punish either of the twins like that. Chad just wanted to be sure James was punished the way <i>he</i> thought James should be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Chad relaxed in the boys' room later that evening as James lugged all the laundry from their room on the second floor to the laundry room in the basement. James wasn't very strong, so it was a long, difficult process. Chad started to feel kinda bad for his brother. Sure he deserved it fot being a snoop, but he was still Chad's brother.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs James walked into the room for a third load, Chad made some minor reality changes. He grew James' muscles to slightly smaller than his own, giving him the body of a swimmer. He was no longer struggling to carry the laundry, and Chad could still overpower him if necessary. Plus, no one would notice the difference because Chad rewrote history to make it seem as if James had decided to begin weight lifting a few years back. Chad thought he was succh a saint. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure helping his brother was one thing, but what else to do today. The night was young and tomorrow was Saturday, so he could be out as long as he wanyed. Not like anyone could stop him anyway. What to do?..</span></div></div>",
