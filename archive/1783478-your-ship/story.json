The ship you were commanding was definately not the biggest ship in the navy, but it was a special one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI.F.O.H Blade-Class Frigate 'Rising Dawn'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, she is a beauty\" You said, walking onto the loading elevator which was currently extended. Several servicemen were struggling to tie down a large vehicle that resembled a tank onto the loading ramp, although the tank was perfectly fit for the job, the servicemen were rookies and it took far longer to finish the job than it would have taken a group of battle-seasoned veterans. One of the rookie servicemen noticed you standing in the corner of the large elevator and ushered the rest of them to hurry up. You almost felt like telling them to take their time and get it right. You were in no rush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, they finished and the loading ramp slowly started to ascend into the ship. You looked down before the gap closed and saw just how many people were rushing about to get this ship ready for departure. So many people who were going to be under your command. You looked around the hangar in which you were now in. It was basically divided into two parts, where the elevator was and where everything else was stored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis ship wasnt big enough for a battalion of fighters, but it did have two brand new landing craft which were outfitted with a few light weapons for ground combat. You walked out of the hangar and headed for the bridge. People were moving too and fro, installing the last bits of walling and making sure that everything was locked tight. As soon as they saw your rank though, they immediately stopped and saluted. You hated that. Saluting always drove you nuts. So you quickly waved them off and told them to keep working.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bridge was just as busy, as people finished installing the last few parts and ensured that all the systems were functioning and their expected capacity. A man was about to yell \"Captain On Deck\" but you silenced him. You were certain that the best way to see how your crew truly worked was to see them when they thought you were not around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left the bridge and headed for your own dormitory, conveniently located just outside the bridge. Sitting down in your own personal armchair which you had brought from your dormitory in the academy, you brought up the ship schematics to review them and help yourself memorise. It was uncommon for captains to change ships unless their previous ship was retiring or too badly damaged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer happily hummed into life and displayed the relevant information...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.F.O.H Blade-Class Frigate: 'Rising Dawn'<br>\r\nLength: 535 meters<br>\r\nWidth: 295 meters<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShip Weapons:<br>\r\n - One Type 8, Class 10 Forward Railgun<br>\r\n - Eight heavy point chainguns (Four per side)<br>\r\n - Four Munition Launch Tubes<br>\r\n - Four hangar defense turrets<br>\r\n - Forty Eight corridor defense turrets<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComplement:<br>\r\n- Total: 450<br>\r\n - Marines<br>\r\n - Operational Crew<br>\r\n - D899 Atmospheric Transport Landing And Surveillance Vehicle (ATLAS Craft) (4x)<br>\r\n - Orbital Insertion Pods (20x)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEngine:<br>\r\n - Four Viking Class Propulsion Engines<br>\r\n - Four Viking Class Maneuvering Thrusters<br>\r\n - One Intrepid Class Translight Drive (Estimated Life expectancy: 20 years)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShielding:<br>\r\n - Four Frontal AXEL Class Shield Emitters<br>\r\n - Two Rear AXEL Class Shield Emitters<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour ship was impressive, and you were more than happy to be in charge of 449 crew members - you being crew member #450: The Captain.<br>\r\nThe ship was the first of its class, with only another 19 expected. It was a special class, designed specifically to work alone with the intention of causing as much harm to the enemy while also being a legendary symbol of peace, small for its size, big on versatility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer bleeped at you, saying a new call was coming in from I.F.O.H Command.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Morning Captain. I see you seem to be still fitting in that armchair of yours quite well\" Fleet Commander Jason Horst said. He was your tutor briefly at the captains academy and you were quite glad that he was the first person to be talking to you.<br>\r\n\"Thank you Commander. There's nothing like a captains chair\"<br>\r\n\"Don't wear it down too well. You can replace a good chair easily\"<br>\r\n\"I'll keep that in mind\" You said happily. \"How can I help you today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, I'm sure your settling into your ship now, but I decided to give you the first chance to pick one of three missions since you'll be the first ship out of dock for the next few days. Your welcome to spend a few hours mulling over them but when you do decide, you'll be heading out as soon as everyone on that fine ship of yours gives you the green light.</span></div></div>",

You relaxed in your chair and mulled over the three different missions. You could take any of them at your point and the decision rested completely on you. The mission to spy on a potential threat looked really interesting, but you really wanted to see how your crew would handle in a potential firefight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was tradition that the first crew for a captain was actually picked by other captains, as you had done for other people in the academy. By all intentions, it was expected that captains receieved well trained crew, but the entire purpose was to ensure that crews knew how to work together despite never having seen each other before. It was a highly effective method that had been going on for years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou decided on the Supply Line Disruption mission and called Commander Horst back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought you'd take that one!\" He laughed. \"Seemed right up your alley. I'll send through more information now. Should be a really easy job, just go in there, tear up a few rebels and then tarry on back to the Ceaser Station in a nearby system for a post mission report. Enjoy yourself.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFleet Admiral Jason Horst was still laughing a bit when he finished the call. You two had gotten along extremely well in the academy, which explained why you were the first captain out of dock.<br>\r\nThe computer bleeped at you again. A face you recognised appeared. Osman, the guy in charge of engineering.<br>\r\n\"Captain, we're all ready down here for when you want to depart. Engines have been spinning happily for the past hour\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks Osman. We'll be leaving shortly\"<br>\r\n\"Sure thing, oh and... Captain?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes Osman?\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks for all this. I'm really glad to be working with you\"<br>\r\nThe call ended. Horst must have talked to some of the crew and exaggerated your skills.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother call came through in about ten minutes while you finished up reading the mission documents. This time it was one of the technicians who wasnt going to stay on the ship.<br>\r\n\"Captain? We're all done fitting everything around here and I'm the last one to leave. Your armoury officer told me to tell you he's busy checking the last of the weapons but apparently he's all happy. Communications has been running fine for the past few days - as evident by our call now. Anything else you need before I leave?\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks guys, you did a really good job here and I'm impressed. Go get yourself a drink in the mess\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks alot sir! Goodluck out there!\"<br>\r\nThe call ended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left your dormitory and headed into the bridge. The same guy from before managed to yell out Captain On Deck before you could silence him. You'd need to make a note of that. Everyone stopped looking at their console, stood up and saluted you.<br>\r\n\"Good morning everyone. Glad your all here. I'm Captain John Macree and I'm hoping we'll all get to know each other well and have some good missions. There's just three things I want to set down before we depart. First, I want you to all work at the same rate regardless of whether or not I am around. Second, I will do my best to not expect anything beyond what I believe your capable of. Lastly, the next person who yells \"Captain On Deck\" OR salutes me gets shot in the throat. I really hate that\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone blinked at you. The guy who yelled out before shrunk away slightly but you gave a light smile. If you didnt instil in this crew that YOU were in charge, this wasnt going to be a nice career.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helmsman\" You said, sitting in your chair in the middle of the room. \"Take us out\"<br>\r\n\"Aye sir\" Came the reply from a man in front. It would take you a while to learn everyones names.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt the engines rumble into life, the power in them pushing against the metal clamps which once held this ship together as it was constructed. The clamps disengaged and folded back into the ground, allowing your ship to rise into the air and fly high into the sky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou soon broke through the edge of the atmosphere, heading past one of the defensive platforms setup around Earth an extremely long time ago. It's slowly blinking lights signifying 'Please don't ram me'. You sailed on past it, far clearer than the minimum distance allowed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helmsman, set course for Sector X39, activate Translight Drive\" You commanded.<br>\r\n\"Aye sir\" He said again. The ship changed course, the rim of Earth appearing just below the main viewport outside the front of the bridge. A massive blue energy portal appeared infront of the ship, a swirl of blue and purple colours moving in and out. The ship moved forward, into the portal, dissappearing from Earth and the solar system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere, was the translight realm, where moving a few meters meant kilometers in the normal realm. It would take a total of two hours to reach the next system. Outside the viewport, everything was black, there was no indication that you were actually moving, just the Translight Drive humming away. Thats what scared people about this realm though, the total blackness - no stars - nothing. Many passenger cruisers actually automatically closed their windows in order to prevent people from becoming unsettled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tactical Officer, report\" You said.<br>\r\n\"Here and ready Sir\" Came the reply from your left.<br>\r\n\"Prepare the Forward Railgun for a single round upon exit of Translight. Make sure the point weapons are all ready for immediate firing upon exit\"<br>\r\n\"Cycling up the coils Sir. Point Weapons ready\" He replied. According to your report, your tactical officer was a keen fanatic on big explosions. \"Preparing for a battle are we Sir?\"<br>\r\n\"I'm actually more keen on how big of an explosion we can make in the first volley\" You said. The tactical officer beamed.<br>\r\n\"Uhh, Captain?\" The Helmsman said.<br>\r\n\"Yes Helmsman?\" You replied.<br>\r\n\"I just checked the Star Map, there's nothing there but an empty large asteroid orbiting a small sun. Several recon reports over the last few months confirm there being nothing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for a mission briefing then\" You smiled. Everyone turned to you. \"According to very recent intel, rebels have setup a small warehouse on the asteroid, which is cutting several of their supply runs in half. We destroy the warehouse and we put a big kink in their plans. Recon also suggests that the rebels don't know that we know about it yet, so the depot will be extremely lightly manned, only a few point guns which we can easily stay out of effective range of\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone nodded in response, happily understanding why you were going there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour journey was up and you exited Translight as swiftly as you had entered it, approaching the warehouse directly from above. Hopefully they had some terrible sensor equipment.<br>\r\n\"Tactical Officer. Fire when ready\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou felt a massive discharge as the Forward Railgun fired above you, slightly shaking the ship. The projectile was like a bullet, going exponentially faster through each coil. Except unlike a bullet, this was a small nuke specially designed for Forward Rail Guns. Since space doesnt transmit sound, all you saw was the fiery explosion of the warehouse on the asteroid as it seperated from the surface, pieces drifting into space.</span></div></div>",

It was as if a massive discharge of something had hit the ship and knocked it off course.<br>\r\n\"Captain! There's an unidentified object behind us and it's charging its main weapons!\" The helmsman said.<br>\r\n\"Sensors can't see the target but visual sightings can confirm its existence!\" Someone else cried out.<br>\r\n\"Captain, we've lost the main railgun for now, but three point weapons are still active\"<br>\r\n\"Fire!\" You yelled. \"If you cant target them with the computer, bring up a camera and shoot them out of space!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour weapons officer wasnt hesitant to bring all three guns to bear. They began spinning and firing volleys of bullets at the rogue ship, which was caught unawares and didnt have enough time to raise its shields. The bullets tore through the hull, moving form the front right down to the rear. They must have hit a critical system, because the engines suddenly exploded in a massive cloud of yellow and blue fire. There was nothing worthwhile of the ship left to scan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Everyone okay?\" You asked, still tense.<br>\r\n\"Damage reports still coming in\" An officer said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain? What the hell was that?\" Osman in engineering came over the comms.<br>\r\n\"Another ship that we didnt expect... It's dead now\"<br>\r\n\"Well could you warn me next time you expect something like that?\"<br>\r\n\"Will do\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Minimal physical damage to the ship. The weapon was an EMP weapon designed to knock us dead in the water. Fortunately their targeting was off a little so we got lucky. Most systems are coming back only but the EMP also caused a few electrical shocks to occur throughout the ship. Minor burns are being treated in the medical wing. Except for one person.\"<br>\r\n\"One person? Who?\" You asked.<br>\r\n\"Lt. Quentus Markuss\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes went wide. Your best friend had been hit by an electrical blast.<br>\r\n\"Helmsman, set course for Ceaser Station, activate Translight Drive. I'll be in medical\"<br>\r\n\"Aye Sir\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked slowly out of the bridge. You didnt know why Q hadnt come to the bridge yet, but he must have been busy with something. You arrived shortly in the medical bay, but two marines refused your entry.<br>\r\n\"I'm Captain here, let me in\" You instructed firmly.<br>\r\n\"We're aware sir. Under any other conditions, we'd let you in\" One of the Marines replied. He almost looked scared to disobey your order.<br>\r\n\"We'll then why wont you let me?\"<br>\r\n\"Lt. Quentus asked us to stop you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was as good a reason as any.<br>\r\n\"Have his doctor send me the medical report\"<br>\r\n\"Will do Captain\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo hours passed as you headed to Ceaser Station. The medical report came in, though the doctor was hesitant to give it. Apparnetly Q was adamant that you couldnt see him in this state.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Captain, but it doesnt look good. The electrical dischage hit him directly in the face. There's a lot of burnt skin and although he'll recover just fine, there's going to be permanent scarring on his face, both arms and his left leg.<br>\r\n\"How big was the discharge?\" You asked.<br>\r\n\"Honestly? I'm surprised he's alive. I'm not sure what speech you gave to inspire him, but it sure must have been a good one\"<br>\r\n\"Mhm... Thanks Doc\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother hour passed before Q's Doctor called you back.<br>\r\n\"Lt. Quentus is awake now, he's asked to speak to you\"<br>\r\n\"Put him through - though I'd like to know why I cant see your camera\"<br>\r\n\"He asked for it\"<br>\r\nYou sighed. There was no point in fighting Q on this - especially after what happened to his family.<br>\r\n\"How you doing?\" You asked, trying to fake a smile. You knew he could see you.<br>\r\n\"Glad your okay\" Came a hoarse voice, followed by a large cough.<br>\r\n\"Apparently your going to make a full recovery\"<br>\r\n\"Your okay and still a terrible liar. I know what happened to me.\" He said.<br>\r\nYour smile faded slightly.<br>\r\n\"Looks like I'm already out of the game\" Q said. \"Havent even seen out of the front of the bridge yet\"<br>\r\n\"I'm not giving up on you\"<br>\r\n\"Oh don't do that. Once I can walk again we'll see if I can come back\" He said. The coughing returned, this time even worse and his doctor hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter arriving at Ceaser Station, the techs there had a quick look at the ship and then said it was fine. After sending your report to Earth, Commander Horst quickly phoned you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry about what happened to Q\" He started. \"We are aware of the type of ship you encountered but didnt have any confirmed reports until now. We honestly didnt expect something like this to happen so far from the front lines\"<br>\r\n\"I know\" You said, biting your lips.<br>\r\n\"High command has decided to rule heavily in your favour on this, due to the unusual circumstances. Unfortunately, you'll need a new second-in-command until Q is back on his feet\"<br>\r\n\"Something tells me I wont like this\"<br>\r\n\"There's only one person nearby who can fit the job. And to top it off, she's currently sitting in the brig of Ceaser Station.\" Horst said.<br>\r\n\"This is all almost too convenient\" You muttered.<br>\r\n\"If you dont want her, your welcome to come back to Earth and find another. I want to warn you though, she's literally one of the best out of the academy\"<br>\r\n\"If she's so good, why's she in the brig?\"<br>\r\n\"How about we make your next mission to tame her? She's a wild girl, hates the chain of command but is a bloody good tactician and incredibly smart.\"<br>\r\n\"Whats her name?\" You asked.<br>\r\n\"Lt. Alanna Jamieson\" Horst said, biting his lip</span></div></div>",

Just remember her bark is far worse than her bite\"<br>\r\nHorst logged off and you thought about your wonderful new task. You left your dorm and walked onto the bridge.  \"I'm going on the station for an hour or so. Helmsman, your in charge\"<br>\r\n\"Okay sir\" The Helmsman said.<br>\r\n\"And I think its about bloody time I learnt your name...\"<br>\r\n\"Third Officer Samuel Jackson\" He said. He didnt expect at all for the captain to care about his name.<br>\r\n\"Alright. And, Tactical Officer?\"<br>\r\n\"Yes?\"<br>\r\n\"Name...\"<br>\r\n\"Oh. Fourth Officer Ashley Wilson\"<br>\r\n\"Excellent. I'll be back soon\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou left the ship through the docking bay and Ceaser Station's First Officer welcomed you on board.<br>\r\n\"So, ye gonna talk some sense into the lass in the Brig aye?\" He asked as you walked. His voice held a thick scottish accent.<br>\r\n\"Indeed. Apparently she's my new second in command\"<br>\r\nThe Officer laughed. \"Well then! Your in for a right treat you are! She can't go ten minutes withoot runnin' her mouth off! I'd have shown her what space was really like if I'd been aloowed!\"<br>\r\n\"I have a feeling I'll be thinking the same thing all too soon\" You muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt only took a short while to reach the brig. Alanna was sitting at the back of her cell, the only person in the entire brig.<br>\r\n\"Oh, look who we have here\"<br>\r\n\"So your Lt. Alanna Jamieson\"<br>\r\n\"And a right tootin correct you are! May I have the honour of knowning who I am speaking to?\" She asked sarcastically, curtesying as she said honour.<br>\r\n\"I'm Captain Macree. We need to talk\"<br>\r\n\"Oh, no first name basis for you? Lovely\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Officer of Ceaser Station laughed. \"Well, ye seem to be gettin' aloong quite nicely! I'll wait outside till ye make a decision?\"<br>\r\n\"Sure\" You say, without turning to him.<br>\r\nThe Officer walked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, all alone now are we?\" Alanna asked. \"How lovely.\"<br>\r\n\"Stow it\" You said firmly.<br>\r\n\"Excuse me? There's thick bars between us, I dont think words will do anything here\"<br>\r\nYou stared deep into Alanna's deep blue eyes, trying to work out exactly what caused such a terrible personality for someone with such high qualifications.<br>\r\n\"There's something unique about you\"<br>\r\n\"You too\" She says, rolling her eyes. \"You havent yet threatened to put me on the firing line yet. I'd advise you to go back and get a few more years training and then come and talk\"<br>\r\n\"Not that. Here's what I think. Your a simple girl who enrolled at the academy to hopefully fly a ship. Except your smarts eventually became a problem when all the academy teachers started to think too much of you and all suddenly everything comes flooding down on you because everyone thinks too damn much of a girl who rolls her tongue like a fourth grader. You like to insult others and riducle everyone in the general hopes that you can just fade away because ultimately your hoping to find a peace you sought from the beginning that you keep seeking but will ultimately never find. There is no hope for you, only a painful death awaits\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat hit Alanna hard. She shrunk back. Nobody had ever understood her quite like you had just done. Phew, that took some effort.<br>\r\n\"So what!\" She yelled. \"Nobody cares about ME! Everyone just cares about my body and what I can do!\"<br>\r\n\"I care about you\" You said quietly.<br>\r\n\"Nobody ever cares about my feelings or my dreams or what I really want to do! They just want me to stand in line, salute like everyone else, yell like all the other captains, BE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE! I hate that!\"<br>\r\n\"Well for the record, I hate saluting as well\" You said. That stopped her.<br>\r\n\"Really?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"Yea. I hate giving speeches as well. What I really like is a good crew member with good skills. But if they've got a boring simple mind then I dont want them. I'd rather have an interesting crew member with good skills rather than a boring crew member with amazing skills - any day\"<br>\r\nAlanna blinked.<br>\r\n\"So here's your options\" You said. \"Either you come with me, or you can stay and rot here. I might annoy you sometimes, but I can at least promise that you wont have to salute me once\"</span></div></div>",

You could finally see what she really looked like, as the back of her cell was swathed in near complete darkness.<br>\r\nHer shoulder length black hair was disheveled and her dusty uniform had a rip down the side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do I know that its worth coming with you?\" She asked. Now close up to the bars, you noticed that her height only reached up to your eyes, meaning she had to look up a bit.<br>\r\n\"Thats your catch. You don't know. I've only just had my new ship for nearly a day now and i've only had one mission. Either you come with me or you can rot in here. By the looks of it, you've been her a while\"<br>\r\n\"One month in two days - all on bread, old fruit and a little water. They don't send many supplies out this way\" She said with a harsh edge in her tone. Alanna chewed her lip as she weighed the decision. Putting aside other events, she'd probably be attached to you and the ship for the remainder of her career.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, I'll come\" She said.<br>\r\n\"Sounds good. I'm pretty sure there's a tailor onboard who can get you a new uniform\"<br>\r\n\"Whats wrong with my current one?\" She asked, looking at you right in the eyes. You didn't need to respond, you just pointed to the painstakingly obvious rip. \"I'm not a fashionista, if there's a slight dishevel in someones uniform becuase they've been working hard, thats fine by me. But I don't think you'll get away with a rip that big on any ship\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turned and left before she could respond.<br>\r\n\"Aye! Your doone early laddie! So, we goin' ta flush her out into space?\" Ceaser Stations C.O asked.<br>\r\n\"No, she's coming with me\" You said flatly.<br>\r\nThe C.O's face dropped slightly. \"Good luck with the lass. She'll really make you work for your money\"<br>\r\n\"Mhm, I've got a feeling that will happen\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou walked back inside with the C.O and he unlocked her door. Stepping out with a graceful walk that would have looked smart if not for the ripped uniform, she followed you back to your ship.<br>\r\n\"So, I never actually found out what actually got you put in the brig for\" You mentioned.<br>\r\n\"Punched my Captain in the face\"<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry?\" You asked in surprise.<br>\r\n\"Was only in space for a month before this. He'd made a multitude of obvious tactical mistakes that cost the lives of so many men. Nobody ever thought him cut out as being a captain but there were rumors he bought his way in\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was all you needed to know. You called the bridge on your communicator.<br>\r\n\"Helmsman here\" Came the response from Officer Jackson.<br>\r\n\"Random question, we got a tailor on board?\" You asked. There was a brief silence on board.<br>\r\n\"Uhh... yea, one down on C-Deck\"<br>\r\n\"Send him... or her... whatever- to the airlock\"<br>\r\n\"Right away sir\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou arrived at the airlock connection your ship to the station in a matter of minutes. Your ships tailor in question was a short, gaunt balding man in a uniform that seemed to be pressed so hard it was the only thing keeping him standing up.<br>\r\n\"Captain, how may I assist you?\" He asked in a wrly manner. You wondered if the whole crew was going to be as unique as him.<br>\r\n\"Take this woman and get her fitted for a Second Officer uniform\"<br>\r\n\"Pardon me sir, isn't your second officer Lt. Quentus?\" He asked, tiliting his thin bald head slightly.<br>\r\n\"Was - after that last mission, he took a direct hit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tailor nodded and quickly took Alanna by the hand. She quickly retracted her arm in disgust but he reached further forward and dragged her down the corridor towards the back of the ship. Meanwhile, you headed back to the bridge.<br>\r\n\"Captain, Fleet Commander Horst want to speak to you\" Officer Wilson said.<br>\r\n\"In my dorm\" You said, immediately turning to leave. Heading out of the Bridge, you entered your dorm where Horst was already waiting.<br>\r\n\"So... I assume you took her?\" He asked with a wry smile.<br>\r\n\"Getting her a cleaner uniform as we speak\"<br>\r\n\"Excellent. I always knew I could count on you.\" He said. \"I'm forward you your next mission documents. I'd like you to bear in mind that this whole mission is likely to take a week, perhaps even longer depending on the results\"<br>\r\n\"What am I getting into sir?\" You asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sending you to the __________ System where you will immediately hide on the darkside of one of the planets - your free to pick which. Monitor which ships go in and out of the system but ensure that you do not approach ANY ship for any reason\"<br>\r\n\"Sounds easy\" You said, nodding in agreement\"<br>\r\n\"Record everything, any ship that goes in or out, anything unusual that previous recon didn't pick up\"<br>\r\n\"Will do sir\" You say happily. Horst nodded and hung up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe relevant mission documents came through, indicating that the system you were travelling to was frequently traversed by rebel ships. Hopefully, this should be interesting. But where did Fleet Commander Horst send you?</span></div></div>",

You got up and headed for the bridge.<br>\r\n\"Helmsman, set a course for the Rammina System. Activate Translight Drive\"<br>\r\n\"Yes Sir\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou once again entered the blackness of Translight. Lt Alanna entered the bridge only moments later. She stared at the portal, unfazed by it's inner murky darkness and outer swelling colours.<br>\r\n\"I suppose you've done this before a few times\" You muttered to her.<br>\r\n\"Five or six times...\" She said. \"You get used to it after a while\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlanna's hair had been combed and tidied up so it actually looked quite nice, reaching down to her shoulders with a perfect length cut all the way around. It seems your tailor also specialized as a hair stylist. That might be useful. Her uniform had also been replaced by a much new and better pressed version, the large rip now completely gone as if it had never existed.<br>\r\n\"Officers, my ready room\" You commanded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour Helm, Tactical and Comms officer filed into the small meeting room which was situated just behind the bridge. Alanna followed in close behind.<br>\r\n\"Sorry Sir, whose this?\" Your Tactical Officer asked. Alanna shot a dirty look at him.<br>\r\n\"Your new Second-In-Command. Play nice, she bites\" You said. Alanna smirked at that last remark. The Comms Officer went slightly white in the face.<br>\r\nYou brought up a 3D star map of the Rammina System on the HoloTable.<br>\r\n\"This is where we drop out Sir\" Officer Jackson said, pointing a red dot that appeared and was then replaced by a 3D copy of your own ship.<br>\r\n\"We're going to be sitting around here for a week\" You said. \"Command wants to know if the rebels bring anything interesting through this system\"<br>\r\n\"Fun...\" Alanna said sarcastically. \"One whole week of sitting on our butts\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe other three officers looked at her as if you ought to chop her head off. But you ignored her.<br>\r\n\"Hide behind one of the planets and we'll begin our sensor sweep\" You said.<br>\r\n\"That one looks like it will give a good range for sensor sweeping\" Officer Jackson said, touching a yellow-orange planet that flashed red when he put his finger on it.<br>\r\n\"Only if we want to get radiation poisoning\" Alanna said, raising an eyebrow and frowning. Jackson looked at her in confusion. She sighed. \"If you'll permit me <i>Captain</i>, this planet is far better. The planet Jackson suggested is well too close to the sun - the radiation will kill us within a day. I'd advise this planet.\" She said, pointing to a further out planet that was blue. \"It'll be just within sensor range for the next three weeks and the distance will give us better cover\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlanna dragged the holographic ship over to the planet where it automatically started orbiting it.<br>\r\n\"Good enough\" You said. \"Jackson, set a course for the second planet from the sun and plot an orbit that keeps us on the opposite side of the rebel supply line\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone nodded and left, save for you and Alanna. When they had gone, she turned to you. The holographic solar system was the only thing seperating you two.<br>\r\n\"He's not an idiot, most helmsman aren't fully aware of the distance you can get to a sun before it starts to kill you - just like my last Captain.\" She said, raising an eyebrow.<br>\r\n\"I'd rather you not call me a captain in such a sarcastic manner though.\" You said.<br>\r\n\"Apologies <i>Captain</i>\" She said, with the same air of sarcasm. There was a dead silence in the room for five minutes before she burst out laughing. \"Relax, I'm kidding\" She said, walking out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entrance into the Rammina System was an easy one and your helmsman set a course for the planet that Alanna had suggested. Thirty minutes after achieving a safe orbit, Alanna worked with some tactical crew to convert a missile and turn it into a remote sensor. It was deployed successfully, giving you some extra sensor quality.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree days into the scan and you noticed that the crew was getting just a little restless. Only twenty five ships had entered the system, each one a rebellion ship. While most of them were cargo ships, visual shots confirmed that they were of an unknown designation, twice as long as the usual rebel cargo ship that was encountered during missions.<br>\r\n\"Send this back to Earth, see if they recognise it\" You said, giving the pictures to your Comms Officer. He nodded and began scanning them.</span></div></div>",

The crew's restlessness was evident, but didn't appear problematic. To combat a potential increase however, you had your second, Alanna, organise for a section of the hangar to temporarily be converted into a soccer pitch for off duty personnel. Despite a few bruises from hitting the hard metal, everyone's spirits almost immediately increased and they appeared much happier at work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlanna, however, never seemed to show whether or not she was happy about the workings of the ship. She always had her work and reports done first, making it look easy. Though, you suspected that her previous work was alot more mind-numbing.<br>\r\n\"So what WAS your previous assignment like?\" You asked, sitting down at a table infront of her one night at dinner. Cutting through the tender chicken with your knife and fork, you made a mental note that the cook should definately be complemented on his work.<br>\r\nAlanna held the piece of bread just in front of her mouth, about to eat it but instead consigning to twisting the roll in her fingers. \"My previous assignment was back-breaking work for a different captain, very different to you. Why are you interested?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"I want to know about my crew. I can't be expected to work efficiently with them if I don't know how their own mind works\"<br>\r\n\"Most captains don't care about their crew - it's below them\"<br>\r\n\"I'm different\"<br>\r\n\"Evidently\"<br>\r\n\"You accepted coming\"<br>\r\n\"You asked\"<br>\r\n\"I think I made a reasonable offer\"<br>\r\n\"So you think. But make sure you keep order around here. If people forget about the chain of command - so-it's-called, there won't be a captain for this ship\" Alanna finished, swallowing the roll in it's entirety without biting it once.<br>\r\n\"Is there something your not telling me?\"<br>\r\n\"Well, I can't speak for the crew. But for me personally, you know I don't like it when people order me around\" She said, locking her eyes on you.<br>\r\n\"I'm all to aware of that. Hey, at least I don't make you salute me\"<br>\r\n\"I wouldnt do it if I had too\"<br>\r\n\"Which I suppose is part of the reason for your incarceration on Ceaser Station?\"<br>\r\n\"Perhaps\"<br>\r\n\"Your mysterious\"<br>\r\n\"I've told you more than think\"<br>\r\n\"Evidently\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat word seemed to almost bite Alanna. She knew perfectly well that you were definately a match for her and her words, able to finish any scentence as soon as you wanted. This would be an interesting game. You sighed.<br>\r\n\"How goes the sensor scans?\" You asked.<br>\r\n\"We're at dinner. You want to discuss work?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"I'm trying to make conversation\"<br>\r\n\"Your not very good at it\"<br>\r\n\"But here we are, talking\" You say, locking your eyes with her at the perfect time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou had a fair point in that matter. Alanna smirked lightly.<br>\r\n\"Seems your not as bad as my first impression\"<br>\r\n\"And what was your first impression?\"<br>\r\n\"Repugnant\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rolled your eyes, that was how she viewed most captains, if not all.<br>\r\n\"And what do you make of me now?\" You asked.<br>\r\n\"Still thinking\" She finished. Standing up, she walked away with her tray, a slight sway in her step. A passing junior officer suddenly had her plate in his hands, and for a second, was about to call out unfair when Alanna suddenly turned around to you: \"Take my advice\" She said. \"Pick something better next time\". Winking, she turned around and left.<br>\r\nThe junior officer looked at you for a second and then went to dispose of the plate.</span></div></div>",

We've got some new orders for you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm ready, so is the crew\"<br>\r\n\"Excellent. Next time you see an unusual freighter come through, we want you to capture it. Learn anything you can about it, including where the darn thing is going and why\"<br>\r\n\"Sir?\" You asked. \"Anything specific we are looking for?\"<br>\r\n\"Excellent question. Anything you can find: Navigation data, ship information and whatever information you can find on whats in the cargo hold. Your welcome to use whatever means you deem neccecary to get the information, but just make sure you get it BEFORE you blow a ship up. While we believe they don't know about you yet, they are sure to come looking when one of the freighters doesn't turn up\"<br>\r\n\"Thanks sir. We'll get right on it\"<br>\r\n\"Excellent. When you get the information, high-tail it back to Earth\" The man said, hanging up straight afterwards.<br>\r\n\"Never a goodbye\" You murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving your dorm, you called your officers into the ready-room and explained your plan. While your Comms officer, Tactical Officer and Helmsman asked numerous questions, Lt Alanna stayed silent in the shadows, either percieving the plan as being an utter failure or potentially a complete success. You hoped for the latter. When everything was complete, all your officers left to prepare except for Alanna.<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" You asked.<br>\r\n\"I've never seen this strategy before, it's a new one. So I'll have an opinion afterwards\"<br>\r\n\"If we all work hard, we'll all get dinner tonight\"<br>\r\n\"That's what all captains say, right before they die\"<br>\r\n\"Then it's time to break that saying\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEveryone was on full alert when the next freighter arrived in the system. It was acompanied by a small corvette which seemed to boast more guns than defensive capabilities. Approaching from the dark-side of the planet, the Helmsman aimed for a perfect line intersecting the corvette. The Railgun had already been charged and your Tactical Officer fired off a round, decimating the ship into smithereens before it had a chance to raise it's shields.<br>\r\nThe freighter was about to bug out, but a smooth aim across it's engine's by your tactical officer quickly put a stop to that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe freighter was dead in the water, it's guard destroyed. Launching from the hangar, you, Alanna and five marines quickly latched onto the entry door with your small craft. The armoury officer had quickly outfitted your unit with a few assault rifles and one grenade between you. The marines stood a better chance at fighting due to their body armour but you figured that Alanna had something up her sleeve, especially since she ditched the rifle in favour of two pistols.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something about this woman that you hadnt quite fully figured out yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForcing your way through the door by using a cutting laser, it fell down with a massive clang.<br>\r\n\"Remember, pick your targets\" You told the marines. The marine captain nodded and they burst through, ready to pick off anyone with a gun. You hoped that the crew of this ship would be able to stay alive, as you might need them to access certain computer functions.<br>\r\nAll of a sudden, two guards appeared out of nowhere, firing at the marines. Their aim was terrible however and everyone managed to duck behind pillars and walls before they were shot.<br>\r\nGunfire was exchanged between your party and theirs. Here it was discovered why Alanna favoured the pistols as she quickly cut down the two guards while the marines distracted them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWorking carefully but quickly to the bridge, one of the marines kicked the door down and they all filed through, forcing the crew to their knees.<br>\r\n\"Captains not here, sir\" The marine captain said. \"Looks like he ran away\"<br>\r\n\"Alright. Secure this area, make sure we don't get jumped and I'll start searching\" You say, starting to work on the computers. Fortuantely, this was one of your strengths. Alanna also got to work, holstering her weapons. The marines changed their position, ready for anyone to come running but also making sure the crew didn't do anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe plans you discovered were easy to access, but you checked that you were not being duped by some other well hidden file. Most of the schematics shown didn't make any sense, but it looked like this ship was delivering parts for a much bigger ship that was being constructed. Downloading all the details onto a seperate harddrive, you decided the next best thing was to go to the hangar just to make sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo of the marines guarded you and Alanna, but you figured that Alanna could probably take care of the both of you quite easily. Entering the hangar, the details you found on the computer confirmed what looked like parts to a ship.<br>\r\n\"I don't recognise this\" Alanna said, sifting through some information on a computer terminal. \"Seems like some new stuff they are building\"<br>\r\n\"Alright, I've got what we need, including visual confirmation. Let's fall back to our ship\"<br>\r\n\"Yes sir\" A marine said. He called the captain on his radio and you all quickly moved back to your ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Captain, what about the crew?\" The Marine Captain asked.<br>\r\n\"I've rigged one of the terminals\" You replied, lightly smiling.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry?\"<br>\r\n\"Tell ya what, come to the bridge and you'll see\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on your own ship, you headed straight for the bridge. \"Helmsman, set a direct course for Earth, Activate Translight drive. Begin when I arrive\"<br>\r\n\"Course laid in Captain\" came the response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Marine Captain joined you on the bridge, interested in what you were talking about. The helmsman engaged the translight drive and you slowly moved in. But, just before you dissappeared from view, the cargo ship repowered up and...</span></div></div>",

Someone onboard, desperate to escape, had powered up the engines except you had already caused an unstable reaction inside the main reactor. The result was an immediate explosion upon ignition.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Marine Captain smiled and shook his head as he left the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce your ship docked with Serenada Station high above your beautiful planet Earth, you personally handed over all the information you had gleaned from the vessel. Horst wasnt there to greet you, but a junior officer was.<br>\r\n\"Hello Captain. Would you follow me please?\"<br>\r\n\"Certainly. Where do I deliver my package?\" You asked.<br>\r\n\"Where I am taking you\"<br>\r\n\"Lead the way then\" You said happily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe junior officer led you through the station to a large meeting hall, it was one of those new ones with the holographic projector installed in the middle of the table. Several men, none of whom you recognised, were already seated.<br>\r\n\"Glad you could join us\" The man at the head of the table said. \"Please take a seat captain.\"<br>\r\nThere was one empty chair roughly near the middle section of the table, so you sat down.<br>\r\n\"If you could insert your datachip then we can review your data. I'm sure the contents will be very interesting.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou pulled the chip from your pocket and inserted it into the Holoprojector. Immediately, several files and blueprints started showing up, scanning rapidly through the various files.<br>\r\n\"So this is what you recovered?\" He asked.<br>\r\n\"Indeed sir. I had a quick check through the logs and I decided that there was no way we could actually keep the ship. The rebels had rigged the ship to blow should it have strayed off course. If I had the time, I could have sent a team on board to clear it but with the number of ships passing through the area, that would not be easy to conceal\"<br>\r\n\"Your decision was well made. I believe what your recovered has far greater usefulness than the ship itself\"<br>\r\nYou looked at the man, only half understanding what he was talking about.<br>\r\n\"But, formalities aside, I believe you don't know who I am yet. Pleasure to meet you captain, I'm Admiral Lance of the 252th Devision. We'll likely be working together for a long time in this war\"<br>\r\n\"Sir\" You said, acknowledging him.<br>\r\n\"Anyway, onto business\" He said, turning back to the Holoprojector. He pushed several buttons on a small pad in front of him and the holoprojector briefly flickered. It backtracked and then start showing up simple blueprints, what looked like basic smelting principles. But then the documents suddenly became increasingly complicated, until once such plan revealed everything...</span></div></div>",

You remained silent, studying everything you could on the screen.<br>\r\n\"This confirms what The Viserelay stumbled upon two months ago\" Another man down the other end said. \"If their initial scouting is correct, it's vastly increased in size\"<br>\r\n\"More likely, their closer to finishing it\" Lance said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou were still confused, but decided that now still was not the time to speak. Another man reached his hand out and touched a point with two of his fingers joined together. Then he seperated his fingers which caused the image to zoom into a section of the ship.<br>\r\n\"I recognise those guns, a new model used by the rebel which we have desigated as RED-X091. We've only encountered a few and they have extremely powerful damage potential. However this ship appears to be equipped by about one hundred. It seems to be able to take on a whole fleet by itself and come out unscathed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance looked hard at the weapons and you wondered if the scar on the left side of his face had faced off against it. His demeanour certainly changed at the mention of it.<br>\r\n\"Then we can't face it in battle. Especially with the main fleet divided. I propose that we sent in a sabotage team to take advantage of the fact that it isnt finished.\" He said.<br>\r\n\"With respect Admiral. This ship may not be finished, but the weapons and engines appear to be online. Getting inside will be extremely difficult and getting out will likely be harder. Our only chance is a surgical strike with ships\" An older woman said. She had the sort of tone in her voice that suggested she looked down on Admiral Lance.<br>\r\n\"Your suggestion is illogical Vamee. You yourself said that the weapons were online. Any ships that entered the area would likely be cut down in seconds. Unless you want my own division to go on a suicidal run\" Lance said, annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVamee maintained a grim silence. Her intentions were immediately obvious to everyone.</span></div></div>",

You ignored them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is like the Corbulo run that we had to do in basic\"<br>\r\n\"In basic, if you got shot you could try again\" Lance said, looking straight at you without any expression. You suspected something but held back asking.<br>\r\n\"In basic, if we got shot, we didn't do anything for a week which drove us nuts. Then we learned how to not get shot\"<br>\r\nLance smiled slightly at the corners of his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How is it like the Corbulo Run then? He asked. \"Show me\"<br>\r\n\"Sorry, but I'm not familiar with that one\" Someone asked. A few others nodded. They appeared quite a bit older than you.<br>\r\n\"It's a new one as far as I know\" You explained. \"Part of the advanced training for infiltration and sabotage. The course is a month long and it's not easy. But after two tries, I managed to get me and a partner in there and cause quite an explosion. Nearly got kicked out for hurting several cadets.\"<br>\r\n\"Oh?\" Someone else asked.<br>\r\n\"The basic instruction is to get into a ship\" You said, manipulating the holoprojector to show your plan.<br>\r\n\"First, you need to find a not so obvious gaping hole in the ship. Hangars are too well guarded and it's blatantly obvious that a docking connector won't work. But what about the ship vents?\" You asked rehtorically. \"We had to get inside a CCR Capital ship, each of which has a small maintenance entrance right at the back, between the four engines.<br>\r\n\"You'll be cooked alive\" The same man said.<br>\r\n\"Not so. There's a small section of space where the heat actually cancels itself out, right in the middle. And, since the engines arent actually doing anything, they'll be idle, just like having a stove cooker on the lowest possible setting before you can turn it off.\" You continued. \"The maintenance hatches arent well guarded because almost nobody knows about them\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou brought the diagram up on the massive rebel ship and showed the everyone on the holoprojector.<br>\r\n\"The engines would create a big bang, but there's alotta people down there. Fortunately, I know a few things about vents, which has a large entrance right near the maintenance hatch. We can literally walk through some of them which I plan on doing. After a fair walk, we reach centre of the ship.\"<br>\r\n\"Which is the main power relay\" Lance said quietly.<br>\r\n\"Cause an overload...\" You started.<br>\r\n\"...By feeding the power back into the distributor...\" Lance said.<br>\r\n\"...which eventually feeds back into the engine...\" Vamee added.<br>\r\n\"...blowing the ship to kingdom come\" You then finished.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance looked at everyone else around the table, they had no problems with this plan.<br>\r\n\"Very well Captain, the job is yours. Who's your partner on this mission?\" Lance asked. You smiled lightly.<br>\r\n\"Are you kidding? I'm taking Lt. Jamieson.\"<br>\r\n\"I know that she got assigned to you and I'd advise against it. She's a real problem from what I hear\"<br>\r\n\"I know, she's a got a problem with everything. But maybe a little violence is what I need\" You chuckled.</span></div></div>",

Shaking Admiral Lance's hand, you then walked out of the meeting room back to your ship, the junior officer once again guiding you through the maze of halls in the station.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Helmsman, you've been transmitted co-ordinates, take us there and find us a nice place to hide. Jamieson, my ready room\" You said, walking onto the bridge and immediately walking out.<br>\r\nYour helmsman immediately plotted the course and took you into Translight. Alanna signed off something on a datapad and handed it to one of your junior officers who prompty left the bridge. She then followed you into your ready room to find out what was going on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is a little forward\" She said, leaning against the wall. \"You havent even told us where we are going\"<br>\r\n\"As far as everyone High Command is concerned, we are actually the only two allowed to know what this mission is about.\" You explained. Walking over to the holoprojector, you brought up the schematics for the new Rebel Vessel. Alanna whistled.<br>\r\n\"That's big\" She said. \"We going to blow it up?\"<br>\r\n\"Knew you'd say that, and yes we are. Gonna blow the whole thing to smithereens\"<br>\r\n\"Judging by the side weapons, our ship won't get close\"<br>\r\n\"We can't use our ship, it's going to hide at a nearby planet or something. Us two will then take a small landing craft with a single pilot.\" You said. Then you proceeded to explain your plan about using the rear maintenance hatch to access the large vents on the ship.<br>\r\n\"There's a hatch there? I didn't know that\"<br>\r\n\"Large ships have them, including CCR Capital ships. I discovered one when I had to get on board for a training excercise.\" You said. \"Figured this might work just as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlanna looked at the ship, occassionally changing the view to look at different angles. \"This is an impressive ship, but it doesn't look like the standard rebel design\" She said after a while.<br>\r\n\"What do you mean?\"<br>\r\n\"Their ships are more rugged... strong, but rugged. This ship is sleek. I.F.O.H sleek.\"<br>\r\n\"You think the designs were stolen?\" You asked.<br>\r\n\"Wouldnt surprise me. I'll see you in the hangar bay.\" She said, walking out of the ready room. You'd never understand that woman.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTen long hours later, you arrived at the co-ordinates you had been given. It was a star not previously plotted on I.F.O.H maps.<br>\r\n\"What is that thing?\" Your tactical officer asked, looking out the front window. The large ship was fully in view, easily dwarfing the smaller ships around it. Your helmsman wasted no time in turning the ship though, moving to the rear of a small moon orbiting a planet, fully hidden from sensors.<br>\r\n\"Your getting faster at that\" You said, commending your helmsman.<br>\r\n\"Thank you sir\" He said.<br>\r\n\"While I'm gone, Tac's in charge\"<br>\r\n\"Sir?\" Your tactical officer asked. \"Shouldn't Lt. Jamieson be in charge?\"<br>\r\n\"She's with me\"<br>\r\n\"Very well then sir\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRifle's wouldnt help on this mission, you and Alanna would look to obvious with them. She, like before, settled with two pistols and you took just one with you. A larger model to hers with greater strength but longer firing time.<br>\r\n\"Ready?\" She asked, straightening her top. While you thought uniform would still be neccecary wherever you were, Alanna had stubbornly strippped down to a black tanktop and black leather jeans. She wore no markings or badges to signify her status and her long hair had been let down. You noticed that her body was a little... different, now that she was out of uniform. She was alot more slimmer than you had previously thought.<br>\r\n\"Still think you should wear something a bit more\" You said dejectedly.<br>\r\n'Is that an order?\" She asked. You stayed silent.<br>\r\nMeanwhile, you had changed into a black uniformed top, preferring to stay at least within the near boundaries of your allowed uniform requirements. However, you had stripped yourself of your badges and markings to not give away your status.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoarding the dropship you previously ordered ready, the pilot moved down out of the hangar bay into the blackness of space. Aside from knowing where to dock, your pilot knew nothing due to the secrecy of the mission. Moving right up the rear of the ship, you expected the sensors to be distorted by the heat, thus masking your trail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pilot maneuvered the craft up to the hatch and latched on, lowering metal clamps all the way around allowing you to freely enter without having to put on space suits. With a small cutting torch, you broke open the hatch and clambered inside with Alanna. The hatch slammed closed behind you and the pilot disengaged as prior instructions. Getting out of here would be all up to you and Alanna.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, where's your little vent?\" Alanna asked. The whole corridor was empty, not even the sound of workmen pacing up and down.<br>\r\n\"Hopefully somewhere around here\" You said, walking forward. After two rights and one left, you eventually found it. With the same portable cutting torch, you broke it off and entered.<br>\r\nThe vent was only just as tall as Alanna, meaning that you had to tilt your head slightly.<br>\r\n\"This is where the long walk is\" You said. She nodded, replacing the grate in a haphazard formation. Trudging through the near darkness, you occasionally looked down to see various other corridors on the ship. The path was easy, as nearly all of the other paths that randomly appeared were blocked by rotating fans that you couldnt bypass.<br>\r\nAfter an hour, you finally reached the point where you were sure you were above the main power grid. The heat had risen dramatically.<br>\r\n\"Here it is\" You said, looking down through a grate to see a mass of machines, each individually distributing power throughout the ship as neccecary.<br>\r\n\"So how do we redirect the power?\" Alanna asked.<br>\r\n\"I'll show you\" You said.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>From what you could see, the large room was completely empty. Nobody needed to be here as the machines were autonomous.<br>\r\nKicking the grate out, you then sat on the edge and jumped down into the room, landing perfectly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter doing a quick scout, you came back and beckoned Alannna down. Using the same method, she dropped down. Unfortunately, her top accidentally caught on a loose piece of metal. She landed with a thud, not making it as well as you. Then she slowly stood up, her arms wrapped around her naked chest.<br>\r\n\"You lost your shirt\" You said slowly.<br>\r\n\"Not just that\" She said, annoyed. \"And if you laugh, I'll hit you\"<br>\r\n\"You'll have to take your arms away to do that\" You said, stifling the laugh.<br>\r\n\"Whatever, let's get this over and done with\" She said, still annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou showed Alanna how to take the floor panels off and manually redirect the current flow all back into the same power line which led back into the engines. That was one done with about nineteen left to go. You started on the left side of the room while Alanna took the right side. This did require her to take her arms away, but you decided to not look, just for her sake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou finished the last one and went to help Alanna as she was only halfway. Your prior experience had made you able to do it twice as fast as the first time and the method was no different. After working on the last one with Alanna, you both stood up.<br>\r\n\"Still awkward\" She said.<br>\r\nYou were hesitant to do this, but you took your own uniform shirt off and tossed it to her. She gratefully took it, promptly turned around and put it on. It didn't fit her well at all but it was better than nothing. Then she turned back and a shocked look on her face appeared.<br>\r\n\"What's that?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"What?\" You asked her.<br>\r\n\"On your back\" She added.<br>\r\n\"It's nothing\"<br>\r\n\"That doesn't look like nothing\"<br>\r\n\"I'll explain later\"<br>\r\n\"You better\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn your back were about twenty to thirty erratically placed deep scars, most of which went across the centre. The story was long and would be better explained later when you had more time.<br>\r\n\"We can't use the vents anymore, we're gonna have to find another way out of here\"<br>\r\n\"Then where do we go?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, by now everyone would have noticed the severe lack of power throughout most of the ship so anyone with a gun or a wrench will be heading here very soon. That leaves the hangars nearly empty.\" You said. \"Then, in about two hours when they still can't figure out the powerloss, the ship goes kaboom\"<br>\r\n\"Kaboom?\"<br>\r\n\"Bang, boom, pop, big explosion time\" You said. \"The big one\"<br>\r\n\"Ah\" Alanna replied. \"Should be nice to watch\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading out of the distribution room, you and Alanna snuck into a side room which appeared to be for storage. Sure enough, a large number of boots and shouting was heard outside as people headed for the distribution room.<br>\r\n\"Sucks to be them\" Alanna snickered.<br>\r\n\"Yea\" You said, going down a small flight of stairs and opening a pressure sealed door to another corridor, also empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking carefully down the corridors, avoiding anyone you saw, you eventually found a console with a map that could take you to the nearest hangar bay. The system was behaving very erractically, the screen flickering constantly. All due to the severe lack of normal power. The lights also began to flicker and several went out completely, giving you the aid of darkness as you headed for the hangar bay. This was all too easy, just like Corbulo on your second round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we are\" You said, looking through the open blast door into the hangar\"<br>\r\n\"Hey, whats that?\" Alanna asked, pointing to a small craft that looked like a fighter jet.<br>\r\n\"Dunno, looks like fun. Wanna steal it?\" You said, smiling lightly.<br>\r\n\"Sure, looks like a double seater.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hangar was completely empty aside from the various jets docked in here. Everyone must have gone to find out why everything had suddenly become dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou clambered onto the craft and lifted up the cockpit hood. Alanna had been wrong, it was a single seater.<br>\r\n\"Damn. And this is the only one that looks like it's working\" She said, looking at all the others which all looked out of service due to the mess of machinery and cables criscrossing them.<br>\r\nThere was no time though, someone was coming. You clambered into the craft and pulled Alanna in, making her sit on top of you. It was extremely uncomfortable, but at least it worked.<br>\r\n\"Ow!\" She said, annoyed. \"What the hell!\"<br>\r\n\"Someone was coming, this was the only option\" You said. Alanna was still very annoyed.<br>\r\nUsing the best of your intuition, you powered up the craft and shot the hangar door open with three of the onboard missiles. An alarm sounded, indicating the pressure breach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour craft was quickly sucked out into space, along with a multitude of other objects and busted jets.<br>\r\nAssuming what the controls were, you powered out and away from the new Rebel Super Ship and headed to the planet where your own ship was docked.<br>\r\n\"So, comfortable?\" You asked, finally relaxing.<br>\r\n\"What do you think?\" Alanna asked. You didn't have a response for that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This might take a while, better get comfortable\" You said after a few minutes of silence, letting go of the controls and relaxing in your seat under the weight of Alanna. She huffed and leant back against you.<br>\r\n\"Surprisingly comfortable\" She whispered, promptly falling asleep.</span></div></div>",

Unfortunately, it didn't appear to be working so after a few belated attempts, you gave up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly a few minutes later, a warning light appeared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LOW FUEL\" It kept blinking.<br>\r\n\"Dammit\" You said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost just as quickly, it indicated that you had no fuel. Well, what a fat load of good it did to say that you were low on fuel. And here you were now, spiraling out of control directly to the planet. What a great day this turned out to be. Nudging Alanna, she woke up.<br>\r\n\"Home yet?\" She asked.<br>\r\n\"Not quite. Looks like we're gonna crash\"<br>\r\n\"What did you do?\" She asked annoyed.<br>\r\n\"Ran out of fuel\" You said. \"How is that my fault?\"<br>\r\nAlanna shook her head. \"Never mind.\"<br>\r\n\"I'm going to try and glide down. Hopefully we can shake some of this speed in the atmosphere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe terrible sensors on the craft indicated that the planet in question did sustain an atmosphere similar to Earth, though less oxygen and much lighter gravity. There was hope yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUsing the barely working manuvering thrusters, you aimed the ship for the curve of the planet, rushing through the atmosphere towards the planet in a very similair manner to how the old spacecraft used to glide down. This craft, however, was ill suited for the task and everything began to heat up.<br>\r\n\"Brace yourself\" You said, wrestling with the control stick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe craft hit the top of a mesa, smashing it's underside against the solid rock. You continued to glide in the air for a short while, before crashing into the ground, coming up for one last time and then hitting the ground again.<br>\r\nThe cockpit lid blew off and the seat jumped about twenty centimeters in the air. Worst ejector seat ever.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlanna stumbled out of the craft and collapsed on the sandy ground. The whole planet was a yellow desert, nothing but the odd rock for miles. Not even a cactus in sight. Blood flowed from her nose and there were several bruises on her arms and legs.<br>\r\n\"Ow\" She said, flopping down into the sand. You slowly made your way off the craft and sat down beside her, leaning against your crashed ship.<br>\r\n\"Well, could have been worse\" You said.<br>\r\nAlanna rested herself on the craft beside you.<br>\r\n\"We're alive, thats enough for me\" She said quietly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour first concern, however, was the blood flowing from her nose and several other areas. Ripping off pieces of the bottom of your pants, you forced her to hold them against the open wounds. It was the best you could do to keep the sand out of it and hopefully prevent infection. That was when Alanna noticed your back.<br>\r\n\"Your bleeding\" She said.<br>\r\n\"I'm fine\"<br>\r\n\"Your entire back is caked with blood and it's dripping onto the sand at a big rate. Let me see it\"<br>\r\n\"Not until your okay\"<br>\r\n\"I'll live, you need to use something to strap up your broken foot\"<br>\r\n\"What?\" She said, looking down at her left foot which had several black patches on it.<br>\r\n\"The bone is broken\" You said. \"Seen it before\"<br>\r\nAlanna hadn't even noticed it until now.<br>\r\n\"Unless you set it right, it'll fix itself at an odd angle.\" You said, slowly, feeling a little woozy. Leaning forward, you twisted Alanna's ankle before she could stop you. She let out an earsplitting scream as you fixed the bent foot, setting it into a much better position.<br>\r\n\"Yeouch!\" She said. \"But, thanks. Much better now\"<br>\r\n\"Yea...\" You said, leaning back and passing out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou jerked awake suddenly. You were in a different position, face down in the sand with a piece of material to keep your face directly out of it. Alanna was beside you.<br>\r\n\"Each one of these scars has split open. I'm not sure what you did to get these, but they are really bad. I don't understand how you can even walk with all this\" She said, treating the wound with a bit of water from a canteen she had found in the crashed ship. It hurt, alot. You did your best to keep the screams in, but this was much better than bleeding to death.</span></div></div>",

Talking would keep your mind off the pain.<br>\r\n\"Yes, if thats okay\" Alanna said, leaning against a tall rock. The sun had passed overhead and was setting in the east. You must have been out for at least two hours now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't normally like to talk about it, but I think I can trust you\"<br>\r\n\"Oh?\"<br>\r\n\"I got these because I disobeyed orders - direct orders. But the result was my entire team getting out alive. Something that doesn't happen often. I was part of Team Seven at the training academy of Geneval\"<br>\r\n\"You trained on Escario?\" Alanna asked in surprise.<br>\r\nEscario was a very hostile world where the jungle forests were constantly trying to reclaim their territory which had been stripped to make way for a training academy. The Geneval Training academy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea. Lovely place. Don't want a summer home there though\" You said, laughing weakly. \"Anyway, Team Seven and I had nearly finished survival training. We had one last test left, which was the real survival test.\"<br>\r\nAlanna stayed silent.<br>\r\n\"They sent drones into the sky above one of the northern forests to check for anything super dangerous. They came back with the all clear so all of our twenty teams were dropped in the middle of the forest. Each team had to seperately reach an outpost and carry an important package there without losing it. Sounds pretty easy, right? Well, there was only just enough food and water to keep us going and we had nothing else. The package was quite heavy so we shared the load every few hours.\"<br>\r\n\"I know that course, I did a similar one on Harmony\" Alanna said.<br>\r\n\"Yea, it's pretty much the same for all the academys. Anyway, after three days, we estimated that we were nearly there. After having climbed a mountain, we saw the outpost in the distance. After another hours walk, Katie heard a noise\"<br>\r\n\"Noise?\" Alanna asked.<br>\r\n\"Yea, like, non-standard noise\"<br>\r\n\"As in...\"<br>\r\n\"Rannivore\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlanna gasped. Rannivore's were extremely rare creatures that lived on a few planets. They had been seeded by pirates and were excellent at tearing through anything. An easy comparison was a rancor from the famous series \"Star Wars\", except a Rannivore was bigger, meaner and much more hungry. It also had four eyes which was something the science boys loved investigating. Rannivores had a cry which made it very distinct from other animals. Basically, if you heard one, you ran.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We picked up the pace, I was holding the package. Q used the emergency communicator and called the outpost, saying that we had heard a Rannivore. The cries happened multiple times and the outpost didnt believe us until they heard it through the comms. There was nothing they could do because they didnt have any weapons to fight it off. All they could really do was protect us when we arrived. Terrible, but true. So we hiked for another ten minutes before it suddenly appeared and blocked our way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe damn thing ran at us, looked really hungry, and grabbed John. It picked him up and would have eaten him if I hadnt chucked a rock at the ugly things eye. He didnt like that, so he drops John on the ground and goes for me. I threw the package to Katie and she said that the outpost had told us to run, don't fight it. So I said: 'No way. Gotta stop it now or it'll go after the other teams'. So screamed at my team to run and get away. They were hesitant at first so I threw rocks at them.\" You said, laughing at the last part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Rannivore picked me up, but I was ready. I dragged a really big rock up with me and just as he was about to eat me, I dropped it in his mouth. It smashed a couple of teeth before it became stuck in his throught. They roar really werid when they have stones in the throat. He drops me, onto my front, and comes down and slashes my back. Naturally, Worst. Pain. Ever. Of all time. It then choked to death and eventually, I dragged myself to the outpost. The outpost commander was ready to reprimand me for disobeying orders but instead said I did well. Then I passed out\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happened to Katie and Q and the others?\" Alanna asked.<br>\r\n\"Q originally had your job until our first mission went badly. As for Katie, John and Jerry? No idea. I was the only one who made captain so I suspect their working on some other ship. Wouldnt be surprised if Jerry was made into a tactical officer. He loved explosions.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks captain, good story\"<br>\r\n\"Yea. Glad I could tell someone again, Jamieson\" You said weakly.<br>\r\n\"Please, don't call me that\" Alanna said softly.<br>\r\n\"Mhm?\"<br>\r\n\"Reminds me of my father, very high up, very secretive, very popular. People always compare me to him\" Alanna said dejectidly.<br>\r\n\"Alright. What DO I call you then?\" You asked. \"Because I know that you don't want me to call you a lieutenant\"<br>\r\n\"Just call me Alanna\"<br>\r\n\"First name basis huh? I can live with that\" You said, then passing out.</span></div></div>",

You woke with a start.<br>\r\n\"Just getting fresh coverings\" She said. \"No need to panic\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot five minutes later, a small dropship raced above your crashsite. It slowed down a few hundred meters ahead and came back around. It landed on a flat section of ground only fifty meters away and someone immediately stepped out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour tactical officer, a pistol in hand ready to shoot someone. As soon as he saw you two though, he holstered his weapon and ran over.<br>\r\n\"We monitored the ship as it went down over the planet, except the magnetic field here is interfering with our sensors so we didn't know what happened. It took a while to reconfigure the shields on the dropship so that we could safely come down\" He said.<br>\r\n\"Well, good that you did come\" You said, wincing in pain.<br>\r\n\"How did he get those scars?\" Wilson asked.<br>\r\n\"Long story, not going to talk about it\" Alanna said. Wilson shrugged his shoulders and went back to the ship for a combat stretcher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot forty minutes later the medics had swarmed you when you left the dropship in the hangar. They made several needle jabs into your back without even telling you what exactly they were doing. Still face down, you turned your head and noticed Alanna following behind with one of the doctors as you headed to the medical bay.<br>\r\n\"These scars down his back werent from the crash, but thats why they opened. I don't have this on my medical record of him\" He said to Alanna.<br>\r\n\"I know\" She replied softly.<br>\r\n\"Whatever the case, we can treat him to be as good as new. However, unless he undergoes extensive surgery, those scars will remain. I'm very concerned that they'll rip open again. The skin is extremely tender.\"<br>\r\n\"I also know that. What can you tell me that I don't know?\"<br>\r\n\"It'll take a few hours, then he's all yours again to go around crashing things\" The doctor said sarcastically. Alanna stopped at the door to the medical ward as two doctors prevented her entry, then locking the door behind them. A doctor put a mask to your face and you then blacked out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-----<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou slowly blinked your groggy eyes open, looking up to see the familiar sight of your private dorm.<br>\r\nYou sat up and looked around. The wound on your back still hurt slightly, but it was more than manageable. Getting changed into your captains uniform again, you headed for the bridge.<br>\r\nEveryone was at their stations, ready for anything. Alanna looked up from her own chair and gestured you to your own.<br>\r\n\"Thanks\" You said.<br>\r\nAlanna's calm and somewhat kind attitude from the planet had once again turned into the stern and demeaning voice she had once you first met her.<br>\r\n\"I've already plotted our course back to Earth to deliver the report. Apparently there was quite an explosion due to our mission\" She said. Your helmsman piloted the ship into Translight and you were off.</span></div></div>",

You noticed a hint of sadness in Alanna's facial expression as she was compared to her father once again, but she quickly hid it behind her stoic attitude.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm pleased to report that the ship is destroyed\" You reported. \"However, as Lt. Jamieson told me, the design is concerning\"<br>\r\n\"How so?\" Lance asked, folding his arms. You gestured for Alanna to explain<br>\r\n\"It's not Rebel design. They typically stick with whatever they can get to work without worrying about design. This was a very sleek, very modern design. It had many similiarities to an I.F.O.H designed vessel.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'She speaks?'</i> You heard someone whisper. If Alanna heard it, she didnt respond. However, Lance did and his brow furrowed as he shot dagger eyes at one of the men at the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I don't know if there are any new vessels of ours currently being developed, but I suspect this was a stolen design\" Alanna continued.<br>\r\n\"I'm aware of the lab boys working on a few new ships\" One of the women beside Lance said, \"But nothing on this scale.\"<br>\r\n\"Nothing top level secrecy?\" You asked. There were blank stares around the room. \"Look, you can tell me if there is or not. I'm not going to go hunting for it because to be honest, it doesn't worry me. If they try again, I'll just use the same tactic.\"<br>\r\n\"Assuming it works\" Lance said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLance sighed and shook his head. \"I don't care what other people at this meeting say\" He said, eyeing Vamee. \"But you have done an excellent job. Take a weeks downtime and you''ll be sent some new mission documents\"<br>\r\n\"Thank you sir\" You said. Alanna left the room.<br>\r\n\"Oh, and, Captain?\" Lance said, just before you left.<br>\r\n\"Sir?\"<br>\r\n\"Try not to crash again any time soon\" He said with a grin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou caught up to Alanna, who was marching back towards the ship, obviously quite angry but doing her best not to show it.<br>\r\n\"I think I understand now\" You said slowly.

I leaned against the railing, feeling the fading sun on my arms and the cool breeze in my long, gray-blonde hair.  Customers of the ship mingled around the deck, admiring the sunset across the ocean and asking friendly employees for the activity schedules for the next day.  I smiled to myself, perfectly content to hang around here for the next century.  <br>\r\n\"Captain, are we clear to start clearing the decks for the night?\" Lieutenant Cambell asked behind me.  <br>\r\n\"Yes, carry on.\"  I sighed.  I too would have to begin the nighttime routine.  I straightened my blue double-breasted jacket and walked across the deck.  I crossed towards the back of the ship where the engine was, smiling and nodding to my customers.  I opened the door leading to the engine room.  It was hot and stuffy in there, as usual.  Machines lined the walls of what looked like a long corridor.  They cast an orange glow.<br>\r\n\"Hello, Cap.  Everything's fine in here, as usual.  No need to check in.\"  Mr. Limber smiled a toothless smile.  He bent over his cane, rubbing his back.  I would have dismissed him long ago, but he flat out refused.<br>\r\n\"Ah, Mr. Limber.  I check everything, captain's job.  Now go and check in for the night.\"  <br>\r\nWith another toothless grin and a nod of the head, Mr. Limber exited.  I checked the engine, muttering the routine to myself.  Everything was in order.  I crossed back to the door.  <br>\r\nThen I heard it.  <br>\r\nA low screech.  Almost like a metal rod scraping against the machines.  I turned swiftly, almost expecting Mr. Limber.  But I saw no one.  I took a couple steps forward.<br>\r\n\"Anyone in here?  I'm about to lock up.\"<br>\r\nNo answer.  I shook my head, arguing with myself.  I was going on forty five, which was pretty dang old in my opinion.  I could have well imagined it.  I turned back to the door.  I heard it again.  This time it was louder and longer.  Goosebumps crawled on my skin.  I faced the corridor again.  <br>\r\nI screamed.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>DRY!<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe sky was cloudless and empty.  The sea calm, now and like a mirror.  The life boat barely moved in the stillness.  It was no longer bobbing has it had done earlier.  The sun shone hotly down quickly evaporating the seawater that had splashed in during the stormy night.and it quickly dried the torn clothing on the lone reclining occupant.  The lone occupant stirred indicating that he was still alive to see one more dawn on this seeming empty ocean.  He raised himself to a sitting position drawing the ball cap from under his body and slipping it firmly on to his head, The cap had once been a dark blue but the sun and salt water had bleached it into a light purple.<br>\r\n The man surveyed the sea and the horizon and seeing nothing of note laid back onto the floor of the motionless craft.  The man opened his parched lips and uttered first a curse and then a prayer.  It was his seventh day drifting aimlessly hoping vainly for some vessel or aircraft to see him and hopefully provide rescue before he died.<br>\r\n The meager ration of food and water were both long expended.  His body was dehydrating rapidly and he knew that if he did not have too much more time.  He rose to his knees and moved slowly to check the sea anchor which kept him from flipping over during storms like last night and also held him close to his position so if a rescue vessel was seeking him they would no where to search.  <br>\r\nFrom habit and the need to do something he lowered his fishing line back into the still water.  He didn't think there was much possibility of it doing any good.  His \"bait\" consisted of a tattered piece of cloth torn from his frayed shorts.  The only fish that he had seen was on the third day when a pair of gray fins had ominously circled his life boat for about ten minutes.  Ten very frightening minutes.  What would he do if he hooked a fish?  Did he have enough strength to haul it in?  The next question was could he cut it with the small pocketknife he had. The final question would be if he could manage to eat it and keep it down.  He was aware that it would provide a source of moisture.  Moisture the very thought almost caused him to salivate.  But he did not have the moisture for even that.  He had even used his own bodily waste to attempt to survive longer.          <br>\r\n          Look there.  Something a far ways off.  Was that smudge on the horizon possibly a ship or was it another ghost image, a mirage, a figment of his parched existence, a strange quirk of his damages mind.  He turned slightly so to peer at the object.  As he did he felt his body ache It ached partly because of the cramped existence in the small life raft and partly because of the burnt and cracked skin on his arms and face.  He had mistakenly splashed salt water on his burnt flesh a couple of days ago in the hope of cooling his body.  The pain had been almost unbearable.  He wished he could stand up and wave is case that smudge was really a ship but his body was too weak and if he should happen to fall into the water he knew he would not have been able to swim.<br>\r\n          He prayed to god that some lookout with a keen eye would spot him and the ship would alter course and pick him up.  If it really was a ship.                    <br>\r\n          He knew he was near the end.  His mind went to his family and those he loved.  He could picture his mom working in the kitchen, her hands and apron dusted with flour as she laboured to create the delicious meals and desserts that always made his mouth water.  He leaned over and kissed her forehead.  Then his thought went to his dad.  He was in the garage moving objects from one place to another, never ever cleaning up and getting rid of the clutter but being busy and happy.  He hugged his dad.  Next he imagined his little sister Susie who was trying desperately to look like a woman with her use of too much makeup and high heels.  She was a good kid.  She was just trying to grow up too fast.  He rubbed her head and just smiled.  Finally he thought of Jo-Anne.  He regretted never making their love official.  He deeply loved her.  In his mind he could picture their last time together.  It had been more loving, affectionate than it had been intimate.  So much to say to her and yet he was lost for the right words and correct way to express how deeply he felt.  Words, emotions that he felt that now she would never know.  Tears would have formed in his eyes but there was not enough moisture in his dry and shrived body.          <br>\r\n          His mind now quickly spiraled away from the living towards the dead.  He was now totally resigned to the fact of his imminent death.  He had made his peace with his Maker.  It was all over now\u2026..Just to wait\u2026.For the end.<br>\r\n          \"I think he's still alive\".<br>\r\n          \"We'll send down the sling and hoist him aboard\" <br>\r\n         He feebly opened his eyes to see a man standing over him and the black side of the ship.  They seemed to be lowering a large piece of canvas.  The man helped to ease his sun-dried body onto the canvas.and he felt himself being lifted.  Lifted, hoisted by the crane aboard the ship.  Only then did it come to him.  HE WAS RESCUED!!<br>\r\n <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The entire river is over over 400 kilometers in length and is contained in the Canadian Nahanni National Park.  I had decided  to canoe this completely alone but several of my friends said that wanted to share the experience.  So now we have four canoes.  Two canoes have couples and two canoes are solo.  This of course makes sense because if there are any difficulties there are other people there to help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt does mean however that we must bring a greater amount of supplies.   My friends who are expert canoeists will share their views as we progress on our trip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMy friends are:Rob and Cathy Innes who are padling a sixteen foot woodmaster.  Jason Paul and Samantha Grayson are paddling the newest  kevlar canoe.  John Dubrowsky is using a wooden canoe he built himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you want to hear more .....<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

After a decadent life of growing up as a street urchin in the Babylon, the capital of the Imperium, she had recently had a massive stroke of luck. To say that she was happy right now would be a massive understatement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the past few years, the Imperium had been expanding it's borders, engaging in a heavy war against the Republic of Ainarth. Eianna was lucky again though, as that war was on the western front of the empire and the region of Illum, where she was currently living, was on the far east, bordering the sea. If her luck kept holding, she'd have little more than bandits and looters to deal with in the rocky mountains and the various outlying islands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEianna left the military office, running down the cobbled road towards the skydocks where her new ship was located. She could barely contain her excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEianna's first venture out into the open sky was only a year ago, working as a deckhand on a merchants ship that regularly worked between Papua and Babylon. She had quickly mastered the art of not only maintaining the ships engines, but also learning how to fly it when Magyar, her master, would allow her to. It was sad to recall that the Magyar's frivolous drinking and gambling had lost him his ship to another merchant, which also cost Eianna her job as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as luck would have it, Eianna was in the right place at the right time. An old pilot was ready to retire and sell off his ship, a badly run down Blockade Runner that was in dire need of repairs. The pilot happily sold the ship to her for less than ten percent of it's original value. \"Aye, she's old and worn, she is. But fix her up right and you'll have one of the fastest ships around\" He said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEianna couldn't wait to show it to her friends, all four of whom had eagerly signed on with her. However, they all less enthusiastic when they saw it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship in question was a Corveyan Hog. It measured out to 25m in length and 8m at the widest. The hull was made of thick oak wood, available abundantly nationwide. A propeller was featured at the rear on both the starboard and port sides of the ship, with the respective engines measuring at one meter in diameter and the extended blades at 2 meters. Two chain guns were mounted near the front, one on each side. Most prominently however, was the helium-2 container which kept the ship in the sky. It was a cylindrical oval shape, measuring at twenty five meters in length and seven meters at it's width. The balloon was held fast to the ship by a number of thick ropes which attached to the front, rear and sides of the ship. A small rubber pipe extended from it to the rear main engine, allowing for the easy ability to both rise and fall at the captains discretion. Aware that the balloons would always be a massive target for enemy gunners, the material was made of thick, ballistic resistant cloth which could withstand the worst of explosive fury. It was now more efficient for gunners to target the hull instead. Research and development initially made it expensive, but the acquisition and inclusion of cheap, renewable materials made it extremely easy to produce for the open market.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately in this case, the ship was in bad condition. The hull was missing multiple planks, leaving gaping wounds showing the inside of the ship. Some of the balloons ropes were badly frayed, looking like they were ready to snap. The chain guns were horrifically rusted, showing clear signs of a lack of maintenance. It would cost Eianna quite a bit to repair the ship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What a piece of junk!\" Mark Hapsburg exclaimed. He was an expert in mechanical engineering and would be serving as the chief engineer.<br>\r\n\"Yea... Not so sure about it myself\" Cappa said, pushing his long black hair out of his face.<br>\r\n\"Can it still even fly?\" Tina asked. Cappa and Tina were near identical twins - their only real difference being that Cappa was male and had long hair while Tina was a woman with short hair. However they both shared an extreme passion for guns and blowing things up, leading Eianna to immediately put them in charge of the ships ammunition stores.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He already took me out for a flight! I swear it flies fine!\" Eianna beamed. Her crewmates were still unimpressed.<br>\r\nMark hopped onto the ship, still moored to the dock. It was good that both he and Eianna had experience on airships, as the dock was on the edge of a cliff and it was a long way down to the sea below. Falling off would be fatal.<br>\r\nMark flipped open the outer casing on the starboard propeller. \"This engine is completely worn out and it's empty on oil. Sure, it'll fly... but you'll be doing some serious damage the longer it goes for.\" He said, examining it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can you repair it?\" Eianna asked.<br>\r\n\"Ehh.... I can jerry-rig a few things but without some new parts I can't do much\" He said, scratching his chin. Cappa and Tina jumped on board, opened the door to the interior and went inside to explore.<br>\r\n\"I'm fresh out of cash at the moment. No chance of being new parts, or even used parts. I've barely got enough for two days food for us\" Eianna grimaced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then we've got three options. Either you help me repair everything here and we make do with what we've got, or I can maintain it while we're flying and hope we come across a wreckage we can salvage, or you sell something else on the ship to buy the parts we need\" Mark said.</span></div></div>",

A day maximum\" Mark said as he continued his inspection of the engines. His concern turned to worry, it was far worse than it looked.<br>\r\n\"I'll take it.\" Eianna said. \"We have to start somewhere. Hopefully there's something out there we can scavenge\"<br>\r\n\"Aye\" Mark murmured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEianna headed below deck to see what the twins had found.<br>\r\n\"Alright, so what have you discovered?\" Eianna asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hold of the ship was just as bad inside as it looked from the outside. The walls were missing multiple planks and one of the doors separating two rooms was broken on one hinge, leaving it sitting on an awkward angle.<br>\r\n\"It's completely empty down here\" Cappa called out from the front.<br>\r\n\"Empty?\" Eianna asked.<br>\r\n\"Well, not completely. There's a crate here of wet explosives\" Tina noted.<br>\r\n\"Explosives?!\" Eianna cried. Something explosive on this worn out ship was not ideal right now\"<br>\r\n\"I said they were wet. Which makes them completely useless. Could sell them to someone though\" Tina replied.<br>\r\n\"No ammunition though. Or food\" Cappa said.<br>\r\n\"We'll make do. I have a bit of cash left for a few meals.\" Eianna said, heading back up top. Cappa and Tina followed close behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright, start her up. Let's head out\" Eianna told Mark. He nodded and pulled the cord to start the engines. They spat into life, groaning through a lack of oil they desperately needed.<br>\r\nEianna took the helm while Cappa and Tina let go of the ropes holding them to the docks. Slowly, but not graciously or majestically, the old ship pulled away from the dock and sailed north through the sky.<br>\r\n\"So, what do ya think we'll find first?\" Mark asked, making adjustments to the starboard engine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Betcha it's a wreckage\" Cappa smirked.<br>\r\n\"Betcha it's pirates\" Tina retorted.<br>\r\n\"Betcha it's a wreckage of a pirate ship!\" Cappa replied.<br>\r\n\"Betcha it's pirates infesting a wreckage!\" Tina yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How much do you want to bet?\" Eianna asked.<br>\r\nBoth Tina and Cappa looked up at her. Neither of them had much cash to spare. Eianna sighed and laughed lightly.<br>\r\n\"Instead of you two arguing, how about you try and get those guns up front working?\" She asked. The twins faces lit up at the prospect of weaponry, they raced to the front and began working on the two chainguns.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship continued sailing north, heading into the Illum Badlands. The badlands was an archipelago, closely linked together, with rocky mountains rising high into the sky. It was a perfect place for them to start. Either Eianna and her crew would make their early fortunes here or die trying. Pirates were frequent here, assailing the few merchants that passed through heading to and from Papua. It was difficult to salvage destroyed ships though, as most ships would either crash and sink in the dangerous ocean, or get caught on nasty cliffsides. The archipelago was also prone to thick fog during the early winter, right before the snow set in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I see something up ahead\" Eianna called out. Everyone looked forward.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The ship was wedged between two spires of rock at the bottom of the cliff, her stern jammed tight into the face of the mountains maybe 25 meters above the cresting waves. She didn\u2019t look like she\u2019d been there too long. Her gas bag still contained just enough helium2 that it still had buoyancy, although it was hanging limply above the tilted deck. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEianne hove to about 500 meters off the mountain face and studied the ship with her spyglass. It certainly looked like a wreck. Not in too bad a shape though. She handed the spyglass to Mark \u201cSo what d'ya think?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark studied the wreck for a good minute and a half before answering. \u201cShe's a good possibility.\" he said finally. \u201cShe's been in a fight, that's for sure. I can see splintered planks along the starboard that is obvious cannon damage, and there's at least one body and the remains of another against the aft cabin. Another on the rocks at the waterline. The bag blocks most of the deck, so I can't tell how the port side looks. We won't know if there is anything useful onboard until we get over there. The question is how.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain nodded. The wreck was on the lee side of the island, and the winds coming over the top of and down the cliff would drive their ship into the ocean if they got too close. There was no beach nearby to land on, and a water landing was out of the question. In spite its shape, their ship wasn\u2019t designed to land on water, even if the hull had been intact. In any case, the water swirling at the base of the cliff was too rough to land in, even if they wanted to try. Whoever had wrecked the ship in front of them had managed to do it in the most inaccessible spot they could find. Some people just had no consideration for others.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to circle the island\u201d Eianne decided. \u201cMaybe there's a spot we can land on around the other side\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe terrain on the windward side was equally mountainous, but they managed to spot a surprisingly gentle valley that lead to a sheltered cove with a level tree free meadow that Eianna declared to be big enough to land in. Now, with a promising landing spot located, they circled the island once more, this time looking for a clear path to their objective. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI hate to say it,\u201d Cappa said finally. \u201cBut it looks like the only way to get to the wreck is to climb down to her from the top.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cDo we have enough rope for that?\u201d Eianna asked, feeling fairly sure she hadn\u2019t seen any on board.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNot that I'd trust to hold my weight.\u201d Cappa said. \u201cNot to worry, Tina and I have had plenty of free climbing experience. This will be a piece of cake.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll my climbing has been done with rope.\u201d Eianna said \u201cI don\u2019t know how good I\u2019d be on bare rock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo the captain stays with the ship.\u201d Mark grinned. \u201cThat\u2019s tradition, anyhow. Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll tell you all about it when we get back.\u201d<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe meadow was a little tight for their ship to fit properly into, but Eianna declared that any landing was a good landing if you could use the ship again afterwards. Besides, the trees wedged against the prow made it a lot easier to moor their ship. A soon as the ropes were tied her crew set off on their hike over the mountain. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo keep herself from fretting while she waited, Eianna busied herself tidying up and performing a few badly needed repairs to her ship as a way to pass the time. She had her head bent down over a rope she was braiding when the sound of someone stepping on the gang plank drew her attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer crew was back, and judging from the size of the backpack Mark dropped on the deck as he turned to help the others board they had managed to find quite a bit of supplies. Then Tina came up the gangplank and lowered her burden onto the deck. Supplies wasn\u2019t the only thing they\u2019d found. They\u2019d found a survivor.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Eianna put down the quill she was writing with and rubbed her temples, trying to find relief from the headache she was developing. The cabin was silent except for the soft hiss of the naphtha lamp burning over the desk that illuminated the logbook she had been writing in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMark had brought back the ship\u2019s log from the wreck, which allowed them to identify her as the Kestrel, a merchant sloop out of Westpoint Airie, 5 days sail south along the coast . The sight of the book reminded Eianna that the port authority had given her one of her own to fill out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery ship had a logbook that provided a written record of the ship. Written in it were the ship\u2019s name (which Eianna still had to fill out), who made up her crew, her home port, where she went, what she saw there, and what she did about it. One of the duties of the captain was to make sure the log was filled out every day. Magyar had taught her the basics of what should be in there, and she had the wreck\u2019s log to follow for the format. Even though writing legibly wasn\u2019t a strong skill set for the former street urchin, she set about the long and arduous task of transcribing the day\u2019s events with a determination that kept her going long after darkness had settled over the jungle around her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a soft knock on the door, and Mark came in. \u201cFinished?\u201d he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEianna nodded. \u201cPretty much. I\u2019ve written down everything I can think of. I didn\u2019t realize how long it would take to describe finding a wreck.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cProbably because it was no ordinary wreck.\u201d He too rubbed his temples, as if he was extremely tired, which he probably was. \u201cI don\u2019t relish the nightmares I\u2019ll have over this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEianna nodded in agreement. \u201cHow\u2019s the boy?\u201d she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sole survivor on the wreck had been the cabin boy Mark had found unconscious inside a jammed tool locker in the aft engine room. A boy who had stayed unconscious all the way back to the ship, then woken up screaming when Tina had put him to rest in her hammock. After they had calmed the kid down they managed to convince him to describe what happened. Not that he could tell them much. A ship came out of nowhere and attacked them. He had been knocked unconscious and woken up in the hammock with no memory of the locker and idea of why he\u2019d be in one. Eianna\u2019s best guess was that someone had hidden him for safe keeping. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s as okay as he can be,\u201d Mark replied, \u201cAll things considered. Still doesn\u2019t remember any more about the attack.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably for the best.\u201d Eianna said, running her hand through her hair and rubbing her eyes.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t asked about the rest of the crew.\u201d Mark continued. \u201cI think he suspects, but doesn\u2019t want to ask because he's afraid of what we\u2019ll tell him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIf he asks, all we just say that they are dead.\u201d Eianna said flatly \u201cThe pirates killed them. Nothing more. He doesn\u2019t need to know the details.\" she paused, then said quietly \"Not all of them.\u201d  Eianna wished she had that need to know option, but she didn\u2019t. And she knew that when they got back she would be recounting what she'd been told to the magistrate. Detailed reports were also something that those in charge liked to see on a semi-regular basis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe wreck had been attacked by pirates. There was no other description for them. Murdering blood thirsty pirates. The wreck had only been a sloop, lightly armed at best. Best suited for zipping around the safe harbors where there was nothing more threatening than a port official who wanted a bit of extra graft to clear the cargo. Why the captain had tried to cut through the Illum Badlands was anybody\u2019s guess. Whatever the reason, it had cost them everything. The defenses had probably lasted less than a minute. Even then most of the crew had probably survived the initial attack, judging from what Mark had found on deck hidden under the sight obscuring gas bag. And when the pirates boarded they had no problem rounding up the rest of the survivors, holding them captive while they helped themselves to the cargo and anything else of value that they wanted. Then the pirates had cut the main feed line and opened the valve on the gas bag that held the ship buoyant in the air, allowing the Helium2 to escape and the ship to sink towards the ocean below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to the log, the ship had 11 souls on board when she set sail. 12 if you include the cook\u2019s soon to be born child. Mark had found 8 of them lashed helplessly to the port rail. Apparently not satisfied with simply scuttling her, they had circled the slowly descending ship and repeatedly raked the helpless captives with an assortment of machine gun fire. The only one they had spared from this butchery had been the ships cook, and that was because at the time of this atrocity she had been lying naked on the Kestrel\u2019s galley table, pinned there by over a dozen meat skewers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEianna sanded and blotted the last page, preserving the tale of pirate horror in within the horror of her not so neat handwriting, all for the benefit of future readers. Then she closed the log book with a heavy sigh. \u201cI\u2019m not good at funerals,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can officiate at one, let alone 10 of them.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo don\u2019t\u201d Mark said. \u201cLet the temple priests do it when we get back. That\u2019s their job anyhow.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat would mean transporting the Kestrel\u2019s crew back to Papua, and I\u2019m not bringing those bodies on board this ship to ferry them back to Papua.\u201d Eianna said firmly. \u201cEven to bring what peace it will to those poor souls. I just can\u2019t!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEianna looked at Mark. To her surprise he was smiling. \u201cI think you\u2019re really going to like this plan I have.\u201d He said, pulling a notebook out of his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>If there had ever been any doubt in Eianna\u2019s mind that her friend was crazy, it had been erased by this mad plan of his. And she was beginning to have doubts about her own sanity, because she was whole heartedly going along with it, believing it might actually work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat it boiled down to was this. The Kestrel looked a mess. The gun emplacements were shattered. Her props were bent and useless, and even if they had been intact the engines that would drive them had been destroyed. There was no way she would ever sail under her own steam without an extensive refit. Her gas bag, however, was still intact, and by luck and good fortune she\u2019d settled onto the rock spires rather gently, keeping the keel straight and whole. In addition, the pumps for the Helium2 storage tanks were driven by the engines, which meant that when the pirates had wrecked those engines in the attack, the pumps had stopped. The only Helium2 that had escaped had been from the bag. Her tanks were still half full. If Mark could fix the feed tube and get the pumps running, which he swore up and down he could because there were more than enough spare bits and parts stored on the Kestrel to do what was needed, they could re-inflate the bag, lift the ship, and tow her and the grim cargo now resting in her holds back to Papua. There they could file their report, let the priests deal with the dead, and claim any rewards due to them for salvaging the ship.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nThe presence of a survivor both complicated and simplified things. By naval law they are bound to offer aid to all mariners in distress, and as surviving crew had been found on board it could be argued that the ship was not abandoned, even though it was quite clearly wrecked. So there could be some dispute over the salvage claim. Still, some reward should be forthcoming, and with luck it would be enough to pay for repairs, more weapons and ammunition, and some good food. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFood wasn\u2019t currently a problem. They had, of course, felt entitled to help themselves to anything they could use from the wreck. Although Eianna\u2019s stomach sometimes felt a little queasy eating anything from the Kestrel when she thought about what she\u2019d seen in that galley, she rationalized her feelings by thinking that the food was there so the living could keep living. There was no use in wasting it. If they were to find a way to quiet the restless spirits Eianna imagined haunted now the Kestrel, they would need to eat to make it happen. The spirits would understand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThree days later Mark declared the Kestrel as ready as she'd ever be. The plan was that they would start inflating 3 hours before sunrise in order for there to be enough lift to free the Kestrel in the calm air of early morning. As the sun cleared the horizon Eianna would sail over the ridge, trailing the ropes they had so meticulously woven into one long line. The rope would drop down onto the Kestrel, Mark would tie it to the bow, then Eianna would nose upwards at full throttle in order to pull the Kestrel up and off the rocks. Once they were up Eianna would head towards Papua carefully towing the Kestrel behind her. That neither Mark or Eianna had ever tried to do something like this, nor had ever seen it done before, shouldn\u2019t be a problem, should it?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Dropping a rope down a cliff and hitting a 20 meter wide target shouldn\u2019t be this hard, Eianna thought as she prepared for yet another run. This would probably be the last chance to try today. Already she could feel the ship bucking against her hands as the wind started to pick up. If it got any stronger they would have to quit, maybe try again tomorrow, although she didn\u2019t relish the idea of doing that. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe problem was that she couldn\u2019t see the Kestrel over the side of the cliff, and the dragging rope stretched behind her, snagging and throwing her off course. Then it swung down like a pendulum instead of dropping straight, missing the target and plunging into the ocean.<br>\r\nThe second time she tried she had Tina coil the rope and drop it just after they cleared the edge of the cliff. That\u2019s when she realized she had no way of telling where the Kestrel was. The cliff top was devoid of any markings she could align with, and time and time again the rope coil landed to far on one side or the other to be useful.<br>\r\nIt was as she was swinging around to make their last run that she suddenly realized something. Why was she coming down over the top? This time she angled straight over the Kestrel from the ocean side, throwing the props into full reverse as she came up to the cliff face, deliberately too low to clear the top. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to crash\u201d Tina shouted<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cJust get ready to drop the rope!\u201d Eianna yelled back, watching the cliff move towards them and praying she hadn\u2019t misjudged how quickly she could stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had misjudged, but not by too much. The bowsprit made a splintering noise as they hit, but held fast and didn\u2019t seem to be too badly damaged. When they\u2019d stopped bouncing Eianna quickly feathered the props, leaving them spinning at full speed but not pushing as she turned to see how Tina was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTina had dropped the rope the moment they had made contact, and now it snaked below them to land with a wet spat on the of the Kestrel\u2019s gas bag, right in front of where Mark was waiting with a boat hook that was suddenly way too long to be useful for recovering a rope that was only a meter in front of him. Casting the hook aside Mark grabbed the rope and scrambled over the side of the bag to the deck, dragging the wet end of the rope forward and tying it firmly around the Kestrels own bowsprit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe\u2019s tied off!\u201d Tina yelled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEianna nodded and slammed the pitch controls in opposite directions, one forward and one back. Now with her props pushing in opposite directions the long slim ship groaned, the bowsprit making more splintering noises as it slid along the cliff face as she started to pivot like an old man trying to remember why he came into that particular room. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPointed seaward once more, Eianna frantically worked the pitch controls to stop the bow swinging, then slowly started the ship moving forward, taking up the slack in the rope. When the rope was taunt she gave a blast on the ships whistle, signaling she was ready for the next step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDown below Mark had headed aft as soon as he\u2019d tied the rope off, half scrambling, half sliding down the tilted deck to the stern where Cappa waited with a knife and a safety harness. Clipping onto the safety rope attached to the rail, they waited until they heard the whistle, although that had hardly been necessary. Both men had felt the jolt when the slack went out of the rope. Now, with the wicked grins that only men about to do something ridiculously clever or dangerous stupid will give each other, they slashed at the ropes tethering the Kestrel\u2019s stern to the rock face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAccording to plan the Kestrel should have practically leapt from the rocks. Instead it protested every step of the way, screeching and groaning as the rough rock clutched and tore at the planks of the hull. Overhead the props roared and clawed at the air as Eianna poured full power into them, pulling upward with every ounce of lift she could give them. The rope groaned and threatened to snap, but somehow managed to hold fast, and the Kestrel actually started to lift. Then the port rail caught on an outcrop of rock, tipping the ship alarmingly and throwing both men aboard her off their feet. Suddenly the railing, weakened as it was by battle damage, tore away and the ship righted herself. Shedding long black planks and a few other pieces of miscellaneous wreckage, the Kestrel rose into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two men clambered back to their feet off the deck where they\u2019d been thrown by the violence of the Kestrels resurrection, clapping each other on the back in congratulations. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it actually worked,\u201d Cappa shouted, unable to keep from grinning like a madman. \u201cThat is the most awesome thing I\u2019ve seen since Tina and I found that cache of explosives hidden in old man Ottermans\u2019 privy.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTold you it would work,\u201d Mark said, equally grinning. \u201cAlthough next time I think we should clip ourselves to something other than the rear rail.\u201d He pointed towards the gap where a good 3 meter piece was missing, probably torn away at the same time the port railing had gone. The two looked at each other soberly for a minute, then started laughing manically again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that they were airborne Eianna throttled the prop\u2019s back to a more sane level, and started pulling them toward Papua and the waiting reward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",
