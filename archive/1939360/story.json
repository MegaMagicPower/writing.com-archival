Cassie and I stared at each other for a second, utterly perplexed by the event that had just occurred. We were not part of a very spiritual family, so we were more curious than frightened. Then I noticed John and Jess on the floor, groaning in pain. I jumped over to John and gave his shoulders a good shake. His eyes peaked open, but he wan't fully alive yet. I leaned myself up against the wall and kept my hand rested on his arm. I looked up to see the strangest thing. Cassie was desperately trying to comfort Jess, who looked terribly panicked. Jess was constantly rubbing her hands up and down her body and frantically running her fingers through her dirty blonde hair. <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://babescene.com/babe/image/medium/babescene.com_ktei98.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://babescene.com/babe/image/medium/b...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie flashed me a worried glance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, Jess. Are you okay? You gotta calm down Jess.\" Cassie told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJess turned sharply to look at me. \"Dan. Outside. Now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBewildered, I followed her out to the living room, leaving Cassie to deal with John.</span></div></div>",

It was late on a hot summer night, and my parents had both gone to bed. My friend, John, and my sister's best friend, Cassie, were there too -They were both sleeping over for different reasons. I had the great idea to bring out the ol' Ouija Board. Neither Cassie or I had never laid our hands on the box ever since she got it as a present for her 13th birthday from one of her weirder friends (with whom she has since lost contact). But! That night seemed like the ideal occasion to dust it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was John's turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCassie, Jess, and I huddled closely around the board, observing the somewhat mysterious movements of the pointer, or rather no movements at all. Then, without warning, the pointer began to move. John looked up at me in a state of confusion, \"I'm not doing this guys...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Suurrre John,\" Jess giggled, \"Ooohh ghosts!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm <i>not</i> kidding guys! Dan, write this stuff down!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter about under a minute of constant movement by the pointer, there was silence. I looked down at the letters I had scribbled, \"What??!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJohn looked confused again, \"What Dan? What did it say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says, 'I will show you the body you desire'?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's kinda sexual, don'tcha think?\" remarked Cassie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah John. That was a lame joke.\" added Jess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Jess! I swear I didn't do it! Eh, what's the use anyway?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, the pointer began to move on its own, and honestly, we were all scared shitless. It moved off of the board (the board was on the floor, a flat surface) and slowly turned towards Jess. She shrieked, and the lights went out.</td>",
