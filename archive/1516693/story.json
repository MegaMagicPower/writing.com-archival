Star-charts reveal that you've been deposited halfway across the galaxy.  \"Long range scan,\" you tell the computer.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the computer's quantum circuits hum you study the nearest star.  Unlike the yellow star of your home system, this one is red-giant.  Though you're a stick-jock first and a physicist second you estimate it to be more than a thousand times the mass of earth's tiny Sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Scanning complete,\" the computer announces in its gentle, feminine voice.  \"Women,\" Mike can't help but snicker, \"doesn't matter if they're made of cells or microchips they're all the same...  Thanks toots,\" you add mockingly to the computer before taking a look at the image diagrammed on the screen before you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough a miniature representation of the planets, the holo-screen captured all of their grandeur and detail, right down to the wind patterns of their atmosphere and the number of moons.  To your shock, all five planets, are flanked by the flashing green text 'Life.'  \"All five are populated,\" you say to yourself, \"how can that be.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping one eye on the picture, you check your fuel guage.  \"Damn, only enough antimatter to get me to one of these rocks.  No way I'll be able to break atmo a second time...  Gotta choose...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Anything would be better than asphyxiating to death out here in the dark of space.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing it will be many hours before the ship reaches its destination, you turn on the auto-pilot, switch on all proximity detectors, and lie back in your cushy astronaut's chair for an extended nap.  In your dreams you are running from something (a monster?) but you never see anything but its shadow.  Somehow you know, that to remain beneath it is doom so whenever it falls on you, you run for your life.  Finally when you dare a look up at the titanic object of your dread and awake with a shudder not remembering what your tormentor was only that she was horrible... 'She?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour thoughts are pulled away from your dream by the beeping of the proximity alarm.  A quick look beyond the cockpit determines why.  In front of you all you can see is the yellow curvature of the desert planet and already friction from its dusty atmosphere is coaxing flames up the nose of your ship.  'The wormhole must have shorted out the auto-pilot.'  You chide yourself, 'why didn't I run a full diagnostic.'  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter, opening all drag flaps and engaging stabilizers, you grab hold of the stick and prepare to wrestle her down.  Mom always told you that playing video games constantly would ruin your chances at life.  Now its only your innate skill with a control stick that lies between you and certain vaporization.  </span></div></div>",

The altimeter assures you that the ground is approaching rapidly so you pull the nose up.  The smoke clears just in time for you too see a dark shape in the oncoming rock.  'A cave!' <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing intuition you fly into the opening, but moments after you enter, the ship strikes down.  The impact jars you violently in your seat and showers the cockpit with sparks.  As soon as the ship skids to a halt you blow the hatch and climb out never having been so happy to get out of a plane.  Hopping down off the ship's wing you notice the trail of titanium wreckage it left behind, the remains of the other wing, and realize her days of space flight are over.  That is unless the aliens here are more advanced than initial scans detected.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up and around, inspecting the greater scope of your surroundings for the first time and gasp.  'The scale is enormous!'  Truly whatever creatures lived here were giants.  Giants and also primitives.  Most of the room's furniture was carved crudely out of the very same cave rock that formed the walls.  One exception, a nearby bed frame which towered nearly 40 feet above the astronaut looked to be made out of crude wrought iron.  Elsewhere hides of scales and fur draped and lay as decorations.  You begin to ponder how big such animals would have to be, but are interrupted by an earth quake and another... and another?  'Oh no,' your brain makes the connection, 'that's definitely not an earth quake.' </span></div></div>",

The crescent blade of the thing, 30 feet from tip to curving tip, faces you killing edge first and you're running to fast to stop.  Instead of it slicing you in half, however, you merely slam roughly against its iron mass.  'Apparently, it's designed more for brute strength than cutting precision,' you think as you stand up shakily from where the collision knocked you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thundering footsteps call your attention back to the outside and you peer through the gap afforded you by the raised bed.  Beyond you see a sandaled pair of feet enter your shrunken world.  They are monstrous, the size of minivans, their mass barely restrained to the soles below by tangled lashings of leather, like beasts imprisoned by knotted cords.  Your breath catches in your throat when you see where her feet stop -- directly before your broken ship.  A hand appears and the space-craft looks toy-sized beside it.  Bracelets of tarnished bronze clatter as she pulls it up out of view.  Above you hear the abrasive sound of metal being pried apart and see more wreckage of your ship falling down to join the rest on the floor. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the Amazon discovers the craft is empty, she drops it to the ground where it smashes spectacularly in front of you, some of the debris even flying as far as the bed.  Then you see her foot rise and stomp, smashing the ship as flat as a wrecking ball would have.  She grinds the craft into the cave floor for a moment, its twisted metal squealing against the stone.   \"You bitch,\" you dare whisper under your breath, knowing now that you're stuck on this rock for good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider a better hiding spot since the giantess obviously knows you're here, but before you have time to think her voice booms out across the cavern like underground thunder.  \"Garuthra! ed tras daza!\" she says which you interpret as something like, 'I know you're here, little man!'  You reach into your vest for the phonetic translator, almost fearing to put it on.  You do anyway driven by curiosity and after a moment's pause you hear her once again.  This time in English.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

Her sandals turn in your direction, massive toes with unclipped, hooked nails pointing toward you're hiding spot.  \"You think I can't find you little man,\" the Giantess mocks her knees coming down like a pair of rockets fallen back to earth.  The impact knocks you on your back where you feel ever the more helpless.  \"I can smell your blood, morsel.  I smell your blood, your sweat and,\" she takes another deep sniff, \"your fear.\"  The giantess laughs in her thuggish voice.  \"Why ever you fear me?\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shadow deepens at the edge of the bed and you see a massive pair of breasts dip into the view followed by a smooth but muscley arm.  You shout as the hand lunges at you from the dark.  To her, you think, it must sound something like the high-pitched squeal of a mouse.  Strong fingers with jagged dirty nails close around your little body entrapping you and pulling you towards a sweaty palm.  You make no attempt to resist but have the forethought to keep one arm near your pistol in case things should go even more south -- as if that were possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the hand finally closes, it does so with the undue force of someone who either doesn't know their own strength or doesn't care.  You are left struggling to even breath, your head the size of a grape barely protruding between her thumb and fore finger, your feet sticking out beneath her pinkie.  In this manner she pulls you out from the bed and you are momentarily blinded by the sudden light.  When the glare clears her titanic silhouette focuses to reveal the giant form of a primitive yet voluptuous cave-woman.  She brings you up to her unwashed face, close to her rather bulbous nose.  \"I told you I smell you, runt!\" her voice batters you as if each word were an airy object hurled in your direction.  She then brings you right up under her gaping nostril and against your better judgment you look up.  'Ywuaauck,' you think, creating a new word in your mind to describe the dark hairy portal dripping with mucous and lined with stale cracked snot.  The nostril sniffs at you its suction great enough to lift your hair straight up.  \"Me like your smell, little man, I might not eat you for while.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Okay,' you decide, 'this is way south.'  You pull at your laser pistol but find to your chagrin that the giantess's grip has your arm firmly locked in place -- you're defenseless.  The Amazon pulls you away from her nose and gives you an angry squeeze, apparantly misinterpreting your attempt as a struggle to free yourself, as if that were possible.  The pressure snaps one of your ribs and you cry out.  \"See what you make me do, little man.  You should act better.  I don't want to kill you so soon.\"  Having put you into submission she walks off foot steps thundering far below.  You feel your rib, it hurts like a son-of-a bitch but its not turned in any bad way.  Without further abuse, it will probably set and heal on its own... 'without further abuse, yeah right.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAround you the cave narrows into a vast passage, hall length for the Amazon, positively endless for you.  She takes a few titanic strides down it carrying you at hip-level and then turns through a door which is not but a scaly hide, 'dinosaur?' draped over a giantess sized crack in the bedrock.  Beyond is... </span></div></div>",

When you do its to late; you reach for it but the other hand picks you up by the leg and the gun, its holster already unbuttoned, slips out and falls beyond sight.  At once her other hand is upon you pinching and tearing your space suit from you piece by precious piece.  She even strips off your thermal inliner when the rest is gone leaving you hanging naked and more vulnerable than ever from her fingers.  She lifts you up and dangles you above her lips.  A tongue the size of a pool-table emerges and swipes their surface sloppily.  Finally losing your epic cool you begin to cry as the thought of being ground up by her teeth crystallizes into harsh reality in your brain.  \"Awww don't worry little man,\" she says sounding surprisingly sweet all of a sudden, \"I just want to taste you.\"  With this as the only warning you are dipped down through the giantess's lips into her awaiting mouth.  Above you the lips close, a tight wet seal around both your legs.  Alone with her tongue you hang powerless as it rakes its slimy surface over every inch of your exposed flesh.  She keeps her lips tight together as she pulls you out so that you feel than sliding up your whole body.  They only stop when they reach your head, sucking on it with such force you feel your cervical vertebrae about to disjoint.  Finally she releases you from the oral prison and you take a much need gasp of fresh air.  \"You taste as good as I thought you would, morsel.  Don't know how long I'm goin to be able to hold off eating you.\"  Suddenly you are dropped into dark confines and are staring up at her neolithic visage.  She grins hungrily down on you, her culinary intents quite clear.  Then a lid closes above and like night covering the sky it douses your new world in dark.  You breathe a painful sigh glad atleast to be alone, then you hear a voice.</span></div></div>",

Sitting thereupon with her tall back arched away from you and your owner, is another younger Amazon.  You can't see much about the girl apart from her elongate arms and legs and stray frizzy lockes of crimson hair.  <b>\"Geida,\"</b> her mother calls above.  As she waits for her daughter to turn and acknowledge her, her muscular fingers work out their impatience on you over squeezing your body like a stress ball.  On the third compression you're sure the blood rush is going to blast your head off in a fountain, but before it happens the girl shifts around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWere she an earthling you'd guess her age to be around seventeen.  Though she has a similar face to her mother, complete with over-sized nose and striking though mated hair, her figure is the opposite.  Instead of voluptuous the girl is gangly as a giraffe, with unproportionally long arms and legs and a straight elongated torso.  She reminds you of Becky Walters, one of your High School class mates.  You still remember when she asked you out to prom.  You'd said, 'maybe when the other half of your hormones hit.'  <i>That was a good one,</i> you reminisce laughing despite your situation.  The next words from the monstrous lips above cause you to suck up your last guffaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geida, you need new slave?\"  The girl immediately perks up and despite the smeared lip stick you can tells she's smiling broadly.  \"You can have this one till next Moon Feast.\"  'Feast?! No way I'm gonna be an appetizer for these pea-brained ultrafeminists!'  You struggle against the Amazon mother's hand once more, and she looks down at you seeming more satisfied than angered by your resistance.  \"He a fiesty one Geida, I know you like them.\"  The gangly teenager smiled again and you can't help noticing her lipstick once more; it didn't fit with this culture, or the rest of her primitive fashion -- even with your one course in extraterrestrial anthropology you knew that much.  \"Just don't break him, and don't eat him before the Feast or they'll be no <i>sashwain</i> for you this month.\"  As she hands you toward her daughter you notice a shape between the girls folded legs -- a man, or what used to be one.  Missing two whole appendages he gushes blood onto the bed's hide cover, but shock seems to have rendered him both motionless and mute.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore accepting you, the daughter lifts her prey to her lips.  They give a red smile to the source of their crimson stain and then open wide.  She crams the entire man inside, quite a task despite the youngish age of her food and begins to chew.  You watch transfixed as a single protruding arm grips and flexes at the impossible pain its body is experiencing within.  The girl's teeth reinvigorates the man's voice as well and you can hear his screams vault beyond blood curdling once the jaws start to grind him up.  While the girl's long fingers enwrap you, your eyes stay locked on her lips.  The arm belonging to her last pet, goes limp finally and she sucks it in to be masticated to pulp along with the rest of his flesh.  As she chews her eyes occupy themselves with you.  Beneath the gaze of this girl who has complete power over you, you can almost feel your dick shrinking, 'this is a bizarro world if I ever saw it.  If any sex should rule the other it should be...'  \"He's cute Momma, I think he can be my...  </span></div></div>",

'I've seen waitresses in red neck bars with better smiles than this Amazon,' you consider as you look through the gaps in her jaundiced grin.

The figure of the giantess in the door sends a fresh wave of fear down you and you involuntarily empty your bladder into your space suit.  Dressed in the style of a primitive barbarian, her muscled body is draped in the skins of slain behemoths and she holds at her side a wicked club tipped with cruel iron spikes.  Despite all the massive scope of her, your eyes can't help but focus on that club and see the blood stains covering is dull points.  You wonder how many creatures your size and larger have met their demise beneath its crushing weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Blarthrag noor?!\"  The Amazon intones in her deep but feminine voice.  You fiddle with your universal translator trying to get the device clipped to your ear but fear makes your hands shake and you wind up dropping the fragile thing to the stone below where it shatters.  Looking up from your last chance at diplomacy you see the giantess striding toward you, her face an angry thundercloud poised between powerful shoulders.  \"Gorvel ek du turanok, SPLAY!!\"  Her feet slam down on either side of you the force of their impact sending you prone.  You look up to see her raising her club.  It comes down on you in a swift arc, its shaft the length of a sizable sycamore, its bulbous spiked head the width of volkswagen.  Emitting a shriek which sounds small, even to you, you fall to the ground.  The club follows you and hits the stone with a loud 'ka-chunk.'  Immediately you feel hard metal pinching in on you on either side.  Above, the weapon's splintering shaft mashes you flat.  You manage with effort to turn your head to the side and get a close-up view of one of the spikes.  You must be the luckiest man in the galaxy, you wound up right between the killing points.  Others, you realize noticing the cracked remains of a femur embedded in the wood, haven't been so lucky.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are forced to reobserve your luck as the club begins to rise and you find you're stuck, the rigid contours of your space suit lodged between the two points of iron.  It lifts into the air, recalled by its brutal mistress's flexing biceps and its carrying you with it -- screaming all the way.  For a moment you watch her looking for you obviously having expected to find your bloodied carcass still beneath her neolithic mace.  Eventually, and unfortunately for you, her crude intelligence puts two and two together and her eyes drift in your direction.  Wildly you squirm, knowing this is your last chance to free yourself, but you can not begin to match the force that drove you into such a wedge.  The Amazon, however, can.  Her giant calloused fingers pick you out as easily as you'd pick a wad of food from between your teeth and for a moment you get a close up view of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe might have been attractive had she made any effort at self grooming.  Instead her face is dirty and pot-marked, her lips are cracked and her red hair is a lumpy tangle of what you could only call dreads (though this was truly an offense to the Neo-Rastafarians of Alpha-Zion 4).  She smiles at you showing rows of yellow teeth, but it quickly turns to a snarl once she notices something.  \"GALUG NWAP!\"  The words very nearly knock you out from between her fingers with their pounding decibels.  She shakes you a few times, scrambling your perceptions as fully as a pan-galactic gargleblaster might.  Then she starts picking at your space suit tearing it away from you bit by little bit.  She drops each tiny piece to the floor, her only interest evidently being you.  She grips your arm in between her massive thumb and forefinger and you can see she's wondering if this is part of your suit.  \"Please,\" you scream terribly conscious of what's about to happen, \"please n...\"  She pulls just a bit and the arm pops out of its shoulder joint jarring you with pain.  She pulls again and your arm tears completely off opening up a fountain of blood from inside you.  In too much pain to see what she does with your dismembered arm you can only writhe as you listen to loud chewing sounds above you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlood loss, is dimming your vision and slowing your brain but you can see clearly enough her lips growing larger before you.  She sticks you past their parting membrane over crooked rows of teeth where you very nearly fill her mouth.  A wide flat tongue is undulating beneath you.  Suddenly it raises up and slick with her saliva you can do nothing to stop your descent down her throat.  Legs kicking in a futile display you go down her gullet.  Passing through a rhythmically contracting passage you are squeezed through a narrow tensing opening which spurts you out into hot steamy air.  You land with a splash in a pool of liquid.  Some of this foul soup goes in your mouth and instantly starts burning the sensitive tissue within.  With dread you realize where you are -- in her stomach.  The nightmarish thought is your last as what remains of your blood seeps out into her bowels and you sink down into the depths of her digestive juices to be slowly dissolved.   </span></div></div>",

Eagerly you scan the arid terrain looking for a tempting place to set your ship down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the distance straddled by a rim of sheer cliffs nothing short of a lizard might scale, you see a monolithic shape appear through the clouds.  The statue of a proud, female warrior, stares at you, eye level despite your altitude.  You pull up on the stick breaking the cloud barrier.  Even then you see the point of her upraised broad sword piercing through the white.  'What kind of crazy, feminist-ruled planet did I choose, anyway?'  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce you're sure you've passed it, you bring the ship down through the clouds and bank around for another look.  This time you fly lower and closer easing back on the throttle so you can make a prolonged study.  'Best to understand the locals,' you think, 'before deciding where to park for an extended stay.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon taking a closer look at the statue you see its assembled of great sand-stone bricks, but none of it made any sense.  For all the mechanical ingenuity it must have taken to stack them so high, this race was surely lacking in artistic skill.  All of the figure was crudely chipped and carved into shape, leaving only jagged edges, even across what should have been the smooth swell of her hip.  \"How could a race advanced enough to assemble such a statue, not be able to do a better job of sculpting it?\" you can't help but ask aloud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wonder what they used for mortar to keep such giant bricks together and sidle the plane closer to the statue.  Squinting shows you nothing more than a faint red line so you reach for a pair of digital binoculars.  A moment later you drop the expensive device to the floor of the cockpit where it shatters.  Above, your face remains rigid with fear, its hues practically bleached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Bones....  Thousands of them...'  The skulls were unmistakable.  They used people for their mortar and if what you just saw was a fair picture of the rest of the statue, then entire nations must have been sacrificed in its erection.  For a moment you couldn't help but wondor what it would have felt like, seeing that stone coming down on you.  What it would have felt like to be ground into a paste of blood and bone to mix with that of your kinsmen who'd be similarly popping, gushing their insides all around you.  And, all for what?  The glory of some tribe of Amazons who held to the misguided idea that women can be warriors.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou swerve the ship away from the statue and simultaneously cast your gaze downward, eager for any distraction from your gross imaginings.  Near the feet of the stone giantess you see what appear to be human or humanoid habitations.  One, sitting at the crest of the cliffs, directly between the statues outfacing big toes is a temple of sorts surrounded by obelisks and populated by robed figures.  Far below this at the base of the sheer cliffs is a scattered village of primitive-looking yurts.  The people here are clothed in rags or nothing at all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

Pistol at the ready, you step out into the hot dry air.  The abrasive wind convinces you to fish your helmet out of the cockpit before going further.  You fit the clunky thing on and click the visor into place.  Eyes now free of irritation you scan the landscape through tinted glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arid and dead,\" you say to yourself.  'Just like the scans.'  A scampering sound behind one of the nearby mounds, however, forces you to recant your analysis.  You walk toward it laser first.  Crouching down you stealthily ease yourself over the gritty sand to spy beyond the hill.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the far side you see... nothing.  You are about to lower your laser, putting it off to the wind when a sudden impact knocks you down the hill.  Halfway to the bottom you realize something is rolling along with you.  It's large and scaly and its sharpened teeth are snapping with ferocity at your helmet.  You use the momentum of the fall to throw the lizard off you and come up ready, laser aimed at the beast.  Before you pull the trigger, however, you realize your attacker is not a lizard but a dinosaur.  It looks something like a velociraptor, standing on two legs, body bristling with claws and teeth, yellow eyes full of cruel cunning.  It wouldn't matter if you were facing a T-rex; though, not with this weapon.  You pull the trigger sending a blade of lazer light slicing through the animals neck.  It falls over shuddering as its cold blood drains out onto the hot ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot knowing that the creature you face is a pack hunter, you holster the weapon and turn only to find three of the beasts stalking you.  Before you can draw your pistol the nearest one bowls you over knocking it from your hand.  You look up into its salivating maw. <br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

It whips you about in response your head still in its jaws.  The motion finally does the job of dislodging your helmet, and you go flying leaving it stuck between the predator's teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou land sprawled halfway between one of the thing's advancing pack-mates and your laser pistol which appears unbroken.  The reptile is walking head down and snarling, its merciless yellow eyes focused on you.  Deciding its your only chance, you resolve to dive for the weapon, but before you can, a skull sized rock pegs the dinosaur in the head crushing its own instantly and spraying the ground to the left with brain and bone.  Your would be devourer falls into its own gore and you look to the right from whence the stone fell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRubbing your eyes does nothing to dispel the sight before you, and realizing its hard reality, you start to scramble backward in fear.  The alien appears to be a human girl-child, around ten years of age.  Her proportions are normal, but she stands nearly fifty feet in height.  'If this is how tall a child is then what about adults.'  You remember the size of the statue and scramble even faster to escape.  The girl Amazon looking suddenly angry loads another stone in her slingshot, a weapon made from a small tree-trunk split down the middle.  Her appearance is of a barbarian, covered only by crude hides and her own filth, so you have no doubt she'll fire.  Ceasing all motion, you hope she gets the message that you give up.  To your horror she draws back the weapon's elastic and lets fly her shot anyway, aiming in your direction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou cringe knowing you'll be pulverized, but the rock flies overhead missing you by a good few feet.  Behind, you hear an animal shriek and turn to see the dinosaur which originally attacked you lying crumpled around the stone.  Turning about, you watch in awe as the girl strides up confidently and raises her bare foot above the remaining reptile.  Dirty toes come down binding the struggling creature to the ground.  Snapping at her foot it finds her callouses an impenetrable armor.  Your fear returns in full force when the child reaches down, pinches the things snarling head between her fingers, and with that terrible smile shared by all youthful torturers, pulls its head slowly off.  The splatter of blood nearly reaches to where you lay but the young giantess seems unsatisfied and tosses the still reflexively biting head away over her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Amazon walks forward each foot step jolting the ground beneath you.  She stops as her shadow falls over you.  You look up but fail to see her childish face due to the glint of the high sun, which is too bad because you'd really like to see if she still wore that sadistic smile.  Instead, you wind up looking at her ankles, the part of her anatomy eye level with you, and notice something you didn't earlier.  Around her right leg is a bracelet of dangling bones... human bones.  You remember the statue and its grizzly masonry and look about for a means of escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes find your laser gun, in all the chaos you'd forgotten about it.

If it could take out a tank it could take out a Giantess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oweee!\" she finally cries as if the hurt was so slight that it took her a moment to notice it.  'No way.'

An explosion in the earth before you reminiscent of a howitzer shell striking a hostile beach stops all your schemes in their tracks as well as you.

You may still have the superior intellect, but without technology how could you match the power of even the simplest child toy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young amazon slips another stone into her slingshot.

Her skin is deeply tanned, not unexpected on a planet  practically hugging the nearest star with its orbit.  Her hair is an earthen red, but wild and unkempt like a brush fire.  Hide clothing draping her titan's body bore evidence that there dwelt monsters on this world at least as big as she.

Images of the velociraptor, head plucked off like a berry from a vine, return to you and your mind, sadist as always, paints you into its place.  Replays of you trapped under the girl's toes as she tweaks your skull from your spine assault you as the hand whisks you into the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead of taking you immediately up to her face for inspection, she stalks over to a nearby boulder.

In fact, the pattern continues in a sadistically unpredictable manner until finally after another unheralded but blessed stop you hear from outside the sounds of a scuffle.  Far below, something is snarling.  You bet that if it sounds like a viper from 30 feet up astride this girl's hip, it very well might be another of those dinosaurs.  Still by the sounds of pained squealing that follows, you feel safe to bet the monster's met its match in the 'little' girl.  \"Nice job, Billy Jo!\" you call clapping.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour pouch prison shifts as the girl bends over and you slide over an uneven course of bones.  Due to the deathly silence, you presume shes retrieving her kill.  A moment later the sky fills with the desert sun.  Then all is blotted out by an irregular shadow.  The loud <i>thwump</i> and ensuing organic clatter announces the arrival of a new trophy to your hall of bones.  Before she can close the pouch you take advantage of the remaining light to see what it is the Amazon killed...  </span></div></div>",

You'd figured by now she'd seen and heard everyone of your embarrassing moments through your own eyes, including the ones regarding the fairer sex.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe very suggestion shatters her porcelein face with shock.  'I would never probe the mind of a senient without their consent.' 'Well that explains why I'm not smoosh... ah shit not again'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'What explains??'  The Goddess looks puzzled but still purely innocent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Oh nothing.  Listen, about those human colonies.  If you could just tell me their coordinates and use your funky magic powers to fix my ship.  I'll be..'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You wish to leave already, life-giver.'

You're starting to learn your way around these Giantess; just like any woman you only need to know where the strings are and how to pull them.  For a moment you consider staying, after all if this one is anything like the rest of her kind I can have this whole civilization working for me in days.  Despite the temptation of being serviced by a starship of living Goddesses, you decide after seeing the pieces of your ship hover back into view that you owe it to your species to investigate these colonies.  What if they're in trouble...  'What if they lack males of breeding age..'  You catch yourself only too late, but a glance up reveals the Goddess is concentrating far to hard to hear your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes look like twin blue giant stars and her chant nearly shakes you off your feet as it rises toward a crescendo.  Meanwhile the scraps of your ship: titanium siding, microchips, fuel lines; are not fitting together in the jigsaw manner you'd expected.  Instead they are slamming into one another at great speed, like protoplanets in an early solar system, forming a bulging molten blob of metal.  'What the hell are you doing to my ship?!' you think before remembering she can't hear you.  Depressed but hopelessly intrigued by the sight, you sit and watch as all of your ship compresses into a shiny sphere the size of a blurnsball.  Encapsulated still in the magical blue light, the sphere begins to reexpand at its urging.  Four elongations and the budding of a smaller sphere ('a head?') put it on the way toward a humanoid shape.  When the light finally releases its hold, the crude form falls over into a fetal position where the final details of the transformation continue like the rising of muffins withdrawn from the oven.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou make no effort to close your gaping jaw as you see perfect feminine features mold themselves out of silvery skin.  When she stands you can see she's taller than you by a head, but perfectly formed right down to her sterling nipples and cobalt lips.  Your ship looks like a supermodel coated in liquid silver, her hair a plasma trail of brilliant red.  Somehow you find it in yourself to be displeased.  'I said I wanted my ship, not robo-Eve!?' <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You said, you wanted me to return your ship to its true form; this <b>is</b> her true form.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Honey,' you think, 'if thats my ship's true form then I never would have made it out of flight school,' you take another gander at her curves, 'come to think of it I never would have made it out of my bunk...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer voice stops your thoughts as surely as a lobotomy.  \"Mi..chael?...\" She squints at you like a long lost friend trying to see through ten years of age.  Awareness creeps over you as you watch the baffled woman spread her silvery fingers and look down at them and her body in newfound wonder.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer?...\"</span></div></div>",

On the other side the blue haired elf giggled once more but a sharp glance from the braided one silenced her.<br>\r\n   <br>\r\nThe pillow floats even closer to the Elf in the center and you can see now that the giantess's irises glow the same color as the pillow.  You figure she's the source of all this meddlesome telekinesis.  Taking a closer look at her pale face you notice another differences between the alien's body and those of normal humans: her skin was overlaid with a faintly shimmering glitter as if she'd been tatooed all over by a unicorn obsessed girl.  Other tats, swirling patterns and an elegantly curling script graced the giantess's descending neck, whether any of these were truly 'inked', you aren't sure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly a hand, wide as a house floats into view beside the pillow.  You look into the giant owner's face and you see her smile reassuringly as if saying everything will be o.k..  Should you trust these strange giantesses, after all what other purpose could such towering females have than to torment empowered men like yourself.  Then again, they were beautiful and they hadn't directly harmed you, just your ship. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Much to your surprise, this was not the case. She instead put her index finger down right in front of you on the pillow, as if inviting you to climb on. Despite still feeling nervous around these powerful females, you decided that they didn't have any intentions of harming you. After all, if they did want to hurt you, then you would probably be flattened into paste between their massive boobs by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiguring that it would be best to be polite to these giant girls, you begin to climb onto the purple haired goddess's fingertip. Once you had climbed on successfully, the giantess smiled at you and lifted you up to her face. The other two girls leaned in to get a closer look at you. Then the purple haired one who was holding you began to speak. Not through her mouth (because at her size, the lightest breath from her would be like a tornado to you), but instead directly into your mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Greetings alien creature, and welcome to Lysune. My name is Marona, and these are my younger sisters.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe giggly blue haired one spoke up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hi there! I'm Salia, and it's a pleasure to meet you! You know, you're actually pretty cute...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe blond one with the braided hair gave Salia a light smack to the back of her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ow! Sis, what was that for?!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIgnoring her sister's complaints, she then looked down at you and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I apologize for my little sister's rudeness. My name is Aralis, and it's nice to make you're acquaintance.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese girls all seemed so polite. Even Salia, despite the fact that she seemed to be more childish than other other two, had an aura of kindness about her that just made you feel at ease. Deciding that it would only be polite to respond to them, you raise your voice as loud as you can and speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello! My name is Mike, and-\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSalia's giggling cuts you off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aw, he's just so cute! You don't have to yell for us to hear you, little guy. Just like we can speak directly into your mind, we can also read your thoughts as well. If you want to communicate with us, just think it!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately shut your mouth and begin to speak to them through your thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well... That's certainly more convenient than having to strain my voice to talk with you... As I was saying, I'm Mike, and I'm a human from the planet Earth. It's nice to meet you three. So, what do you plan on doing with me now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarona, Salia, and Aralis all simply smiled at you. Then Marona said...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

When you go to pull the trigger, however, it doesn't budge.  You flex your fist but not so much as a spark exits the barrel.  Then you see the blue light once more and you look around to see the weapon, your only protection from these titans out of Tolkein, encased in an aura of the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh shit,\" you whisper your head slowly turning around and up to face the Goddesses.  Expecting to find anger you are surprised to see only disappointment and not even that with the giggly blue-haired Elf; she looks... sad.  Under their gazes you don't just feel impotent anymore you feel guilty, as guilty as you did when you shot your father's favorite dog in a hunting accident, only magnified thousands of times.  You barely notice the pistol floating from between your weak fingers, you feel wretched, how could you have turned your weapon on something so beautiful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laser you had aimed at these now obviously serene aliens flies over the face of the pillow taking a while to reach the purple haired Elf's outstretched fingers.  When it does they clamp in upon it, and it disappears between them like a gnat between the closing walls of a trash compactor.  She opens them a moment later and the remains slowly peel off her thumb then frisbee off toward the edge of the pillow.  The sight of seeing the titanium casing flattened to the width of a sheet of paper reignites your fear -- that could just as easily be you, more easily in fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Fingers of the disapproving Goddess then come for you.  Their nails are painted purple, and jeweled rings wide as circus rings hoop their length between the knuckles.  The fear, powered still by the image of the flattened weapon, takes you, literally.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bolt across the pillow's expanse, but the opposite side just seems to get farther away while the shadow of the Goddess's hand is ever gaining on you.  You trip as it comes over you as if the massive shadow itself had weight.  When you look up it is through the heights of a pink ravine, its cliff edges etched by spiraling gouges.  The Goddess's face looms high above you, still dissaproving, like a mother who's just seen her child fire off a bb-gun in the house.  Uttering a shriek which is to them more like a peep, you jump up and run for the opening of the ravine all the while the fleshy walls closing on you.  The opening becomes a slit of light and you dive for it hoping to silp to safey.  You do...halfway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Elfin Goddess raises you pinched between her fingers, your tiny torso sticking out from between them like nothing more than a pinhead.  Her blue eyes swallow you up like sapient seas and you go limp in her massive grasp accepting finally then that escape is impossible.  Then for the first time the titans speak but not with their mouths, the very act of doing so, especially when you're so close, could very well blow your ear drums out.  Instead the voice appears garbed in silken thoughts only.  Soft but stern, leaving no doubt as to who the more evolved of the two species are, it opens in your mind like a flower of thought and emotion.  'You must learn...'  </span></div></div>",

You began to feel yourself gravitate in her direction and the smile widened.  Coming into orbit with her, you couldn't help but note other aspects of the beautiful terrain: eyes yellow like as desert's, nostril marked by a mound-sized gemstone, and a tiara flowing like a river of silver across her forehead.  'Delaphne, is the mystery keeper of this art,' your keeper's thoughts resonated from above and behind like the tremors of a distant volcanoe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'You can call me Del,' the shorter though still titanic Elf broke in with her own jingling line of thought. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'That'll help if I start missing my computer', you joke to yourself, forgetting again that around these Giantesses there was no such thing as privacy.

HEY!\"  The fingers cornered you and pinched together ever so gently.  'Be Still,' came the elfin Goddess's calming voice.  You found yourself surrounded by soft ridged flesh of her massive fingertips, but due to her grace, your fragile little body remained unharmed.  Your pilots senses told you that you were moving, but as to where, you couldn't know for everything around you was the same pinkish color.

Before you can make another grab for it, a boulder of ice side swipes the ship.  Your hand is knocked away from the controls and alarms go off at once.  \"Starboard boosters inoperable,\" the female computer calmly explains.  Another smaller chunk then strikes but with much greater velocity causing the whole ship to shudder.  \"Air leak detected,\" the computer adds, explaining the high pitched hiss you begin hearing beneath you.  \"Cabin depressurization in approximately 6 minutes.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs your ship spins in the direction of the ice and water, you see one of obvious alien design come into view.  Compared to your tiny craft it is gigantic.  In fact, the thing sucking you in is but a little tube extending from the vessel's hull.  You look in the opposite direction and see a field of icy asteroids and it dawns on you.  'They must be harvesting water.'  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout your thrusters all operating, you'd just wind up putting the ship in a spin if you tried the controls again so you let the water carry you along, hoping maybe that the aliens will detect your ship once within their storage tanks.  Swirling about the tube like water above an open drain you travel in a tightening orbit of increasing speed.  The centrifugal force squashes you against the out facing side of the ship, releasing you only once you are sucked into the tube's dark interior. There the water continues to carry you along.  Lights from the ship illuminates a bland interior of endlessly segmented metal cylinders.  From wall to wall the tube looks to measure 50 feet.  Glad at least that the ship wasn't about to get jammed you turn your eye to a now more pressing dilemma: the rising pool of water at your feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer?\" you ask, \"how long till the compartment fully floods.\"  \"Ten minutes,\" comes the unconcerned response.  \"Damn.\"  While your thinking about your problem yet another rears its head.  Just as you predicted the tube spits you out upon the frothing and rapidly rising surface of a titanic cistern, but you don't remain there for long.  The metal ship sinks like a stone and within minutes its hull is creaking.  \"Maximum pressure limits exceeded.\"  Your physics training reminds you that, for all its destructive nature, the vacuum of space can't hold a candle to pressure and ships designed to handle the former could rarely handle the later, yours included.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wait because that's all you can do (the pressure outside would surely obliterate you in an instant) and to your relief the ship strikes bottom with a hollow metallic clang before crushing like a tin can.  Peering out into the depths you see uniform blue and gray in all directions except to your right.  There on the otherwise untextured floor of the 'ocean' a valve opens and contracts periodically sucking in water with it.  In a flash of inspiration you remember your port- thrusters are still working and your hand goes for the stick.  A couple brief blasts and the tubes suction does the rest pulling you down into the unknown.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I wonder where it leads?'<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It is a giant bird with a wingspan that would make the rocs of earth legends look like malnourished pigeons.  That by itself would not be so bad, but what really unnerves you is the carriage that swings beneath its feathery expanse.  Tethered to the flying animal through a complex rigging of knotted ropes and vines, the compartment itself  is made of tree-sized spars lashed tightly together.  It isn't exactly what you'd call technology but no doubt it was crafted by something intelligent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you fly beneath the raptorial transport you consider the options.  \"Computer, run genetic scans on the...

You crane your neck out the window to see a crude lasso looped around the wing.  Following the rope up to the craft, you see a giant furry arm gripping and pulling it toward the ship.  You notice the opposable thumb and humanoid fingers but realize even, at this distance, that its scale was far beyond anything one could call human.  \"Sorry, baby no time.

'Just because I'm small doesn't mean I can't sting.'  You pull the trigger sending a barrage of eight missles streaking toward the giant eagle.  You know better that to aim for the compartment.  'Never kill the rider, when you can kill the horse,' you quote as you watch the white smoke trails trace a line right to the creature's heart.  Knowing any heat seeking missles fired at a warmblooded organism so large were sure hits, you prepare to gun the throttle when it goes down, chest cavity hollowed by the blast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe eight missles do all strike down exactly where you aim, their explosion issuing a cloud of fire and smoke which is smaller than you had hoped for when compared with the bird's massive body.  When the smoke drifts away you see, rather than a gory hole leading into internal organs, barely tarnished feathers.  Suddenly your feeling of power drains out through your feet replaced by cold dread.  The monster is just to big to damage, atleast with your arsenal, but you did succeed in doing one thing -- getting its attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe raptor cocks its hook-beaked head in your direction, annoyonce evident in the one eye that faces you, then it snaps.  You gun the thrusters, your hand at the ready but the rope behind you snags; you look and see the furry arm staining but still holding on.  'Damn these giants are stronger than I thought,' you admit, but your wisdom is too late, for the beak is already engulfing you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFizby lets go of the rope so as not to be drawn in along with the strange silver bird.  The Lynx rubbed her gray furry stomach which protested the loss of her meal.  \"Oh well,\" she consoled herself as she took her seat next to a sleeping Buck.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mice?\"  The call came from the Vixen stewerdess swaying up the aisle.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFizbi gave her a disinterested glance, 'tramp,' but extended her hand none the less.  Into it the Fox dropped two anthropomorhpic mice, both with tussled blond hair and one wearing a tiny blue skirt.  They look truly terrified in the hands/paws of the giant Feline as she brings them up to her sharp teeth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry I don't have time to play with either of you,\" she says while poking the boy mouse with her clawed finger.  \"But I'm way to hungry right now.\"  She moves her hooked talon to the girl Mouse and teases off her skirt not wanting it you get caught in her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Mice squeak an inaudible plea as they are tossed remorselessly into the Cat's mouth where she chews them up and swallows them down forcefully.  Some muffled cries of terror and pain can still be heard, as they travel in a bulge down her throat but they are silenced once behind her ribcage.  She rubs her now full tummy and begins to purr.  <br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

The sounds of hisses and purrs continue, and you can see giant shadowy forms moving in the distance all around you. You're pretty well hidden behind this rock, since there's also some plants close by that provide almost perfect cover. From here, you look around and plan your next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright... so there's giant... things here,\" you mutter. \"Of course. Why couldn't I land on a planet with aliens my size? Weird, though... that alien looked almost human, except for the cat parts of course...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you consider what to do next, you feel the ground shaking, and see two giant creatures approaching. They're both of the same species as the previous one, and you get a better look at them now. They look very humanlike, but have some odd characteristics. Most obviously, they're giant compared to you--you must be no more than five or six inches compared to them, making you compare yourself to a mouse in front of these cats. They both look like they could easily hold you in a single hand like you were a small doll.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOther than their size, they have other weird traits: they have cat ears instead of human ears, and cat tails too. Their legs are furred and end in paws, and their hands have only three fingers apiece plus a thumb. One of them is bigger and has a much more mature figure than the other, who appears to just barely be old enough to be called a teenager. The older one has tan skin and black fur with piercing green eyes, while the younger one has lighter skin color and dirty-blonde hair with blue eyes. Both are wearing what seem to be leather clothes, but they appear primitive, as they cover only their chests and privates. They also seem to have tribal markings on their skin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey're talking to each other, but you can't understand them. Luckily, you have your translator earpiece, which you activate and start listening to the catgirls with.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and I'm ashamed to say it,\" the older one says.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon Gracaga, I didn't do too bad, did I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, you did! You didn't catch a single animal, Lisnaca! I thought I'd trained you to be a better hunter!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I AM a good hunter! There just wasn't any good prey around!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There were plenty of animals you could've caught! You're just too gentle... You can't stand the thought of hunting and killing, you can only eat what's already been killed. You'll never survive on your own without your sister Liana hunting for you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that, the older catgirl makes a loud \"hmph\" sound and hurries off, leaving the younger one standing there all alone. She sits down on a nearby fallen pillar and hangs her head, sniffing softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou sit back after watching this exchange, thinking over what it taught you. First, there are giant catgirls living here who are civilized enough to have clothes and tribal markings, and relationships of teacher and student, but still seem primitive. Second, there are creatures around that are likely your size, since the catgirls mentioned prey, and you can't imagine them hunting and killing anything too big. Third, this catgirl, Lisnaca, is apparently \"gentle\" and can't stand the idea of killing creatures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this knowledge, you have two options. First: approach Lisnaca and hope she's friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr, you can follow the older catgirl, Gracaga, and see what she's up to. If anything, this option would also let you explore a bit, at the risk of getting murdered by a catgirl.</span></div></div>",

She's still sitting on the fallen pillar and looking down at the ground, her arms folded around her legs and her head resting on her arms. She doesn't notice you as you approach, and soon, you're within a few dozen feet (from your perspective at least).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe catgirl still hasn't noticed you, so you decide to make yourself known. Walking closer still, you start to speak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey,\" you say. \"Can you hear me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe young catgirl's ears twitch and she looks up, glancing around in confusion. She doesn't think to look down, though, and you talk again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm down here!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisnaca looks down, finally spotting you. Her eyebrows raise as she gasps, and gets off of her seat on the pillar and goes down on all fours, bringing her giant face frighteningly close to you. Seeing such a huge creature move so quickly and suddenly is both impressive and scary, and you stammer for a bit before you recover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I.. uh... Hello there,\" you say.

After introducing yourself and telling her your name, you continue to talk, explaining how you crash-landed here and are hoping to find helpful natives to assist you in getting off this planet. The catgirl continues to listen to you, her ears twitching every so often and her long, skinny tail wagging slowly back and forth behind her. Once you're done, you await her answer to see if she can help you in any way, hoping against hope that she can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe catgirl's expression shows that she understands you, as she clearly begins to ponder something, having likely understood your question.

Most of them just show up then go away without doing much, as far as I know. But once, a member of my tribe caught one in her paws, and found a tiny creature inside, that looked kind of like you. It was friendly, but most of the tribespeople considered it prey. A fewof the tribespeople, though, wanted to help it, and discovered that there were crystals on this planet that could power the creature's metal bird. This was all when I was very young, though, so I don't know the details... but from what I understand, if we can find some of those crystals, you might be able to leave here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou nod, taking in Lisnaca's story. \"Alright... Do you know where any of those crystals might be?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the catgirl shakes her head, and you sigh. \"Some of my tribespeople might know, though,\" Lisnaca offers. \"I could go there and see if any of them do.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're about to ask her to do so, but then remember you're tiny and on a planet inhabited by giant cat people that could easily eat you.

You have explored the galaxy and been to several planets before, and you have encountered life forms as big as this catgirl, and some that were even bigger.

You remain smotioness, but you quickly realize it's useless, as the leaves covering your hiding spot are torn away to reveal an enormous green eye staring right at you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Found you!\" the catgirl's voice shouts, and you quickly get to your feet, stumbling back as far into the hole as you can go. Unfortunately for you, it doesn't seem to go back very far, and the catgirl seems to realize this too. With a small laugh, she moves back from the hole, allowing you to catch a glimpse of her tan-skinned and black-hairde (and furred) body. You realize that this is the same catgirl as before, Gracaga, who scolded Lisnaca for being too gentle. Knowing that, you're suddenly very afraid for your life, as she clearly does not like gentleness towards small creatures like yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracaga only moves away from the hole for a moment or two to allow her to move her arm into position to reach in. You stare at the giant hybrid paw-hand approaching you, noting the odd anatomy of the three fingered and one thumbed hand, which has pawpads on its palm and fingers like a cat would have on its paws. The hand reaches for you, and you step back as far as possible, but it doesn't seem to be enough. Luckily, the hand stops right before reaching you, and you realize that the hole is just the wrong size for the catgirl to reach you. She begins wiggling her arm, straining and grunting as she reaches for you. But she can't touch you at all. You sigh in relief, but soon realize your situation. You're stuck in a small hole in the ground with a giant and hungry catgirl just outside, with her hand in the hole and no less than a foot from you. If she stayed here, blocking the hole, you'd be trapped, which is not a fate you want to have. But if you try to escape, she'll be there to eat you. You're in a bad spot, and Gracaga notices that too, apparently, because she starts talking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, little mousie,\" she says. \"You've got two options. First: stay in that hole and see how long you can last. I'll stay right here, blocking you in, so you can't leave without going through me. Got that? Second option: walk right into my palm, and I'll take you out of the hole. You won't be trapped inside for the rest of your life, which is a good thing, right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou consider that leaving this little cave might not be a good idea, since it'll just lead to entering another cave--the catgirl's mouth and stomach. On the other hand, you won't last long trapped inside a tiny cave. What do you decide to do?</span></div></div>",

I always hate when you guys resist. It just wastes time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the catgirl's hand-paw, and gulp in fear. Having explored the galaxy and been to several planets before, you know that some have life forms that are as big as this catgirl, and even bigger, and some even have prehensile body parts that can pick up humans. You've actually allowed this to happen a few times just to see what it's like, and you usually consider it a nice experience, being surrounded by warmth due to the alien's body heat and knowing you're able to be kept safe due to the alien's size and strength. You've been picked up by a few different ways: there was a serpentine alien with tentacles near its head that coiled your torso to hold you, another resembling a giant monkey that used a tail longer than itself to grab you, and several humanoid giant aliens that simply used hands, paws, or talons to pick you up. So, you know what you're getting into here, although you've never been grabbed by a giant alien that was clearly hostile, such at Gracaga seems to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNonetheless, you know it's the only way, so you raise your arms in front of you and walk into her palm. Her hand twitches when she feels you, and her fingers quickly curl around you from chest to knees, though your arms are free due to you raising them first. The catgirl squeezes you gently a few times, as if testing your squishiness, then proceeds to pull you out of the hole. She moves quickly, making you dizzy and making you see just a blur until she brings you to a stop. You shake your head to clear it of dizziness and then look ahead to see the catgirl's giant face, the size of your whole body, right in front of you. Her green eyes stare at you, and you notice a single fang poking from her mouth. You almost shudder as you realize you might be heading into her mouth any moment now, but decide to stay strong. You're only in Gracaga's paw because you let her snatch you up. Your arms are free, too, so you're not totally under her control. Plus, you've experienced being held by giants before, so overall, this experience is not new to you. Besides, you've gotten out of worse situations before, so you decide to glare at the catgirl defiantly and do all you can to resist her should she try to kill you...</span></div></div>",

You quickly move to the entrance, now that it's clear, and see Gracaga crouched a few feet (at her scale at least) from the cave, looking around for the source of the noise, it seems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I heard that, you know!\" she shouts. \"Come on out, mouse! How about you call me fat when we can see each other, huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're confused, but that soon ends when you see what you can only presume to be the sound's source come out of the bushes nearby. It appears to be a mouse person, a mouseboy to be exact, no bigger than you. Like the catgirls, he is part human and part animal in appearance, but significantly smaller. Though he is far away, you can tell that he has all the same traits as the catgirls (furred legs, tail and ears, three fingered hands, even the same style of primitive tribal clothing), but he has mouse traits instead of cat ones. He's also holding a flimsy spear, which he is aiming up at the catgirl. At this distance, it's tough to hear what he says, but apparently Gracaga is insulted by it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why you... Come here!\" Gracaga lunges right at the mouseboy, and to your surprise, he completely fails to dodge her. The catgirl lands on top of him, pinning him to the ground beneath one of her hand-paws, and begins to laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There, mousie... That's what you get for insulting a cat!\" She gets up off the ground, rising to a crouching position, and you see that she's holding the mouseboy in her right hand-paw. The tiny hybrid creature is struggling and shouting, presumably begging to be let go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you stare at the catgirl's successful attack on the mouseboy, you're filled with fear over how that mouseboy could have been you. A moment later. You realize that's still a possibility. The catgirl was distracted, and you're now free to go, but she could remember you at any time.

She doesn't notice your approach, and you're able to get within an foot (at your size) of her before realizing this might have been a bad idea. Being this close to her shows just how massive she is, even when she's crouched lower to the ground. Still, humanity has won out over many dangers, and although giant man-eating catgirls are a new one, you're confident that you can figure out some way to save the mouseboy and stop the catgirl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, you start by punching her, as hard as you can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe catgirl freezes mid-lick, pausing for a moment before slowly looking down towards you. You stand there, your fist up against her black-furred leg, finally realizing that you've made a very big mistake. You look up, seeing the catgirl's green eyes staring down at you, a surprised look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Seriously?\" she asks. You remain silent and motionless, but on the inside, you're cursing your own stupidity. That one useless attack just made you lose a lot of your confidence, so you simply watch as Gracaga begins to grin, showing some fangs, and reaches down with her left, unoccupied hand. You don't move, allowing the furry paw-hand to reach you. The fingers curl around you tightly, and you're roughly plucked off the ground and brought in front of Gracaga's face, right next to the mouseboy held in her other hand. Gracaga looks between the two of you, and after a few moments, a big smile appears on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're funny,\" she says, looking at you. \"Really, you are. You're not even armed, and you still try to fight me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou suddenly feel a burst of energy--possibly because you think you're close to death, and your body is starting to give you more adrenaline--and find the strength to talk back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course!\" you shout, your voice cracking with unintentional fear. It makes your voice sound like a squeak, just like what you'd expect from the mouseboy beside you. The catgirl holding you finds your voice crack funny, and starts to giggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, don't you laugh at me!\" you shout, careful to keep control over your voice. \"Don't you know who I am? I'm a human! We're a very strong species, you know. We've built cities bigger than anything on this planet, and we've built machines that can take us over land and sea, through the air, and even into space, to other worlds! We've conquered our own homeworld, and been to many other worlds too. We've got a reputation as a group you don't want to mess with. And I know I'm not in a good situation right now, but humans have been in those situations tons of times before, and we've never given up! And I won't give up now!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGracaga stares at you as you give your little speech, clearly surprised that a creature small enough to hold in one of her paw-hands is acting so brave, and talking about the strengths of his species despite having just been overpowered by a single member of another species. The mouseboy is surprised too, and glances between you and the catgirl, wondering what her reaction will be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou're wondering the same too, as you glare into those green eyes of hers, each the size of your head.

Unfortunately, it seems like its already noticed you, as within a minute, the leaves covering your hideout are moved away, and you see what you can only describe as a mouseboy standing there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLike the catgirls from before, he is part human and part animal in appearance, but significantly smaller, even shorter than you in fact. He has all the same traits as the catgirls (furred legs, tail and ears, three fingered hands, even the same style of primitive tribal clothing), but he has mouse traits instead of cat ones. He's also holding a flimsy spear, which is aimed right at you. He is younger than you, and seems somewhat scared, but stares at you intently nonetheless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a human,\" you reply, deciding to answer his questions and not provoke him. \"I came here from... Somewhere far away, and I'm trying to get back home.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've never heard of a human before,\" the mouseboy says, \"but you sure look strange.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, same can be said for you,\" you mutter. \"At least I'm not some kind of freaky hybrid thing like everything else on this planet seems to be...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuckily, he didn't hear that last bit about him being freaky, otherwise he would probably have gotten angry. He looks you up and down before speaking again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... you said you need help getting home?\" he asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, but someone is already on that,\" you explain. \"She's off getting help for me right now, so I'm just waiting for her here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who is she?\" the mouseboy asks. \"And what is she?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe way he asks that makes you nervous, but you answer truthfully. \"She's a catgirl,\" you say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe mouseboy stares at you in shock. You wonder if you may have made a mistake saying that, and as the mouseboy speaks, you get your answer...</span></div></div>",

A flick of a switch electrifies transparent heating coils evaporating the water in seconds but doing nothing to remove the white masses concealing the planet's surface.  Like any trained pilot, your eyes turn to your instruments practically ignoring the useless distractions outside. \"Computer switch to short range scans only.  I don't want to run into anything up here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Michael.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You bet your sweet silicon ass 'of course',\" you grumble, eyes still probing the many dials and digital read outs before you.  'Gas content, moisture levels, temperature; it reads like any tropical rainforest on earth only.. this cloud bank is immense.  We should have cleared it minutes ago.'  As if in answer to your request the clouds begin to disperse showing widening glimpses of a green world below.  Soon you are looking down over a vast tropical rainforest, whose foliated expanse seems to have no end.  \"Shirley,\" you say using one of your many mock names for your artificial punching-bag, \"I thought you said that the jungle was not the dominant ecotype on the moon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is correct Michael.  The contiguous forest below accounts for less than 1% of the globe's total biosphere.\"  You blink, cynicism temporarily beaten back by wonder, 'one percent?!'  The numbers hadn't lied about the moon's size, but they had failed to express it on human terms.  The vista below you <b>did</b>, and it was growing larger by the moment as your descent continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Betty switch to bio-scans and find me the densest concentration of lifeforms, that'd be the city.\"  The computer beeps, whirs and flashes through the task eventually responding with coordinates.  \"Alright then, now shut up baby and let the <b>man</b> work his magic.\"  Smoothly and with no loss of ego you bring the craft down into the canopy.  Trying not to gape at branches the size of suspension bridges, you keep your eyes open for a 'civilized' landing spot.  You look for any hint of gray amidst the sea of brown and green that surrounds you.  All appears wild and untamed.  For a moment you think you notice something motionless, dark and splotched with green.  'Maybe the face of a building, overgrown with algae', but upon closer inspection you see it is just the gray-furred back of a monstrous mammal similar in shape and speed to an earth sloth  The green lichen encrusting its fur had more in common, size wise, with the forests of your home planet.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFarther still you descend until the sunlight vanishes and unseen animals replace the visible monsters.  'Perhaps,' you think, 'the density of life picked up by the scan only reflected the packed nature of life in a rainforest and the city, if it was once here, is now long gone.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Well,' you consider, 'if there's no buildings then there's no city.  Might as well look for a cosey natural nook.'  Within no time, your sharp eyes find exactly what the doctor ordered, a knothole the size of a space carrier's landing bay.  Jetting thrusters to stabilize your altitude you bank the ship into the dark.  Bow-lights reveal an almost tapestry-like wall of green foliage and you judge it to be flimsy enough to fly through.  Like the brushes of a car-wash the viney tendrils drape and drag over the cockpit smothering all in green for a moment.  When they drop away they display a quite unexpected interior.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently the forest hasn't overgrown the city -- the forest <i>is</i> the city.  Within the tree, giants lumber; neither human nor alien, but reminiscent of earth felines.  Their stature, build, and general facial shape is 'humanoid' after a fact, but fur, ears, tails and a general cat-like grace betray their true nature.  Before you can be mistaken for a bird, you cleverly kill all thrusters and let the ship drop, reigniting them only when the sensors scream at the approaching floor.  A yank of the stick spins the ship away from the giant Cats.  Hugging the wall all the way, you ease the ship behind some piece of furniture, to titanic to contemplate and set her down in the dusty shadows.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment you pant to catch your breath, letting the adrenaline wash out of your system.  Finally feeling the need for the rational grounding only a computer could provide you ask, \"Kelly, how big are these aliens?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Which aliens, Michael,\" the computer responds with typical tediousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou wipe a hand across your now sweaty face in frustration, \"the Cats, Veronica, the giant <b>god-damned</b> KITTY CATS!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Their average height based on data aquired so far is 82.3 feet, mass average is 45.7 tons.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Great,\" you grumble, \"I'm mouse sized...  Sally I think I'm going to need you in the field for once.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Michael I am honor...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Shut the fuck up,\" you interrupt her as you cram the zip-drive into her main port downloading her AI functions into the handy portable device.  This you hook into the earphone that doubles as a phonics translator.  \"I love technology, lets hope us humans at least have that edge over these tree-hugging giants in that regard.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe computer speaks consolingly into your ear.  \"Michael I am detecting electrical and mechanical devices only.  No quantum-technology is present outside of the ship.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Cool, baby,\" you check your laser pistol, most brutal and simple of all the so-called 'quantum technologies', finding a full charge, \"now lets do some exploring.\"</span></div></div>",

Just as you think nothing will break this stalemate, however, his eyes shift to look over your shoulder and widen.  Your focus remains on him, thinking he's just just trying to pull the old \"look over there!\" trick to divert your attention, but then he lowers his guns and scurries further under the furniture.  As you turn around, you see a Cat woman striding into the room with a broom in hand, a reminder that you--and the Mouse--have much bigger problems on this world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dart after him, and as the two of you look at each other breathlessly, you declare a truce, at least for the moment, as two enormous feet come to a stop in the middle of the room, red claws upon their toes.  At first, you think they might be stained with blood, as if she had impaled Mice upon them, but the uniform distribution of color makes you suspect it's some sort of claw polish.  The broom lowers to the floor, and she begins sweeping.  <i>Good girl,</i> you think.  <i>You know your place.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dare to creep forward, toward the front of the couch, until you have a full view of the beastly broad, who wears only a chemise over her sleek curves, allowing you a glimpse into the canyon between her thighs.  Had that freakish feline face not appeared atop the otherwise very anthropomorphic body, you would have been compelled to ask for her phone number, but she was only good for what was below her neck.  Actually, come to think of it, that made her no different than human women.  Of course, there was also the minor matter of her being somewhere around 80 feet tall, according to the Computer.  Wait a minute....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Computer, are you sure about this chick's height?\" you ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, Michael.  I measure her as 129.6 feet tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost smash the Computer on the ground.  \"What the hell?  I thought you told me they were like 80 feet tall!  Did you include the Mouse in that average or something?  I just wanted to know the height of the Kitty Kongs!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My calculations differentiated between the two species, even though they share approximately 99.1 percent of their genome.  I detect seven individuals of species designated Kitty Kongs in the vicinity, measuring a total of 576.1 feet, for a mean average height of 82.3 feet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So she's like one fifth of the total!  Mind giving me the details?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In descending order of height, they are a 129.6-foot female, a 120.7-foot female, a 100.4-foot female, an 85.1-foot male, a 74.7-foot male, a 40.8-foot female, and a 24.8-foot male.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis meant that you were standing at the feet of the gold medal winner in height, but the fact that two other females rounded out the top three caught your attention.  \"Computer...can you determine their relative ages and list them in that order?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course, Michael.\"  She needs to work for a moment to gather this data.  \"Accoring to my analysis, they are, in descending order of age, an 85.1-foot male, a 120.7-foot female, a 129.6-foot female, a 74.7-foot male, a 100.4-foot female, and a 40.8-foot female and 24.8-foot male of virtually the same age.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat pretty much settled it: this was the Planet of the Pussies in more ways than one.  You made an educated guess that this was a family with five children, and the girl sweeping the room was the eldest daughter, whose father wouldn't even reach the height of her chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For the sake of curiosity, Computer...do you detect any more Mouse people in the vicinity?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I sense a total of three, averaging 8.0 feet tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, great.  Let me guess: the females are much bigger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In descending order of height, they are a 9.1-foot female, an 8.7-foot female, and a 6.2-foot male.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rake a hand down your face.  The Computer's observation that the Mice shared 99.1 percent of their genome with the Cats made it clear that they were both native to this planet, evolving from a common ancestor, instead of your initial assumption that the Mouse species, like you, was an accidental arrival from elsewhere in the Universe, ruling their own relatively puny world but helpless in this giant land.  Not only were they surviving, but they appeared to be thriving, possessing a respectable level of technology that may have even been superior to that of their physical superiors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really are an alien, aren't you?\" the Mouse finally realizes after having the opportunity to observe you while you weren't pointing guns at each other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm starting to think you're just the eye candy on this operation,\" you sneer.  Your best chance of making it through the day here may be to follow him to his group, but then again, who knows what humiliations await you in their matriarchal society?  You'd better make a decision quickly, or the Brobdingnagian broom slowly heading your direction may sweep you right out of hiding.</span></div></div>",

The silence is broken finally by you as you whislte at the sight of a gray polluted orb.  \"Atmosphere 30% CO2, 12% O2,...\"  The computer droned on listing off a number of chemicals, many toxic, which lingered in the tainted astmosphere.  It prompts you to strap on your breather.  A compact but useful device, the breather could strain out toxins and since it stored oxygen at the subatomic level it provided nearly infinite amounts of breathable air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Begin descent,\" you tell the computer through the breather sounding much like an alien yourself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe ship dips down into the gray clouds.

Finally the smog clears and you drop into a shadowy gray cityscape, drab and destitute on all directions.  The buildings that tower over the endless slums leave no doubt in your mind of your relative size in this world.  If there is any remaining it's chased away by a pigeon as big as a jet liner that nearly broadsides your ship.  \"My God,\" you say aloud, words muffled by the pounding of its wings.  \"I'm, like, an inch tall.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis dawning realization is interrupted by the ship's alarm.  \"Fuel leak detected,\" the computer explains.  Looking down you watch in horror as the bar representing the fuel line drops.  'The acid must have melted one of the fuel lines.'  It begins to drop even faster, 'or all three'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh well,' you think, not for the first time.  'Looks like its time to crash.'

Following with your eyes, you see both your horrified faces reflected in a descending spoon.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou dive down tugging the girl along behind you but it is too late.

Within moments she's lost interest.  Working the squirming little man over top of her molars she bites down.  For some reason it takes a few such bites to stop his moving but finally something cracks and she can feel his warm juices trickle down between her teeth.  \"Mmm,\" Cherry observes, \"he's spicier than the others, hmm?\"     <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

'Shame the way they treat teachers, forcing them to eat the same gruel as these ignorent street urchins.'  Her condescending eyes drift between the dark borders of her glasses as she watches the beans pour out onto her plate with grueling slowness.  She stares at the aproned under classmen who served her a moment before marching off.  \"Thank you.\"  They are the tersest words ever spoken on Krynn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n....below<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSubmerged again by the violent abduction of the spoon, you fight back to the surface.  When you burst out from between two stray beans, you must wipes the streaks of tomatoe sauce off your visor to see clearly.  The syrupy vegatable smears the glass and you wind up just hinging it open.  A rush of fresh air enters your helmet followed by sights unseen by men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove and beyond hang the largest pair of mammary glands ever.  They call to a part of your brain inactive since weening, entrancing you like an astrophysicist confronted by a quasar.  'I'm barely big enough to be a nipple ring for this woman,' you think and your dick responds to the indignation shrinking inside your space suit.  Unshackling your eyes from these Goddess sized breasts only with great difficulty you look up along the rise of her black sweater, and the slope of her slender but still massive neck.  Atop this sits a middle aged woman's face, just starting to show the wrinkles of age.  She was probably vivacious once, you bet, but her expression now looks so constricted that any former passion must have surely been squeezed out by now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'To bad she's not normal sized, so I could give her the fuck she obviously needs...'  The tray shudders as the teacher finds her table, reminding you that to this alien you were less a potential mate than a possible snack.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n...above<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs. Nimby's spoon poises over her beans.  Her eyes stalk through the lunch room like weasels.  \"Jimmy stop doodling,  Erin quit fidgeting, Timmy!!?\"  Ms. Nimby glared at a near by little boy.  His mouth hung open still and the teacher could clearly see a human woman pleading for help from within the slimy bolus which sat on his tongue.  'The horror, to think what his parents are teaching him at home.'  \"We chew with our mouths closed young man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Ms. Nimby,\" the young toehead repeated by rote as he closed his lips on the human and continued to eat in strictly regimented chews.  The math teacher's gaze circulated once more, like a baleful light house, and only once assured that order had been maintained did she return to her own lunch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut before her spoon dips, she reaches for a human shaker, one marked <i>Tender</i>.  She taps it over her beans releasing ten or so of the squirming naked treats onto her food.  They were all between the ages of 8-13, the same age group as her students.  'Atleast there's some justice in the world,' she thinks as she scoops up a couple doomed children.<br>\r\n  </span></div></div>",

He hears crying and traces the sound to a young boy sprawled out on the surface of a bean awaiting his demise.  Around him are other cries, but they turn to shrieks as the giantess's face lowers into view like a moon falling toward the horizon.  The spoon hovers close until the women's chapped lips are all anyone can see.  A tongue who's tip alone dwarfs Mike's ship exits and runs across the dry membranes wettimg them with saliva.  The doomed astronaut can only stare entranced by a mixture of fear and a strange erotic desire.  He barely notices the warmth of urine flooding his suit or the erection from which it spouts.  His entire sensory world has collapsed to that one giant mouth.  Neither the mammoth shouts of giant students or the tiny screams of his fellow morsels disturb his singular vision of the teacher's titanic maw.  When it finally opens to a dark canyon spanned by cables of spit, Mike knows in his heart his end had come.  He no longer mattered, we was no longer Ace Space Pilot Mike Anders, he was just a calorie, a bit of protein to be digested, little more than seasoning; and his last task in the universe would be only to die, to die and be dissolved. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the spoon inches forward the children fall silent, they too know their fate and had somehow come to accept it. Or maybe fear itself had made them dumb.  Above yellowed teeth pass like plaque armored sentinels, beyond is a hot, humid dark.  It was only as shadow fell over the spoon that Mike came to his senses.  <i>What am I doing!!  I'm Mike Anders!  I'm the pilot who the navigated the Hell's Storm Nebula, who found the black hole binary system of Sector 3892, who first had sex with a sentient arthropod... well maybe that last one isn't much to proud of, but God damn'it I'm a MAN and I'm not going to sit around to be digested!!</i>  </span></div></div>",

Not wanting to smash into the outside of its brick cone, you do the only thing you can do, steer right into its smoking maw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDarkness engulfs the ship for a moment, but it is soon replaced by an orange glint at the end of a very long tunnel.  All else is obscured by a constant upwards rain of hot ash and smoke.  The dive is too steep to turn so you quell your fears and follow the pipe down to the light.  It brightens with your approach and you can now see the individual coals, briquettes the size of boulders.  Once the pipe opens into the heated furnace you wrench up on the stick barely pulling up before crashing into them.  \"Heat shields failing,\" the computer recounts the latest doom.  \"Shut the fuck up and let me fly,\" you yell as you angle the plane for the furnace door.  A giant shovel is retracting and the olympian workmen is bending down to shut the blast door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou crank the throttle expending the rest of your fuel in one shot but granting you just enough speed to make it through before the iron door toles shut.  Knowing your ship is now doomed to crash, you pull the ejection lever and hurtle out into the unknown.  Your parachute opens immediately, cued by the altitude, but catches hold of one of the many cinders still burning atop the hull.

Even without your translator, however, you get the gist of it -- 'get back to WORK!!'  Watching the ogres trudge off, and leave the bits of silver shrapnel you breathe a sigh of relief at their distraction. They all looked like stupid troglodytes to you (fit for Space Infantry even), but maybe one of them might have been smart enough to think to look up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaving a thin smoke trail you guide your mortally wounded chute through the steel puzzle of rafters, loosing altitude as consistently as time.  When you reach your destination you're cruising no higher than eye level, to these aliens anyway, a distance you estimate to be around 500 feet.  'Crap that makes me no bigger than a chunky bug.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you pass under the door frame increased light temporarily blinds you.  Out in the shop there had been perhaps four flickering oil lamps.  Here in what appeared to be an office, incandescent bulbs radiate with solar intensity.  By the time you can glance around all you have time to notice is a titanic labyrinth of office dividers.  Then the smell of burning plastic calls your full attention upward.  \"Shit!\"  The main tether had caught flame.  When that went you'd have all the maneuverability of a maple leaf.  You needed to look for a spot to unhook and fall unless you wanted to come down hot and obvious in front of these heirs of Hephestus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDirectly below you see a cramped office, though its dimensions are that of a city district to you.  Dominating it is the hunched frame of a middle aged giantess.  She works furiously, cigarette burning at the edge of her painted lips and coffee steaming beside her typewriter.  The coffee would definitely save you and your suit could take the heat.  Unfortunately, your fate after that would be uncertain at best.  Then there was the woman's hair.  Artificially swollen into something resembling earth's antiquated bee-hive hair cut, it would cushion your fall but it might also alert her to your presence.  The only other choice would be to aim for the window and hope to God the chute holds.</span></div></div>",

Never have you felt so tiny and insignificant.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHigh above, your still burning chute continues its trek through sky (little more than a burning napkin, on alien scale), while below it, but still far above you, the secretary is a mountain (on your ordinary scale).  She swings her cigarette poofing smoke from the red rimmed volcanic crater of her mouth.  Tapping it in the ash tray, she reaches her free hand in your direction.

The former shows a fuzzy red orb, while the later clarifies it into a dangling uvula.  You begin paddling with more desperate force aware of what its dangling over, but the current only intensifies.  Behind you the plaque pasted portcullis lowers banishing all light but your own lamps.  Beneath you, the tongue arches up sending you down her throat in a wave of coffee, that sounds like a whirl pool, but must be a swallow.  For a moment you tumble through empty air, but then you feel her esophagus tightening around you, its sticky walls slowing your descent.   Once you're stabilized your beams show an endless red tube leading into down into darkness.  Its folded walls are pushing you along in squelching waves, each one advancing you closer to her stomach and coating you more thoroughly in alien mucus. </span></div></div>",

'Strange,' you think remembering the always busy playgrounds on your own colony of Vocktar-Prime.  Then again those yards were green and bright while this one lays in the shadow of tightly constricting brick buildings.  Taking a closer pass at what must be around head height for these titans you notice that the swing sets and jungle gyms are rusting for lack of use.  'Perfect,' you decide, 'I need somewhere to think this through without being stepped on, and who knows what these giants are like.'  You'd certainly seen enough of the beings from the air to know they looked human, and even if they were exactly so except for their size this was no great comfort considering the history of your species.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGuiding the craft nimbly between the bars of the jungle gym you drop ever more altitude, undecided on your exact landing space until you see an inviting tin can.  It sits, jagged metal opening just poking from the shadow of one of the great buildings.  'That should do,' and it might even have the bonus of having some food still inside.  The thought of subsisting on the discarded refuge of the giants gives you a shiver of revulsion, but you force yourself to remember what few rations you had along with you.  You weren't planning on a pangalactic journey, after all, when you started out to the nearest star.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou coax the craft gently in using thrusters at full force to bring it into a hover in front of the can.  You see a faded, peeling wrapper on its side.  \"Computer,\" you ask, still in hover mode, \"Run a translation on the symbols.\"  The process, not an easy request, takes the computer more than a moment and glancing down at your falling fuel gauge, drained mostly by the thrusters, you decide you can't afford to wait.  Easing the stick forward, you bring the craft into the can at a snail's pace.  Its a tight fit and you hear one wing drag on the port-side, wincing at the squeal of titanium on tin.  Finally all the way in you detract the landing gear, their pads no doubt squishing into whatever residue remained stuck to the walls of the can.  As you come to a rest the computer's silence attests to her having completed the translation algorythm.  \"Well,\" you ask impatiently, \"what does it say?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pork, beans,\" the computer replies without emotion, \"and humans.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost vomit right there on the console, 'could they be... cannibals...'  And what's more you actually considered eating what was left.  'If I hadn't thought to run the translation I might have...,' the thought conjures a new wave of nausea.  Swallowing the taste of bile you turn to your computer's patiently blinking green lights.   \"Please,\" you say, forgetting even to be rude to her, \"run a diagnostic on your linguistic circuits, you must be wrong.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA short humming, then, \"circuits check out, Michael, there is no error.\"  Your face darkens, of all the worlds you could have wound up on, you had to pick the one where you're on the menu.  With masculine spirit you pull yourself together, 'there's no use cryin' about it like a gir...'  A loud wheezing sound outside stops your thoughts,... the sound... of crying.

Her older, nearly teenage, brother can only shrug.  \"A little bug fell into the dip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nu-huh,\" her brother disagreed after having looked into the green mush and not seen so much as a speck in it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah-huh,\" Mala argues.  \"It fell in right there.\"  She points to the center of the dish.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA finger-tip the size of an architectural dome hovers over you where your tiny head pokes out of the guacamole.  It is so colossal and so close that the crests and trenches that form the finger print look to be furrows wide and deep enough to trap your body within them.  The sight is as paralyzing as an eclipse and the shadow cast on you by the giant child's digit also compares to one.  When it draws away you breath a sigh of relief and begin to unhook your parachute.  'Time to get out of here before I wind up on a chip.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbove<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See,\" the girl said withdrawing her finger as if that proved the point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer brother Jake's freckled face grinned as he grabbed for a chip.  \"There's nothing in there and I'm gonna prove it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yucky,\" the girl said recoiling on the other side of the picnic table.  \"Don't do it, I told you there's an itty-bitty bug in there.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJake just smiled, incited all the more by his sister's revulsion, as he brought the corn-chip toward the bowl.  He even made sure to aim it exactly where she'd pointed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelow<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe massive chip sinks deep into the the guacamole projecting you up for a moment upon a green gooey wave.  When you come to rest you see the chip standing tall and triangular out of the dip like the fin of some megalithic shark.  Then the sea of avocado below begins to rumble as the chip lifts you, along with a 100 tons of guacamole, out of the bowl.  When it spins, you barely recognize the boy's mouth for what it is because of its size, the lips themselves would stretch many city blocks and you could probably fit townhouses in the cracks between his teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn one last desperate attempt, you seek to signal the boy waving some of your white parachute in the air.  \"DON'T EAT ME!\" you scream, knowing it will do even less good at your size, but unable to resist the building panic.  The eyes far above register nothing, and below his mouth opens to a reveal a great dark vacuum that dominates your entire visage.  You realize suddenly and with increasing dread that at your size it would be very possible for you to survive any chewing due to your extreme tininess.  His mashing teeth might very well drive you body into one of the cracks between them unharmed or perhaps mortally injured and slowly bleeding to death.  The thought of living your days out between his molars in constant fear of groping tongue and probing tooth-picks terrifies you now even more than the idea of being chewed to a pulp.  The nightmare image drives out of your little lungs a truly wordless scream of helpless terror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

More like calcite cliffs, they stretch on for what seems like miles above and below.  Beyond, lays a pink tongue big enough to flatten a whole village beneath its wet mass.  Knowing this is your last chance to escape what could become your prison for all time or the gateway to your doom, you struggle wildly against the green goo pushing in around you.  No  use.  Though no doubt squishy to the giants, to you it has the consistency of wet cement.  You close your eyes waiting for the bite, half hoping his molars come down directly where you are ending this horrific adventure once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bite doesn't come, however, and neither does the absolute darkness which would have been precipitated by the closing of his jaws.  Instead the chip is moving in a jerky fashion threatening to hurl you straight out of the green muck.  Looking to the rear of the chip where the giant had been gripping it you still see a massive finger clamping down... but wait.  Farther up the finger's red-wood girth you see a pink plastic ring.  Your eyes pan even higher and you see extending up into the stratosphere a freckled arm and above that a red blouse flashing in the air like a fire storm.  The giantess's face is nearly impossible to see from your distance; all that's visible are stray locks of her curly hair flipping past the ridge-line of her blouse.  You infer from your erratic motion that she is running with you, but where to...?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura snatches the chip before Jake can bite down rescuing the poor, defenseless bug.  She then vaults off the picnic table and bolts ignoring both the shouts of Jake and the admonitions of her parents.  Running down a nearby trail until her pursuer is temporarily out of sight, she takes advantage of a nearby tree and dives behind it pushing her back up against the base of the trunk and waiting until the coast is clear.  She can hear Jake stop for a moment and imagines him looking around, angry that he's been robbed of his victim. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Laura!\" she hears him yell, \"if you don't give me my chip back Mom and Dad are gonna ground you.\"  Figuring this for a bluff but willing to accept such punishment in the defense of her insect charge, Laura remains hidden her breath hushed.  Within moments her brother, never gifted with an exceptional attention span, trots off bored with the chase and Laura turns her attention to the chip.  \"Come out little bug,\" she whispers to it, \"I won't hurt you.\"  Squinting at the guacamole but seeing nothing but green she decides to probe it a bit with her pinkie to see if she can uncover the tiny thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*************<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"STOP!!!\"  You scream at the descending finger but it is no use.  To you her voice is as inaudible as comets crashing and to her your's is no doubt ultrasonic as well as microscopic.  Drawing closer you see the pinky's tip complete with a nail the size of a hockey rink coming straight at you.  Without any other option you dive down into the guacamole, but it is to stiff for you to swim far into in the split seconds available.  When the young Goddess's finger touches down you are stuck upside down legs kicking awkwardy in the air as you attempt to swim down to safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are jarred by an earth-shaking impact which forces you up into some tight crevice.  When the green gunk around you falls away you see the world spiraling down centered around the chip and the giantess's small (on her scale) hand.  You try to squirm out of your prison but find yourself pressed flat along the horizontal plane.  Still not grasping your location your view turns up and is filled with the face of the giantess.  Especially after the experience of nearly being eaten the close up view of that titanic face and puffy lips growing closer throws you into an instant state of panic.  Swiveling in your prison, you turn around and squirm farther back into the tightening crevice.  Only when your body pushes into something dark and gritty do you realize where you are.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n***********<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Laura looks at her pinkie trying to see if the bug maybe stuck to it she sees the build up of dirt beneath her finger nail and makes a note to clean it when she gets home.  Not seeing the bug in the smear of green on her finger she confidently sticks her pinkie in her mouth and sucks it clean.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn about in your prison eager to escape the nail-grime and see the horror of her open mouth expanding to encase both you and her finger.  It goes dark and you can hear a loud sloshing outside as her tongue no doubt cleans the exterior of her finger of avocado.  For a moment you dare to think that you might be safe, but then a powerful sucking sound, the herald of your doom, fills the chasm around you and you feel yourself being helplessly drawn toward the outside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow desperate to dive into the dirt beneath her nail, you fight the siphoning force, scrambling back toward its refuge but it is to strong and draws you out from under its protection.  Arms reaching out at the last second, you manage to grab hold of something preserving your insignificant life, for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n**************<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLaura draws her finger out of her mouth, unaware of the tiny, tiny man who is now kicking and screaming helpless upon an unclipped hang-nail.  She takes a few minutes to scour the rest of the chip, but finds nothing.  Not ready to risk the possibility that her little bug might still be in there she places it gently upon the grass instead of eating it.  Then she looks about making sure she is all alone before...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You\u2019ve learnt the safety manual and protocols by heart. But none of those protocols has ever mentioned of BEING SUCKED INTO A WORMHOLE TO ANOTHER DIMENSION AND GET EATEN BY A FREAKING GIANT TEENAGER. \u201cPlease don\u2019t swallow please don\u2019t swallow please don\u2019t swallow PLEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSEEEEE!!!!\u201d \u2013 you desperate plead with yourself while trying your best not to let go of the big ugly pinkish hills that was the boy\u2019s taste buds. How humongous is this \u201cboy\u201d truly is anyway, if his taste buds are already at the size of freaking hills? Things are getting worse, as gravity begins to take over, and his slimy saliva starts to make your hands become slippy. But like people always say:\u201d What must be, must be.\u201d A great shadow soon looms over you, as the bolus of guacamole begins sliding toward you. \u201cF*ck!\u201d- you mutter as the ball of mushy avocado hits the tiny pathetic speck that is your body and drags you to the eternal abyss awaiting at the teenager\u2019s looming throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the trip in his oesophagus can be described in a sentence, it would be \u201cF*KING TIGHT!\u201d For nearly 3 minutes, you are stuck inside a mass of chewed soggy chips mixed with guacamole, continuously pushed downward by his powerful peristalsis. In spite of the minuscule size of your body, his powerful throat muscles are still able to squeeze you tightly between its fleshy walls along with the food. The pulses are so strong that it feels like being squeezed by a fleshy anaconda. Finally, your trip to hell end with a crash into his wrinkly cardiac sphincter (assume that this \u201cJake\u201d kid has the same anatomy with a normal human), which soon open and drops you into a gigantic cavern that is literally the manifestation of Hell (presumed that this Hell was made when God himself was on crack). You fall from a high of like hundred meters and land with a splash into its mushy content, probably his breakfast, followed by the meteor-sized guacamole boluses. The boy\u2019s stomach is at least the size of that cave in Vietnam where you can fit an entire building in (Son Doon Cave, very beautiful!). The place was relatively dark, but there is still enough light filtered through his belly, at least enough for you to see. The walls are reddish pink and extremely wrinkle, each folds stretch for dozens of meter along the soft walls. The sea of mushy and digesting food you are standing in is in a mixed colour of vomit green, red and booger yellow, which is horrible to look at. And it smells disgusting, just exactly like that smell when you first threw up in your helmet in a test. You waddle through the chewed food and quickly reside on a floating piece of the chip that is lucky enough to not be crushed by Jake\u2019s pearly molars. Then things begin to turn bad, as the teenage giant\u2019s stomach commences its mission: digesting his food, including you. Light green, transparent droplets of stomach acid are secreted from the walls and rain down to the hot mess below. A few drops hit your body and (very) slowly burn through your protection suit, creating a stinging feeling throughout your skin. Then the tummy walls start to shake as the boy\u2019s belly churns his picnic lunch. With every ripple it makes, large waves of chewed food begin to forms, threatening to knock you off from your safe haven on the island of the chip. It is incredibly noisy, most of which are the gurgling sound of the churning belly and the sizzling noise of stomach juice digesting guacamole. It\u2019s just like those doomsday movie in here, where every disaster takes turn appearing one by one then combine into a bigger catastrophe. \u201cThis place is truly hell itself!\u201d \u2013 you scream, struggling to balance yourself on the chip while avoiding more piece of chewed-up food fall from the top sphincter. Damn this boy eats a lot! After a while, the food rain stop. But before you can even get a rest, the cursed hole on top of his hell belly opens again, and a stream of orange water pours in, creating even more waves and raising the \u201csea\u201d level to the middle of Jake\u2019s stomach, and makes it look even more disgusting. \u201cWhat the hell is that? Why is it bubbling so violently?\u201d said you as you take a look into his stomach content, clearly showing some kind of reaction after the downpour of liquid, shown through the increasing volume of its sizzling noise. One drop of liquid splashes to your face and gets into your mouth. The sweet, sour, tangy taste strike a chord in your mind. Then the realisation hit you. \u201cThis\u2026 is\u2026 orange soda! Which means\u2026\u2026\u2026..! Oh, God!!!!!\u201d Not before you can finish your sentence, the boy\u2019s meal is sizzling more and more violently. The air starts to feel weird, and somewhat windy. In a split of a second, nearly all the air in Jake\u2019s tummy rushes out through the cardiac sphincter, creating an explosion of \u201cUUUUURRRRRPPPPPHHHH\u201d sound as the teen lets out a massive belch, relishing the gas stuck inside his full tummy. The belch is so violent that it shakes the whole stomach, creating a tsunami of vomit that knocks you from the chip into the disgustingly warm and smelly digesting food, while nearly deafening you at the same time. You struggle to swim back to the surface of the food ocean, only to find out that your safe place has been reduced to a tiny piece of chip that you can barely sit on. \u201cAt least I still have a f*king place to sit!\u201d - you whine. Some of the food has got into your suit, which makes it very uncomfortable, as the acid also got in. Your whole body was in stinging pain, and you know that the suit can\u2019t protect you forever. Eventually, you will have to succumb to the stomach and die a painful death inside this hellhole, and you don\u2019t sign up to become an astronaut to suffer such horrible fate. You must escape this place as soon as possible! But how? Currently, there are only two possible ways to get out, with the exception of waiting for hours and hours to die a horrible death. You can either climb the great wall of Jake\u2019s stomach using the wrinkle as foothold, which means that you have to climb onto an pulsing, acid-spewing cliff whose height is over a hundred meters compare to your size, then fight your way through the incredibly powerful peristalsis of the teen boy\u2019s kilometre-long oesophagus. Or you can just put on your helmet and dive to the bottom of his stomach, where another sphincter leading to the next part of his digestive system awaits. But this trip is, well, basically the worst torture, both in physical and mental term, for any living creatures in the universe, and everyone with a basic understanding of anatomy will obviously know why. <br>\r\nSo which route will you choose?<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

That is like, the worst way to die no matter which galaxy you are in. Also, your helmet isn\u2019t in a very good condition.

HOW MAY TIME MUST I FALL BEFORE YOU LET ME OUTTA HERE!!! IS 50 GODDAMN TIMES NOT ENOUGH!!! FUCK YOU BOY AND YOUR GODDAMN HELLHOLE OF A STOMACH!!!! ROCKY MOUNTAIN MY ASS!!!!\u201d - you angrily yell while trying to stay afloat on the mushy surface. That was the 50th attempt to climb out of here. Every goddamn time when you could really, really, REALLY see the  cardiac sphincter in your reach, Jake\u2019s stomach would randomly do something that would make you fall, like it really wanted to say \u201dFUCK YOU!\u201d. At the very first time, it was easy for very much the first half of the climbing. But then Jake decided that it was the best time to let out a burp. It shook the whole cavern and you dropped like a rock to the swamp of half-digested food. You said to yourself \u201cCome on! It\u2019s not too bad! Try again! It would be alright!\u201d But wait, there\u2019s more! After that, it was either its weird random shakes or the teenager\u2019s sudden movement, like his annoying walking, or his sudden need to jump, or even more freaking burps. As if this place really, truly want you to stuck here forever and ever and ever. Well, not forever, as sooner or late it would melt you into a fucking puddle if you keep staying in this fucking hellhole. \u201cCome on kid! Let me get the hell out of here! Why do you even want to eat me? I am a fricking tiny human!!! YOU CAN\u201dT EVEN GET ANY PIECE OF NUTRIENT FROM ME!!!!!!!\u201d - you continued to yell, while at the same time unleashing your anger to the poor tummy in the form of insignificant punches and every possible insult that would make a digestive organ feels shame. It does absolutely nothing to the stomach, as you are no bigger than a pin\u2019s head compare to him, but at least it make you feel a little bit better. And only at that time when you begin to notice a faint, blinking red light on your right wrist, along with a muffled voice. It was partially covered with digested guacamole. You wipe it with your other hand, then shake all of the mushy stuff out. \u201cWarning. Suit\u2019s integrity is at 5%. Request nearest aid immediately!\u201d - said the cold, mechanical voice repeatedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShit!\u201d - mutter you. The suit was design to be able to shield its wearer from danger for a limited time, in case there were accidents, such as a ship crash. But you weren\u2019t notice that. You are too focus on your climbing to realise that the suit was getting weaker and weaker with every falls you made, and even ignore its warnings. And if your memory serves you right, it is said that the impact from falling into water from a height of 20 meters or above could result in severe injuries, and even death. If it wasn\u2019t for your suit, you probably wouldn\u2019t even have survived your first fall. The suit is now severely damaged, as an effect of the impact from the falls, as well as the corrosive acid of the boy\u2019s full belly. It won\u2019t survive a trip into the deep innards of the boy. In addition, the helmet is also damaged, leaving your head unprotected, as well as creating a large opening for acid to spill into your suit and boil you alive. It is too late to change your decision. This climb will be your last, and your only way to get out of here safe and sound. You either succeed and survive, or fail again and die as painfully as possible. \u201cOne last time! You can do it Mike! You can do it! You MUST succeed!\u201d-you encourage yourself for one more time, then begin your climb of fate. Never before has you had so much motivation in your life. You quickly advance, making every grab and step with maximum precision. The wall begin to shake again, as if it knew this is the key to your destiny! But they won\u2019t deter you. With every motion it makes, your grips become firmer and firmer. You will not give up! You still have a promising career ahead! \u201cI will not fail!\u201d - you said while increasing your speed at the same time. Soon, you were able to reach the height of about \u00be the height of Jake\u2019s stomach. Looking from your position, the stomach looks even grosser than before. Its walls are in a darker tone, like the colour of a recently killed animal\u2019s flesh. Countless and countless wrinkle cover the reddish surface, making the already hellish appearance even creepier. Acid pours from those wrinkles, creating small puff of smoke as it mercilessly dissolves the boy\u2019s last meal. The belly has nearly finished its duty. The piece of chip that was once your safety haven is now nothing more than a part of the weirdly-coloured muddy contents, bubbling and churning violently, as well as any other thing that the adolescent devoured into his cave of a maw. Hell has always exist inside our own body, and no one has ever known. The same fate will happen to you, if you fail. And you will burn to death inside this boy\u2019s body, unknown to anyone of this world or your world. Those thought of death clouded your mind, making you slip a little bit, and nearly fall to the chaotic cauldron of acid below. \u201cDammit! This is not the time for such thoughts!\u201d \u2013 you clear your mind, and resume your journey. A few centimetres more, and you will be safe! You will escape from this hell for good! The cardiac sphincter is nearer than ever before. \u201c5 steps! 4 steps! 3 steps! 2 more! Finally!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut life don\u2019t work that way. It wouldn\u2019t just give you what you want just because you are so close to your goals. Life is a bitch! Just as your tiny hands reach the wrinkly opening, everything abruptly tremble violently like a tremendous earthquake. Tsunamis of digested food rise, crashing into the already trembling walls. Outside, Jake has already finished his picnic, and returned to his home along with his sister Mala, which was the reason why you failed much of your previous climbs. The so-called earthquake was caused by his running to his room using the stair. Who would have known such harmless action from a fifteen-year-old boy would cause such chaos. Deep inside his belly, it was like the apocalypse. Your struggle to keep your grips, hoping that the tremor will be over soon. Your pray to every god you known. All you need right now is that the chaos would stop, and you will escape to safety, to return to humanity again. But like that purple guy in that movie from 2018 said: dread it, run from it, destiny still arrives. What must be, must be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou fall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n(P/s: Aaahhhh!

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Meanwhile, in the outside world, Jake is happily running to his room. Today has been a good day. For some reason, Mala\u2019s friend Jenny decided to ask them to a picnic along with some of her friends. They came late, and made Mala a little bit upset, but they still had an enjoyable picnic. He even ate a bug just to mess with Mala. The guacamole was marvellous, and he emptied nearly half of the bowl, which made his stomach bulge out a little bit and gurgle in enjoyment. They play some games, then got home, where he received a letter from his old friend Thomas studying abroad. It\u2019s been a long time since he last wrote to Jake, and he is excited to read his writing. The young teen rushes in his room, sits on his chair and read the letter carefully. Tom is going to return for a while, as it is currently a semester break in his school. Jake\u2019s mind is filled with joy. After Tom returns, they, along with his best friend Luke will spend some quality time on his recently bought console. But soon, the meal inside his full, bulging belly starts to take effect and makes him feel sleepy. He has spent his entire morning playing and eating at the park, so it would be a good idea to take a nap right now and restore his energy for the party at Luke\u2019s house tonight. The young boy carefully puts away the letter into the drawer under his desk and quickly takes off his clothes, leaving nothing but his boxer on. It is a hot day, so he turns on the ceiling fan, then quickly jumps on his bed and dozes off. However, not everyone can have the luxurious pleasure to sleep peacefully at that moment. Unbeknown to him, while he is immersed inside his delightful dreams, inside his gurgling stomach, a poor, unfortunate and pathetically minuscule life is about to end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeep inside the 15-year-old\u2019s innards, an insignificantly teeny, tiny \u201cplop\u201d could be hear as a diminutive body plummeted into the stomach\u2019s chaotic cauldron of acid from the height of approximately 12cm. It was the fall of a young pilot full of potential who has just had all of his hope shattered along with some of his body. Coincidentally, that poor man also happens to be you. The quaking of the stomach\u2019s fleshy wall quickly made your grips loosen, and in just mere seconds, you fell. Your microscopic body crashes into the digested chips and avocado dip, just like those fallen angels when God decided to just toss them into hell from the ridiculous height of the heaven. Well, you are already inside a mini and organic version of hell. As the stomach becomes stable again, you struggle to make yourself afloat, while excruciating pains begin to take over every part of your body. There are nothing for you to hold onto. Your suit and helmet are terribly cracked. You are lucky that they managed to protect you before getting destroyed from the impact. However, it wasn\u2019t able to protect every part of you. You can feel that your left leg is broken, and can barely feel anything but numbness on your right hand. \u201cSuit\u2019s integrity: 0%. Suit will now deactivateeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee\u2026..\u201d the suit\u2019s mechanical AI, its voice sound twisted and broken, before shutting down for good. Soon, pieces and pieces of the protection suit falls out. Your last defence is gone. And in just a few seconds, the stomach acid comes into effect, as it slowly melts your inner suit, and got into your skin. The pain is agonizing, as if you has just been burned by the lava of hell itself. More acid pours down from the wall. Some got into your hair, and soon melt away your messy black hair. Red blisters of acid burns soon cover your tiny body, burning away every last piece of your skin. One of your hand is now completely skinless, exposing the bloody flesh, which is quickly burnt by the acid. The pain is too much, it nearly drives you to insanity. You try to scream. You want to scream. But acid doesn\u2019t allowed that, as a stream of acid spills into your mouth and nose, rendering you pretty much mute. No one\u2019s gonna hear it any way. They don\u2019t bother to the scream that is barely louder than the chirp of a tardigrade, assuming that tardigrades can even chirp. The scalding stomach juice makes its way into your organ, searing your stomach and burning your lungs. Regret and fear rapidly fill your damaged brain. Had you not been so blinded by your own pride and ego, and dived down into his gut, you would have probably survived. One foolish decision to recklessly climb a wall that you could have never finish, and now you are lying here, seeing your life getting utterly wasted, seeing your own body corroded by the acid of a boy\u2019s stomach, seeing all of your hope, all of your future shattered. You can barely see or hear anything, beside the steady beats of the boy\u2019s heart, his hollow breathing and the stomach\u2019s disgusting gurgles. Suddenly, dimensions shifts, and everything start to be plunged into chaos for a few moment. The boy must have laid down, and judging from his unclear but noticeably slower breathing pattern, he has fallen asleep. Ironically, the shifting of the boy\u2019s stomach bring the patches of mushy swamp of rotten avocado carrying you right next to the cardiac sphincter. You hopelessly attempts to reach for it with your safe hand, only to realise that you can\u2019t even move your shoulder. You are now nothing more than a badly burnt piece of bloody, mangled flesh. Had you waited just a few more minutes, you could have escaped. But you choose to be foolish, and brought doom over yourself. All of your senses are now dead. But you can still feel the corrosive pain eroding inside your body, eating away your bones, muscles and organs. So you lie there, enjoying every seconds of being alive for one last time, before the acid melts away every single part of your body and organs, and light start to become darkness in your blinding eyes. In a minutes, nothing left but cracked skeletons remain mixed in the digested food, as your life meaninglessly fades away inside this godly being\u2019s stomach, unknown to anyone, unknown to anything. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>A few hours later, the pyloric sphincter at the end of the stomach opens, and everything begins to be flushed into Jake\u2019s duodenum. The young teen is still sleeping peacefully, without the slightest care to the fate of that bug he pitilessly devoured back in the picnic. Bile and pancreatic juice are secreted from the hepatopancreatic sphincter in his duodenum, neutralizing the stomach acid, but also further breaking his meal down at the same time. Soon, you and the rest of his meal arrive at his small intestine, where millions and millions of villi reside. They are like hungry leeches mindlessly swinging inside the murky food, consuming every piece of nutrient that happens to come across them. Some of you are consumed, along with all the nutrient and vitamins into his blood, rushing to the thin fleshy curtain of the teenager\u2019s beating heart. From there, you are distributed into his body, and become a part of Jake. Some of you end up in his belly fat, to protect him from the cold, and become his energy when needed. Some get fused into his growing bone to make him taller, and stronger. Some get the honour to become the fuel for his young, developing brain. In addition, a tiny part of your DNA are broken down, and merge with his gene inside his growing testicles to further enrich his genetic and become a part of his endless army of sperms (some of which would probably be wasted on a piece of paper tissue as the boy experiences his wet dreams, or just his masturbation sessions, and into the trash bin beside his bed). However, not everything is accepted by his body, as a part of your dissolved body got filtered inside his kidneys, and dumped into his bladder, waiting for his next discharge in the toilet. You are now one with this by Jake. One with this giant. One with this <b>GOD</b>. At least your death was somewhat meaningful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHours passed by, and it\u2019s already midnight. The party at Luke\u2019s house has long ended. Jake had had the time of his life. He won the dancing contest at the party, and even got kissed by his crush. Inside our party boy\u2019s body, the stomach is now working at its full capacity again digesting its master\u2019s party. It bulges out even further than in the morning and gurgles in delight as Jake gives it some gentle rubs. Far behind the closed sphincter of the stomach, beyond his coiled maze of small intestine, the morning picnic has gone into his large intestine \u2013 the very end of your journey. What is left of such meal are now only unused slime that was once a delicious salad, are drained of every water left by the ribbed, mucous wall of the colon. The further they go, the drier they are, and the smellier they become, as the community of bacteria inside the 15-year-old\u2019s gut fermenting them into poop. Logs of faecal matters start to take form, and they reach the boy\u2019s rectum after a while. Outside, Jake is taking a late shower. Suddenly, he feels a slight pressure in his bottom. It is time for him to release his digested meal, and empty his butt. He lazily sits on the porcelain throne that is his toilet, and let his anal muscles, as well as his abdominal muscles to do its job. His rectum contracts and loosen rhythmically, forming waves of peristalsis to push out the poop to his pinkish anus, which open to release the logs into the cold, disgusting toilet water. After a while, Jake relaxes as he push out the last logs of shit, where a tiny piece of your half-digested skull got stuck into. He thoroughly wipes his young butthole with papers, throws them into the toilet. Then he gently holds his penis, carefully pulls his sensitive foreskin back showing his reddish penis head and takes a piss, dumping every last of your unnecessary essence into the bowl. He closes the lid, washes his hands with soap, then flushes the toilet clean, sending your remains into the oblivion inside the sewage. Jake wears his pyjama and goes to his bed, preparing for a long sleep after such party. It was the best night of his life, and he feels like he need to treat himself with something. \u201cA quick masturbation, perhaps?\u201d he young teen thought, but soon feel that he is too tired. \u201cNah! Maybe tomorrow!\u201d And soon our young Jake sleeps with a smile on his lips, and immerses himself in his world of delightful dreams again. The young boy had never realised the atrocity he had done to that poor bug, to the poor man that had unfortunately ended up inside his raging belly.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Please proceed with caution. Thank you!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere will always some moments in life when people thought that they were having the worst time of their life. For your mom, it was when she accidentally lost the necklace that her mother left for her. For your dad, it was when he was fired from the space exploring squad (of the same department that you are now working at) by his own comrades after 24 years in service. For your uncle Joe, it was the day he married your Aunty Betsy and left his hillbilly monster truck racing career behind. For you, it was when you were 15 and were forced to give away your teddy bear Mr. Cuddly McCuddlington (may his soul rest in peace in teddy bear\u2019s heaven) to Joe Jr. \u2013 your dumbass cousin, only for it to end up melted in his pet boar\u2019s stomach (yes, uncle Joe gave his son a wild boar for his 5th birthday). But it was a matter of the past. Now, that moment is when you were FUCKING EATEN by a bigass teenager from another galaxy, which is exactly right now (what a coincident)! But unlike those pessimistic idiots on the internet, you don\u2019t give up. You will not suffer the same fate as Mr Cuddly McCuddlington. If you die, you will die like a brave man! Knowing that climbing his stomach would result in certain death, you divert your course to the lower sphincter. But there was a problem. There was hardly any food left inside your suit\u2019s emergency backpack, which has magically survived the descent from the oesophagus. And suppose that you have to eat the boy\u2019s stomach matter (which are now hardly food anymore), the small space of the backpack wouldn\u2019t hold enough food for your journey in the small intestine. The thing is 5 metres in length, and judging by your size currently, that would be approximately 3 kilometres. Unless you are going nonstop without any breaks or rests, which would kill you from exhaustion, it would take about 2 hours or more to get through the organ. Saddened by the harsh reality, you look into the disgusting ceiling of the boy\u2019s stomach and scream at the top of your lungs, venting all your anger into the staled and smelly air. The organ responds with a loud gurgle, as if it was laughing at your useless efforts. And you can swear that that dump Jake kid is also making fun of you, as the boy\u2019s non-stop laugh shook his belly, making the already noisy stomach even more irritating.  But then, something happens. There is a weird sound, as if a flood is rushing above. In mere seconds, the oesophagus sphincter opens, and comes as a fuckton of water, as well our first deus ex machina!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the outside world, Jake and his sister Mala are still having fun together. Mala\u2019s friends, who she invited to have the picnic with, haven\u2019t come yet, and it's beginning to upset Mala. To lighten the mood, Jake, as the nice brother that he is, begins to tell jokes he heard from his grandad and some old TV shows of his. At first, Mala wasn\u2019t amused, but then she began to smile, and soon both of them have a fit of laughter together. Jake smiles as he prepares his next jokes. But suddenly, the teenager feels an odd annoyance in his mouth, specifically on his tongue and his throat. This brand of grape soda was much sweeter than those he usually drinks, and the high sugar content is starting to mess with his delicate taste buds and also his throat. So he asks his little sis for her cup of water, and takes a few gulps to soothe the feeling, before thinking for a few quizzes to challenge his sister. He can feel the cool water travelling down his throat, eliminating any bit of annoying sugary taste left inside his gullet and dumps it into his full stretching belly. Never had he realise that he has also swallowed a teeny, tiny piece of \u201cdirt\u201d that would later save the tiny stuck inside his vast chaotic tummy. He had a little sister to please today.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the teenager\u2019s belly, columns of water fall from the sky, as the water rushes in, violent like a monsoon flood. The massive flood continue to mess up the stomach, diluting its acid and thinning the marsh of rotting guacamole, turning it into exactly what a marsh becomes when a flood strikes (I honestly don\u2019t know what the word for that is, so imagine something like the Everglades with more water, fewer gators and more rotting avocado soaked in acid). But amidst the chaos, you manage to notice an unusual but oddly familiar object floating above the dirty vomit water. It was a long, reddish piece of something. \u201cOh my fucking teddy it\u2019s my fucking parachute!\u201d you snap, realising the ugly \u201cspaceship-and-stars\u201d logo of the Agency (seriously, it\u2019s 2100 already and people still used those century-old logos). And never in your life had you been so excited about a piece of fabric, well if not counting the time when you buy a new shirt for Mr Cuddle. You jump into the creepy warm water and swim like a hungry orca toward a big fat seal. \u201cThank you Mr Cuddle for your blessings from the heaven!!!\u201d you squeak in joy like a kid receiving his Christmas present. But another problem prevails. The parachute is too big for you to carry. Using it would turn you into basically Santa without his sled and any of his reindeers, and you are too damn sure that Santa\u2019s fatass would have died if he had to carry such pouch on his pack and walking across the globe, which would also be the same fate for you assuming that you do the same, but in a child\u2019s small intestine. And as if Teddy Jesus knows your suffering, he sends in another deus ex machina (yay?), this time in the form of a small fragment of your ship pinning on the fabric for some stupid reason. It isn\u2019t as sharp as Gordon Ramsay XVI\u2018s knife, but still enough for you to tear the big piece of fabric into smaller pieces, as well as some pieces of rope. Then you swim back to your mushy mushy island and rip it apart, until you have 16 nylon pouches of staled corn chips, 10 in your backpack and 6 on your belt, as well as another 8 pouches of vomit water (with grape and avocado, as well as stomach juice flavour). And as if you aren\u2019t lucky enough already, the pyloric sphincter decides that it was the best time to let the water into its next destination and slightly open just enough for the water to flow in, creating a miniature maelstrom at the end of the stomach. \u201cMaybe this thing doesn\u2019t really hate me at all!\u201d you exclaim. You take a final look of the stomach, its wrinkly acid-spilling walls and the noise made from its gurgle, Jake\u2019s heartbeats and his hollow breathing, before diving into the murky water, ready to travel into a new world. \u201cWhat could possibly go wrong?\u201d you said. And soon, the tiny man was sucked into the abyssal depth of the boy\u2019s innards along with the water, leaving only the rotting food behind. The sight soon changes, and your mere mortal eyes are welcome by an even more otherworldly scene. Welcome to the small intestine!<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Entering the small intestine isn\u2019t fun like you\u2019d thought. In your mind, it supposed to feel like a typical slide that you would usually play at the waterpark when you were young. Well, it does feel like a water slide, if the slide happens to be made of human flesh, with the water being replaced by a viscous mixture of water, grape soda and a few pieces of rotting guacamole. The good thing is the violent current of liquid gave you a free trip into about 1/10 of the small intestine right at the end of the duodenum, greatly reducing the time you need to walk and create more opportunities to escape. Also, the water has turned from what originally a violent river of billowing waves into more of a shallow stream as the content is now scattered throughout the organ, so you won\u2019t have to worry about swimming The bad news is you have to walk inside whatever the fuck kind of terrain this place is. For some reason, for a place, this deep inside the boy\u2019s abdomen cavity, the small intestine, or at least the section you are in, are still oddly lit, albeit a little darker than the stomach (well, fiction story gotta fiction). But it\u2019s the lighting that gives you a clear view of the unfathomable weirdness of the place you are in. While the stomach still gave a little bit feeling of, ummmmm, normalcy, like a big fleshy cave that randomly spits corrosive HCl on you, the small intestine is undeniably a creation from some alien movies from a century ago, where special effects are still horrible to look at. It looks like some weird grotesque garden made by an unholy demon lord or something. The ceiling is much lower than the stomach, only about 10 times higher than you. And everywhere, like seriously 99% of this flesh tunnel is covered by those weird wiggling tentacle thingy. \u201cVilli!\u201d you exclaim, remembering that name from an old lesson in 8th grade. They resemble a gigantic savannah that stretches through the near-infinite length of the boy\u2019s gut. Each of them is nearly as big as you. And as if a savannah of fleshy tentacles isn\u2019t creepy enough, wherever the stomach\u2019s content which had just rushed in touch, the villi stretch out and wiggle even more violent, like being possessed by a swarm of very, very hungry ghosts. They search for any pieces of food that are absorbable, and when they found one, the smaller, but much harder to see villi on top of them (they have smaller villi on top of villi, like wtf) grabbed it and swallow that piece into oblivion. At least villi don\u2019t spill any weird liquid on you. Well, they don\u2019t, but the intestine does. 30 seconds after your entry, from under the shallow river of digesting food, a brown liquid spills out like a geyser. Unfortunately, you are in its range, and in seconds, you are covered with the liquid from head to toe. \u201cEwww! What the hell is this?\u201d you whine. Clearly, and luckily, it wasn\u2019t acid, but rather its sibling juices \u2013 bile and pancreatic juice. These things are made to digest some part of Jake\u2019s meal, such as fat, protein etc., as well as neutralizing the acid that got inside along with food. They aren\u2019t exactly worse than the acid, as they don\u2019t kill you. But they give you a horrible smell, as well as an equally horrible taste in your mouth. After spending a few minutes washing away the juice on your body, you begin your journey. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking through a field of villi is much harder than you thought either. It\u2019s not exactly easy to walk through a forest of human-sized flesh sausage, all of which want to eat you. 45 minutes, and you had just only covered like another 1/10 of the way. You walk for a minute, then stop for another minute to get the villi away from you. It\u2019s like a trap specifically made so that tinies who miraculously escape the stomach like you won\u2019t be able to escape. And as tough as you are, being stuck onto a bunch of villi isn\u2019t very comfortable, and it soon wears you down. You tried to find a place to rest, but there aren\u2019t any empty space that isn\u2019t packed with villi. So you decide to walk and eat at the same time, to save time. Bad idea! As soon as you open your food pocket, those sticky sausages poke in, rob away your food like the most annoying flock of seagulls at a busy beach. 3 pockets of stale corn chips and 2 pockets of water were opened, but only half of them end up inside your hungry belly. The other half are now on their way to Jake\u2019s bloodstream, waiting to be distributed throughout his body in the heart. At least your hunger problem is partially solved. Speaking of heart, it is oddly quiet in here. The noise you heard in the stomach is almost non-existent. You can hardly hear the drumming heartbeats that shook your brain, nor the rumbling growls of the stomach. Jake\u2019s voice is merely muffled noise at this point. \u201cSo far so good!\u201d you said. The silence of the small intestine is creepy, yes. But setting the annoying villi aside, then this place isn\u2019t half as bad as it appears to be. Villi can\u2019t kill you or melt you into a pile of goo. The best thing they can do is suck up one or two of your fingers. And the boy seems to be hygienic enough to not have any worms or parasites inside his gut. Those things must be the size of a serpent compare to you, and that would be horrible for both you and him. You would get eaten, and he would got all of his nutrition sucked out and become what essentially a creepy zombie. Everything seems so peaceful. Then suddenly, your world shifted. Tremors after tremors hit you and knock you from the ground. The liquid inside his intestine shakes like a stormy sea, with waves smashing into the wall. Everything was chaotic. \u201cWHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON!\u201d you scream, hugging the nearest villi as if it was your anchor to life. Outside, Jake has returned to his home, and are running on the stair to his room. He just got a letter from his best friend, stating that he will soon come back from his trip abroad. The boy can hardly control his excitement. It\u2019s been a while since Tome left, and both of them will have a great time after his return. But that is a matter of the future. Right now, Jake needs to conserve his energy for the party at his friend Max\u2019s house tonight. The trip to the park is fun, and his tummy is filled with delicious guacamole. But it also exhausted him a bit. Taking off his clothes, leaving only his boxer, the young teen turns on the fan and jumps on his bed. Minutes later, he\u2019s already deep inside his sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the boy\u2019s belly, as the boy\u2019s movement makes one final shift to the scenery, the chaos has settled down. The whole area you were in is rotated in a 90-degree angle. The boy must have laid down to something\u201d you thought, still squeezing the poor villus between your arms, afraid of another earthquake (or in this case, gutquake). Soon, everything returns to its daily routine again. Food continues to be digested, villi continue to grab food, and you can finally stop hugging the villus next to you and continued your journey. 2 packets of supplement are lost in the chaos, but it wouldn\u2019t be much of a trouble, as you have covered much farther than you have originally expected, thanks to the current. \u201cWell, so far so good, again! Now let get this shit over with!\u201d you encourage yourself, as you adventure deeper and deeper into the coils of the sleeping teenager\u2019s gut.  <br>\r\n.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n~ 3 hours later ~<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\n.<br>\r\nAfter 3 hours of non-stop walking through the devil\u2019s garden of villi and bile, finally, you have reached the final part of the boy\u2019s digestive system. Now, lies ahead of you aren\u2019t the forest of villi anymore, but a massive sphincter slightly agape \u2013 the final gate of the small intestine, and the entrance to the boy\u2019s colon, also known as the shit hell. \u201cFinally!\u201d you happily exclaim. As if it can sense your happiness, the whole place shifts again. \u201cDamn! He is waking up! I better hurry!\u201d you said as you lunge toward the sphincter, trying to squeeze through it. The sooner you get through it, the sooner can you escape.  After a series of struggle, you finally got through the sphincter and tumbles into the boy\u2019s large intestine. Outside, Jake groggily turns off his alarm, but soon get excited after realising it\u2019s time for the party. He quickly got up and changes his clothes. \u201cI will shower later! I must get there soon!\u201d said the boy as he rushes into the bathroom and carefully gelled his hair and uses some of his dad\u2019s fancy cologne. When all things that need to be done have been done, Jake walks to his garage and ride his bike to Max\u2019s house, after having said goodbye to his sister. His parents are going on a business trip, so he can play \u2018til midnight without any restriction. Never did he realise that deep inside his lower belly, another hitchhiker are coming with him, and will soon come out of his butt like a weird offspring of some lunatic aliens. </span></div></div>",

But nothing a little writing magic can\u2019t fix!)<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMax\u2019s house is quite near to his house, so after 5 minutes or cycling, Jake arrives at Max\u2019s house, which is currently filled with partying teenagers. He is soon greeted by the twin, Max and Luke, who he can\u2019t really tell apart who was older (so do I, Jake, so do I). All he knew is that Max is the more hyperactive one, which kinda useless considering that both of them are equally hyperactive. \u201cJake! Welcome to the party! Man, you look rad! Get some drinks and be ready. The dance competition will start soon!\u201d Luke (or is it Max?) says. \u201cWait, you have a dance competition? But you didn\u2019t men-\u201d Jake asks in surprise, but soon finds himself ignored by the hyperactive party hosts as they greet other girls from another class, and disappear into the house like lightning. Jake shrugs his shoulder, impressed by the twin\u2019s enthusiasm, and joins the party inside.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack to the inside of his tummy, you have made it to the large intestine. And unlike the giant host that are trapping you, you are greeted with a foul smell of eternal disgust. To further illustrate its horribleness, imagine a toilet that hasn\u2019t been cleaned for a month, and a kid puked in it, then also pooped in it. Now multiply that smell ten folds. That how horrible the large intestine smells. \u201cHOLY FUCK THIS PLACE IS DISGUSTING!\u201d you mutter, covering your nose with a piece of fabric that you use to keep food in. If only the helmet, which you have left behind, hasn\u2019t been broken, this trip would\u2019ve been much easier. But well, that is life. You never expect what hardship will come next (this one is totally predictable tho). Once again, the scenery changes into a more spacious area. Obviously, it is bigger than the small intestine. Instead of villi, thing membranes or ribs projects out of the pale pink walls, forming rings after rings. That would be very helpful, considering that you are in the vertical section of the colon. In the middle of the floor you are standing on is a small hole. Jake\u2019s appendix, probably. Not wanting to cause any trouble to the vulnerable organ, you avoid it and begin to climb the wall. But things don\u2019t go that easy. In place of the villi, covering every centimetre of the colon is a strange mucus, made of unused and indigestible food (like you) that will soon become shit (including you) and be disposed through his anus. \u201cThis will take a while!\u201d you said, as you continue your struggle to climb up the smelly wall. After half an hour of vigorous climbing, you finally reach the part of the colon stretching across his belly, right above his belly button. And this is where the true challenge begins. \u201cHoly mother of fuck! Look at the size of that shit!\u201d you cry. Ahead of you literally lies a piece of shit, at the size of a hill. Obviously, its size cause quite a trouble to the organ, as every attempt of the peristalsis, which was strangely weaker than those of the stomach and small intestine, only move it a little bit. \u201cWhat the hell did he eat?\u201d you wonder, beginning to have doubts about the boy\u2019s seemingly fit body (which you got a glimpse of just before you got eaten). You sit down and wait, watching the colon struggle to move the log of faeces away. 10 minutes. 15 minutes. Nothing truly significant happens. In all of that time, the log of poop manages to move 2 cm further than before. Yay! You are hungry again, but the sight of this shit tunnel isn\u2019t very helpful for your appetite, and you would have a very high chance to accidentally ingest his faecal matters. That is something no one would risk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut still, life doesn\u2019t work that way. All of sudden, Jake moves again, this time more abrupt and faster than before. Once again, everything inside his body is juggled and you aren\u2019t very lucky. The movement nearly sends you back to the lower colon, but you manage to get hold of the wall\u2019s ribs. You can now hear the jiggling noise of the stomach right next to you, like a water bubble shaking in a cyclone. He must have drunk a lot. Then suddenly, Jake\u2019s whole body jolts to the left, and you are shot headfirst into the giant log of poops in front of you. The faeces are still in its \u201cyoung and squishy\u201d form, and it gets into every open orifice on your face. Your eyes are burning, as they are rubbed in poop, and you get a mouthful of poop, too. \u201cThings I do for this fucking life!\u201d you thought with anger, then, with all of your might, you swing your arms and try to dig through the log of poop. It took you a while before you manage to reach the other side. And as soon as you got out of the poop, you barf, spit out every piece of disgusting faeces inside your mouth. And as if that isn\u2019t enough, you vomit everywhere violently. Whatever the hell the boy is doing right now, it must have been some good shit for him to react like this. Maybe he is dancing (yes, yes he is)? Anyway, after spending another minute vomiting and swearing, you cool down a bit and start your escape again. More poops appear ahead. Some pieces fall from the ceiling and hit your body like some kind of apocalyptic avalanche of doom. Some are just logs of mostly immobile shit waiting you block you from your freedom. You continued to dig your way through the boulder of poop. \u201cGood thing that I still have this suit,\u201d you mumble. Occasionally, Jake would shake his body again, just for your face to hit the shit, again. After a while, he stops (finally) and seemingly takes a rest or something, as proven by the sound of chewed-up food pouring into his growling stomach. You can hear his heartbeats again, pounding rapidly along with his strong, hollow breaths to supply the boy\u2019s growing muscle after his whatever-performance. Gas is now visible inside his colon. Green, smelly and potentially toxic clouds of fart hovering above your head, waiting to be released. 20 minutes of swimming through craps, and you finally reach his rectum, with the anus ahead. Unlike any other sphincter that you have encountered before, the anus is specifically stronger. Judging by the amount of shit and fart being held captive with you inside his rectum, you can understand why. None of your pushes or kicks works. You try to open it with your hands holding its edge, and it still won\u2019t move. Rather, Jake just feels a tiny bit of annoyance and just casually uses his finger to poke his asshole through his jeans, knocking you off into the pile of shit. Not knowing anything better to do, you sit down and wait for the sweet release. You can gracefully die inside a toilet, but you won\u2019t accept dying inside some unknown giant brat\u2019s butthole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen what must be, must be. All party must come to an end, and soon Jake is at his house again, exhausted. The boy lazily takes a shower. Then he feels a weird vibration in his lower stomach. He has been holding it since the party. So he walks to the porcelain throne of a toilet, sits down and let his muscle do their jobs.<br>\r\nAbove the anus, now covered in shit, you cry out in joy as you see the movement of the anus and light fill in the poop cavity. Logs after logs begin to move toward the exit, one by one drops down to the water below like bombs. All of his gas rush outside, creating explosive farts that deafen you with the noise. As the final turd got pushed outside, you can take a peek of the outside world again. Hundred of metre bellows lies the cold water of the toilet, your fastest escape route. Now is your chance! Finally, your freedom is here! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWill you risk jumping into the water? Or should you stay and wait for a safer moment?<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

'This is new,' but then you recognize the unmistakable aftertaste in the water you swallowed -- 'chlorine.'  <br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There you go Mala, I knew you could do it.\"  \"Good Job,\" echoed her father.  \"Gooood joowb,\" parroted her brother.  \"Michael,\" the father's warning prompted the boy to swim off to avoid punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why don't you show us your back stroke, Mala?\"<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you can figure out why Mala's ear canal has literally become a canal, gravity shifts ninety degrees and you tumble through the water for what seems like a minute before you can get you bearings.  When you finally find 'up', you plant your feet on the soft 'ground' and discover that your head now barely reaches above the water.  Then the swells come and you find yourself alternately submerged below the surface.  You gasp urgently between each set of waves, not wanting to swim for fear of being sucked out with the undertow.  Disgusting or not, this girl's ear was probably one of the safest places for you on the planet. <br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~ <br>\r\n</div><br>\r\nMala reached the edge of the pool triumphantly but her brother was waiting for her.  Michael didn't look impressed by her accomplishment.  He released the tiled edge of the pool and tredded water out into the deepest section.  \"I bet you're still scared to go under water.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am not,\" Mala protested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright then show me, lets see if you can go down as long as me.\"  And with that the giant boy swallowed an earth's worth of air and plunged down head first like a pink skinned leviathon.  <br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe water level suddenly started rising with all the speed of an elevator.  In a moment of foresight you slam your visor down preserving what little oxygen your helmet still contains.  In your bouyant space suit you are carried along with the tide and finally raised into the sticky embrace of the all to gooey ceiling.  With much grunting you manage to peel yourself off, and look around.  The entire canal iss submerged.  A dreadful thought enters your mind -- 'what if she drowns.'  By staying here you might suffer the same fate, but the chlorine indicated she was in an artificial setting.  Surely even if she did drown her body would be quickly spotted... or so you thought</span></div></div>",

In one quick moment, your tiny form was \"accidentally\" scooped into this giant woman's bra top, plunging you deep into her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine was a young 23 year old woman with a curvaceous body. Currently on leave from work, she decided to take a dip in the pool as a way to get some exercise. After the brief underwater dive, Catherine emerged from the water, and took a deep breath. Swimming had never felt this good before for her. After that, Catherine then made her way to the edge of the pool, as she was done with swimming for one day.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou found yourself lying down with your head looking straight up. Over the course of the gushing water,, your gravity stabilizer had been triggered somehow, giving you some localized gravity of this massive woman: your \"hostess\", so to speak. You could see the chin of your \"hostess\" from your position, appearing high above you that feels like thousands of miles high. What was more imposing were the fleshy mounds on each side, the size of a mountain in comparison to you, each surrounded by large watery blobs, which must be the un-dried water from the pool. Suddenly, there was a loud rumbling sound, and you could see something that resembles a bright red canvas being removed from the \"breast mountains\". It was the bikini top. This was followed by a gigantic green \"thing\" entering through the canyon, and starting to clear up the water blobs around the \"breast mountains\". Strangely, the giant green \"thing\" managed to avoid sweeping you out. You must have been too small for the towel fibers to pick you up. After a while, the massive towel was gone, and another fabric-like object appeared and covered itself over the \"breast mountains\". It was not long before a large darkness overshadowed your view of you \"hostess\". Mike Anders, the astronaut, now a literal speck inside the cleavage of some young woman millions of times larger than yourself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n===<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatherine slipped on her top, finished with changing her clothes. It was good to get out of the uncomfortable office, especially with the nasty rumors spread about her in the office. All Catherine did to achieve her figure was just to eat right and maintain a vigorous exercise acumen, and all she got was slander about her using her body to garner favors. Picking up her bag, Catherine began the journey back home, oblivious to the tiny speck of a passenger inside her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n==<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was simply too dark for you to see your surroundings, even with the help of your in-built searchlight. You needed a better view of surroundings first, especially if you plan to settle down near the base of the \"breast mountains\". The choices are to either climb up one of the \"breast mountains\" for higher ground, or to climb upwards through your hostess' cleavage. Your call.</span></div></div>",

Her belly hair, no doubt sleek enough to be invisible on the aliens' scale, stood around you like blond reeds as strong as steelrebar and twice as thick.  With the water crashing at either horizon, you feel like you stand upon a broad pink beach, a soft sandy isthmus between mountainous mammary glands to the north and the hidden valley of her sex to the south.  You deciding with no small amount of anticipation that you'll be safest sheltered to the south rather than near the shifting mounds above.  'After all she could crush me flat just by adjusting her top.'  Starting south you soon notice you pace picking up without your intent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a few moments you go from walking to scrambling and finally to falling as her smooth belly turns sheer as a cliff.  Only her hairs, one of which you snag on the way down, saves you from a fall of miles.  The ocean, now barely visible, must be crashing around her knees.  'She's moving towards dry land,' you realize.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking advantage of the stability of your position, you look out and away from the neverending plain of arousing flesh and see not floating but flying continents.  To you these giant aliens appear as Titans, the Gods of Gods.  To them you are doubtless an invisible and insignificant speck.  Even if they tweezered you off this Titaness's hairs they'd probably mistake you for a parasite, a crab or a skin mite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour imagination prompts a horrifying thought, 'what if I run into a crab.  A skin mite would probably kick my ass, a crab would likely just eat me.'  You look down at the tempting perimeter of the woman's bikini bottom.  'No jungle treks then I guess,' but the pervert in you argues, 'maybe she practices good hygiene, or shaves...  Even if I do run into some monstrous crotch parasites, I can just use 'ol Betty on'em.'  You glance at your trusty laser just to make sure it still rode securely at your hip.  In this world of giants, so huge a nuclear strike would be hard pressed to get their attention, you'd forgotten about your puny weapon.  'Well it may be no good against alien Titans but at least I can protect myself against their pests.'  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up from the blue waistbands to the moutains of the same shade far above.  The cleft between their mass is a canyon to your earthling eyes.  Beyond its far rim you can see only part of the woman's fair features, but enough to confirm what you conjectured earlier -- 'she's a babe.'  On the cusp of this realization comes a crowd of strange thoughts: places you might visit upon her body on your scale, erogenous zones expanded to erogenous landscapes.  You imagine loosing yourself in the depths of her cleavage, or hiking the hills of her nipples.  You could even pay a close personal visit to the g-spot.  She wouldn't know where her continuous pleasure came from, and she'd never suspect its source was a microscopic man working ceaselessly for her...  'What the heck am I thinking!!  Vagina's are meant for screwing not spelunking.... right?' <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

From his backpack  he extend quickly an antenna, fortunately his suit was the latest in technology, had a necklace which had a receiver and a sender, setting the frequency with a button on his wrist up to the maximum frequency.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter one long minutes both women finally were able to receive the signal of Mike.

You curse all engineers as you lay in a twisted pile at the base of the insect pyramid, though, you figure at the same time it was all that pinching that weakened the suit.  You get up and begin to inspect the damage both to it and your body.  You palpate the area bringing to bear the basic medical training imparted upon all young astronauts.  Your skills lead you to discover three clean breaks.  They'd set on their own if you could only keep still for a while.  Familiar chittering draws your gaze up and you see three warrior Eleph-ants converging on you -- 'keep still when everything on this planet wants to eat/ and/or crush me, oh sure.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf the worker who abducted you was a monster these things are behemoths with toothed pinchers nearly as long as you are tall.  They could probably shear hippos in half with those things and you don't want to find out what they'll do to your already compromised suit.  Choosing with gusto the better part of valor you turn to run but find another regiment blocking your way.  They circle you, signing their anger with long hairy antennae.  You should have waited for the cover of dark to move, you realize.  This close to the nest they must assume that you're a predator.  'Hehe, as if.  The only thing I might predate in this world would be a flea... on second thought a flea would be about the size of a buffalo here... maybe a flea's flea.  Hmm do fleas have fleas...'  You dive to avoid a bullish ant as it charges you pinchers lowered.  Another one is scraping three of its six legs in preparation to attack, but before it does all goes dark.  Even the stupid bugs recognize the forboding calm as the prelude to disaster and some start to scatter.  You keep your eyes on the one eyeing you and are relieved to see it turn and skitter along with its sisters.  \"Ha, run like the little bugs you are.  I may be small but atleast I have...\"  You turn around to see a giant sole filling the air. \"..guts.\"  Indeed you do and it becomes all the more evident when the sneaker descends crushing first the ant mountain, then the ants and finally you, spraying your guts out of your space suit in one last blinding instant of pain.<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\nKaren gives the ants a couple good stamps killing dozens but not making a dent in their numbers.  None the less she is satisfied with having some revenge for the maple syrup they spoiled with their endless raiding.  She walks back inside having no clue that she's tracking the remains of an intergalactic explorer from a world tiny beyond her reckoning across her carpet.  </span></div></div>",

While there's a distinct possibility the aliens inside will be unfriendly, you reason that your chances are far worse with the eleph-ants.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou don't get far before you hear a deafening slurping noise behind you, and, against your instincts, you look back, seeing a massive, glistening red wall sweeping toward you, the boulder-size cookie crumb and its ant-outrage glued to the surface.  The strange crimson object then rises into the air, but not before it also whisks away the ant that had, seconds before, been studying you from only a few dozen feet away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you gaze up, you are shocked by what you find, for that massive thing had only been a tongue, which retreats into the mouth of what looks like a Great Dane--by far the greatest Dane you've ever seen.  If you had to guess, you would say its muscular body, covered in sleek black fur, reaches an altitude of no less than a mile and a half tall at its shoulders, and its head proudly rises higher yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter beholding this behemoth, you are surprisingly unsurprised to see that, attached to a collar that would have encircled a city block back home, there is a leash being clutched at the other end by a huge hand.  Following the length of the arm to the person's torso, you can make out the shape of two breasts.  If you hadn't been able to see the bulges beneath the spandex tank top that far in the air, though, you could have also inferred the dog owner's sex from the lack of any major bulge beneath the tight shorts made of the same material.  Her face soars too high in the heavens for you to get a good look at it.  The word \"Brobdingnagian\" comes to mind, but that doesn't do her justice.  You weren't even the size of a Lilliputian in Brobdingnag; you were closer to the scale of a Lilliputian <i>mouse</i> in Brobdingnag.  The person casting you into shadow is, quite literally, as tall as a mountain.  She could have stood at the base of Olympus and still stared down her nose at the gods at its apex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if you had audibly asked for a better look--and she could actually hear your request--she kneels and leans forward, a pony tail of brown hair slipping over her shoulder and eyes looking toward the ground not far from where you stand, their blue irises as big as swimming pools.   It turns out she has to retie her sneaker, which you now realize is the so-called \"ship\" that pulverized <i>your</i> ship into oblivion!  As you consider her attire, you come to the conclusion that she is out running with her dog, and what you had mistake as a landing strip for massive ships is nothing more than a recreational pathway, a source of enjoyment and relaxation to this race of giants and their pets but a deadly place for you and the world's insects.  This notion is only solidified as someone else zooms by on inline skates at what seems close to the speed of light, creating a sound like the roar of a thousand freight trains, and shortly afterward, a family pedals by on bikes.  Though slow by comparison, even the young girl steering a shaky course with training wheels larger than the London Eye would have shattered Earth's land speed record.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs miniscule as you are, the gigantic jogger is looking at her shoe, and you're standing right next to it.  You loathe asking the weaker sex for assistance, but the dangers on this pathway are too many to count, and she may be your best hope to avoid suffering a fate unbefitting of someone as handsome as yourself.  Will you try to get her attention?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\"><div align=\"center\">**If you are not eighteen, turn back now lest corruption ensue**</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is a setting-focused macrophilia piece.  When adding please respect what was added before and revisit these details so that the reader remains cognizent of place and perspective.  The planets themselves should be a large part of the story not just the man-munching and what-not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBasic story goes as follows:  Mike Anders, red-blooded American astronaut and all-around male chauvinist, is flung away from earth's gravity by the pull of a spontaneous worm-hole (yes I know this is a rip off 'Farscape' but it gets much different from here on I assure you).  The tear in space-time spits him up in another solar system in perhaps another galaxy.  He is immediately struck by the scale of the planetoids orbiting the system's red-giant star (get-it 'giant').  The smallest is five times earth's size and all support life.  Mike has enough fuel in his ship to reach one (but only one) of these five worlds. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">Rules</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) No extreme underage sex scenes (ie. younger than 14)<br>\r\n2) Stick to the planet's theme<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnything else is fair game, please add and I will add to yours<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSPOILER ALERT!  For your convenience I'm placing a brief overview of the planets here; please read if you intend to write.  If you're a reader I highly suggest skipping so as to preserve the suspense of the tail.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1) Varash- This is a barbarian planet.  They have little technology to speak of but I plan on introducing for them a type of sacrificial magic.  The environment is arid with desert and rocky steppes being the dominant terrain features.  The Amazons themselves stand between 80-90 feet putting Mike's scale height at about 4 inches, just big enough for an appetizer ;P  Tinies live here too and are the terrified worshipers/servants of their Amazonian Goddesses.  They are, as per usual, Mike's size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Lysune- This is the gentle giantess storyline.  I am placing an aware and unaware s.t. in this one so if you don't like the grosser stuff please stay on the aware track.  I am modeling these giantesses after Venusian Goddesses.  They should all be extraordinarily beautiful (no foot stink, please).  Their technology is based off their varied psychic abilities (feel free to expound on these and incorporate them into the erotica -- I sure will.)  Their planet is mostly covered with water and many scenes will have to do with water (ie. baths, drinking cups, toilets).  Since I want these giantesses to be divine I'm making their scale big.  The tinies here are non existent having all been captured by the Amazons of Varash in the past.  This is a good plot device because it puts Mike at the center of their attention.  The Lysular are all female and stand a thousand or more feet putting poor sexist Mike around a quarter of an inch or less.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Vorax- This is the furry-focused world.  Vorax will have the most variety in scale since the various anthro races are all different sizes.  Mike himself will be mouse sized.  This makes him toy sized to cats, bug sized to bears, doll sized to rabbits etc. Predation is the rule on Vorax ( \"Vore\"-ax ;P) and Mike will probably spend a lot of time in my writing attempting to escape the 'food-chain.'  However, I imagine kindly animals will also be present, and some Kittys might like to 'play' with their prey before eating.  The main characters of his scale Mike will interact with here are Mice (Neo-rodent ;P) who are exactly human sized to him.  Descriptions may range from very anthro (no or little fur, ears, tail maybe) to totally furred out (snouts, paws, scales, you name it).  Just make sure that when a species is introduced as decidedly one or the other, you keep it that way  Please have some humanoid characteristic though.  No Godzilla-vore, sorry, there's a little of that going on on Varash if its yo' thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4) Krynn- I call it gothic, steam-punk, industrial, factory vore.  I do not know if I'm the first one to put this exact slant on the fetish, but knowing the internet, I suspect not.  On the world Mike will find himself in the clutches of a heartless society driven by primitive steam power.  The tinies are the mass produced food for the giants (both Male and Female) and there is little to their existence other than being eaten.  Giantesses and Giants who have a sexual desires for their food are considered as big of freaks as I am on earth.  This is a good plot device since it means any Giantess or Giant who captures him will have to secret the little astronaut away, perhaps only 'sharing' him with their closest friends.  The scale on Krynn has Mike and his fellow tinies at about an inch tall, making the giants around 400 or so feet tall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) Doros-  This is a mostly unaware tale of Giantesses and Giants so large Mike is less than bug-sized to them.  He will be extremely hard to see and will be the only tiny on this world making the big-folk less likely to suspect his presence and more likely to mistake him as a bug, mite, or speck of dirt.  Giants will function mainly as landscape with Mike climbing up out of pond sized navels or trudging through swamps of toe-jam.  The Giants themselves have a late twentieth century level of technology ('Land of the [Mega] Giants!').  Scale is hard to fathom on Doros but I've been imagining Mike smaller than 1/32 of an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright, I think that's it.  Feel free to add, twist and change so long as you stick to the erotic spirit of the world you're on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n--Neo-rodent, the technologically augmented marsupial (yes I know marsupials aren't rodents but it sounds funnier)<br>\r\n    <br>\r\nP.S.  If you are offended by anything you see here, please ask yourself a question: In a world where 1 out of 5 women are sexually assaulted during their lifetime, is a fetish that makes its owner physically and psychologically incapable of rape a perversion or the next step in human evolution?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*Fairy Hunters* my growing tale of a word plagued by tiny-people is ready for viewing, chapters 1-8 on my portfolio, my gift to you my fellow macrophiles for showing me I am not alone in my weirdness.
