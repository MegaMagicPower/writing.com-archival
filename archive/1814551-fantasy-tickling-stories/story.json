While there you can find a room to stay in, talk to some of the locals, and possible search for some work. It is the perfect place to start. You walk in the door and look around. The tavern is almost completely deserted. The only people you see are the bartender, the waitress, and a man passed out at one of the tables. You approach the bartender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good evening sir, my name is Knight and I am looking for a room to stay in for a couple of days\" you tell the bartender. <br>\r\n\"Well we have a room for rent if you have the coin\" the bartend responds<br>\r\n\"I'm a little short on money right now. Is their any way I can pay for it later?\" <br>\r\n\"Well......\" the bartender looks you over \"I usually don't do this but you look like a trustworthy man. We have a vacant room upstairs. Its fairly small but it has a bed and a dresser for your things\"<br>\r\n\"Sounds good to me. I cant tell you how much I appreciate this and after I find a job you will be rewarded greatly\" you tell the man. He hands you the key. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou order a beer and talk with the bartender for a bit when the man who was asleep at the table approaches the bar area.

You sound like my kind of man\"<br>\r\n\"Yea well I was not the only one. I was a couple miles out of town when I was ambushed by a woman. Before I knew what hit me I was knocked to the ground and tied to a tree. She then proceeded to interrogate me about all of the information I knew about the treasure\"<br>\r\n\"Interrogated. I don't see a scratch on you\" <br>\r\n\"She just did ok I does not matter how\" <br>\r\n\"Come on it could not have been that bad, just tell me\"<br>\r\nThe man starts to blush \"Fine, she tickled me\"<br>\r\n\"She tickled you? You let a little girl tickle you\" you tease him.<br>\r\n\"Yea its really embarrassing but she tickled me, I eventually passed out and when I awoke I was laying outside of this pub\"<br>\r\n\"Wow that's quite a story\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bar starts to get more crowded and the man starts chatting it up with some random girls. You are sitting alone for a while when all of a sudden you hear a woman behind you. \"Anyone sitting here\" you turn and see the waitress standing behind you. She is a short, skinny girl with blond hair and is very attractive. \"Go right ahead\" you tell her. You chat with her for a while when the conversation between you and the man comes up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yea he was tickle tortured by a woman\" you say <br>\r\n\"That sounds awful\" she says to you<br>\r\n\"Come on its just tickling. It cant be that bad\"<br>\r\n\"I don't know. I'm a expert tickler. I bet I could make you talk\"<br>\r\n\"I don't think so\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moves in close and you think she is going to kiss you when all of a sudden her hands start digging into your sides. You try stop her but her hands are too fast. You end up falling off of your stool laughing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just tickling hu?\" she says smiling \"Well I have to get back to work. We should do this again sometime\" She winks at you.<br>\r\n\"Im free tomorrow\" you tell her while climbing up off the ground. <br>\r\n\"Its a date\" she says to you.

Their face is covered by a black mask and all you can see is their eyes through the eye holes in the mask. They sit silently staring at you. Not knowing what to do, you decide to speak up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you and what are you doing in my room?\" you ask the unknown intruder.<br>\r\n\"Straight to the point I like that\" you hear a woman's voice respond.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer playful tone makes you uneasy. She does not speak anymore but just sits there staring at you. After a staring contest that seems to go on for ages, you decide to act. You don't know what this person wants, but you don't want to stick around to find out. You stand up and slowly walk towards the door. As soon as you touch the door knob you hear her speak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would not do that if I were you\" she responds still in her playful tone. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe is still sitting in the chair in the corner of the room. There is no way she can catch you before you can reach a guard. You decide to go for it. You turn the knob, open the door, and start to run down the hall. You only go a couple of feet before you are grabbed from behind and thrown back into the room. The door closes behind you. You look in the corner of the room and see that she has not moved from her chair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look back at the door and see that there is now a second person standing there. They are dressed exactly like the first intruder. They block the door, your only escape, and you soon realize that you may have to fight your way out of here. You look around for your sword but it is not where you left it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry you will get your weapon back when we are done\" she says sounding a lot more serious this time. \"Now will you please take a seat so we can do this in a civilized manner\" she says pointing to the chair at the other end of the table. Seeing as how you have no weapons and are outnumbered you listen to her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you now we have a proposition for you. We are members of a secret organization who specializes in stealth and martial arts. We are assassins and thieves who work to keep the world balanced. When one empire becomes too powerful we destroy them. When one kingdom is on the verge of collapse we save them. When one man has to much money we take it and distribute it to the poor. We have been watching you ever since you saved the innocent gladiator from the corrupt king. We see great potential in you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did you know who I am? I made a clean getaway\" you question the girl<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We see all and know all. Our power spreads throughout the entire kingdom. No one can hide from us.

The man snaps out of his trance and stares at you.

They all agree with you and you guys part ways. With your many years of guard duty, you decide the town guard would be a good starting point. You approach a guard in the market place and he points you towards the town barracks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou enter the barracks and see a couple of guards who are sleeping, but for the most part it is empty. You head through a second door in the back that leads to a outdoor courtyard where most of the men are practicing with their bows and swords.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No Civilians allowed in the barracks. Leave at once\" you hear from behind you. You spin around and notice a large looking man. He is wearing nicer armor than the rest of the men and you assume he is some higher ranking guard. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I was actually wondering if you had a position open\" You tell him. \"In the town that I came from I was part of the royal guard\".

Knight, this is Rex our newest recruit. I want the two of you to fight with each other\" He steps back and the two of you draw your swords. Rex immediately charges at you but you hold your ground.

She constantly tries to run away from them or persuade them to leave her. Were not exactly sure how, the guards refused to talk about it, but she has gotten very good at it. Hopefully you have the skills and the wits to outsmart her and protect her\" The Capitan explains to you as you walk down the street to the palace. You enter a door and are now standing in a large hallway. \"Oh yea if you lose the princess, you will be sentenced to 2 hours in the stocks. Because you are a town guard the punishment will not be very severe and the town will go easy on you but you must be put in them all the same\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well hopefully it will not come to that\" you tell him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe leads you into a large room at the end of the hallway and you see the princess sitting on a throne across the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Your Highness this is Knight, your new protector\" the Capitan introduces you.

This close to her, you notice something a bit strange- it's hard to judge due to her green dress, but...she seemed rather...toned. Not overtly powerful, more like she wasn't fragile. However, having been asked a question, you chuckle and shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well, Princess...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...You don't know my name?...You must be new to the Kingdom. Here, royalty by tradition have names based on colors, with the highest ranking nobles- my family, naturally- being green. Mine is Verde.\" She replied with a chuckle, before letting you speak again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right, Princess Verde, I'd have no way to truly gauge my skill, though the guard captain says he finds me impressive with the blade.\" You say truthfully. The Princess seems to look you over for a bit, before speaking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Right then...follow me.\" She waves you towards her, and leads you through the halls and rooms of the castle. There are many banners of different colors, but all seem to have a particular design on them. At last, she takes you up a small flight of stairs, leading to the second floor, before bringing you to the tower. The castle was large; you had seen this tower on your way here, and could guess you had been pretty close to it within the castle when you met the princess, but this walk alone took five minutes! At last, however, you walked into her room...And were shocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn her room, on one side, was a beautiful balcony with banners galore and all manner of plants. There was, inside, a wonderfully huge, comfy bed, multiple tables and dressing rooms...and at one side, what looked like a miniature dojo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Father likes keeping this a secret. He understands women can be just as powerful, if not moreso, than men, but feels a princess must use her wits and diplomacy to show strength. Of course, it doesn't hurt when his daughter also happens to favor the spear...or the fist...or the trident...Or, my personal favorite...\" She walked into her little dojo, taking a lightweight axe out of a cupboard. \"The axe. So, I want to see how skilled you are. Don't worry about hurting me. I have plenty of potions for healing injuries in here as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou weren't given a chance to protest; everything you did to dissuade her fell on deaf ears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd that's why you found yourself, three minutes later (Two and half arguing, the last thirty seconds having your butt handed to you) on the ground, a victorious princess Verde in front of you. \"Still think I need protecting?\" She asked in a singsong voice. \"If you stay, I can always find a new way to make you leave.\" She said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDo you take this as a challenge?</span></div></div>",

It must be some sort of potion, as the princess is already unconscious. The woman must be a kidnapper or a assassin, but working for who you can't guess. You draw your iron sword and point the tip at the kidnapper. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop immediately and unhand the princess!\", you shout. Hopefully other guards have heard the commotion. The woman turns rapidly, and throws a probably poisoned dart at you, which misses your head by and inch.

The sponge hovers inches from your face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou almost push it back at her, but unexpectedly the woman digs her fingers into your horribly ticklish sides and armpits!

You did notice some hoof prints near the window of the castle. It is likely that the attacker was riding on horse back so you figure this is a pretty strong lead.

You still have your sword and light armor, but your dignity has been lost forever. The inside of the house is sparsely decorated with cobwebbed wooden tables and chairs. A staircase leads to the basement, which you go into. The basement would look like a normal wine cellar if one of the wall casks hadn't been pried open to reveal a secret passage. This must be where the kidnapped brought the princess! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou follow the thin rock passage for many minutes, taking care not to bump your head on any loose stones or sharp rocks. As you walk downward and downward the rock turns darker and darker. Eventually it ends in a ladder, which you climb down. The ladder ends behind a stack of crates in some sort of storage room made completely out of black rock. You peer over the edge of one of the crates and - <i>gasp</i>- the doorway is guarded by two demon-like creatures with red eyes and skin! They're not armed as far as you can tell, though both are taller and more muscular than you. You doubt you could take them even with your sword since these subterranean creatures are rumored to be extremely strong and durable. Behind the doorway the hall splits into left and right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them (a lightly armored man) speaks to the other, a female with breasts barely held back by her armored bra. \"Where do you think she took the girl?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Like i know. She seemed pretty important, so probably not to the torture chambers. Maybe she's in a cell, or maybe one of the higher-ups wanted to see her Or even- Hey! Who's there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou seem to have bumped into one of the crates, which makes a slight banging noise. The woman starts towards where you are, but before she sees you you pull yourself into one of the room's large bags, which is thankfully empty.

Not knowing which one you would prefer, you try not to think about it too much. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou climb out of the water and look around. You seem to be in some sort of temple.

A lap bar automatically goes down over your waist, pinning your body to the seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou watch your surroundings grow darker and darker as you advance down the track away from the well lit room. You soon find yourself in complete darkness. You can feel the wind rushing past your face as the cart picks up speed. Then something catches your eye. In the distance you see a small light. The light grows and grows as you quickly approach the light. You can clearly see, lining both sides of the track, are a series of torches lighting the way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are only feet away from the first torch when you make a horrific realization. Beside each torch stands a large, stiff looking feather. You don't have time to panic as within seconds the first feather brushes past your now trapped foot, forcing a yelp to escape your mouth. Again a feather brushes past your other foot, forcing another scream of surprise from your mouth. The torment continues as your feet are tormented by the seemingly endless line of feathers. You try and bite your lip to hold in the laugh, but you soon start to giggle, and soon after that, full blown laughter occurs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the trail of feathers stop your abs are aching from the tickling and you can barely make a sound. You continue down the track in complete darkness again, giving you a chance to catch your breath. You hope this will end soon when all of a sudden you again see a glowing light. As you approach it you see the familiar torches that caused you so much pain. But something is different this time. Instead two rows of feathers there is just one going down the middle of the track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Few\" you think to yourself as you come to the realization that the feathers will be nowhere near your feet. You sit back and relax thinking you are safe when all of a sudden it hits you. Literally. A stiff feather brushes across your bare bottom, causing you to almost jump out of your seat. Unfortunately the lap bar does a good job at keeping you restrained as feather after feather after feather brushes up against your bottom. This tickles so much worse than your feet did and you scream in ticklish agony, knowing there is nothing you can do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time the cart rolls into the station you are a giggling mess. You climb out of the cart and take a seat up against the wall to catch your breath. Fearing what is ahead, you contemplate trying to find another way out of this place. \"I can dig a hole! Yell for help! At least find some clothing to protect myself!\" but you know it is futile. This place has one purpose. To test the body and mind and you know there only one way out of here. You trudge through the door into the next room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The uncomfortable bed you are strapped on to.<br>\r\nYou are affraid that she is in such a hurry because she wants to be the very first person to do to your feet, what apparently some people just can't resist doing to trapped bare feet in this town. But with you being in here and your soles being out there, there is no way of knowing. <br>\r\nIt however only takes around 30 seconds before you feel fingers touching, no grabbing your big toe. That's got to be her, right? you try to wiggle out of the grip but you soon notice that some kind of noose has been put around your big toe and then around the other one and then, with one strong pull, you feel your big toes being pulled back, now touching the cold wall outside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFurthermore you notice that there appears to be some kind of arch, or bulge above the wall holes, keeping your soles taut, in a position a foot would assume if it was wearing a boot with perhaps two, or three inch heels.<br>\r\nSoon after that, you feel similar nooses being put around your second and third toes. With your big toes already trapped, there is now way for you to do anything about that happening. As these four new nooses are also pulled back, your feet are almost entirely immobile, with now only your fourth and pinky toes being allowed some wiggle room.<br>\r\nRight after that, as you were expecting your last bit of toe movement to be taken away as well, you instead feel a very rough and violent scratch on both of your soles, right where the ball of the foot meets the arch. Being alone, there is little use in denying your tormenter the satisfaction of your laughter, so you throw back your head and do, as your body commands you to do. You laugh maniacially.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile tears form in your eyes and your head begins to feel light, you vaguely remember Veronica's hands, her fingernails, to be precise. They were very long and sturdy looking, so you conclude that it's got to be her out there.<br>\r\nYour cruel torment continues for several minutes and with every second passing, you hate Veronica more and more. At this point you are no longer able to think of other possibilities, so in your head, Veronica is the culprit. The tickling changes every few seconds, making sure that you develop no tolerance for any of it. After the cruel scratches, you feel slim fingertips exploring the soft and sweaty skin between your toes, after that, you feel spider tickling all over your heels, moving upwards over your arches, only to then have sharp fingernails scratch the sensitive skin under your toes. Every now and then your torturer uses both hands on one foot, lightly scribbling your instep with one hand, while having the other hand wildly tickle your sole.<br>\r\nWhile still laughing uncontrollably, your hatred for Veronica knows no limits any more and even though you are sure that she cannot hear you out there, you shout at the top of your lungs: <b>\"<i><font class=\"size35\" style=\"\">Veronica you filthy $%&amp;\u00a7\u20ac!

Knight leads you towards a round table and as everyone sits down, the bar keep shouts \"you have to order something if you're gonna sit there folks!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnight calls back to the bar keep \"a pitcher of ale and five mugs, my good man!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you wait for your drinks, you look around the table. To your left is  the leader of your company, Walter Knight, or as he prefers to be called, Knight. Knight stands at an intimidating 6'2 and has a large muscular frame. He has short blond hair and blue eyes and is sitting up straight, waiting patiently. Knight glances fondly to his left and your attention shifts to Blair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlair is the expert hunter of the group, keeping everyone fed as well as safe whenever you venture into the wild. Blair loves to indulge with tales of the monsters she's  hunted, she even claims to have saved Knight when they first met. She has her chair facing backwards and leans slightly forward. Blair has a long and lean build which is evident as her left arm wraps around the back of her chair. Her right hand brushes a loose strand of her shoulder length dark brown hair back into place. Her jade green eyes scan the room as Blair is always on the lookout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur is sitting across from you, his hazel eyes looking down at his open spell book as usual. Your eyes a drawn to his dirty blond hair that falls to the base of his neck as you wonder what Knight sees in him. Sure his magic is quite usefull, but he seems to have no loyalty to anyone but Knight. Sometimes you wonder if his attitude is just a result of stress caused bu great power, or if he really doesn't care.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEmily sits to your right with her feet resting on th table as she leans back in her chair, hands laced behind her wavy red hair. Her short stature makes this balancing act that would be difficult for most. As a rogue, Emily is a skilled acrobat and quite stealthy. While Knight dissaproves of stealing, even he can't deny the usefulness of her skills. Her blue gray eyes are looking behind the bar, probably for the most valuable bottle. You find yourself looking down at the table, thinking of how her eyes remind you of the sky just after a storm, calming and comforting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou train of thought is interrupted as the bar keep delivers your drinks and Knight pays him. Everyone takes a sip of ale and you brake the silence, asking \"is it just me, or us that woman in the cloak over there watching us?\" Some how she must have heard you because she is now walking toward your table, reaching into her cloak.

Both women are bound and being tickled mercilessly by the goblins. Blair is stuck on her belly with her wrist and ankle hogtied by her own bow and the goblins have taken her boots and sock. To make things even more humiliating, the goblins have helped themselves to Blair's arrows and are using the feathered ends to tickle her helplessly exposed feet. Blair's laughter is breathy and lower pitched than you would have expected, as if she's willing herself to keep as quiet as possible.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn your attention to Emily and see that she's laying on her back with her wrists tied together with a short length of rope that is staked to the  ground above her head with one her daggers. Her ankles are bound in the same fashion and her feet are also bare. Goblins kneel at her feet, sides, and armpits tickling them with their clawed fingers. A third goblin straddles her waist and tickles her belly with what appears to be a feather sword. Emily's armor leaves her torso exposed and the sleeves shirt she wears underneath has been ripped off by the goblins. Emily's laughs are short, fast, and varies in pitch as the goblin's feather sword explores different regions of her belly. In comparison to Blair, you can see that poor Emily isn't able to hold any laughter back as the young rogue's face is now as red as her hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou draw your sword and whisper to Knight \"I'll get Emily, you get Blair.\" You try to sound brave, as you really want to impress Emily but you're slightly intimidated by the feather sword wielding goblin. Knight nods in agreement as he draws his sword and you both leap into the clearing, slashing and stabbing at the goblins. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the corner of your eye, you see Knight cutting down the unarmed goblins around Blair with ease. The unarmed goblins torturing Emily don't give you much trouble either. You stab and slash at the goblin but she dodges your attacks, countering by slashing at your sides wither her feather. You spin away from her attack and slash at her, but she ducks and swipes her feather under your arm, sending your sword flying. You scowl and charge her, tackling her to the ground. The two of you roll on the ground, stopping with you on top. You see one of Emily's daggers in the ground in front of you and you reach for it. As extend your arms the goblin uses the opening to tickle your sides. You grit your teeth and pull the dagger out with only a few giggles. You sit up and stab the goblin through the chest.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou free Emily and she sits up and gives you hug, still trying to catch her breath.

Everyone, beware of their coordinated attacks!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBut we just want to play! Ticklemancer says you will play with us! So laugh!

While they might have been more effective against a larger beast like a hydra or a great boar, the tiny things flew through the holes in your net with ease, dispersing to the multiple thrusts of your trident. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile you managed to catch a few careless fairies as they vanished in a puff of pink smoke, the remainder quickly took notice how easy it was to dodge your desperate attempts. It was just a matter of time until multiple fairies latched onto your legs, slipping underneath your guard with mosquito-like fervor, their wiggling hands almost feeling like ticklish bites on your bare skin. Collapsing to the ground and letting go of your weapons in boyish laughter, you could only writhe about as your hands vainly tried to pry the several fairies from your body one ticklish second at a time. \u201cD-Damn Fairies! Get off of me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo your side, Blair and Knight had a much easier time dealing with the swarm. Thanks in part to the Ranger\u2019s earlier warning, Knight had barely enough time to cover her back before the fairies descended. Swinging his sword to cleave an opening, the male could only grunt as his back was pressed against Blair, the latter firing a volley of shots with accurate precision. \u201cWe need to find a way out of this! There\u2019s too many of them!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Arthur! He could easily handle these fairies with one-Arggh!\u201d Freezing up with shock at the unfamiliar sensation in his clothes, Knight quickly looked down to see that a dozen moving shapes had already infiltrated the space under his mail armor. As the mischievous things started to begin their ticklish antics, a ticklish grunt could be heard from the corners of Knights mouth as his legs gave way, forcing him to a kneeling position while leaning on his sword for support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cKnight! Get up! C-Curses! You devious little things! Let go!\u201d Turning her attention to two giggling fairies who were tugging at her bow, Blair dug her heels into the ground as more of their kind joined in the attempt to disarm the archer. However, the stalemate only lasted for a few seconds. Feeling despair as more giggles were heard from behind her, Blair could do nothing but grit her teeth as tiny hands fiddled with the straps of her leather vambraces and chest guard before letting the equipment drop to the forest floor, removing the her last line of defense. As two more daring fairies flew to her underarms to attack with long fluffy reeds they had retrieved from who-knows-where, Blair\u2019s resolve held for a few more precious seconds before the dam that held her laughter gave way, her hands slipping from her hold of her weapon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith both your fearless leader and archer dropping to the ground with their own hearty and feminine laughter, this only left one member of your ragtag team left. Hearing another hysterical shriek, your hopes were soon dashed. Forcing your head to the side, you could see Emily thrashing on the floor. While the thief had been the most effective in keeping her numerous opponents at bay with her speed and dexterity, her exposed outfit offered her no protection against the tickle dust secreted by their wings, blankets of the purple powder covering every inch of her skin as she tried to furiously scratch away, only managing to tickle herself even more in the process.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few minutes which stretched into an eternity for the four of you hysterical heroes\u2026<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

A large sand-floored fighting pit sits in the middle. Grabbing your trident, sling, and helmet, you enter through the gladiators' entrance. Below the seatings sits the preparation room, where fighters are prepared and armed. The man in there lets you keep your trident, sling, and light armor and explains the rules of the Arena to you. It differs from other arenas in that one gladiator must make the other \"give up\", be it by raw pain and injury, intimidation, or...unorthodox methods. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Unorthodox methods? like what?\", you ask. The trainer tells you that it means someone can do anything if it makes you surrender.

You head through the town, passing through some very shady areas, before you reach the edge of town. You stop before a closed gate which leads across the ocean, to the college. The college sits upon a rocky island that is only accessible through this bridge. The location ensures not only security for the Mages in the event of an attack, but also that only college people will venture into the castle. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You wait by the gate trying to figure out how to gain access. It is a tall gate, way to tall to climb, and it is way to tough to break through. Even if you could, you are sure either of these methods would be seen as hostile to the Mages. After examining the gate closely, you notice and inscription running along one of the metal bars. The inscription reads \"To get into the college is your aim, but to get through you must produce a flame, cross the bridge and don't let the flame die, otherwise you must head back and retry\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis seems simple enough. You cast a flame in your hand and the gate opens. You start slowly walking down the bridge to the college. The flame starts getting smaller and smaller. You have never had to hold a conjured flame this long before and it is really draining your energy. You make it about halfway before the flame goes out. As soon as this happens a gist of wind whirls around you, blocking your vision and lifting you off of your feet. In an instance you are once again standing in front of the gate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou rest for a couple of minutes before trying again.

You soon arrive at a large looking room, and you take your seat. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello everyone, I believe I see a couple of new people in the class so I will introduce myself. My name is Sarya and I am your defensive magic teacher. In this class you will learn how to use magic to defend yourself, instead of using it to attack. Today we will be learning a simple shielding technique, which is incredibly handy. The spell is called Incantatores Resilit. If preformed correctly, this spell will rebound the spell and fire it back at the attacker. Would anyone like to give it a try?\" the teacher in front of the class asks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nobody? How about one of our new student? How about you sir? What is your name?\" she asks pointing at you. You nervously tell the audience your name and walk to the front of the class. She shows you how to properly preform the spell and then she tells you to stand at the other side of the classroom. She then tells you to be on guard and when she fires a spell at you, you should try to deflect it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe then walks to the other side of the room and before you know it she fires a spell at you. You try your best to deflect the spell, but you must have done something wrong as the spell hits you hard. Before you know it, you are laying on the ground. You fell a tingling sensation in your armpits. The sensation gets stronger and you start giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see class, I have attacked our student with a simple tickle charm. This charm tickles the student in his most ticklish spot. If he were to properly preform this spell, I would be on the ground laughing instead of him. Unfortunately for him, he mispronounced the spell and did the wrong movements which made his defensive attack pointless. Now instead of me, he is on the ground laughing. I would advice you to work on that spell for the next class\" the teacher says as you are rolling on the ground laughing like crazy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher immediately preforms a spell which stops the tickling and you climb back up, completely embarrassed. You get back in your seat and the class starts preforming their blocking technique. As embarrassed as you were, it seems like nobody could properly do the spell, and multiple people end up on the ground when the teacher tests them. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class soon ends and  Zyliath catches up to you to how you were the next class us.

Don't worry keep at it and you will learn\" a mousey looking woman standing in front of the classroom says. The two of you find your seats and she continues teaching.

With a flick of the wrist your body starts changing before your eyes. Your arms and legs start getting skinnier and browner, your joints lock up, your belly starts to get flat. Your head slides off of your neck, and is levitated by the teacher who places your head on her desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat once was your body now is a large desk, identical to the rest in the room. \"Now you guys wont be expected to do this sort of stuff until the end of the year, but I just wanted to show you that the possibilities are endless\" She is about to turn you back when all of a sudden you hear a student yell. Looking up you see a student laying on the ground with their desk broke in half. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Um teacher I think my desk is broken\" the student says completely embarrassed. Se climbs up off the ground and the teacher levitates the broken parts into the corner of the room. \"Ah no worries we will get this fixed in no time. But until then, I am sure that Arthur will be willing to lend a \"Body\" \" the teacher chuckles, laughing at her own joke. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you have time to speak the teacher places your body, now a desk, in front of the student. and moves your head onto a desk in the front row. \"There now Arthur you can see and Jenny has a desk.

It is not long before the creature forces a steady stream of laughter escaping your mouth as she uses her wings to torment your belly and sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to think that you are going to be trapped here, entertaining this terrible creature for a long time, as you run out of energy and stop fighting. An array of unanswered girlish screams and pleas for help pour out of your mouth as the creature starts using one of its vines to poke around your exposed underarm. This new sensation causes you to laugh even louder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother vine wiggles into your other armpit and two more start gliding across your exposed feet making sounds come out of your mouth that you did not even know you were capable of. Your abs start getting tired from laughing so long and the only bright side you can think of is that no one is around to see you scream like a little girl. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course your luck is not that good as you hear a female chuckle from below. \"Looks like somebody was not paying attention in magical creatures class\" You turn your head to see....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You, Zyliath, and a dozen other students climb the steps and enter the tower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe master mage of this class is named Ardef. Although he is old, his voice is powerful enough to capture the attention of the class. \"Today ,for our first class we are going to work on using simple defense wards against magical creatures.\" You mentally groan as you remember your experience last class with defense spells. Ardef continues, \"Rest assured that we teachers will intervene before any real harm can be done.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nArdef waves his hands in the air, mutters a long incantation, and a blue, magical cage is teleported into the large center of the room. In it sits a captured naga, a woman with the lower body of a snake, who hisses and says a few strange words in her strange tongue. Around the cage Ardef conjures a large circle of energy, to ensure that once released the naga couldn't reach the new students. Suddenly Ardef looks you in the eye and says, \"You there, come and show me those defense wards you practiced. He lets you through the energy circle to the naga's cage. Shivering, you look into the eyes of the snake-woman. They show only one desire- to tickle you until you pass out, or worse. But Ardef is there to make sure that doesn't happen, right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly the naga' cage dissapears, and she hisses and slithers forward. From the corner of your eye you can see Zyliath cheering you on. The naga charges at you, her objective to use her tail to tie you up and her fingers to tickle you into submission. You prepare to cast the defense ward.</span></div></div>",

Expecting them to be angry, their friendly, inviting tone is a little unsettling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well are you just going to stand there all day or are you going to introduce yourself to your Arch-Mage?\" It takes a second for you to fully comprehend what she said, and as you do, your heart skips a beat. \"Th-th-th The Arch-Mage?\" you respond in a weak, cowardly voice. You slowly turn around and sitting in a chair in the corner of the room is the Arch-Mage<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arch-mage wears a very oval shaped face with an almost non-existent chin. She she has a pair of deep, sky blue, eyes that could make just about anyone melt. She wears a long blue robe that matches her eyes perfectly and a hood thst covers most of her head. Her long, white hair flows out of the sides of her hood and all the way down past her shoulders. She wears and mischievous grin on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I-I\" you stammer trying to figure out what to say. The way she is just sitting there and grinning at you makes you feel like a trapped animal. Eventually you find your voice. Not being able to think of any way out of this you lower your head and speak. \"I.... I have nothing to say. I broke in and I am sorry. I will grab my things and leave\" You slowly make your way to the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Stop\" she says. You stop dead in your tracks and turn towards her. \"The ledge you climbed out on is dangerous and you were the first student I have ever seen who was stupid enough to risk climbing out onto it.  You are lucky you survived. And you did all of this for the sole reason that you wanted to break into my private chambers. You have risked everything....... To gain the knowledge that lies between these shelves. And after all that is why we are all here, to gain knowledge, is it not?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou look up at her confused. \"So I am not going to be kicked out?\" you asked her in a hopeful tone. She looks you over for a minute and then responds. \"I must stress how serous of an offense this is. Although your reasons were admiral, your actions were not. You will not be kicked out, but you will be punished\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour heart skips a beat when you hear this. You are not getting kicked out! You broke into the Arch-Mages bedroom and all you are getting is a slap on the wrist. You don't even care what the punishment is you are just happy you get to stay! \"Thank you so much! I promise it will never happen again!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Good, now for your punishment.....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her voice is much more demanding than before and you know you better do what she tells you. You follow her through a large wooden door that leads you out of her bedroom into the hallway. She leads you down to the end of the hallway and stops next to a large Mirror. She taps the mirror with her hand and steps into it. She easily passes through the mirror and you follow her through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou are surprised when you find yourself in a small tunnel, barely large enough for you to walk through. You can feel the cold, damp dirt on your bare feet and look around for the Arch-Mage. You turn around behind you and are stunned when you come face to face with a rock wall. The way back is blocked. With the Arch-Mage gone and the way back blocked your only hope is to continue on to the end of the tunnel where you see a small, bright light shinning through. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sudden burst of cold water hits the top of your head as you pass through the edge of the tunnel. You take a look back and see that you have just stepped out of a waterfall. The waterfall originates from a large gargoyle statue on top of a rock and empties out into a stream. You look around and see that you are standing in the center of a large courtyard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe yard is incredibly large, spanning almost a mile in every direction. On each end of the yard there lies a stone wall that spans the entire length of the courtyard. A thick layer of trees cover the four walls creating the illusion that you are standing in the middle of a forest. The place is full of students walking through the forest. Every once in a while a student will appear out of seemingly random places like a tree or a stone. And just as easily as they appeared they will disappear in the same manner. Multiple students are standing in clearings practicing spells and others are just laying out enjoying the sunlight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see the Arch-Mage standing by a tree and she orders you to follow her. She leads you through the trees and you come to a large pond. She kneels by the pond and places the palm of her hand on the ground. As she does this the ground at the bottom of the pond rises creating a dirt bridge that leads to a small island in the middle of the pond. You follow her across the bridge. In the center of the island sits a pair of stocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now sit\" she orders you in the same demanding tone from before. You do as she says, not wanting to see her when she is angry. She waves her hands and the stocks seem to come to life. The stocks enclose around your ankles, trapping them. Some rope attached to the back of the chair comes to life and wraps itself around your hands like snakes, trapping them so that your elbows make right angles just at shoulder length and your wrists are trapped above your head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a clap of her hands a blue fiery ring pops out of the ground and surrounds you. \"For your punishment you will be trapped in these stocks a couple of hours. This ring will stop anybody from reaching you\" she tells you, sounding a little nicer now. \"OK, well since nobody can reach me, all I have to do is sit here. This sounds pretty easy\" you tell her relieved. I mean this is the easiest punishment ever. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I would not say that. The student here are quite clever\" she tells you with a smile on her face \"The ring just makes them work for it.\" She gives another clap and you are covered in a big puff of smoke. When the smoke clears you look down at yourself and see that you are now sitting in just your underwear. She claps her hands again and vanishes, leaving the bridge to the island in place. You have to say, although you are supposed to be in punishment, this area is quite peaceful. The gently waves crashing into the island calm you and there is a lot of wild life crawling around to keep you company. Everything seems fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

As the individual approaches you see the familiar long white hair and black robe and see that it belongs to Zyliath. She walks up to the edge of the fiery circle with a confused look on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Arthur? Is that you? What on earth happened? I came back to get you for class and you were not there!\" You can tell by the tone in Zyliath's voice that she was really worried about you. You tell her about how you sneaked into the Arch-Mages room and how you got caught. You then tell her about the insane journey that brought you to these stocks. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And.... She took all of your clothing?\" She asks confused. \"Yea I'm not really sure why she did that. Supposedly this is supposed to be some terrible punishment. But all I have done so far is sit here. She said that no one could cross the line but that some students can get quite clever. I'm not really sure what she meant by that\" you tell her. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nZyliath studies the blue flame closely. She tries to move her hand past it however her hand stops dead in it tracks as it hits an invisible barrier. \"Hmm I wonder\"  She then grabs a bird feather off the ground and tosses it towards the flame. Unlike her hand, the feather passes the invisible barrier with ease. \"Oh I get it\" she says talking to herself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is it\" you ask her confused. Zyliath stares at you like a piece of meat and you start to get nervous. \"Well if you were in class today you would know that we learned how to levitate objects. And I'm thinking its time for a practice test\" she says wearing a slight grin on her face. She waves her hands and like magic the feather starts floating in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe practices her control a little bit as she does circles around you with the feather. \"Wow that is really neat!\" you tell her. \"Yea, and super useful to\" she tells you. You are about to ask her what she means when the feather takes a dive down towards you. She stops it as it rests under your armpit, then with a flick of her wrist the feather starts moving back and forth, brushing against your underarm. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou immediately bite your lip to try and hide the laughter that is trying to escape your body. \"Hey stop that!\" She gets a more serious look on her face. \"Well maybe if you would have shown up to class instead of breaking into off limit areas you would not be in this situation\" she tells you sternly. \"You could have been injured, you could have been expelled, you could have even been killed! You got lucky and I think I need to teach you a lesson!\" she says seriously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe grabs another feather off the ground and guides it to your other armpit, and like the other, it starts tickling you. Once in place the feathers seem to be moving under their own power as she no longer needs to guide them.  She just sits back and admires her work as you try with all your might to prevent laughter from escaping your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on it will be much easier if you just let it out\" she tells you. She seems to be enjoying your ticklish torment greatly as she wears a large grin on her face. The two feathers start wearing down and a giggle soon escapes your mouth, followed by another and another. It is not long before a steady stream of laughter is escaping your mouth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See was that so hard\" she mockingly says........</span></div></div>",

Wriggling to get free, you can do nothing else as her cold slimy fingers  slowly drag up and down your bare armpits. \"Hee hee, eheheh, ahahahahah!\" You begin giggling softly and attempt to get away  by pulling and pulling more, but you are reduced to helpless giggly laughter as Zyliath and Katie stand and watch in awe. Then the spirit decides to go full force.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMild laughter turns to full-force guffaws, almost yelling as the sperctre digs her pointy fingers into both armpits. You can do nothing but scream and laugh when she squeezes and pinches the hollows of your armpits for what seems like eternity. Then she switches tactics.<br>\r\nHer hands slyly slink down and hover over your legs agonizingly for a minute before they start pinching and kneading the soft flesh of your inner thighs. Your face turns beet red as you belt out laughter full force from this embarrassing tickling. \" AHAHAHAHAHA!\" This is when Zyliath and Katie become a bit nervous, as you are panting between your shrieks of laughter. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Zyliath turns and shouts the spell again, \"Spectram incantatam priorius!\" The spell has no effect! Zyliath runs over to you and pries open the stocks. The spirit is too late to stop her as you collapse to the ground but in revenge floats over to Zyliath and squeezes her wide hips over and over again.

Naturally, you fly right through it and land hard on the ground. You turn your head and see the spirit no longer is attacking Zyliath and now is floating your way. You scramble to your feat and make a dash for the bridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the ghost hot on your tail you make your way over the bridge and into the woods. You turn your head to see Zyliath and Katie running after you, however they are clearly not as fast as you and are having a tough time keeping up. As you run deeper into the woods you lose sight of the two of them completely. The ghost however remains only feet behind you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you feel the ghosts hand graze across your back you start to think you are doomed. You try and pick up the pace but the ghost is running you down and you don't know how much longer you can last. Just as you think all is lost you see the wall marking the edge of the courtyard. You are about to give up and let the ghost catch you when something catches your eyes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the base of the wall is a small hole, just a couple feet wide, just large enough for you to slip through. The hole is quite dark and appears to go deep underground. Diving in a hole does not seem like the smartest idea, however the only thing on your mind is to escape your pursuer, and you dive down. As you slide down the hole, you look back to see the ghost standing at the base of the hole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething is wrong. As you stare up towards the ghost your vision starts to get blurry. You hear someone yell \"Superare Specter\" from the top and see the ghost vanish. As you go deeper down the hole your vision gets blurrier. You can still see the rays of the sun poking through the entrance of the hole when you pass out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

There is quite a tunnel above that and only a few pinpricks of light shine from it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stand up and gather your wits.

In one corner there is a pool of murky black water. It churns and bubbles silently but may lead somewhere if you cast an easy underwater breathing spell.

You are brought close to the Arch-Mage...sweat<br>\r\nbreaking out over your body as you realize you are within easy tickle-range of those fantastic fingernails. She studies you bemusedly.....then extends her<br>\r\nshapely hand...nails making a slow tickling motion...

She continued...\"But I have a proposition for you..if you can hear it\"....she snickered...\"Mythresse, dear...slow down for a bit..just a bit\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The torturing fingernails eased up...enough to hear the Arch-Mage speak over you own frenzied laughter. \"Now then,I need someone to retrieve something I<br>\r\n..um..misplaced..a while ago.....\" she clicked her nails together in annoyance...\"will you agree?\" You wheeze and gasp....\"what..what is it?\" She waved a hand,<br>\r\nthe nails passing deliberately close to my vulnerable belly...and I flinched, giggling harder. \"No details until you accept....decide\"..she declared. \"Oh, I forgot..<br>\r\nMythresse, dear..he's heard the offer...pick up where you left off\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n   A sadistic chuckle echoed in my ear as the tickling nails returned to maximum speed....<span class=\"clred\"><b>\"Goochy goochy goooo</b></span>.....come on,honey..I know<br>\r\nyou love this, surrender to meeee\"..Mythresse ran her tongue into your ear as you howled with renewed laughter.....</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\n   Well, what's it to be?</span></div></div>",

She cant hide the grin that is forming on her face and she gives the naked man a wave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBack on the ledge you are mortified. Here you are hanging on for your life, and sitting right in front of you is a woman who appears to be enjoying herself. The woman starts pointing at your member and starts silently laughing to herself, covering her mouth. This causes you to turn bright red with embarrassment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe woman gets a wicked grin on her face and looks around the room, making sure no one is looking at her. Once she assures the coast is clear, she waves her wand, and points it towards you. You stare at her confused as nothing seems to have happened. You start to think this girl is messing with you when all of a sudden you feel something soft brush past your ear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is when you see the small bird feather floating through the air, controlled by the woman. She wickedly grins at you and moves the feather towards your armpit. She then starts moving her wand back and forth. The feather follows suit and starts brushing against your armpit. You bite your lip and try to pull yourself up however the laughter is making you weak, and one of your hands slip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moves the feather to your other armpit and start brushing it again. You manage to push the feather away from your armpit, and she moves it out of your reach. The woman just shrugs, and then moves it down towards your member. As the feather makes contact you start squirming. This sensation is much much worse than before and you try with all your might to reach the feather, but it is just out of your reach. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot only are you being driven out of your mind, but the sensation is causing you to get excited. You turn bright red and the woman controlling the feather gives you a large grin. The sensation is causing you to lose focus and just as you are about to explode you lose your grip and fall towards the ocean. Just before you lose sight of the woman she gives you a wave goodbye with a triumphant smile on her face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you plunge into the cold water, your excitement immediately vanishes. You now have two options. You can either swim all the way back to the harbor in Bowerstone, or you can swim into a near by cave. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The further you get into the cave, the stronger the current gets.

The strong current guarantees that this is going to be a one way trip and you have no clue where this will lead you. As you head deeper and deeper underground you pick up speed. Enchanted torches light the path as you speed down the river. It is not long before you see a opening in the cave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore you know what happens, you go flying off the river, and fall 20 feet to a deep pond below. As you surface, you look up and see the contents of the river being emptied into the pond. The current from the waterfall naturally sends you to the shoreline and you wade out of the pond. Taking a look around the room you see that you are in small cave. Enchanted lanterns line the walls. In the center of the cave is a pedestal emitting a blue light. Behind the pedestal is a large doorway. Not wanting to mess with the pedestal just yet, you walk up to the door and give it a large tug. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLocked... Looking around, you come to the conclusion that this glowing pedestal is your ticket out of here. You walk up to the pedestal and take a look.

You head down a series of streets until you come across an old looking shop. A dusty sign hanging above the entrance reads \"Dragonbots Charms and Incantations\". As you enter the shop, an aroma of smoke fills your nostrils. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the crackling of a roaring fire coming from the side of the room. A small elderly man, who you assume is the owner, is fast asleep in front of the fire. Resting in a cozy looking chair, you decide to let him sleep and start browsing through the old looking book shelves. You leaf through a book called \"Alizar's book of Basic Incantations\" however it fails to produce any useful information and you continue looking. You are about to leave the shop when a very old looking book catches your eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn small gold letters, the title \"Charms and Incantations of the Ages\" is written on the cover of the book. There is no author listed on the book, which is odd, even for older books.  The binding of the book is frail, and the pages are worn. As you carefully turn the pages, you see that multiple pages are torn and a couple of pages are missing. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeafing through the pages, you don't see a single spell you have ever heard of. After each spell, the pronunciation is listed, followed by any additional instructions needed to preform the spells. Unfortunately you don't see any description of the spells. Only by using the title of the spell, and a bit of testing, will you be able to figure out what the spells do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRemembering that you are dirt broke, you start to place the book back on the shelf when an idea comes to you. Looking at the man fast asleep, and looking at the wide open door, you make a decision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n </span></div></div>",

She wears a long, black and purple dress that barely covers her thighs, and does a poor job at concealing her breasts. Along with her dress, she wears a large, stereotypical witches hat. She does not look like your typical, run of the mill witch though. With her flawless skin, long brown hair, and comforting smile on her face, she seems more like a princess that a witch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you look the witch over, you are completely oblivious to the two vines coming out of the ground behind you, moving like snakes through the air. Once they are high enough to reach your wrists, they dart at them with incredible speed, and before you have time to react they wrap themselves around your wrists. They start reeling themselves back into the ground, and although you fight to stay on your feet it is not long before they have you on your knees,<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can feel two more vines wrap themselves around your ankles, pinning them in place, and the vines around your arms pull tight, bringing your wrists to your ankles, leaving the entire front of your body completely vulnerable. You see a couple more vines raise out of the ground in front of you, and hover in front of you, moving through the air like a snake about to strike. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistracted by the vines, you just now remember that the witch is still here. You look up at her and she just grins at you. \"Hello, Welcome to my home. My name is Leona\" she says. The tone in her voice is not serious, or stern, or really threatening at all. There is not a tone of mischief in her voice, she sounds very kind. She takes a seat in front of you, and you are just out of her reach. \"And what is your name?\" she asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCompletely outraged that you have been captured like this, you completely ignore her question. \"What on earth are you doing!\" you yell at the lady. She just grins and nods at the vine that is facing her. The vine turn back towards you and with lighting speed, slashes across your shirt, cutting it in half. The vine quickly removes the pieces from your chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So are you going to tell me your name? Or are you going to keep throwing a tantrum\" she tease. You are outraged! \"Listen up lady! I don't know who you think you are, but You can't just go around capturing people\" The vine, like before, turns to Leona who gives it a quick nod. and the vine starts slashing away at your shorts, and it is not long before you are kneeling in just your briefs. You can feel the vines make quick work of your socks and shoes,  and it is not long before those are gone as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So how about that name\" she asks in a very casual tone \"Or should my little friends continue their work\" she motions towards your briefs. \"Ok just stop stealing my clothing!\" you say, getting a little nervous. \"My name is Arthur\". You stare her down trying to get a good read on the situation. She is very calm, almost like she was just having a normal conversation with you. \"It is a pleasure to meet you Arthur\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now are you going to tell me why you have tied me up?\" you question her, hoping it will not lead to you losing any more clothing. \"Oh why I did not do this, these vines have a mind of their own\" she says motioning to the vine who is still slashing away at the shirt that is lying on the ground. \"I would not worry though they are not dangerous, just a tad playful sometimes. Kind of like me\" she says giving you a very seductive grin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok so why am I here?\" you ask. She, yet again, does not give you a straightforward answer. \"I was not the one who brought you here. You followed the map and came here on your own free will. I do not mind though, I am always exited to meet new people. Even ones as stubborn as you\" she laughs as she says this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So Where are we?\" you ask. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We are in my own little world that I created. It is quite nice isn't it? I got tired of all of the violence in the old world, so I created this one where I could live in piece. I do grow lonely sometimes though, which is why I created the map. And you came to visit! That was so kind of you. Hey Stop that!\" she shouts at a vine who was tugging at your briefs.\"Like I said, mind of their own, anyways where was I....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she continues speaking, one of the vines that is holding your foot starts to stroke across your foot. The sensation is light, and you manage to keep your composure, but you do not know how long you can keep it as the vine tickles your foot. The other three vines holding your feet and wrists join in on the fun,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou bite your lip trying to keep your cool in front of the witch, but the four vines are too much for you and you let out a giggle, followed by another and another. \"hahah pleheehehs stop them!\" you yell to the witch as the vines weave there ways through your ties and down your soles. \"Hey I said stop!\" The witch yells. The vines immediately stop. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So anyways where was I, Oh yea! So we have a town down the road that some people have decided to live in. You of course are more than welcome to stay as long as you like. The town is ........:\" As the Leona talks, you feel one of the vines graze itself along your thigh. You have to bite your lip to hold in the laughter, and Leona, who is looking at the sky as she speaks, does not seem to notice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vine slowly continues his torment, just slow enough so that you can keep in the laughter, but fast enough for it to still tickle. You are so distracted that you do not even see Leona stand up until she is standing right in front of you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Another vine does the same to your other side, and you start to realize that you are not getting out of this anytime soon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two vines maneuver up to your head, and starts  tickling your neck, causing a smirk to appear on your face. The two vines continue their torment for some time as they flick your ears, tickle your nose, and stroke your neck, keeping you just on the verge of laughing. You are not sure how long it will take for Leona, but it can't come soon enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of the vines picks a cattail off of the ground and starts running it under your nose, causing you to snort, and sneeze at the same time. He then starts dragging it along the side of your neck, causing you to giggle. And if that wasn't enough, the vine near your foot picked up a leaf off of the ground and started stroking it along your sole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the vines torment you, you see a large bird land, eat something off of the ground, and the fly away as quickly as he came. You were not focused on the bird though, but the large feather that he left behind.This feather has to be one of the largest, stiffest feather you have ever seen, Your hearts drops as you see one of the vines, also noticing the feather, heading towards it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vine soon returns wielding the feather like a sword. The third vine brings the feather up to your chest, and starts flicking your nipples with it. This is the last straw as you start thrashing around, squealing like a girl, as the vines play with their new toy. The feather tickling your nipples is by far more ticklish than anything you have ever felt in your entire life, and you try with all of your might to avoid it, or break free of the vines, or do anything you can to stop it, but it is no use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vine with the feather eventually stops tickling your nipples, and moves down to your thighs where he starts sawing the feather between your legs, You try and spread your legs apart to avoid the feather, but two more vines pop out of the ground and hold your legs in place, Although this sensation is driving you insane, it does not take long before the vine gets bored of this. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTwo more vines pop out of the ground, grab onto the legs of your briefs, and pulls it out, creating a gap between the underwear and your leg. The feather then is stuck up your underwear, and is flicked across on of your balls. You thought your strength was gone, but this gave you a burst of energy like nothing else you ever felt as you press against your legs, trying to break free of the feathers torment. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis new found burst of energy was actually enough to free your legs for a moment, but the vines quickly recovered as more vines wrapped around your legs and arms. The vine with the feather flicked your balls again, and this time you were bound tight and there was nothing you could do besides scream out in ticklish agony as the feather danced across your balls. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe vines have found there new favorite spot as two more vines squeeze down your underwear and starts tickling the top of your balls. It is not long before you start to get hard from all of this tickling. Two more vines start tickling your nipples again, and you thrash around in ticklish agony, with nothing you can do. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The smirk does not disappear from her face and the vine raises its head and looks at her. \"Well I have to admit, this is the first time I have seen a smile on his face since I have gotten here\" she jokes looking at you as you are still being attacked by the vines, who have are now trying to push their way into your armpits. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please let me go!\" you scream as one of the vines managed to fit itself in between your arm and your side, and is now wiggling itself in the hollows of your armpit.

Two Vines dart in each of your armpits, wiggling around in your pits. No less than 10 vines starts scribbling along your feet and gliding in between your toes.

Almost every inch of your body is being tickled, and you can not do anything to prevent it.

Her customer, or customers should I say, were none other than the famous Leona, accompanied by a naked man, passed out in her arms. Leona tells Megan about the story of her visitor, who had a little to much fun with her plants, and how after passing out, the plants shredded his last piece of clothing. With no male clothing of her own, Leona had no choice but to bring him here, naked. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMegan told her it was not problem, telling Leona that in the morning she would help him find some clothing to wear. She leads Leona to a empty bedroom, sneaking as many glances at the naked man as she could, and Leona sets you down on the bed before she thanks Megan one more time, and leaves.

No way you'd managed to steal that huge book out from under his wrinkled nose without him noticing, since normally you're not much of a thief. But no matter, you got the book and escaped the store without anything bad happening. You sit down on a smooth rock outside of town and take out the spellbook. An unblinking eye adorns the book's musty cover, inviting you to delve inside. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey you! Stop right there!\" You gasp and look up. Two well armored Bowerstone City Guards have approached you, each holding heavy shields; which are excellent for blocking magical as well as physical attacks. They carry no other weapons, but you know the steel shields can deliver a devastating blow. Although the only part of their body you can see are their eyes, it's obvious by their molded breastplates and voices that they are female. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's that you've got there?\", the one with blue eyes asks. \"Just a storybook...\", you reply, hoping neither notice your arcane book.  Too late. \"That's no common book, it's an ancient wizard tome!\", the green-eyed guard says. \"Probably stolen, too!\" Looks like there's no escaping this one. But armed with only a rudimentary knowledge of spells, such as \"flames\" and \"light flash\", you don't stand a chance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut wait! Your spellbook!

She responds with a negative shake of her helmet. \"I think I found his weakness...\" the spellsword coos, and her tone drives you to act. A large firey ball appears in one of your hands, bigger than anything you have ever conjured before, perhaps because of your anger at being tickled like a child.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt's in vain, though, as she swats your flame out like a bug with a more powerful spell, and pins your arms above your head.

You upper body is immobilized too when the blue eyed knight sits on your waist. \"Naughty, naughty little mage.\" she whispers, and then she plunges her fingers into your sides. You howl and squirm in laughter, but the weight of all the armor on top of you prevents all but wriggles.

You look at your cell: it is a tiny, dingy hole, with a dirty cot and a bucket for your business in the corner. Your cell lies next to rows of other ones, about four stories of cells overlook a dusty prison courtyard,and you can see male and female figures alike sitting and walking in it.

One of the guards approaches the cell, opens it up, and escorts the man down the staircase. Moments later the guard returns to her post. Realizing you are not going to get anywhere in here, you turn towards the guard. \"I would also like to go to the courtyard\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou hear the guard groan, clearly annoyed that she has to escort yet another prisoner outside, but begrudgingly opens your cell. \"Follow me prisoner, and since you are new I will warn you, any funny business and you will be taken to the corrections facility. And trust me you never want to end up in there\". The tone in her voice is serious and sends shivers down your spine. You don't know what goes on in the corrections facility, but you are certain you never want to end up there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe escorts you down the cement staircases and you head down through a tunnel, guarded by two guards. A magical barrier, giving off a purple light, blocks the way to the courtyard. One of the guards steps up and removes the barrier, clearing the path outside. You and the guard walk through and when you look back you are shocked to see that the barrier is already back. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe guard leaves you and passes back through the barrier, leaving you by yourself. Looking around, you see that the prison is surrounded by large stone walls. Guard towers are positioned every 30 feet along the tops of the wall. Looking around you can sense the lack of hope in the prisoners spirits. Although a few of the prisoners are talking in small groups, most of them are sitting around, keeping to themselves. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou see one prisoner who is standing near the wall, looking up at the sky with a depressed look on his face. You approach the man. \"Thinking of breaking out\" you ask the man as he studies the top of the wall. \"Na, there is not escape from this place, the guards monitor your every move. And being caught means being sent to the corrections facility\" the man says, never looking down from the top of the wall. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What exactly happens in the corrections facility\" you ask the man curious. The man sighs for a moment, turns towards you, and slowly shakes his head. \"Trust me, you are better off not knowing. The only thing you need to know is that you never, ever want to be sent there. So what are you in for?\" the man asks. You tell him the story about how you were sent here for stealing a book, which in your opinion seems pretty unfair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The length of your stay does not matter, nobody leaves the prison. The guards look for any excuse to keep you hear longer. There are rumors of prisoners who got added ten years for walking too fast or breathing too loud. Some prisoners claim they were just swept up off the streets and ended up here, without committing a single crime\" The man warns \"If there is one thing I know, this prison is not sanctioned by the king. These guards make there own rules\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou start to realize you are in a lot of trouble. You have to escape......</span></div></div>",

But don't expect to get released anytime soon. The guards lengthen sentences all the time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is bad news. Ten or more years in prison will spell the end to your spell-casting career. You've got to get out, but how? <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour gaze is drawn to a prison brawl in the dust fifteen meters or so to your left. Ten or twenty prisoners surround it, so you move in for a closer look. Two prisoners fight ferociously on the ground. One is a blonde-haired man about your size and age, but a bit taller. The other is a woman with a shaved head but a pretty face. She is shorter than you but more muscular, not surprising since being a mage requires little heavy lifting.  The man who had been speaking to you earlier taps you on the shoulder. \"That's Katira. She's well-informed about many things in this place. A seasoned prisoner, too; they shaved her head because she kept hiding tools in her hair. If you want to go through with your delusions of escape, she's the one to ask. But one thing: a newcomer like you wants to talk with a seasoned prisoner like her, you're gonna have to past a test.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What kind of test?\" you ask him. \"Combat and wrestling.\" he replies. \"You're gonna need to beat or draw her in a match. That's what that kid over there is trying to do.\" \"That kid\" isn't doing too well by now. You see that that woman Katira has his arms pinned above his head while she's sitting on his chest. The motley crowd cheers her on. Suddenly she digs her nails deep into the armpits of her opponent. The effect is immediate: he bucks and shakes in an attempt to get her to stop, but she hangs on, cat-like. After a minute or two he is too tired to struggle, and lies quivering and laughing while her deft hands squeeze his sides. After some time she lets him go, and he crawls away wheezing and gasping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis all came as a surprise to you, it seems like everyone on the land of Avara uses tickling alongside or as regular weaponry. And quite an effective weapon it is, against your ticklish body. But you have one advantage against Katira: magic. If you use magic without the guard noticing you could pull off a draw, or maybe even a win. If you do this you'll be one step closer to escaping the prison.</span></div></div>",

But I don't give out information for free. If anybody else sees me doing favors, especially to a shrimp like you, they're gonna know something's up and I'll be a target. Anyway, even if there are a few weaknesses I doubt a clumsy oaf like you could get five feet into the guard rooms and towers surrounding this place, much less even the first wall.\" With that she shakes her head and turns to go back to her cell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer callous remarks anger you, and fueled with the thoughts of getting out and becoming a master wizard you grasp her leather tunic by the collar as her back is turned. Quick as a viper she whirls and jabs you in the side with one finger. A burst of ticklishness hits you and knocks you back. Stifling your giggles, you almost conjure a spark in your hand before remembering the magic-hating guards. Katira doesn't notice your magic, but she says to you, \"I admire your spirit. If you want your information you must beat me in a fighting match. Many have tried before, few have won.\" She thinks for a moment. \"There is another way...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See that balcony high up there?\" she points several stories above the yard to an imposing balcony. \"It's the private quarters of the captain of the guards.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In the private rooms of the captain of the guards there is a mirror: a gift from some official who saw how well-guarded this place was.\" Katira tells you. \"I don't care about my reflection; it contains glass from the Sands of Mystery: said to be weightless and invisible to the human and elven eye. The glass would make the perfect shiv and the other prisoners would fear my power, so I could become a powerful gang leader. I'll tell you everything about how to escape if you get me that mirror.

You try to lift it up, but it's too heavy for your boyish arms. \"Step aside, son.\" Dragonbot tells you. He murmers an incantation and the block turns transparent. It must have been an intangibility spell. \"After you, if you please.\" says the shopkeeper. You climb down a short ladder into a room below. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you reach the stone floor, Mr. Dragonbot suddenly turns the stone solid again, trapping you inside! No amount of begging and banging will open it. You're stuck down here, so you might as well look around. The hall is quite large, with rows of upright and collapsed bookshelves holding molded old books, none of which seem complete enough to read. At the end of the hall, on a stone dais, is a large black wooden coffin, with a skull etched in the front. This must be what that old trickster wanted you to look into. With nowhere else to go but forward, you walk to the coffin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs you approach a dull violet light hums from the coffin. Cautious of this, you carefully take a few more steps forward. When you step onto the stone podium the lid of the  coffin flashes brightly and disintegrates, and a figure stumbles out, hunched over. It's dressed in a maroon corset with shoulder ruffles, a shadowy black gown, and a red-studded choker. The distractingly low top reveals that the figure is obviously a woman. You are striken, and back up a bit, causing your leather shoes to clap against the stone. Her head shoots up, revealing bright orange eyes and blood-red lips set in a pale complexion. She hisses and moves incredibly quickly, grabbing you by the collar of your tunic and lifting you up against a rotting shelf. The woman smiles seductively, showing two pointed teeth for canines. She's a vampire! She whispers to you, \"Thank you for freeing me from my realm, young mortal. Soon Avara shall fear my name again: Charnelle the Ancient!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour eyes widen, for legends tell of the wicked vampiress Charnelle, and her ways of tormenting innocents. \"Now what shall I do with you, meat?\" she asks seductively. Her lips on your ear tickle, and you fidget in her unnaturally strong grasp. An unholy grin forms on her face when she sees this. \"Ticklish, fresh blood? It's been a while since I had a victim to <i>tickle</i> in my castle...\" Her grip immobilizes you while she tickles you to tears with her dark red nails, which poke and squeeze your sides. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts race through your tickle-addled brain, and you come up with an idea. With one hand you summon a glowing fireball, which you recently learned from that book you found in the store.

Arthur tells you he is heading to the library and leaves all of you.  Knight and Thorne are heading to the town guard to see if they need any mercenary work done and they too leave you. Emily says that she is going to steal stuff and leaves you alone in the town square. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou figure that the town pub will be the best place to look for work. You are about to head to the shop when you notice a large ruby sitting on one of the local shop stands. This is usually Emily department but how hard could it be?

That just leaves the \"Drunken Fiddler\" the local tavern. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt is still fairly early in the morning so when you enter the tavern, you are not surprised that it is almost deserted. The only occupants of the bar are the friendly looking bartender, the barmaid cleaning a table, and a shady looking woman sitting in the corner of the bar drinking a beer. You approach the bar tender. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Would you like anything to drink?\" he asks you<br>\r\n\"Yea would love one\" you say handing him a gold coin.

We decided to head west in search of a new life\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow exciting life\" you hear someone say behind you. You turn around and the woman who was sitting in the corner of the room is now standing behind you.

You learn that her name is Nova. She, like you, used to be in the town guard until her town was ransacked by bandits. Since then she has been doing anything to make ends meet. The more you drink, the less professional your conversation ends. The last thing you remember is dancing on the bar table, then you black out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou awaken in the morning and you......<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

You can't, however, when Nova's finger finally reaches your armpit, scratching gently. You giggle and squirm, try to crane your head to see the tickling. \"Stop tickling me!\" You gasp between giggles. \"Now, now, my tickle toy, you know I can't do that.\" Nova responds, still teasing your underarm. You tug at the ropes holding you, but it's a pointless struggle. Nova begins tickling you with her entire hand, spider tickling your sensitive flesh. Your giggles evolve into laughs as you pull at your restraints, desperate to stop your armpit from being tickled. Nova smiles, a little more crazy then genuine. Her other hand goes to your other arm, slowly stroking it's way down toward the underarm. You laugh louder, unable to stop Nova from tickling you. Both her hands are now wiggling in your armpits, sending you into hysterics. Your laughing too hard now to even beg. Nova tickles you like this for six minutes,  occasionally running her fingers to the top of your ribcage, sending a new but just as torturous sensation through your body.
