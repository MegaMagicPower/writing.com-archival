That's when a nurse comes in and covers your mom's head with sheets.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou stare at the covered body. ''I shouldn't have gone to sleep.'' You say quietly to yourself. ''I'm sorry, momma. I let you down.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou turn from the body, and walk out of the room. You roam the halls, feeling like you should be the one dead. ''I dreamed my mother into death.''You thought to yourself. ''I can't let this happen again.''<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou run out of the hospital, and out into the open road. You stand there just hoping a car will hit you. What happens?</span></div></div>",

That's impossible, no one can see the future.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How wrong you are child, long ago there was a secret society, they could see the future in their dreams.  For reasons unknown, only women have this power.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This society, what was their purpose?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At first they had no purpose, but there is a comfort in being with others like you.  They experimented with their powers, and soon, they didn't have to sleep to have visions.  <br>\r\n\"One day, they all had the same vision at the same time.  They all saw great evil prepared to rule the world.  They dedicated their lives to stopping this evil, but their vision of the evil never came to pass.  They were perplexed, for it was the first time they were wrong.\" he said<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what?  That proves that their powers failed that it never really existed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh how wrong you are.  That evil wasn't false.  It just wasn't coming as quickly as they thought.  You see, this evil comes from the Shadow World, a place in the realms of Chaos, where all fear to tread.  The Shadows were merely biding their time for an appropriate moment to attack, with the Seers, as they were soon called, always ready for an attack, they could not get through undetected.  Now that the Seers no longer believe they have power to do anything, the Shadows are coming through the barrier between our world and theirs.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What does this have to do with me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Learn to use your powers, then call to them, call to the Seers.

Yes sir, I will.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou realize that this man is working against you.  He himself said only women were Seers, so he couldn't be talking to someone asscociated with them if it was a man he as talking with.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShould you investigate, pretend you saw nothing and meet him, or never go anywhere near him again?</span></div></div>",
