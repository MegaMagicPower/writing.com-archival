            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Hello my name is Aaron Travoski, and this is my story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI was, at one point at least, a normal college kid. I was a junior with decent grades. I had a girlfriend named Jenny, nothing serious. We had gone out for about two months, and she was all right. She is the starting point for my story.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJenny was 22 and also a junior. She was really cute with long black hair and green eyes. She was about 5\u20196\u201d. You know not tall but not short either. She had a good body as well. There was good reason for having a crush on her. She was also a rather nice person, most of the time. She knew how to be forceful when it was needed, which I liked about her. I like a girl with a little bit of a backbone. Her one major flaw though was that she would hold grudges for a really long time, but many girls are like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Saturday evening at around 8pm. She and I had just finished a dinner together and were now back at her place. She works at a late-night bar on Saturday nights, so we did something together at dinnertime instead of Saturday night. She would have to leave for work in about a half hour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI had taken her to an especially good restaurant tonight. See I wanted to break up with her. I had planned on doing it during dinner but couldn\u2019t gather up the courage. She was too pleased with the expensive meal and kept on thanking me during dinner, so I couldn\u2019t break the news. There was nothing wrong with her, or so I thought at the time, it was just that I figured she wasn\u2019t right for me. You see, I wasn\u2019t ready for a serious relationship. I was young, and I wanted to meet more women first to determine what kind of girl was right for me. I needed to swim in the ocean a little longer before I dropped my anchor so to speak. She and I were at the point in which we either needed to go to the next stage in our relationship or go our separate ways, and I chose the ladder. Nothing personal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo anyways, we are in her room. We both know she had to leave in a little while, so we don\u2019t have a lot of time to talk. She clearly wants to hang out with me but knows we don\u2019t have much time. She doesn\u2019t want to kick me out of her room, but in a little while she would have to, making an awkward conversation. I had a short window to break the news to her. I sat down on a chair near the door, a perfect place to make an easy exit after I broke up with her, and she sat on her bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 that was a nice dinner. Thanks for taking me,\u201d she is trying to start a conversation. This was about the fifth time she thanked me for dinner, and each time it made it harder for me to break up with her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah, I know. I\u2019m glad you enjoyed it. Hey ahh, there\u2019s something I want to talk with you about,\u201d I began.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell, I wanted to ahh talk about umm\u2026 us,\u201d I somehow finally manage to spit out. Okay good, I think to myself. Now that I got it started, the hardest part is over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat about us?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI ahh don\u2019t think it\u2019s working out between us.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you saying?! Are you breaking up with me?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way, but\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t take this the wrong way! What do you mean don\u2019t take this the wrong way?! Answer my question: are you breaking up with me?!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a manner of speaking\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cIn a manner of speaking my ass. You\u2019re dumping me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis is not going to according plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease just hear me out,\u201d I attempt to reassure, but it doesn\u2019t work.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI bust my butt for you. Just last week I went to that stupid James Bond movie instead of a chick flick to make you happy. I\u2019m often late for work on Saturdays because I know you enjoy seeing me before you go out partying. And this is the thanks I get.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cListen. It\u2019s just that\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNo, YOU listen to me! I have done too much for you to deserve this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore I could respond, she walks over to her closet and grabs something out of it.  She pulls out what looked like a toy gun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa. Let\u2019s have a conversation here and not do anything too rash.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy now I\u2019m freaked out and am really trying to settle the situation. I get up and slowly walk towards the door just in case I need to exit quickly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe can talk about this,\u201d I state calmly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes. Let\u2019s talk about it. You\u2019re not dumping me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes I am, especially after this display right here. I don\u2019t want to date a woman who has pulled a gun on me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRight after I said that I realize that wasn\u2019t the best thing to say to someone who looks like they are about to kill you.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI said you\u2019re not dumping me. Don\u2019t make me use this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that I bolt for the door, but she shoots before I could make it. I should have known that I wouldn\u2019t have time to get away. A laser beam fires out of the gone and hits me square in the chest. Before I knew it I become extremely dizzy. For a second all I can see was light all around me, and then I see the room, but it isn\u2019t like how I saw it before. It was much bigger. I\u2019m confused. Why was everything much bigger? The dresser, which was up to my chest before, is now like a skyscraper. Then I realize why, I\u2019ve shrunken to about two inches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs I looked at my surroundings, I saw Jenny. She is so HUGE and is walking towards me. I can feel the ground shatter after every step. I rush for the door. Then I see a huge pink thing fall right in front of me. I realize it\u2019s her foot. She had caught up with me given that her size made her steps a hundred times as big as mine. I don\u2019t slow down quick enough and run smack into her foot making me fall backwards onto the floor. After a second I look up to see a gigantic Jenny towering down at me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re not leaving me any time soon.\u201d </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\u201cWhy did you do this to me?!\u201d I shout up at my girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell Aaron,\u201d she explains as she effortlessly picks me up and lifts me to her face. I\u2019m terrified as I realize how big she truly is. Her face is the size of a three-story house to me, and I fit easily unto her palm like a doll. \u201cI\u2019m saving the relationship unlike you who just gave up. I\u2019m willing to do whatever it takes to continue to save our relationship, and if forcing you to stay with me is what it takes, that\u2019s what it takes. You may not understand now, but later you\u2019ll thank me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re crazy!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n What relationship is she trying to save, I think, we were just going out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDo you really want to say that to me given your position?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer palm tips over, making me fall. I fall for what seemed like an eternity but is really about two seconds. I look down and see what appears from my perspective to be a couple hundred foot drop to my death. Luckily her other palm comes right below me, so that I land onto it instead of death. I realize that she is in complete control over me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI could do far worse to you. Now there are going to be a few rules. First you are to never insult me or say anything mean about me. As a matter of fact, you are to refer to me as Dear. Second everyone I tell you to do you must comply. If I say, \u201cJump,\u201d you say, \u201cHow high?\u201d Third you are not to leave this room without me being with you, no matter what the circumstance. Fourth is that you have no excuses for breaking any of the rules. You\u2019re not allowed to pin the blame on anyone else but yourself. Do you understand?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s, \u2018Yes Dear.\u2019\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Dear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAnd if you break any of my rules,\u201d her face comes within a few inches of me, and I gasp at her huge mouth that could have easily fit two or three of me in it at once. \u201cYou\u2019ll regret it. Do I make myself clear?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYes Dear.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGood, now you tried to break up with me, so I will have to punish you.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe walks over to her closet and got out a spool of yarn. She then grabs my right arm and ties a piece of yarn to it. I try to resist, but it\u2019s no use. My entire body strength is no match for her fingers. She clasps my entire body except for my right hand into her fist and ties a knot around me arm with her other hand. She then repeats that process with my left and both my legs, so now all four of my limbs are tied to separate pieces of yarn. She then put me down on the ground. I immediately start to run before realizing how bad of an idea that is. She just yanks one of the pieces of yarns attached to my legs, and I trip and fall over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat won\u2019t work, silly,\u201d she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI then see her take four tacks out of the closet. She places one of the tacks into the other end of the yarn that is attached to my left arm and jams it into the floor. So now I\u2019m bolted to the floor. She then pushes me over until this piece of yarn is taut, knocks me over onto my back, and holds me there with her index and middle fingers. I try to push my way out, but it\u2019s no use. It is amazing how she controls my entire body with just two fingers. Next she takes a second tack, puts it into the yarn attached to my left arm, extends the yarn so that it is taut, and anchors it into the floor. She does the same thing to the pieces of yarn attached to my legs. She then lets her two fingers off of me. Immediately I try to wiggle out but can\u2019t. The yarn was as tough as chains. With just yarn and tacks, she had pinned me down to the floor. I look up helplessly as I lie on my back. My chest is completely exposed, and each limb is stretched outwards. I see Jenny kneeling above me with an evil grin. She looks at least ten stories up, but her face still seems larger than a billboard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow Aaron, this is for your own good.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stands up, her figure much scarier now that she\u2019s the size of a skyscraper. She lifts her right foot over top of me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you going to do to me?!\u201d I shout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d With that she descends her foot on top of me. Being unable to move, I\u2019m helpless to prevent this foot from falling on top of me. I try to scream, but that is quickly muffled as her foot landed completely on top of my body. Her smell and sweat completely overwhelm me.  She\u2019d slowly add pressure until it felt like my organs were about to explode. She\u2019d then relinquish the pressure a little bit right before my body explode and start to increase it again. After about ten minutes of this torture, she finally stops. I look up gasping for air at Jenny smiling back down at me. She was clearly enjoying this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cMay you never think of dumping me again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe kneels down in front of me and lowers her face to a few inches from me. I can feel her breath like it\u2019s a windstorm. She then spits on me, covering me in her saliva. She puts a particular large amount of spit on my face drowning me. I had to try to wiggle my head to get some of it away from my mouth and nose so that I can breathe. Since I can\u2019t move my body, I had to accept that I was lying in a puddle of her saliva and let it soak into my clothes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I have to go to work now. What should I do with you while I'm gone?\" she ponders aloud. </span></div></div>",

I\u2019m temporarily blinded by this light, but after my eyes get adjusted to it, I see the form of a person walking through the doorway. This is odd, I think. Jenny wouldn\u2019t have finished work for another like five hours.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSally, we need to go,\u201d I hear a fainter voice call to this mysterious intruder. \u201cWe already late for the party, and we still have to go to the mall to buy her a gift.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHold your horses Rachel. I just need to put on some eye-liner. It\u2019ll take a second.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOh, this must be Jenny\u2019s younger sister, Sally, a 19-year old freshman at our school. Jenny always complained that Sally would come into her room and use her make-up even though she could never prove it. Jenny said she\u2019d come back and notice all her cosmetics have been moved around from how she left them and always suspected it was Sally. So she was right all along.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right but be quick about it. We have to go soon.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel the ground quake as she walks into the room. She doesn\u2019t notice me lying in the middle of the floor but is looking at the dresser ahead of her. I see her steps coming closer and closer, and it is beginning to look like she might step of me. I try to yell up to her, but that is of no use. I see her foot rise above me and wince as it lowers right over me. Does she step on me? </span></div></div>",

WHAAAM. I hit her hand head first as she encloses her hands around me to catch me. If the act of flying is bad, the impact is far worse. I am surprised I\u2019m still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel my legs being pitched, and the rest of my body flipped upside down as she dangles me by my legs. She lifts me up close to her face. She has brown hair and green eyes and an evil smile staring down at me. I try to flip my body over because it is rather uncomfortable being upside down, but since she has my legs, it doesn\u2019t work very well. I try lifting my head up to my legs to prevent a head-ache, but she just shakes me effortlessly, and my head falls back down. I can hear her laugh at my attempts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re so cute, little guy! So helpless!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan I see him now?\u201d a couple of girls ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHey Britney, give other people a turn.

I fall into this weird surface until I hit a surface that\u2019s slightly harder but still a fairly soft surface. I am completely covered in the mushy white stuff, and even though it\u2019s soft, it pinned me and prevented me from being able to move. The slightly harder surface is also whitish, more like a cream. It\u2019s flaky and bread-like, like a bakery dish. I taste a little bit of it when I realize that it\u2019s cake and that the first layer of stuff I\u2019m trapped in is the icing. I\u2019ve landed in Amy\u2019s birthday cake. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhere did he go?\u201d I heard a voice ask.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe fell into the cake.

I\u2019ll do the honors,\u201d states Amy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel the ground of cake around me jolt as she cuts out a piece where I am. I\u2019m lifted up and then tipped over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t you ever get a piece of cake onto your plate without tipping over?\u201d someone asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Amy replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI\u2019m tipped back over. I feel slices come down all around me as she eats her way around me. I fear being the next bite. Eventually I see the fork come down a few inches from my face as her cut comes amazingly close to me. She doesn\u2019t even know or care where I am or whether she cuts me by accident. If she were about a centimeter farther over, she would have cut my head off! I can now see the outside world since this cut a hole right next to my face. I try to wiggle my out of it but am still stuck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel pieces being eaten all around me and realize that I\u2019m the only \u201cpiece\u201d left. She scoops me and the cake and icing surrounding me up with her fork and puts me in her mouth. I feel myself being pushed back into her throat and try to run back to the opening. But before I could get there I see a wall of teeth come knocking down in front of me, nearly cutting me in two as she closes her mouth and traps me inside. I turn around to see her giant red tongue come clasp itself around me and push me into the side of her mouth. She chews and swallows the rest of the caking and icing, leaving only me and her enormous tongue. Her cheeks pushed me back into the middle of the mouth where her tongue was waiting for me. Before I could do anything, her tongue forced me to the top of her mouth where it proceeded to suck all the icing off of me. I\u2019m not drenched completely in her sticky saliva. My clothes, my hair, all soaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYum,\u201d I hear her murmur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tongue then lowers and I run to the front of her mouth. I try to open up her teeth, but that fails. Eventually she lets me open her teeth an inch or two only to close it moments later. I move my fingers just in time not to have them crushed by her bite. This was a warning not to mess with her teeth or try to escape her mouth again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tongue, which I was standing on, then slowly rose, making me slide backwards. I tried to run forward but slipped on her slippery, wet tongue, fell on my face, and proceeded to fall into the back of her mouth even more. Just in time before I saw fell down her throat, I grabbed hold of a bump in her tongue, probably one of her taste buds and hold on for dear life. I look back at her throat, a dark and bottomless hole ready to take me. She lifts her tongue higher and higher until I am dangling off her tongue holding onto this taste bad for dear life like a rock climber desperately grasping a hold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cPlease! Don\u2019t eat me!\u201d I cry. \u201cPlease! I\u2019ll do anything, just don\u2019t eat me!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shakes her tongue back and forth, and I barely manage to hold on. Eventually her tongue lowers, and she spits me out of her mouth. I find myself flying into her hand and look up at her laughing face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry my little pet,\u201d she cues. \u201cI won\u2019t eat you. I like you and have many plans for what to do with before that happens.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI look up in fear. That\u2019s hardly a reassurance. I can only imagine what she has in store for me before she decides to actually eat me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWho wants him next?\u201d she shouts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI hear many voices shouting, \u201cMe!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell however catches him gets him next!\u201d she says as she throws me into the air towards the group of waiting girls\u2026 </span></div></div>",

I don\u2019t really have much of a choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing to him?!\u201d I hear a voice shout from among the wall of girls. Suddenly a girl pushes herself forward.

You\u2019ll get your turn when you can do whatever \u2018humanitarian\u2019 things you want with him, but respect Ashley\u2019s turn,\u201d Amy intervenes.

It\u2019s another girl\u2019s toes, which must have grabbed me from underneath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou took too long. Your turn\u2019s up,\u201d she explains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI try to struggle as I am dragged across the rug, but it\u2019s of no use. My legs start to burn from the tension, and finally she lets go. I lay there panting too hurt to move. Soon I see a dark figure hovering above me. I realize that it\u2019s her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou had better move quickly.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe foot began to come down on top of me. Suddenly my animal instinct rushes in, and my tiredness temporarily subsides. I manage to roll out from underneath just in time to avoid the foot from crashing down on top of me. I get up and begin to run away from this killing machine in a desperate attempt for some peace. But before I run more than about twenty feet, I feel a rush of air as her second foot comes crashing down a few inches in front of me. I don\u2019t have time to stop as I crash into the pink sticky surface and become stuck to the side of her foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to kill him!\u201d Emily screeches. I couldn\u2019t see her because my face was plastered to this girl\u2019s foot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYeah Chelsea, be a little more careful with him. We want him alive so that the rest of us can play with him,\u201d Amy reprehends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they are talking I try to wiggle off of her foot but can\u2019t. The smell is unbearable. I try to hold my breath to prevent it, but I can\u2019t hold it very long and get a stronger whiff of it once I have to catch my breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I guess I got a little carried away. But look! He\u2019s stuck to my feet! I can feel him trying to wiggle his way out,\u201d Chelsea responds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe lifts me and her foot high into the air. I realize that it might not be the best idea to try to free myself from her foot since I\u2019d fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI thought so little man. You don\u2019t want to leave my nice sweet feet,\u201d she plays. \u201cBut you\u2019ll have to get off eventually. I know the longer you stay there, the harder it\u2019ll be for you to want to depart from them, so I\u2019ll have to cut you off now.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhy couldn\u2019t you do it while I was on the ground, I think to myself, but I guess that would defeat her fun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI feel something scratch my back from behind me, and I realize that it is her big toe from her other foot, prying me off. This is quite possibly the most inefficient way of getting me off. Her toe can\u2019t grab me properly but can only rip and scratch me off. I\u2019m sure she picked this method just to torture me.  Each scratch delivers excruciating pain to my back but only causes a little bit of my front side to rip off her, which feels like ripping off a band aid except across the entire body. Eventually I fall off and land head first onto the rug. I smack against the ground. My body can barely move. I feel hurt all over from being scratched, ripped, and dropped. To make matters worse, the pains of dropped the first time and being dragged revisit me as well like a bad family reunion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor a moment or two I close my eyes and just lay there, hoping this is all a dream and that there\u2019d be an end soon. I try to forget about everything, my bleeding legs, the cuts on my back, the cuts on my front, my head-ache, my hurt shoulder, and remember when life was good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen I open my eyes to see several dozen eyes beaming back down at me and remember the hell I am in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou guys are such barbarians!\u201d protests Emily. \u201cLook at him down there! You\u2019re about to kill him.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised what a body is able to sustain, even a small one like his,\u201d Amy replies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell even if you don\u2019t kill him, how would you like to be squeezed, almost eaten, dropped, crushed, or smashed against a foot?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHe loves it! Don\u2019t you Tiny Tim?\u201d Amy teases. Before I can answer, she pokes me in the stomach with her index finger to force a smile out of me. \u201cSee.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s hardly proof\u2026\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh be quiet you dork. You\u2019re lucky to even be invited to this party. I only did so out of charity.

I fall flat onto my head, and the room again erupts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWe never said to stop dancing,\u201d Rebecca scolds, so I continue. Pretty soon all the girls are getting in on this idea, and I am knocked onto the ground before I have time to get back up. This happens for about five or so minutes until eventually I fall off the coffee table. Unbeknownst to me, each fall moved me a few feet backwards until I was on the edge of the coffee table.

She grabs me, pulls out some string, and grabs an empty bottle of soda from the dining room table that was left over from dinner. She presses my back around the bottle and ties to it, so that I can\u2019t move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s play Spin the Bottle. Here\u2019s the rule: whoever it points to gets to give him a kiss.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the girls form a circle around the dining room table and place me and the bottle in the center.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere goes\u2026\u201d, and Amy gives me a spin. I scream as I am twirled around and around. I try to close my eyes, but that doesn\u2019t help much. I\u2019ve always gotten dizzy easily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually the bottle stops. I can\u2019t see who it\u2019s facing since I can\u2019t turn my head, but I am lifted up. I am brought near the face of Sally who gives me a nice peck on the face. It would have been a nice, gentle kiss, but because of my size and inability to defend myself on account of being tied down, my face is slammed between her red lips in front of me and the bottle behind me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cCome on. You can do better than that,\u201d the other girls comment. \u201cReally give it to him.\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSally then moves her lips in for another try. This time she kisses with twice the force. Her lips form a suction that literally sucks the air out of my lungs. I can hardly breathe as her lips press against my body and push me into the bottle. Next she rubs her lips up and down against my pinned body. Her lips depart leaving my face red and gasping for air. She kisses better than her sister or maybe that was just due to my size.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s more like it,\u201d the other girls say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI am spun again and again. Each time I get dizzier and dizzier, and the girls kiss harder and harder. Many used their tongue for a French kiss. They would lick my face, neck, chest, and sometimes lower, covering me in saliva. Sometimes they would solve my face into their mouths as part of \u201cthe kiss\u201d and play with my head with their tongue, pushing me head up and down as it\u2019s forced either into the tongues or into the roof of their mouths. This proceeds for at least half an hour until I am extremely dizzy over the spinning and can hardly breathe. Each girl tries to outdo the others before her, making each kiss more and more painful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a several turns, I am spun.  They must have twirled me extra-fast this time for it felt like I was spinning for twice as long as I usually do. I can barely handle the dizziness. My face would have been blue and green by now if it hadn\u2019t been covered in red lipstick. I can\u2019t even tell when I stop spinning because my brain was still rotating several seconds after it. I stop at Amy. That isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve gotten her but it\u2019ll be a turn we\u2019ll both remember. She scoops me up and brings me to her face. I am completely disoriented and close my eyes hoping to get this over with. She licks her lips to get herself ready. Before I know it, I\u2019m plunged in. She presses her soft against my face, neck, and chest and takes out her tongue. She rubs me over and over slowly and then drops my head into her mouth. The rest of my body is still outside tied down to the bottle. Inside she rubs my head with her moist tongue. I can hardly breathe as her tongue covers my face over and over. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that kiss, every girl sticks me in their mouths during their kiss. This goes on for about a half hour until I am tired, dizzy, barely able to breathe, and covered in saliva and lipstick residue. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy finally announces that it's time to stop playing Spin the Bottle. Is this really the last game or does she want to play another?</span></div></div>",

She carries me up to her room with her right hand and grabs the shoe box I came in with her left. The rest of the girls go about to the bathroom and such to change and brush their teeth. I notice that a couple of the girls are following Amy and me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cNow I don\u2019t want you to sleep with us in the living room because you might get squashed by accident in the middle of the night,\u201d she explains, half as if she was thinking out loud.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe brings you into her room. It isn\u2019t a bad looking room: it had white walls, a bed covered with blue sheets, and a dark gray rug. The bed is against the wall in the far corner and next to it is a large dresser on it is a desk lamp and a few other things I can\u2019t see very well from my angle. At the other end of the room, there is a desk with a computer, books, and unorganized papers, presumably where she did homework. In the corner between the bed and desk, there is a bean bag chair. The walls are covered in posters, but I do not have time to look at them very well. It looks like a normal college room. I wouldn\u2019t have thought such a crazy girl lived here. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAmy sits down on her bed, opens up the shoe box, and places me in. She leaves for about ten seconds and comes back with a wash cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cHere you go little one. This will be your bed.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe folds the wash cloth into fours so that it\u2019s the shape of a mattress and puts in the box right next to me.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSweet dreams, and I\u2019ll see you in the morning,\u201d she coos, and she blows me a kiss, which nearly knocks me over. \u201cYou are just so cute!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closes the box, and I hear tape being wrapped around it. She\u2019s taping me in! That prevents any escape I had planned. She then places me on her dresser and walks out of the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cAll right girls, time for bed!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere is a little bit of noise downstairs, but eventually things start to quiet down. I am exhausted and just fall over onto my \u201cbed.\u201d I could barely stand up I am so tired. In about two seconds, I\u2019m fast asleep despite the fact that the wash cloth isn\u2019t particularly comfortable. </span></div></div>",

I stammer to my feet from the drop. I never really got a good look at her before, but with the light, I can see her rather well. She has black, curly hair down to about her shoulders. She has a nice, attractive, slender face. She is wearing a blue pajama shorts and a matching bra. I stand on her waist-level. She moves her leg an inch to the left, which completely shifts the fabric I am standing on and causes me to trip and fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cSo fragile, I barely even moved,\u201d she giggles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe moves her right leg, which causes me to tumble on my face.

She lifts her legs up making me fall forward onto her stomach. She places her legs onto the bed and slants them so that I can\u2019t climb up them. In front of me, I see a plain that\u2019s her stomach ended by two gigantic mounds. Behind that I can see her face with a malicious smile on it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh, what should I do with you?\u201d Her question causes her stomach to rise and then suddenly it falls. Not used to sudden change in the ground I\u2019m standing on, I tumble over. Before I can get up, I\u2019m launched upwards as her inhale jolts her stomach back up. I fly upward a few inches, about five or six feet from my perspective and fall back onto her stomach, only to be launched again by her inhale. She laughs at my predicament, which causes me to be launched even higher. After the fourth or fifth launch, I try to land on my feet, but when I hit the cushy surface of her stomach, I lose my balance and fly forward into one of the gigantic mountains in front of me.  I land face first into in and bounce back landing on my butt. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does she decide to do with you?</span></div></div>",

        "description":"<td align=\"left\" class=\"norm\">This was a story I wrote a while ago for another website. I wanted to see what other potential ideas and directions for this story were out there, so I'm making it an interactive story. That way others who have better ideas than me can contribute as well. More heads are better than one (either that or they'll just cause a big headache, but that's a risk I'm willing to take). Because this was initially a story I wrote, the first option will be my initial telling of the story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere is the premise of the story: The narrator is Aaron (1st person) , a college student, who dumps his girlfriend Jenny. She avenges him by shrinking him, and the rest is up to you... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHere are some ground rules: <br>\r\n1) Don't write in the series of first chains as they are reserved for me. By that I mean the \"1,\" \"11,\" \"111,\" etc. If you do write it, I'll delete (though I'll try to copy it to another area if I can). <br>\r\n2) It's narrated 1st person by Aaron. (If Aaron dies, change narrator but keep it 1st person). I want him to be the primary narrator. You can change narrators briefly but then switch back. <br>\r\n3) No sex nor nudity nor toilet. This is rated PG-13 for a reason. I'll allow breasts but nothing below the belt.<br>\r\n4) No male interactions (You can have a male bring a shrunken individual to a female, but keep the male interaction very brief, no more than a few sentences. Dont' dwell on it.)<br>\r\n5) No short and pointless posts. The more description the better. I'll delete them if they are too short and non-descriptive. Make it at least a few sentences.<br>\r\n6) Good grammar is preferable. Not to say, I'll hound you for having a slight mistake, but a post with so many misspelled words that you can't read it is confusing. Also use punctuation. I've seen many posts that don't end sentences with periods or put quotations around dialogue. It's hard to read. I don't want to sound like a perfectionist, but these things exist so that the reader can read it easily. A dialogue is hard to understand when you don't specify what's dialogue or when someone's finished talking and another begins.<br>\r\n7) Write in paragraphs. This may seem like an odd rule, but I've seen too many posts in various Interactives write the whole thing as only long paragraph. It's incredibly hard to read as it is hard on the eyes. USE WHITE SPACE! It exists for a reason. Otherwise, readers have trouble following it. When you have dialogue, try to make every new statement it's own paragraph. That makes it easier to read.<br>\r\n8) Don't be afraid to kill off the main character, but don't do it excessively. But also don't be too unrealistic in what he survives. I've seen so many stories that have the person survive completely obscene falls, crushes, etc., and it's often silly. Also make sure to have at least 2 options for each post you make. In interactives the point is to have options, so don't force the reader to go a certain path too often.<br>\r\n9) I prefer humiliation, feet, vore, mouth play, crush, slave, and entrapment, but you don't have to follow my preferences. Make your posts your own.9</td>",
