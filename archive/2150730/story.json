Granted, the man had a knack for keeping himself fairly well-occupied with his little experiments, but his supplies were short, and the Foundation's patience for him was even shorter, leaving to many of his submitted requests for new materials ignored. He ended up, that afternoon, laying on his bed, staring up at the ceiling with one hand over his head, the other sprawled along his stomach. He groaned in irritation, sitting up and pouting slightly. God, the facility had softened him up too much. He'd arrived as rigid and cold as ever, but now here he was, pouting like a small child. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he was done chastising himself, he got up and began pacing, rummaging for anything solid in the loose, scattered scrapyard of ideas in his mind. <i>Anything,</i> really. He just needed something to do before he ended up going stir crazy in that hum drum bore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe sat back down on the bed, glancing at his desk and pulling his notebook over. It was new, and it looked quite dull, but at least the Foundation had been so... Generous as to provide him with something he could jot down notes in. Flicking through the pages, he caught something interesting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere, on one of the first pages, was a little idea he'd been kicking around for a while now, but one that he didn't necessarily have much confidence in. He had grown curious in regards to the human figure as of late. Most notably, the human stomach. It was a bit morbid, but briefly, 049 became vaguely interested in the limits of such an organ. How far could it be stretched with added chemicals and mixtures? He had just enough in his room to work with that he could certainly come up with something. Although the interest in such a thing had waned greatly not long after the notes on it were jotted down, 049 couldn't help but feel a certain... Spark within him. The idea suddenly seemed appealing to him once more...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, he'd need a subject for such an experiment, which presented a notable issue. He had none. Of course, there was always himself, but that was ludicrous! Right..?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe thought bounced back and forth in 049's brain before settling reluctantly. He'd have to use himself as a subject if he wanted to make any progress with his idea. Sighing, he swallowed his pride, kissed his lithe figure goodbye, and got to work. First thing was first, what about his belly would he alter..?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The idea was silly at first. Hungrier? That wouldn't necessarily test its limits, would it? It would still rupture at a certain point even if he forced every single bite of food down his gullet until that point. More thinking began to change that outlook, however. What if someone's hunger and someone's capacity were linked? The results of this experiment would most likely be a bit skewed due to his own... Unorthodox genetic makeup, but he had to work with what he had. Going off of this line of logic, 049 got to work quickly before he began to doubt it too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a few hours of trial and error, pumping his syringes full of different concoctions and looking them over, over and over. Eventually, however, 049 came up with something he deemed... Promising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the syringe that would hopefully lead him to success was bright green liquid, like some kind of ooze one would see in a cartoon show. After some brief testing to make sure there were no air bubbles, 049 nodded in approval, and proceeded to inject the mixture into his stomach. He winced slightly, much to his surprise. He'd never actually <i>felt</i> the needles he'd used time and time again. Going off of this one's example, they actually hurt much more than he was expecting. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen the syringe was empty, 049 disposed of it, jotting down the formula he'd used to make it in his notebook and laying back down on his bed. All he could really do now was wait... Hopefully, it wouldn't take too long to kick i-<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>gggwwrrrrgle...</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n049's eyes went slightly wide, and he looked at his stomach. It rumbled again, and he quickly began to realize just how effective that mixture had been... He needed food, <b>now.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was the next problem, however. One he had foolishly decided to overlook until it was too late. How the Hell was he going to get a scrap to eat, let alone enough to actually have viable experiment results?</span></div></div>",
