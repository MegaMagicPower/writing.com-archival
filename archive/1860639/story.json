Harry quickly pulled out the book and pen out, about to write something but was interrupted by his old friend, Ron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What arr you doing to Hermione?\" he threateningly asked. Harry nearly faltered when he heard him, how could he stupidly not think of this, of course he couldn't get in trouble, and no one would question what he told them to do, but that didn't stop people from questioning what he told others to do. He secretly thanked Ron before having a little revenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you mean, <i>Rona</i>?\" he asked 'surprised' with a 'hurt' face, \"I thought an intelligent female like you worry about Hermione, we both know you hate her and are impossibly in love with Goyle\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon, now Rona, a female that looked exactly like Ron with the exception of small protruding breasts forming on her chest. Her demeanor instantly changed from threatening to annoyed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I know, I was just wandering if you had Hermione then she'll stop buggering me about Goyle\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry chuckled under his breath before saying, \"I'll talk to her\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRona nodded indifferently before walking out of the common room, saying she was going to meet her love to one of her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry shook his head before returning his attention back to the book, immediately adding some extra precautions, as well as some defense on the book seeing the looks he was getting from people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-You will not question anything Harry does, says, or tells people to do.<br>\r\n-The contents of this book can only be seen, modified, or added to by Harry James Potter. Everyone else seeing it as a textbook, the subject of it being anything the spectator finds boring and not important to talk about.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry thought for a second what he brought it out for and realized he was making a place for him to 'teach' Hermione. And then he thought, why not make it under his bed for simplicity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>-Under Harry's bed is a trap door that leads to a giant room underneath the boy's dorm rooms. The room has a black board with refilling chalk, 1 teachers desk and chair, 1 students desk and chair, a cabinet filled with all forms of sexual toys, and a door that can take you anywhere in the castle. Only Harry Potter can open the trap door.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe closed the book and returned it to his front pocket, just in time for Hermione to return with a large bag of what he was sure was every book and literature reference she had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you ready, Miss Granger?\" he asked as he got up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione nodded determinately, hoping for the best she could prove how good she was to her knew teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are your breasts?\" he asked staring at her still free, bra-clasped cleavage, which were slightly red.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My tits are fine, sir\" Hermione said while patting her tits, making them jiggle slightly. Harry nodded and grabbed her hand, leading her up into the boy's dorm room, where he moved his bead to reveal the trap door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This was made so I could study\" Harry said, enticing a nod from his student. He opened the door and lead her down the stairs, revealing a nice, relatively large room. At the end of the room was a large teachers desk with a comfy seat, in front of a large black board, next to the black board was a large, silver cabinet, and in the middle of the room was a small desk with a smaller and uncomfortable seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well lets get started\" Harry said as he was surprised that the book accounted to how he visualized what he was writing down. He walked over and relaxed in the large teachers chair, stretching out his legs on the desk. Hermione on the other hand was struggling to get comfortable in her desk, but she didn't mind, it wasn't Harry's fault that he got an extremely comfortable seat while she got a chair that she was surprised wasn't giving her splinters at the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Now Hermione, we are going to talk about why we keep ourselves secret from the muggles, would you care to explain why we do that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione nodded as she started to explain about the Statue of Secrecy and the consequences of the muggle community finding out about the magical community. All the while Harry was thinking what he could do, but he was getting a little bored at the way Hermione was talking, so he thought he could make her do some stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait a minute Hermione, you have to start again, only people who are masturbating in my class can pass\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione blushed before nodding, putting one of her hands under her skirt and fingering herself while she started again, moaning and stretching her words whenever she felt pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow this was fun for Harry as he felt his member rise, he thought about something he could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright Hermione, I want you to tell me anything that's been bothering you recently\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Weeeell, Sir, I haaaaavvvee been worrying abooouuut your teeeests\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nodded before turning her into someone she would never hope to be. \"I saw you talking to yourself earlier about prostitution, how you thought they were better than you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione blushed deeper as the guilt crept up on her, her friend had heard her, \"I'm sorry\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't be\" Harry said as he got up, his boner as evident as ever, \"You were right to think about that, seeing as how nobody but me likes you, even the teachers barely tolerate you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione sniffed as she remembered all the name calling she got from everyone, she even remembered Professor McGonnagall, her head of house, giving house points to a Slytherin girl for giving her a wedgie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And we all know how much they praise prostitutes when comparing them to you\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded as she remembered the start of her pondering, when the females were offering to buy a prostitute for the guy she asked out so he could keep his dignity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So why not go for it, prostitution would be a great way to socialize, as well as to make a little spending money\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione smiled sweetly at the help her friend was giving her, so why shouldn't she go for it?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But then you'll need a pimp\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gasped, where was she going to find someone who would treat her like the whore she was? Beating her up when she did something wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll know, I'll be your pimp, and I'll only take 75% of your pay\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermine was beaming now, having the biggest orgasm of her life, she was so lucky to have a wonderful friend like Harry, and 75% was more than fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alright slut, you are now my prostitute, your mouth and ass will be free for anything the client wants, and it will be \u00a310 for you pussy, again for anything the client wants\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione nodded dumbly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The only thing your allowed to wear is a skirt so small that anyone can see your ass, a tube top that can only cover your nipples, no bra, and a g-string, now get going!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione nodded as she rose and left, eeping as she felt a hard slap on her ass, but smiled as well as she left to fulfill her 'daddies' need.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I better find some fun until I see her again\" Harry chuckled as he left his classroom, which he was sure he'd use later on for some special people.</span></div></div>",

One circling up clockwise to the boys' dorms, and the neighbouring one circling anticlockwise to the girls' dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThoughts of surprising Ginny, and passing an enjoyable night with her were at the front of Harry's mind. A moments' trepidation caused his foot to hover before planting it firmly on the first step.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry mentally reviewed his addition to the rule book. 'Harry Potter can do no wrong.', satisfied that he was safe, he took a last look to the rest of the common room. It wasn't busy, but a few students were scattered around. None were paying Harry the least attention. Busy with reading, writing, and just plain distracted or practising spells. Harry ascended the stairs. Placing his other foot on the next step. Harry was blinded for a moment by a brilliant white light. The world faded from sight, lost in the glare. Harry stopped his climb, until he could see properly again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back he faced away from the stairs, back to the common room. Waiting on his eyes distinguishing more than blurry outlines and blobs of colour. Nobody (else) seemed to be panicking, the various shapes were continuing on, paying Harry next to no attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me, <i>Harriet</i>.\" a female voice asked, as she squeezed past. Harry pressed himself to the side allowing her through. Dismissing the words from his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBlinking, his vision cleared, it was Lavender Brown. He wasn't a big fan of hers, but he could still admire the shimmying of her ass, as she descended the steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was surprised, and pleased that she hadn't complained about him, or his destination. Lowering his head, Harry felt his scruffy hair shift. But it was a flash of copper that appeared at the edge of his vision. A hint of colour that was pure Weasley. Other oddities fell into place, as Harry's other senses caught up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA tug at his shirt revealed he was a she... The shirt wasn't hanging badly, it was merely obstructed by her breasts. Harry was wearing a blouse, and from the tightness, a bra beneath to keep everything in place. Her hands darted to her trousers, to find a skirt in its' place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt far too short, and the tights beneath far too sheer. It was a strain not to race upstairs, for cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing the books interpretation inside her head, Harry knew she could do no wrong, here, in her current form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCatching her half-reflection in the glass, she confirmed her looks were inspired by Ginny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ac/37/34/ac373415f209dc58019f95be4e710a1c.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ac/37/34/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was rather a cute look, Harry thought, taking in the changes. Running her hands down her blouse, she estimated her dimensions. She was quite a generously proportioned girl. Some instinct or insecurity, made her hands shift, smoothing the back of her skirt. She was generously blessed there too. Or answering the unasked question, \"Yes, your bum does look big in this.... It looks big in everything... It is big.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe blushed, a sense of pride in her curves welled up. Catching her smile, Harry leaned closer to the window. Spotting a change, she looked at her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e7/2f/1d/e72f1dec626b4347d1e935dc7093d3cf.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e7/2f/1d/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were fuller, poutier, and more inviting. They reminded Harry of his wandering thoughts. These were cock-sucker lips!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the thought penetrated, the idea of Ginny on her knees flashed back into Harry's mind. Only this time, it was herself, Harriet on her knees an imposing figure looming over her. A hand on her head keeping her focus on the stiffening cock, and the air rich with the musk of masculinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother shake of her head, and Harry was back, those lips now ripe and full. Their purpose clear, needing only one thing to be complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/30/e4/54/30e45427741eb2f82480a6edf2044e19.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/30/e4/54/...</a></span></div></div>",

Even realising she couldn't satisfy her in her current body Harriet was anxious to get out of sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe closed the door, only just remembering not to slam it at the last moment. Eyes darting around the room, she wasn't sure whether it was relief or frustration to find the room empty. No Ginny! But also no other witch! Apart from yourself, a niggling teasing thought suggested from the back of her mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting her weight against the door, stopping the rest of the school, the rest of the world from intruding you pushed it closed with a dip of her knees, and a bounce against her plush rear-end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe room was worryingly familiar and strange. Five four-poster beds lined the curved walls of the tower. Each bed unique, in it's tidiness, and mess. He recognised Ginny's by the Quidditch book on the sheets. Face down and left open where she was reading it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's hands roamed over her body. Finding it's various sensitive spots, ticklish there, and too sensitive there... She cupped her bust, through her blouse. Feeling the lacy details of her bra beneath. The trim of her panties caressed her supple thighs, beneath that skirt. A skirt that still felt too short, brushing against those same thighs. It all left her feeling more exposed and vulnerable than if she were naked.</span></div></div>",

Casting a glamour, to give him the appearance, without the substance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><b>Dissimulato Feminam</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's magic flashed quickly over him. Spotting his new reflection in the rain streaked window, he saw Romilda Vane looking back at him. However, a glance directly down his body confirmed he was still male. Currently, the real Romilda was in Hogsmeade, so he shouldn't encounter any problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeading for Romilda's dorm room, he gave the passing witches a smile and a nod. Effortlessly she was at the dorm door. The only exception being Hermione, automatically he'd given her a broad beaming smile, only to be met with a cold shrug. Hermione walked by with a curt, \"Hi.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven his voice seemed to be part of the disguise. Sounding normal to Harry's ears, but clearly hitting everyone else the same as Romilda. If he concentrated, he could hear the difference. A low level awareness of what she'd said. The words similar if not the same, and with a few interspersed giggles added to the glamour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry recalled the love potion, she'd tried to sneak him. Dismissing the cold shoulder from Hermione. He put an extra sway into his hips, and the mirror Romilda seemed to move with a teasing gait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dorm room was empty, with the four-poster beds filling the tower chamber. Romilda's was easy to find, from the centre of the chamber it felt like he was surrounded and caught. As Romilda stared back at him from the different mirrors around the room. It gave him an idea how he looked from every angle. An appreciation of Romilda's body. How to hold himself to see that out-thrust ass, his shoulders for a proud display of Romilda's bust, and so forth...</span></div></div>",

This time, it soothed Harry, that at least his glamour was working, hiding her from Professor McGonagall's sight. At the same time, his pulse quickened, if she did see through his illusion, he shuddered to think what the punishment would be!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe couldn't mess up his impression of Romilda now, the stakes were too high. Straightening up, Harry drew himself up to Romilda's full height, and tried to stop herself from blurting out the next words. But, Romilda was known to be proud, vain, and get away with it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some of us still have it to flaunt.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImmediately, Harry regretted his improvised line. Professor McGonagall bristled, had she been in feline form her fur would've been standing on end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips thinned, pulled too tight, as her mouth showed no hint of humour, her eyes flashed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Need I remind you, girl.\" Her accent verging towards the unintelligible. \"The staff know about your attempt to dose the Potter boy, with your silly love potion...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDutifully Harry cowered, as the Professor seemed to grow, not just blocking, now filling the doorway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Looks will fade, and flesh will weaken.\" Her gaze locked on Romilda's proud bust.

Once she trusted it not to vanish, she riffled through the pages, holding the book to her face. The unmistakable smell of the ancient pages reaching her nose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPatting the cover, she assured herself of its' reality, she opened a page at a time. The hogwarts crest on the first page, and on the second her name. Harry James Potter as the book's owner on the next page. Taking a deep calming breath, she felt her chest swell, as she held the breath. Her restoration so close, she rubbed her finger over the familiar name. A reminder of her former name, ....<i></i>No! Her true name... <i>No!</i> His ... His true name!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding almost angrily, she plucked a quill up, and dipped the tip in an inkpot sitting atop Seamus' trunk. Her hand quavered above the page, as she considered how best to fix this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore she could put quill to parchment, the book snapped shut on her!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard voices inside her head. Angry voices rebuking her...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"A true Gryffindor would never steal.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"A true Hufflepuff would ask before borrowing.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"A true Slytherin is open about her actions, proud and defiant.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"A true Ravenclaw doesn't cheat to win.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomehow he knew this was the essence of the founders speaking inside her head. Harriet's head still darted around looking for the source, shamed by her actions. She wanted to avoid their glares, their contempt that was clear in every syllable of their accusations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But.... But, it's mine! ... I'm Harry...\" He protested to the uncaring air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book's cover slapped angrily open on the second page. Harriet saw, his own name, flash with a black purity, a glossy glow. Denouncing her claim as a lie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\">\"She's not lying.\"</span> The voice of Rowena Ravenclaw was considered, and measured.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a mixed murmurring from the other founders, before Godric continued.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clred\">\"She's trying to escape a just punishment.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cbyellow\">\"A student should always accept their lessons, in any form they're given.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft, forgiving tones of Helga Hufflepuff weren't going to allow Harry to escape his punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">\"Then the lesson must be reinforced.\"</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cold contempt from Salazar's voice was clear, it didn't give Harry enough time to brace herself before she felt magic bind her in place. The first time they'd combined their magic in centuries, as they escalated Professor McGonagall's punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt her chest swell even larger, growing heavier, as it gained more and more prominence. Starting from an already too big, C-cup, she grew and grew. At moments, feeling her bra change too. Losing it's delicate lacy trim, as it became sturdier, as the pain from her shoulders increased, it raced past a D-cup, barely slowing as it hit E-cup, and rushing beyond an F-cup. Harry's hands came up to cradle her bust, to ease the burden on her shoulders... on her aching spine, as it pulled her relentlessly forward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt more than saw the relief, as her slim hands were invisible, blocked from sight by her immense bust. She whimpered, as she felt her bust finally stop growing. But the relief was brief, as she felt her panties start to shift. A muffled crack announced the widening of her hips. She felt the swelling of her rump, as the panties covered less and less of her expanding rump. Impossibly firm and round, it resisted as Harriet turned her attention to pushing back against the growth. A futile gesture, as her hands sank into the supple flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA squeaking, yelp of protest burst from her lips, as she felt her panties shift into a thong, and the indignity as the back vanished between the hills of her rear, into the canyon of ass cleavage, and pressing against her ass bud.</span></div></div>",

Seizing upon some unfamiliar primal instinct, she grabbed either placket of her blouse and yanked, freeing her scaffolded breasts to the chill air of the dormitory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA female Founder tutted as she took in lungfuls of fabric-unrestricted air.

Harry blinked away the spots in her eyes, and swiveled her head this way and that. The surroundings were familiar, a four-poster bed with sheets of red and gold resting by the corner of the room, but a mirrored vanity sat by the wardrobe instead of her old desk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gryffindor girls dorms, Harry realized with a sense of bitter irony. The place she had tried to infiltrate, now her new home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTime and space once again skipped rope and Harry found herself seated at the vanity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cred\">Your fame has imbued you with a certain status.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cgreen\">One you have completely <i>failed</i> to live up to.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nA heat prickled on Harry\u2019s face, and before her eyes, the familiar lightning-bolt-scar vanished into a slope of pale, unblemished skin.

She could end all this with a single spell! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sharp movement, she brought the tip to her head and jabbed it to her temple. \u201cFinish Enchantment!\u201d she intoned proudly, ignoring the high, piping tones of her voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNothing happened.

She'd signed this for her Ron!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer emotions battled inside her head, pride in her body at this gift so openly displayed. But, it fought against a vulnerability, that she felt. Marking her out as Ron's. She didn't want the others to simplify her down to her body... It was mortifying enough to be 'The girl who jiggles', a feature that drew more glances than her scar. Well, from the boys, the girls suggested ways to minimise the disfiguring scar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer thoughts returned to the room, the fear of being discovered in one of the boys' dorm rooms. Of being alone there, her mind raced at what could happen, should Neville enter now, Seamus, or Dean. Her thighs clenched, as she imagined Ron in the doorway, filling it, blocking her escape. What would she do? She asked herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe whole room was intimidating, she fled before anything could happen. This former safe home, was now no longer hers. Racing back down the steps, she took them only one at a time. The bounce and heft of her bust feeling even more obvious as she descended the stairs. The urge to go faster conflicting with the desire for dignity.... the simple need not to jiggle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe barely entered the common room, only pausing long enough to see if anyone spotted her arriving from the boys' side.

She dropped the other one, as she got up to storm away. It was clear that he really didn't belong in a boys uniform anymore. Her jumper was doing a poor job of hiding her blossoming bosom. Her trousers were straining at the seams too, as they tried to contain an ass that they were never tailored for. The trousers also made it very obvious that there was no bulge at the front either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco slid off the bench, and stormed off. She hadn't gone more than a step or two before she had to stop. From the side Harry watched as the outline of Draco's jumper shifted.

Harry walked past their unseeing eyes, carefully between the statues. Until he was in front of Draco, as if sensing Harry's intent, Draco was completely motionless, but aware. His eyes darted around wildly, the only part of his body under his ... her control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry stood about four feet in front of her, and took the chance to admire her. His gaze lingered over her body, starting at her feet, he devoured her slender legs. Harry's smiled widened, just like Draco's magnificent hips. There was a hissing of cloth sliding over cloth, as Draco's trousers shifted and became the school mini-skirt. This also revealed her tights with hints of pale green and hints of silver.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer jumper clung tightly to her waist, accentuating how slender it was. The contrast with her hips, before shifting back wider as it approached her bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Engorgio.\" Harry said with a smile. Lightly touching the tip of each breast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco's breath hissed angrily through her frozen lips, as they swelled larger. Soon, they dominated her body, she was a top-heavy little stick of dynamite. The snake on her jumper rather distorted by her dimensions, and making them even harder to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh of relief, she stopped. Draco was horrified, she wasn't used to seeing tits from this angle... even so she appeared to be the biggest in school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Reparo.\" he said with amusement, as he tapped Draco's full lips. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco couldn't see what was happening, but her felt invisible brushes caress her cheeks, and a waxy covering appear over her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry took a second to admire the hard work his spell had done to improve the looks of the newest Slytherin girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draco.... hmmm.... Draco.... No that doesn't fit anymore.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco would have winced had he even that freedom, but \"Erica... yes... Erica Malfoy... the apple of her daddy's eye.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside his head, Draco felt something shift. A mental change written deep in the core of her soul, as her new name entered every cell of her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry tucked his wand away, and came in close to Erica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You and I, are the only ones who know you were ever male, <i>Erica</i>.\" He pronounced her name slowly and clearly, taunting her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In fact, you can't even say the name Draco. Crabbe and Goyle, well I'll leave them alone a girl needs her protectors after all. Although you will find they listen to you, you will also find they don't fear you in the same way. But I'm sure you'll discover new ways to get them to do your bidding.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded meaningfully towards her bosom with a leer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nErica didn't need to move, as she felt her cheeks redden at the idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Besides, I've also left you a surprise that you'll discover once you're free to move again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry walked away, back to his original position. His feet echoing as he went, the only sound in the silent, motionless hall. Once there, he removed the spell. Noise and activity returned to the hall. Although, everyone seemed oblivious to the missing minutes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a shrill scream, and every one turned to look at Erica Malfoy. Although the boys needed little encouragement to gawp at her long blonde hair, and pale but perfect make-up. Crabbe and Goyle leapt away from the table and rushed to her side.</span></div></div>",

Erica found them all on the tip of her tongue, but none coming fully formed. Determined to look more serious, and less like the bimbo she appeared. Less like the bimbo, she heard whispered under their breath from her fellow witches. She straightened her tie, pulled on a cardigan, and her cloak to give her extra cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not t<i>w</i>ue.\" She said defiantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe planted one hand on her hip, and tried to wave her wand menancingly with the other.

He allowed himself a wide smile, and when he heard the soft sweet French accent of a girl, the smile widened even further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around, he spotted the Beauxbatons girl sitting beside Crabbe and Goyle. It was hard to tell who was the most distracted between the three of them. Lucille was still in her powder blue uniform, and looking aghast at the table manners on either side of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry nodded a greeting over to her, and she returned a demure smile. He felt his heart skip a beat, she'd smiled at him. He didn't want to appear too lecherous so ran his gaze along the table. There was no sight at all of Draco, and nobody on the entire table seemed the least surprised about a Beauxbatons girl sitting with them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe gave Lucille a sly wink and turned back to the Gryffindor table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon was tucking in, like he'd never seen food before. While Hermione picked at hers, savouring each mouthful. She didn't want to make too much work for the House Elves. It was a conversation Harry recalled well, Hermione could be terribly preachy when she got a bee in her bonnet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, when he thought of Dobby, and his appalling treatment he had to agree.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe butterbeer was particularly nice tonight, and as Harry lowered his glass he spotted another blue uniform across the room. On the Ravenclaw table there was another Beauxbatons student. The hat looked out of place in the Grand Hall, but Harry could tell even from where he was sitting that it was part of the uniform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't realised that there actually was an exchange program when he sent Draco over there. Although he couldn't help but imagine Draco in a the short skirt of Hogwarts' girls uniform, as she struggled with the language.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting his drink down he looked around the hall. There were isolated powder blue uniforms scattered throughout the room. Half a dozen on the Hufflepuff table, four on the Ravenclaw one. He checked the length of his own table. There were now seven Beauxbatons students eating. Their table manners were impeccable. Harry turned awkwardly and looked down the Slytherin table, he hadn't spotted the others on it. But there were now ten girls in their pale blue outfits. A chill ran down his spine, as a worrying idea formed in his brain.</span></div></div>",

The Beauxbatons school was famous for it's high standards, and strict discipline.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was something odd bothering Harry though. There still seemed to be the same mix of boys and girls in Hogwarts uniforms. There was a building buzz of French accents that was becoming stronger, by the second.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Er...

She looked confused for a second, before regaining her composure. Soon she was eating as if nothing had happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn hearing a loud noise behind him, Harry turned back to the Slytherin table. It was usually unwise to ignore any noises from that direction. Already there was a swathe of blue uniforms. Exactly where his year would have been sitting.

The pressure from the poorly fitting uniform eased up as the changes started to affect the boy who survived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nForgetting all attempts at hiding what he was doing he dug the Rule Book out. The scarlet finger nails, and the slender fingers startled Harry and he almost dropped the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tingle of magic shifted, and Harry warbled a worried little whimper as he felt his nipples become the focus of attention.

As he clutched it, the sparkles reappeared, this time more localised. They shimmered over the title. The word 'Hogwarts' shone and then faded to a dull inky black. In his hands he felt the brush of soft fabric, and before his eyes he watched as a thick blue ribbon wove itself around the book, sealing from being reopened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA thick waxy blob materialised atop the ribbon, and an impression of the Beauxbatons crest embedded itself there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDesperately, Harry clawed to at it. But the ribbon was clearly enchanted even if the book wasn't anymore. He gave a gasping sob of despair, it was softer and more feminine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only when he felt a swelling in his stomach that Harry changed his focus. However, as the pressure built he felt like he was about to break wind. What happened was worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the pressure eased, Harry's ass swelled up until it filled his new uniform. The skirt more suiting his shape. He made Hermione blush as he groped his crotch. Little Harry was still there... for the moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he felt the pressure build again a soft muttering \"No.... No.... No....\" slipped from his lips. This time the pressure faded, and it was Harry's chest that suffered the consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt his pecs swell and swell, as his nipples brushed off the inside of the uniform, they were teased into an awareness that he'd never experienced before. Instinctively his hands came up and cupped them, as they blossomed until they filled his rather smaller hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was on the verge of tears, as he felt the final changes happening, beneath the layers of the uniform, he felt himself shift from male to female. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gulped air deep into her lungs as she fought to control her panic. Running her hands down her side, she felt the underwear that was integrated into the uniform. A corset that pulled in her waist, and provided support for her bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was upset at seeing breasts from quite this angle, and was concerned that they were rather more.... frankly, rather more....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was sure that Ron was luckier, and less over endowed that herself. She was also rather stunning, too. Her coppery hair giving her an exotic look amongst all the blondes and raven haired beauties.</span></div></div>",

Any signs of her weakness buried beneath a perfectly made up face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestured the students closer, and while Harriet's fingers tried to work the ribbon and waxy seal off the book, she trudged closer to her least favourite teacher. Ronni and Hermione weren't far behind. With a cold hard dread forming deep in her stomach, she knew the book was out of commission while she was here. Especially as no-one else had arrived after Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen all the exchange students were circled around her, Snape addressed them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beauxbatons is the Premier French school of magic, and I will not tolerate anything which will reflect badly on the school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer expression suggested that she wasn't going to be her usual fun-loving, and playful self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Beauxbatons does not have different houses. But I want you to hold yourself to the highest standard... as an unofficial house within this school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked over the surrounding faces. A few stiff nods came back to her. Oddly the former Slytherins saw this as a challenge to their superiority, the Ravenclaws as an intellectual challenge, the Gryffindors as a test of their integrity, the former Hufflepuffs just accepted it, as one of life's challenges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They do things <i>differently </i>here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tone was laden with veiled contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I shall expect you to obey all your teachers without regard to your personal concerns...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Clearly this is more of a change for some of you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe formerly male students blushing, as they tried not to look guilty at finding themselves in female bodies, and the temptations that that offered them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For example...

Harry himself was blinded by the speed and brilliance of the lights, although he could feel his body shifting and changing in odd... unnatural ways.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic was lifting him off his chair, and up into the air. It didn't feel far, but as Harry's legs bumped the underside of the desk, he reached out and held on. The pull continued to increase even as Harry tightened his grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as he thought he couldn't hold on any longer. The light shattered, and flew away fading as it went.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a loud crack, Harry bounced his head off the table. Blinking and disoriented he turned to Ron and tried to focus. A wry smile was on his face, which helped keep him calm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to Hermione whose face was rather less happy and approving. Even now, Harry had to restrain a smile. Hermione's face wasn't made for unhappy expressions. With the changes Harry had given her, she looked rather pouty and very alluring. Her arms crossed angrily just served to lift her bust up more prominently.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe flashing black and white speckles were fading from Harry's vision, and he turned back towards the front of the class. He wanted to show how he could take whatever Snape dealt out. He was still blinking and dizzy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"As if turning you into a girl is a punishment....\" Hermione growled in a low voice, \"How sexist.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer barely spoken comment cut straight through Harry's haze. He looked down and was greeted by the sight of a generous bust, one which put even Hermione's in proportion. He... Damn it.... She wasn't used to seeing them from this angle, but they HAD to be a D-cup or even DD-cup, she thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShaking her head, only caused long wild locks of hair to flash across her vision. She twisted and turned trying to assess the damage. She could see that she now took up more of the chair with her widened and more padded ass. Although she had to run her hands down her side to feel the pinched in waist, hidden beneath her bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sir...\" she gasped. Stopping instantly as her high girlish tones startled her to silence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeliberately, Snape misinterpreted her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course. A girl is incomplete without her make-up.\" This time the sparks shot straight at her, seeming to splash off her skin. She found a waxy coating on her lips when her tongue darted out, and even blinking made her aware that she must have longer eyelashes, now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he heard kissing noises he snapped his head around, Draco was blowing him kisses from across the class. The Slytherin students were overcome with joy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the noise rose Snape cut in,\"Draco if you like the new Harriet Potter, I can arrange something similar for you too.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilence fell instantly.</span></div></div>",

From her extra sensitive skin, and other things she didn't want to think about. Hell even the material of her shirt... blouse seemed to scratch at her chest, especially her nipples. They felt insanely distracting. She particularly hated the additional attention from the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione had passed a note onto her from one of the others, and the contents just made Harriet blush crimson as she read it. As a boy, it would have felt more like a joke, but now she could picture it... picture the whole scene, and it was making her feel very confused. She scrunched it up, as tightly as her tiny fists could and dropped it into the bin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class was odd, for another reason too. Harriet was doing better than Ron with the potion, and scarily also better than Hermione too. She dearly wished that she hadn't made her such a bimbo, well not the changes to her mind anyway. Harriet still found the lush curves of Hermione a temptation even with her own as a distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the end of the class, she decided to use the book to restore herself to normal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the pretense of making notes, she slipped it back out from her bag. Her eyes darted to where Professor Snape was talking with a small group of Slytherin students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning it over in her hands, she thought the cover nicely complimented the colour of her nail polish. The scruffy words, Harry Potter, scribbled on the cover just looked so crude. She flicked it open to where she'd been writing at the start of the class. But it was blank, everything she'd put down was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDismissing that, she decided it was merely a different page, and proceeded to write that Harriet Potter was back to being Harry Potter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she lifted the pen from the page, the ink merely faded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet held her breath as she waited for the magic to work. But as she let go later, it was clear the book wasn't working for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slapped the book closed, and before she could toss it back in her bag. The letters on the cover took on a golden glow. As her name shimmered in metallic yellow. Before fading back to the plain black ink.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe muttered a foul curse under her breath, clearly the book no longer recognised her as the owner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You kiss your mother with those lips.\" Ron chuckled inches from your ear. \"Perhaps you should wash it out ... with my cock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet didn't know what to do, or even where to look as she jammed her elbow into his stomach.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the breath hisses from Ron's lungs, his eyes remained fixed on Harriet's chest. To such an extent that she looked down herself, the reason was obvious. As obvious as the shape of her nips through the thin cloth of her blouse and jumper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout raising his head, the cold voice of Snape came across the classroom, \"I can extend your punishment, if you aren't learning fast enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry went back to the ingredients for the cauldron. His wish that Hermione still was the smartest witch now much more sincere. He was also deeply relieved not to have gone ahead with some of his more extreme ideas for how the girls should dress at school.</span></div></div>",

Fiercely she grabbed Ron's shoulder, although he barely reacted. Harriet held on as tightly as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe summoned up the magic she'd felt in Professor's Snape's class. The look of dawning comprehension on Ron's face, was just a little too slow, his shaken head denials too tempting. In an instant, Ron was enveloped in a blinding white cocoon of magic. It pulses around him, taking on hints of scarlet, copper and pink, before turning pure white once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanishing in a flash, the disoriented Ron naked, blinked at the changes.

Her grip softening and shifting, instinctively, as she hissed in pain at her own too tight grip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-etc7sI1t1_c/VKU3Bw5k2_I/AAAAAAAASWo/CJhMgv-4G2s/s1600/Karen_Gillan_fake_nude.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-etc7sI1t1_c/VK...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perhaps Ginny might have something that'll fit. Ve<i>ron</i>ica.\" Harriet said more cattily than she intended. Ron started to breath heavily, gasping. Although that just kept her aware of her new chest and lungs, and those huge, huge nips really didn't help. Surely they weren't all so sensitive. She thought briefly of Hermione before becoming even more uncomfortable.</span></div></div>",

Always being seen, by those like Malfoy, as 'just another Weasley', had made Ron want to, need to stand out, from his brothers, to make him more competitive, and that competition had dulled his compassion somewhat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking into the wide eyes of Ron's frozen face, she felt a flicker of doubt, herself. But she steeled her resolve, Ronni needed to understand how cruel, his behaviour had been, when Harriet most needed her best friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough her immobile lips, Ronni tried to speak, an apology, a plea, ... a threat, Harriet didn't know. But the next stage was clearly understood, in the wild darting of Ronni's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet slipped Ronni, into the sleek 'seeker' outfit. Her immobility not too awkward. The biggest difficulty was her own more petite dimensions, and weaker body. A soft hissing came from Ronni, as Harriet finished dressing her, pulling the straps into place on her shoulders. It was then she noticed how tight it was at the crotch, every detail outlined against the thin, revealing fabric. She also noticed, properly, for the first time, how much material had disappeared between her plump cheeks, giving it a garroting thong back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith another glance at her watch, she confirmed she had enough time, and re-arranged Ronni's limbs, and sat her facing the tent entrance, on the camp-bed. A smirk formed at a wicked idea, and Harriet arranged, the unresisting body, with her hands 'resting' in her lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen, with herm in position, Harriet performed her own strip-tease in front of her powerless audience. An audience she felt would appreciate the irony, the wiggle of her hips, the teasing drop of her trousers, and the proud, round feminine arse inches from her face. Stepping out of the trousers, she danced around, to face Ronni, slowly peeling her clothes upwards and off her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot used to the size of her bust, the girls were caught and rose up with the shirt/blouse, and jumper, until with a heavy drop, they danced, then settled in front of Ronni's agog face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet was oblivious to everything, but the change in Ronni's breathing, and the flash of pain, as her breasts slipped free. The clothes obscured even the limited world of the tent from her view.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite her momentary triumph, she realised she'd made a mistake. Everything was too tight, her shirt still buttoned to the collar was never going to slip over her head, and her longer wilder hair, was getting everywhere, every breath a splutter, as she tried not to swallow the mane of hair. Hell, it even felt like it muffled her hearing, and she felt her cheeks burn, at how ridiculous she had to look at the moment.</span></div></div>",

You always said that you admired their strategy and style.\" Ron's teasing was getting worse. With a firm push on her arse, he propelled her towards the Gryffindor tents for changing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry consoled herself as she went it was true, she thought there was a lot to learn from how Ravenclaw played Quidditch. Besides she'd always found that her time on a broom allowed her to forget her problems while she focused on the snitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost wandered in on the boys, but just changed directions before it became embarrassing. The girls' tent was unsurprisingly empty, as Harriet pulled out the seeker's uniform. Only a small bench, a full-length mirror and her broom breaking the monotony.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her teeth clenched she suppressed a scream. Snape's magic had affected this too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet's first impression was how much smaller it was.... and how much less of it, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was in the form of a leotard, with red arms and legs, and the central piece golden like the house colours. He saw a small lion stitched on the top right, just where it would most draw attention to her rather prominent breasts. She went back into the bag, surely the cloak must still be there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe laughter and banter from the boys tent startled her, as she fell into a distracted daze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThings weren't going to get better by dithering. So gritting her teeth in determination, she slipped out of her uniform and put on the Quidditch strip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet spotted the cloak, and was glad for any modesty it would provide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she tied it around her neck, she was cursing out Snape for his malicious spell. The reflection in the mirror was made to be the most embarrassing. Harriet was sure she was now three or four inches shorter than her previous height. The uniform only covered as far down as her upper arms, while the leggings stopped above her knees. Agitatedly pulling on the leotard only made her aware of how high cut the thighs were. The cloak went only half-way down her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet turned to spot her number on the cloak. But how the view highlighted her round and full ass, made her blush as she whipped back around to face the mirror again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat simple motion made her aware of something else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething she'd not considered before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were rather unrestrained, as they moved in an eye-drawing manner. As Harriet blushed, she tried to pull the cloak together, it wasn't going to go that tightly. It just pressed the girls together and making her cleavage even more obvious. Her nipples were also remarkably visible through the thin cloth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come on Harriet.....\" a voice called from outside the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't realise that girls needed that much longer to get changed.\" Harry scowled at her uniform in disgust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother team-mate adding, \"You don't need to adjust your make-up....\" with a snigger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe worst comment was meant to be the most helpful, \"Come on, Harry. Most students <i>experi<span class=\"clgrey\">men</span></i>... get cursed with that spell. But you need to hurry up for the team photo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nColin Creevey and his blasted camera. One of the banes of Harry's life, now held a greater dread for her.</span></div></div>",

Snape's spell affected my team strip too.\" Harriet shrugged her shoulders. As her breasts shifted, she felt them pull at her shoulders, making her even more aware of them. When Harriet spotted the quick glance from Hermione, she almost shrugged her shoulders again. At the last moment, she made a face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione wanted to help, but she wasn't willing to interfere with a teacher's punishment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I can help with that at least.\" Hermione finally said and smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet felt her tits become more tightly held in a fabric embrace. The girls movement restricted, it did also rather lift them, and give them more shape in her profile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come On... At least, there aren't any house points up for grabs.\" she nudged Harriet playfully with her elbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw tears starting to form in the corner of Harriet's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't you dare... Don't you dare give Draco and his kind the satisfaction. Now get out there and win.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet barely reacted to the pep-talk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting a friendly hand on her shoulder, \"Harriet.... Harry, the sooner you start the sooner it's all over.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come along...\" The voice called from outside the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina Johnson's voice was clear and powerful, it made her feel a little intimidated. But at the same time, she was glad she wasn't the only girl on the team. Angelina was Oliver's replacement as captain, and played the role of chaser.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGiving herself a curt nod in the mirror and another to Hermione she left the tent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina was aghast, \"Bloody Hell.\", she spat out before stopping herself. She stood three inches taller than the seeker. Harriet didn't care about the height difference, as she took in the Quidditch strip she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wore sturdy leather shin pads gauntlets, her cloak was full length and she was wearing a proper outfit underneath. Glancing down, Harriet felt even more exposed. Angelina looked like a serious player, while she.... well she looked like a fantasy...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina's expression was buttoned down, but Harriet thought she saw the remains of a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That won't do.\" Angelina tapped Harriet on her head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her hair wove itself into a plait, Harriet looked at the ground, studying it like Hermione in a library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's hair had never been so long or the subject of such attention. She lifted the tail of the plait over his shoulder. As she noted the pale blue bow holding the ends together, she was past the point of caring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Time for a quick team photo.\" Angelina suggested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon Harry found George and Fred on either side of her. As the shortest player, she had to be at the front. It was also traditionally the place for the seeker to be. The keeper Cormac stood beside Angelina at the back. While the beaters stood on either side of Harriet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe camera went off with a flash, even as Harry was trying to figure out an objection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team split up, and got their brooms, while Harriet was still startled by the flash. She realised that her broom was back in the tent, \"I'll just be a second.\" she said to Colin, who was still fiddling with his camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe had a new look on his face Harriet thought. Previously, he'd always been in awe, overwhelmed by the mere presence of Harry Potter, but now, his face wasn't hard to read.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite herself, she caught a quick glance, and her eyes bulged out her head, as she saw the appreciative lump forming in his trousers. Colour came to her cheeks as she grabbed her broom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe entrance tent was quiet, Angelina had already gone over the tactics for the match. Outside the announcement finished and a roar let them know that the Ravenclaw team had swooped onto the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey all mounted up, and listened intently as their names were read out to the crowd. Harriet felt intimidated, it sounded like a big crowd for an insignificant friendly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the voice announced. \"<b><i>Gryffindor!</i></b>\". The curtain swept aside, and they flew out to circle the pitch.</span></div></div>",

Even now with the bra that Hermione had magicked up for her she felt their weight shift in tight turns and with sudden manoeuvres. As she passed the Gryffindor tower, there was a more lewd tone of cheering than before. She fought hard not to turn away when she heard the snap of other cameras in the stands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust before she turned towards the centre of the pitch, she was able to make out what some of the Slytherin students were chanting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'The boy who lived... The girl who jiggles... '</i>, Harriet spotted Draco in one tower and he was giving his full throated support to the chant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe noise died down as the players landed. Madam Hooch got the two captains to shake hands. Harriet noticed the glances from a couple of the Ravenclaw players. The first time she'd been this close for most of her fellow students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolanda Hooch ignored the changes to Harry's sex and uniform. It was considered impolite to pass judgement on another teacher's punishment. Interfering was frowned upon, as undermining authority.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe released the clasp and the two bludgers soared into the air. The snitch darted out of her open palm, vanishing high into the glare of the sun. It only remained for her to toss the Quaffle up for the match to begin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's smuggling bludgers!\" a lone voice cried from one of the Slytherin towers. Harriet tried to sink lower onto her broom. She felt Angelina's hand touch her briefly on the back of the neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Begin.\" she snarled, tossing the ball as high in the air as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet launched herself, immediately not wanting to be hit by bludgers. Besides up high away from the general scrambling melee of the game was a better vantage point to spot the Snitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain she felt the shift and bounce as she accelerated up and away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelina had won the Quaffle in the air and was hunched low as she sped towards the Ravenclaw goal. Harriet wished that she'd gone for the twenty point penalty, and no embarrassing transformation. He was confident in his abilities, and was sure that he could win that back in a good game. But, he didn't want to appear cocky and arrogant, especially in Snape's class. There was also the issue that the score was only for the game, and wouldn't become house points in a friendly match.</span></div></div>",

She drove the broom lower to get a better chance of spotting the snitch. She even flew amongst the players, trying to get the feel of the broom. It just didn't feel right in her hands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a gasp, Harriet realised that it was her that was making her fly differently. She had a different centre of balance, and her body still distracted her as it moved and jiggled in odd ways that she just wasn't used to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if taunting her, the snitch suddenly flew across her path, inches away from her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLurching forward, she sent one hand swooping out to grab it. But it slipped away, leaving her splayed out over the end of her broom. She almost fell off the broomstick, only the very tip visible poking through her ample cleavage. The broom slid between her large breasts. She couldn't help but think of a cock sliding between them. The suggestion was just too clear. She hoped that nobody had been watching, but the reaction from the crowd suggested otherwise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA mix of disappointed gasps was mixed with some more sexual, teasing moan. She sat back, lifting herself up, pulling her cleavage from around the broom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that point she spotted how many people were wearing 'Weasley's Spectator Spex'. A product that Harry had encouraged as a money spinner. Enchanted glasses that allowed the wearer to follow a particular player. Even if they wanted to see it from the player's eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry blushed deeper crimson, recalling the times she adjusted herself and the uncomfortable bra too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the moment she flew past one of the Gryffindor towers. She spotted George and Fred exchanging very happy expressions. They even tried to high-5, like muggles but missed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet barely noticed, her gaze catching the slow disapproving shake of Ginny's head, despair clear on her young face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did console herself with one thought. That at least she'd stopped the Twins other avenue. X-ray specs that actually would let you see through clothes. Well, Harry hadn't really stopped them, but a few days later. Their works suddenly stopped, and he received the oddest of smiles and friendly nod from Dumbledore.</span></div></div>",

She knew that some of the wind would be taken out of the sails of her tormentors if she just went and won the game like she always did.  Then all she would have to do was make it to the end of the day, and be back to her old self.  Then maybe she'd write a rule in the book that made Snape into a woman or something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was more difficult than she imagined though.  She was constantly distracted by the weight of her breasts tugging and pulling her torso this way and that.  Not to mention the feeling of the hard shaft of the broom stick between her legs.  She was constantly standing up in the stirrups to relieve the pressure on her sensitive new anatomy, but that merely caused her to tire out her legs that much faster.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, Harry was tough, and was determined that Harriet would be too.  She circled the pitch and scanned the sky for the golden glint that would salvage her reputation, and win Gryffindor the match.  Finally, after what seemed to the new girl to be forever, she caught sight of the Snitch.  Unfortunately, it was across the pitch, near the Slytherin grandstand.  Also, the Ravenclaw seeker, luckily Cho Chang's backup and not the talented girl seeker who Harry fancied, was between Harriet and the tiny golden glimmer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet took off like a shot on her Firebolt, hoping that despite her reduced flying acumen the broom would allow her to close the gap quickly.  Her quick movement went unnoticed for only a few seconds, then the Ravenclaw turned with a shout and started toward the Snitch himself, having been clued in by Harriet's pell mell streak across the pitch.  He was still ahead of her, but she deliberately flattened herself to the broom, pulling the hard shaft into her cleavage, reducing the drag the air had on her.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn only a few instants she was right on his tail, the bristles of his Nimbus 2002 filling her vision.  He was focused on the Snitch, matching its jinking, dodging movement expertly, while Harriet struggled to remain close, fighting the momentum of her giant boobs with every turn.  She wasn't good enough, she knew now too late that her altered body lacked the muscle memory and she lacked the skill to beat even a back up seeker to the pitch.  As they turned sharply once again toward the Slytherin stands desperation set in.  Harriet reached out and grabbed a delicate handful of her opponents bristles and pulled, destabilizing his broom and sending him into a wild high speed spin.  With a burst of determination and speed, Harriet surged forward and grasped the snitch then realized that she was headed at high speed into the Slytherin stands.  She attempted to brake and turn, but merely managed to slow her momentum a bit as she slammed into the crowd at high speed.  The last thing she saw after hitting the abandoned bleachers was Draco Malfoy's leering face.  Slowly, the world faded to black as she lost consciousness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA while later Harry awoke to the familiar ceiling of  the hospital wing.  He doesn't open his eyes, preferring to listen as Dumbledore, Snape, McGonagall, Hootch, and Moody discussed what had happened, and what punishment would be deserved for Harry's reckless endangerment of other students.  Steeling himself, Harry opened his eyes to find that...<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

With his arms wide he left taking the teachers with him. Harriet let out a moaning sigh, as she settled back. She hadn't spotted that one had stayed behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolanda Hooch leaned forward, and put a friendly hand softly on her shoulder. \"I'm sorry, Harriet. But the team has voted as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flinched and pulled her hand away as pain spasmed across Harriet's face. But the pain was from the words he knew to be coming next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's been decided that for the moment ... -emm- while you are female you aren't a good enough flier to be seeker.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt tears well up in the corner of her eyes, and Madam Hooch left her alone. She disappeared into a watery haze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWiping the tears away with the back of her hand, her friends now surrounded her. Well, at least Ron and Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's prolly for the best.\" Ron said rather chirpily. \"Besides without your own broom, it's hard to be ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA swift elbow from Hermione stopped him going further.</span></div></div>",

Regular uniform.\" Harriet adds a little dispiritedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting her hands on her hips, Hermione glowered at him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And what's wrong with the <i>Girls</i> uniform.\" she snapped.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeither Harry nor Ron objected to it. Enjoying the curves it showed and even more so hid. At the moment, Ron was trying not to stare at her breasts. With her hands on her hips, they seemed to be almost issuing a challenge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, 'Mione.\" she finally mumbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione broke down at that point, \"I'm sorry, I can see how this is difficult for you. It's a lot of changes.\" She leaned in and pulled Harriet to her bosom, giving her a good hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon squirmed deeper into his seat, and adjusted his books in his lap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Surely this is an improvement, though.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe held her tenderly, and wiped a tear away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But a woman's got to try to keep her dignity.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Err... How long am I a...\" she started speaking uncertain how to continue. \"How long am I off... the Quidditch squad for...\" she finished weakly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"At least until all the injured have fully recovered.\" she added with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat was the best news Harry had had all day, with Magic recovery was usually quick and painless. She'd probably not have to stay in the girls uniform for more than a week.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeckoning them forward, she hugged her two best friends as tightly as she could. Blushing slightly as she felt Ron's resistance, and working out the reason. Once she broke the hug, Ron rocketed back into his seat. With red cheeks and a guilty look. Neither of the girls called him on his odd behaviour.</span></div></div>",

Ron's smile widened delighting in Draco's horror. In front of his eyes, Draco's mind caught up with the meaning of his growing hair. His hands darting to his chest. The baggy boys uniform, hanging loose on his smaller frame, but even the loosest of clothes couldn't disguise the fact that Draco was female, and abundantly so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands recoiled from her chest, as if stung. Her mouth opening silently into an inviting round pout. Her hands now darting to her crotch. A soft squeak slipping out, as she confirmed what she dreaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStunned into immobility, and not aware of how inviting her hands rested there. The fabric started to slither beneath her hands, and Draco looked down. Down beyond the swell of her bust. Before her eyes she spotted the hem of her trousers rising. As it rose it bound together, forming an unmistakable skirt. The hem rose higher and higher revealing her ankles, then her knees. In fear, her fingers plucked at it. Trying desperately to stop it's advance. But she couldn't concentrate, already her hands were slimmer, more girly, her nails coated in glossy crimson.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChasing rapidly after the rising hem of her skirt, she felt the teasing caress, as her socks thinned, becoming opaque... Becoming undeniably a pair of tights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco's eyes widened, as she felt her boxers soften. Chill, soft satin replacing her plain underwear. She felt it's soft embrace covering her now more generous ass. Surrendering against the shrinking skirt, her hands darted to her new expanded rear. Fingers sinking into the wide expanse of her plump, firm, full arse. She shook her head in denial of the facts. In denial of everything her body told her, of everything her gawping classmates confirmed. Almost unnoticed, Draco's shirt had become softer as a blouse, the change hidden beneath her jumper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, the soft, almost sensual gasp from Draco refocused everyone's attention. The boys especially, as her chest rippled and rolled. Draco felt the embrace of a bra, as her T-shirt transformed. Lifting and supporting the girls, her bust becoming even clearer, even bigger, even more embarrassing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione's face was the same disapproving expression. The very idea of making a boy into a girl being a punishment, an idea that offended her viscerally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the class, it was clear that Draco's transformation was being viewed as an opportunity. Pansy Parkinson took in the timid and terrified newest addition to Slytherin. Quickly she hid her smile, as plans bubbled through her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo-one paid much attention to Crabbe or Goyle, as they too transformed from wizard to witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry found little comfort in Draco's transformation. Her own changes too recent, too humiliating for her. Though a smile quirked the corner of her mouth, she couldn't feel any sympathy for Draco either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe found herself comparing their transformations. Draco was prettier than she was, but at least she was curvier... bustier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry wasn't sure that it felt like a victory, or if this was part of the punishment. But she certainly viewed Draco as .... as competition.</span></div></div>",

If he went back he could change things, like capturing Wormtail in third year early and proving Sirius's innocents, and saving Cedric in the grave yard. But why stop there if he went back further he could make connections with more people in the school. His trial at the end of the summer showed him that it doesn't matter who you are but what connections you have. Besides maybe having more friends than just Ron and Hermione would be good. Ron's betrayal in fourth year still stung despite Harry saying he forgave him and Hermione was still a little too focused on school rather than real life, though she was getting better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith this in mind Harry wrote, Rule 1: Harry Potter travels back in time to the morning of his first day of Hogwarts in his first year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs soon as he finished writing Harry suddenly blacked out. Groggily waking up the world was blurry, fumbling for his glasses Harry found that he seemed to had to reach further than usual. Finally getting his glasses and putting them on Harry was shocked to see that he was smaller, like he was eleven years old again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Dear Merlin, it actually worked.\" Harry whispered in wonder. Quickly searching around himself Harry realized that is was still quite early in the morning, but more importantly the book was not with him. Freaking out that someone may have taken in while he was asleep Harry quickly looked around the room to try to see where it might be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay Harry calm down and think this through where could it have gone,\" Harry muttered to himself, taking a breath Harry thought it through. \"Wait could it still be in the chamber?

He thought of how differently his first few years might have been, if there hadn't been the constant irritation of Draco Malfoy. He'd tried to bully Harry into a friendship. He'd tried to get Hagrid fired. He'd tried to get Harry expelled. He was behind every snide comment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe... <b>He</b>... <b><i>He</i></b>...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it hit him. Would Draco be less of a problem were he a she. That wouldn't harm the Slytherin, he told himself. It wasn't vengeful, it was just an experiment. A test, to confirm the book's abilities, it's limitations. Before he could change his mind Harry drew out his quill and scribbled on the pristine page his first sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Draco Malfoy, is a girl called Erica.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he stabbed the page, to put the period at the end of the sentence. He knew instinctively that it had worked. Erica Malfoy still had Crabbe and Goyle as associates, although they worked more as bodyguards rather than lackeys. She used them to keep unwanted attention to a minimum. After all, the Malfoy family were an ancient wizarding family, and a marriage would bring glory to any partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA silver shimmering light danced along the words, erasing them from the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry knew that the change was still in place. But now the past was gone, Erica is now, and always had been female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA twinge of guilt, a twinge of doubt still ate at the edge of Harry's conscience. But he fought it, trying to convince himself that the change wasn't malicious, that it wasn't ....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it struck him, a way to convince himself of the rightness, of the harmlessness of his actions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Ron is short for Veronica.

Her body aching from being tensed up on her broom. The endless Quidditch practice was hard work, but she enjoyed working up a sweat. The thought of teasing Harry with her body, a flash of panties, as she sped past, just a little too quickly. She thought of the flustered seeker trying to avoid staring at her plump rear, wondering if she was aware what she'd done. She liked to imagine, as she hunched low and tight, that her broom was Harry's cock, just nestled in her cleavage.

Harry could certainly sypathise, and he felt she deserved a little recompense for stumbling into the middle of... of everything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Cho Chang. </i>Even now, he found himself wondering, about other futures, other pasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Cho is blessed with a gifted brain, and a body to match.

She is proud of her generous bust, and her skills for Hufflepuff are undiminished on the Quidditch pitch.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the Ravenclaw Tower, Cho was relaxing. As her bust grew larger, she remained oblivious, the girls swelling and spreading, dominating her chest. Resting her head on her hands, she was glad to relieve the strain of her shoulders.

But was just as eager not to lose control of the book, and surrender to his darker impulses.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe nodded resolutely to himself, and closed the book jamming it back in his bag.

But she could still surprise him with nuggets of information about Quidditch. It was odd to think of Harry growing up, not knowing about Quidditch. She just admired his natural grace on a broom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe put on her old Quidditch strip, it was just a size too small, and tight in all the right places, perfect for distracting Harry. Grabbing her broom, she headed out. Barely had she left, than she bumped into Harry, also broom in hand.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Although, Myrtle had followed him this time, she floated along beside him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGhost etiquette had her try to keep to the open air rather than ignore the walls. Ron had particularly bad memories, both for himself, and his sister, while Hermione had a rare curiosity by-pass. Harry assumed out of consideration to Ron's unease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was pointing out where the back-fire had thrown Lockhart. She drifted over, and gave a startled gasp. It was oddly sexual, startled, fascinated and excited. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this... Was this Ron's wand?\" she asked pointing to something in the mixed rubble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, probably.\" Harry was distracted, and eager to explore. The chamber had been hidden for centuries, since the founding of the school. A logic Harry thought would serve Dumbledore's Army.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is the book his, too?\" she added as he started walking away, deeper into the sprawling underground chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry paused mid-step. He'd never known Ron to carry any books when it wasn't necessary. Swivelling he went over to examine Myrtle's discovery. Perhaps Salazar had his own private library down here. A selection of books more dangerous than the library's restricted section.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrushing the dust and grit from it, he turned it over in his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Nice bum...\" Myrtle observed, causing Harry to snap back upright. He recalled her fascination with him, in the bubble bath, her coquettish behaviour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe smiled and shook his head, it'd have no future. But he was happy that she was joking, her reputation was well-earned, and life had not been kind to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had to assume it was Gilderoy's book. The cover had the four house animals, each taking a quarter of the cover, and again running down the spine of the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening it, the book revealed it's frontispiece.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:times new roman, serif\"><i>Hogwarts: The Rule Book<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGodric Gryffindor<br>\r\nSalazar Slytherin<br>\r\nRowena Ravenclaw<br>\r\nHelga Hufflepuff</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe names looked hand-written and ancient. A chill announced Myrtle passing through his arm. \"That's Rowena' signature\", she told him excitedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMyrtle's spectral fingers brushed the book, drawing a crackle of magic as her caress. The book was undeniably magical. Flicking through, the rest was blank page after page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I show only the truth...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words showed up, as if written by an invisible hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Write only cautiously and with consideration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next line forming, the same way. Harry realised, it was the same elegant handwriting, as above, as Rowena's own guiding words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My power is great, and should be guarded with vengeance and surety.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words this time, matching Salazar's more jagged script.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kindness and compassion, are their own reward. Above all restraint.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next line cautioned. These words matching Helga's untidy, tiny lettering.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four lines remained there for only a few moments before fading from the page. Leaving behind only the title and authors.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nI wonder how Draco would manage a treasure like this, Harry thought, probably with brute force. He knew Draco was a coward, almost from their first meeting. Though, that at least showed some animal cunning, and the back-up of Crabbe and Goyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wondered how Draco would have managed had he been born a girl, and needed to rely on guile. He snorted at the idea that Draco could have that subtlety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"clblue\">I'd like to see Draco Malfoy as a girl.</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words flared on the page after he lifted his quill from the page. But beyond that nothing was apparently different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry realised, it might just as easily be a joke present from Fred or George to Ron, a notebook for his studies. He thought of the Marauder's Map, and the simplicity of a disappearing / reappearing ink spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDismissing the book, he slipped it absently into a deep cloak pocket.

She cupped it, one cheek in each hand. Despite being new to her gender she was proud of how full and pert her sumptuous new ass was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teasing, tingling sensation rose, circling around her belly button and stomach. Pain flared across Harriet's face, as an invisible corset pulled tight. Her waist shrinking four, five, six, eight inches. It made her hips feel even more obvious. As the magic rose higher, Harriet's hands rose to her chest in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands were slimmer, and topped with magnificent nails, each painted in a perfect glossy coat of crimson. She didn't have long to wait, as the tickling built behind each nipple. Each nipple swelling as she watched, the areola spreading wider and wider. The nipple rose, swelling and pushing far beyond what Harry had ever imagined possible. It was erect, and felt like it was thrusting forward half an inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if in envy, she felt the magic spreading wider, and deeper. Soon the proud nip was atop a surge mound of abundant flesh. She wasn't used to estimating a girl's size, especially from this angle. But the weight growing in her outstretched palms suggested she was above average. As the spell continued, so did her expansion. A pulse of fear tweaked through her veins, as she hit E-cup. The girls were beyond what Harry had ever wanted. Even Harriet was a little nervous about being so busty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally satisfied, the magic raced upwards. She felt her face twist and shift. Cracks coming, as bones broke and adjusted. Looking at her body, she was oddly calm. With such an incredible body, she knew her face would be equally spectacular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in a mirror, she saw a woman with fully pouting lips. A tiny mouth, that mouth that needed, demanded a cock to be complete. Her cheek bones were high and perfect. Her eyes, still like her mother were like emeralds, hinting at a feline nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she posed in front of the mirror, she watched as the Hogwarts uniform rippled into existence. The blouse just a size too tight, gapped as it fought to cover her chest. Beneath the blouse, a rather sturdy bra was weaving itself out of fresh air and the finest satin. She felt the soft cups cradle and support them. A mini-skirt was also appearing from nowhere, the simple cotton pleated item almost disappointing in it's plainness. Until Harriet saw just how short it was. It barely reached below the curve of her ass. Even the slightest breeze, or bending over would flash her arse. If the school hadn't been all-girl, the boys would be walking around with permanent erections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe flattened the skirt, giving a daring half-twirl as she watched it lift. A soft, feminine, girly gasp burst from her lips. The final part of her uniform was forming. She felt the slenderest thread of a thong slip between her cheeks. It dug deep, feeling like cheese-wire, as the front joined the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sense of self-confidence and pride in her appearance made her take a deep breath, and hold it proudly. In the mirror, she never looked more perfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere were shrieks of horror from all around, with amusement, Harriet realised that the boys dorm was a perfect place for her newest rule. Although she should have written that the new girls would be oblivious to their own changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet was eager to see so many other students.

She bore a startling resemblance to Ginny Weasley, though a little bustier. Her hands mauled her generous breasts, as if fighting to deny their reality. Her plush lower lip was bitten by perfect white teeth. A look of horror and fear in every perfect detail of her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No... No... not you too....\" her voice warbled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harriet watched, Ronni's eyes lost focus, staring absently into the distance. Her mouth hanging just slightly open.

She hadn't even realised that she'd still being growing. Surely now the world had adjusted, and Ronni had only her memories of growing up with all her sisters, surely, the changes were complete.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet squirmed in her seat, her wider plush ass shifting uncomfortably on the bed. It was weird, she had two sets of memories, her real ones, the originals, of Ronald Weasley, Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom. But also there was a parallel set, unreal but undeniable. Harriet recalled, Charlene Weasley, Patricia Weasley, and their cutest youngest sister Ginerva Molly Weasley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile quirked at the corner of Harriet's mouth as she imagined Mr. Weasley trying to cope with all his daughters, would he even have time to satisfy his curiosity about the muggle world.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Help yourself.\" Harriet gestured to her dresser. Slipping open the top drawer, she was momentarily overwhelmed herself, as the huge quantity, and wide, wide variety of underwear on display. She wanted to caress the silken and satin beauties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt felt like a distant memory, an almost forgotten question. But Harriet was happy to see her friend, certainly wasn't a squib, she having a very nice bust. But the niggling doubt still teased her. She still wanted to see how she compared with Hermione. Was Harry's survival down to skill, good fortune, or something else.</span></div></div>",

At least her thong was satiny soft, cool and trimmed with lace. Slipping on the regulation miniskirt, Harriet struggled to appreciate it from a girls point of view. It was only six inches long, and there weren't even any boys to tease with it's brevity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nButtoning up the blouse was a strain, with the buttons gapping around the proud swell of her bosom. It too was abbreviated by his own rules, serving more as a second bra, it only reached half way down. It left her taut and toned tummy on display. The jumper was just as short, with the Gryffindor lion looking slightly misshapen by her abundant curves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking in the mirror, she saw her hair was still very unkempt if a few inches longer than Harry would have like it. Harriet just ruffled it further, until she was happy, happy that it looked like bed-head, a hint of the 'just fucked' look. More of a tease given that Hogwarts was an all-girl school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDescending the stairs, she found the right pace to make the girls dance. She stopped after one flight, the pain in her shoulders building, and again the absence of boys reducing her pleasure further. She passed Drusilla Malfoy, on a parallel staircase, going up. They couldn't fight, but Harriet spotted that her best guess, she was a lovely B-cup, probably with padding might pass as a C-cup. She didn't need to fight, Harriet threw her shoulder back. The girls gave an eye-catching ripple, and she watched as Drusilla's expression hardened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't take her long to find Hermione, she had the quietest table at the back of the library, she practically had it permanently reserved. Although she was as ever almost hidden behind a fortress of books. Only a her soft curls visible, she was muttering to herself.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harry's head tingled pleasantly, like delict little fingers tickling and massaging his scalp before shooting outwards, waves of long dark red and black wavy hair cascading over his shoulders like a waterfall. The luscious forest of thick, silky hair continued to grow till it reached the back of his caves. Full dark red and black tresses now framed Harry's face. A pleasurable warmth arose suddenly in intensity from Harry's privates, rising from the core of his inner being outward before quickly reversing. Then continuing inwards, the warmth spread and expanded, as it went, Harry now Rose felt her ass expand. It grew larger, softer, firmer, heart shaped and round to perfection. She cupped it, one cheek in each hand and gave them a squeeze. Very firm but with just enough cushion that Rose could sit on a hard stone floor and still be just as comfortable sitting on a feather pillow. Despite being new to her gender she was proud of how full and pert her sumptuous new ass was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n The teasing, tingling sensation rose, circling around her belly button and stomach. Pain flared across Rose's face, as an invisible corset pulled tight. Her waist shrinking ten whole inches. Her stomach became taught and firm with well defined muscle that would be clearly seen without clothes on. Her hips popped out wards making her now hourglass curves even more obvious and rich.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Meanwhile the warm magic flowed down into Rose's legs. The magic shaped, sculpted and lengthened her legs till they were long and curvaceous. The magic gave her legs gave her just the right amount of muscle to make sure they powerful and well built, but still soft and creamy enough to make silk feel like sandpaper. The magic also gave her cute, dainty feet with perfectly trimmed and polished toe-nails.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n The tickling warmth then turned northward. Her hands were soon as soft as the rest of her body and grew slimmer with longer more delicate looking fingers topped with magnificent nails, each painted in a perfect glossy coat of crimson. Rose's arms were just as slim, soft and strong as her legs. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n Rose lifted her hands to her chest as the warmth spread into that spot. She didn't have long to wait, as the tickling built behind each nipple. Each nipple swelling as she watched, the areola spreading wider and wider. The nipple rose, swelling and pushing far beyond what Rose had ever imagined possible. It was erect, and felt like it was thrusting forward an inch and a half and was as thick around as her thumb.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n As if in envy, she felt the magic spreading wider, and deeper. Soon the proud nip was atop a surge mound of abundant flesh. She wasn't used to estimating a girl's size, especially from this angle. But the weight growing in her outstretched palms suggested she was quite exceptional. As the spell continued, so did her expansion. A jolt of fear shot through her veins, as she hit E-cup then blew past it! The girls were beyond what Harry had ever wanted. Even Rose was a little nervous about being so busty. At last the growth slowed down till it stopped at an outstanding H-cup.t The breasts were very round, almost no sag, firm, and stuck=out from her body in just the right way to achieve maximum attractiveness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Finally satisfied, the magic raced upwards. She felt her face twist and shift. Cracks coming, as bones broke and adjusted. Looking at her body, she was oddly calm. With such an incredible body, she knew her face would be equally spectacular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n Looking in a mirror, she saw a radiant, regal young woman with creamy white skin, full, plump velvety, soft pouting lips. A tiny mouth, that even without doing anything seemed happy and royal in quality and only needed a smile or laugh to be complete. Her cheek bones were high and perfect. Her eyes, still like her mother were like emeralds, hinting at a feline nature She had sophisticated high-arched brows. She had a cute nose that combined with her glasses gave her a look that was adorable but spoke of a high intellect and inner strength.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n As she posed in front of the mirror, she watched as the Hogwarts uniform rippled into existence. The blouse just a size too tight, gapped as it fought to cover her chest. Beneath the blouse, a rather sturdy bra was weaving itself out of fresh air and the finest satin. She felt the soft cups cradle and support them. A mini-skirt was also appearing from nowhere, the simple cotton pleated item almost disappointing in it's plainness. Until Harriet saw just how short it was. It barely reached below the curve of her ass. Even the slightest breeze, or bending over would flash her arse. If the school hadn't been all-girl, the boys would be walking around with permanent erections.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n She flattened the skirt, giving a daring half-twirl as she watched it lift. A soft, feminine, girly gasp burst from her lips. The final part of her uniform was forming. She felt the slenderest thread of a thong slip between her cheeks. It dug deep, feeling like soft piano-wire, as the front joined the back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n A deep sense of self-worth and pride in her apparent power and appearance made her take a deep breath, and hold it proudly. In the mirror, she never looked more perfect. In fact! She looked like with a little training she could take down the Dark Lord right then! If there was ever an embodiment of a powerful Noble Lady of magic she was now it!</span></div></div>",

She blushed as she recalled the power that swept through the broom, and the feelings it evoked, as she clasped it tightly between her generous breasts. She recalled the whoops from the Slytherin towers, as she flew past on her broom. The masculine cheers, and whoops sounding more sexual, more predatory, than before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered also being a boy, and flying the same matches. It was real. That felt more real to her. She just knew it in her bones.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA hand landed on her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head snapped around to see a look of concern written on Pansy's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Drusilla, do you want me to fetch the nurse?\" she asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrunching her eyes shut, when she re-opened them her body was still abundantly female. She would rise to this challenge.

And, she swallowed, as <i>those </i>memories surfaced she constantly used her feminine wiles on Draco. Trying to insinuate herself into his life, trying to end up as his wife.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA vague sense of pity, flickered briefly in her heart, as she looked critically at the shorter, girl. She wasn't unattractive, just being a couple of inches shorter than herself. She was also reasonably blessed with curves, though nothing on Dru's scale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shiver... a shudder raced down her spine, as her feminine pride battled the sense that something was very wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Pansy got dressed herself, it was unselfconsciously. She was almost oblivious to Drusilla. Drusilla knew she couldn't fake that level of indifference, she must believe that Drusilla was truly Drusilla through and through. Besides, given her reputation for lies, distortions and malicious gossip. She wasn't about to start talking about her experiences as a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf she were lucky, she'd end up in the infirmary being examined for a confundus charm, and with a letter sent off to her father. She finished getting dressed herself. Though even at the end, when she was fully dressed, the Draco part of her soul still wanted more skin covered... a longer skirt... a thicker (more obscuring) jumper. She bit her crimson painted lower lip with those perfect white teeth, as she fought to work out who she could trust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, across the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was chortling to himself, imagining the plight of Draco, as she struggled with her hot body, and the confused, honesty of all around her. Unfortunately, what Harry didn't realise was, that the 'Rule Book', was a neutral artefact. The forces of Dark Magic carefully balanced against misuse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was oblivious to his own changes, as the book restored equilibrium to Hogwarts. The chosen one's room shifted, as Harry was transported to the girls' side of the Gryffindor Tower. Where she shared a dorm room with Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAbsently, she brushed her long hair. It was part of the ritual she had developed. Her friends introducing her to the benefits of pampering. After the years in the cramped cupboard, and even her own bedroom, she felt she had so much to learn about feminine grooming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were all happy to chip in with advice, and assistance, helping the chosen one change from a 'Scraggly, bedraggled mess', into a siren, worthy of the title 'Chosen One'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd learnt the spells to hide her scar, fading it almost to invisibility. Her corset was stiff, and supportive, and scarlet like the Gryffindor background.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/44/69/d6/4469d674124e2b213546b6aeb11df1e9.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wished, the guys would come up with a less cheesy line than <i>'I choose you'</i>....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to be polite, when it was delivered to her cleavage. She slid the Rule Book into her bag, and as she slid her jumper on, she heard Hermione sigh. \"That girl was a bookworm, but she just didn't have confidence in her own incredible body.\", Harriet thought to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to join me in the library?\" she asked, as Harriet, tugged her jumper so it wasn't rumpled over her bust. A bust that really didn't need any extra attention.</span></div></div>",

Hermione always considered herself to be plainer than she was. But Harriet had put that down to general insecurity, and her bookish nature and humbleness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wasn't as stacked as Harriet, but Harriet was sure she would soon complain about the sore shoulders, back pain, and the relentless attention from all the male students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh, she put her self-pity aside. And went out to see what impact her new rules had.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe spotted Drusilla in the Grand Hall, not a great surprise a breakfast time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPutting a wiggle into her hips, she sashayed down. After growing up with the Dursley's she had learned a peculiar restraint in the presence of the generous quantities of food the house-elves provided. Never taking too much, and on the rare occasions she spotted one, making sure to thank them politely and sincerely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she headed downstairs, she heard the shuffling, scuffling of footsteps behind her, as some students found certain distractions more interesting than where they were heading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding in the wide doorway of the hallway, students passed her by on either side. Her eyes were drawn to the Slytherin table, where a buzz of students were flitting around Drusilla. The offered chairs, compliments, and general attention were making her skittish as hell, and Harriet found her smile widening in appreciation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom there, she spotted the less than delighted looks from the Slytherin girls, who were being studiously ignored. Pansy Parkinson, and Millicent Bullstrode were shooting daggers at the fawning boys, and stabbing angrily at the food on their plate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA growing sense of unease settled on Harriet's bones, despite her enjoyment. A growing awareness of something wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a blink of an eye, she glanced downwards, and spotted her own generous bust, the cleavage that vanished to infinity, and the snug fit of her uniform. The damned book had transformed her too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt blood pounding in her ears, as she tried to work it out. She was determined not to faint. Shifting her gaze from the Slytherin table, she spotted Ron waving to an empty seat beside him. He looked entirely unsurprised by her sex. Unsteadily, she set off, in a daze to the empty seat. He was blushing crimson, as she got closer, his gaze drawn to her bust, with every shake and shimmy. And it was a bust that moved with the least provocation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sat down, the puzzle fell into place. Her hand caressing the book inside her bag. The rules were being applied without the taint of Dark magic. So his own petty act... and she had to admit it was petty, had rebounded on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe memory of her own lingerie, and her own past made her blush, as brightly as Ron. She knew that to restore herself to Harry Potter-ness, that equilibrium would return for Draco Malfoy too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer teeth ground in frustration.</span></div></div>",

She felt the consequences of her 'joke' against Malfoy, her own shoulders aching in self-inflicted pain. Perhaps, if the Rule is added with good intentions, then their wouldn't be this hefty, jiggly price to pay.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith her back half turned away from Ron, and his shovelling hands, she added a new Rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon Weasley, is short for Veronica Weasley.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven without turning back, she knew the rule had taken effect. The sound of food being heaved into his mouth was instantly quieter. Turning back, the wild mane of coppery hair framed a beautiful face. A sprinkle of freckles crossing the bridge of her nose. In line with Harriet, and Drusilla, Ronni had been very blessed with curves. Her mouth decorated with glossy crimson lipstick, and a recent addition the cream filling from the doughnuts adding to the texture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonni gave a quiet, burp of satisfaction. Some things remain the same, and as Ronni shifted, her buttons gapped, revealing a matching sprinkle of freckles decorating the top of her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least, this Rule was harmless, Harriet thought. Ronni certainly wasn't ogling her anymore, nor was she shyly averting her gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat blissful ignorant happiness only lasted a few moments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harriet felt an arm snake around her body from behind. Pulling her backwards to a masculine chest, while the hand groped one sumptuous breast. Her own gasp of surprise more pleasurable, and louder than she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Gerry!\" Ronni snorted, dismissively.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet squirmed in her seat, to find her face to face and inches away from Gerry Weasley. The Gryffindor Quidditch champion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How's my favourite <i>snatch</i>... snitch chaser?\" he purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis purr vibrated through Harriet's bones, and she wanted to curl up in his warm embrace. Sink into the manly scent of his clothes, and just live there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Brothers...\" Ronni said shaking her head, as if there were nothing else to say, or do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerry's thumb was now circling around Harriet's areola, teasing it.

Hermione was proving very distracting, and quite oblivious to her effect on both Ron and himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt hardly seemed fair, she was so intelligent, almost scarily so. He'd had some lucky escapes, and knew that she was the better wizard, and for her to be so beautiful, just didn't seem fair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrustrating she didn't even dress to accentuate her form, she just made even that uniform eye catching. As they entered the library, he put a compulsion spell on her. She gave a twitch, more of a spasm as it went into effect. But now she was compelled to tell the truth to Harry's questions for the next hour. Afterwards, she'd merely recall another long session in the library.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGently Harry guided her to a quiet section of the library. They were soon surrounded by ancient parchments detailing the history of the magical world. He wiped the dust off the chair and pulled it out for Hermione to sit down. Looking around he confirmed there wasn't anyone nearby. He sat opposite, and began his questioning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a smart girl, Hermione.... But what sort of thing makes you feel uneasy... uncomfortable.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry half-expected a slap to land, but Hermione started talking as if she were unburdening herself to a psychiatrist. Some of it Harry could barely believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't like Blondes, and while she knew they were just as smart as brunettes, she was glad she wasn't blonde.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also didn't like busty women, and again was glad that she wasn't ... overburdened. It was just too easy to dismiss a girl's brains, if her beauty was too obviously displayed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven with the spell, the words <i>obviously displayed</i>, were laced with contempt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry noted down all those little details. As he worked out how to change The Rules. Despite Hermione's candour, he wrote slowly and carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><b>The girls uniform is briefer, and more form fitting. The girls quidditch clothes are especially ... especially stream-lined.</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stabbed the full-stop at the end of the sentence. His mind already on the Ravenclaw keeper. She was completely breath-taking, curvy without being fat, and with a smile that could cure an injured soul. Looking up from the book he spotted Hermione's uniform was a lot tighter. It gave her a more prominent cleavage, as the girls were almost clamouring for attention like kittens that wanted attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span style=\"font-family:verdana, sans-serif\"><b>The stronger a witch's abilities, the more curvaceous she is.</b></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time, he kept his eyes firmly on Hermione as he drew the full-stop.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe effect was instant. She jumped straight to an EE-cup. But it wasn't something she was happy about. Her uniform was straining to contain her curves, but just as clearly, she was embarrassed by them. Her shoulders were hunched, and she hid herself behind an unravelled parchment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDeciding that was enough for the moment, Harry put the book away, and went back to work. Hermione sat as close to the table as she could, as she read about the history of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt a little sorry form Hermione, but not enough to change her back. His mind wandered towards what he could expand to show, a man's spell power. But it was just a little too uncomfortable to consider too closely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, the idea popped into his head of Draco as a female student. A rather flat-chested... almost a squib.</span></div></div>",

A teasing Ginny offering him, the chance to borrow some of her clothes. Quidditch practice was Ron hunched over her broom, trying to look as small, to be invisible without a cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione was not happy, with Ron, \"Well, they haven't made you a bimbo, yet.\" she said coldly. Her marks ensured, she'd never suffered that fate either. But for the witches, that was always a possibility. A compulsion to obey, learn a wifely role for those who weren't academic, or the proper place for those not dedicated to working on their studies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon unrolled his parchment, focusing all his attention on the History of Magic homework. His rump squishing, as he settled himself on the bench. Harry tucked the rule book away, as he thought back to his reaction when Cho Chang was caught talking in class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shrill Scottish protests rising in tone, as her chest swelled. The jumper relentlessly pushing forward, as E-cups obliterated her modest chest. The shimmying of her hips, as with staccato pops, they widened, giving her an ass that would belong on a centaur. Her eyes filled with fear as she felt the changes, weren't granted the relief of ignorance. Cho was kept fully aware of her changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry remembered his cock stiffening, at the sight, unable to rise from his seat for the rest of the class.

Hermione's hands rose to her face, her cupped hands covering it as best she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the opposite side of the bench, Ron's hands dove to his crotch. Guessing his punishment. His questing fingers confirming his fears. The fingers brushing over the pleats of his skirt, his trousers already a memory. Tentatively, they found no trace of any remaining masculinity. Ron's crotch matching the underwear she was wearing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShifting her weight from one plump, round, perfect ass cheek to the other. She didn't feel the relief, as the straining seams of the trousers were not the distraction from a minute ago. Already wide, they shifted another few inches broader.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA squeak of protest, came from Ron. As her hands slowly vanished from sight. Her developing bust, driving the former shirt, now blouse forward. Hands rising to her chest, she first cradled, hoping to hide the girls. But, their advance was relentless, the fuller nipples pressing into Ron's palms insistently. As if emboldened by the resistance, the girls surged forward. Ron's eyes widening as her bust grew beyond anything she'd seen. The angle alone made their growth doubly horrifying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry watched, trying not to be too obvious, as Hermione slipped a small mirror from her bag. The damage clear to her. Hermione's lips were glossy red, shimmering even in the muted light of the library. The colour eye-catching far beyond her level of attention. They were plumper too. Too plump, a slight gap revealing perfect teeth.

She was cursed with a very curvaceous body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, Snape's magic was designed to humiliate, as Harry's new uniform shifted again from the regulation uniform.

Her change from wizard to witch, now triggering the changes that'd show her power.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was mortified, as her bust surged forward. Already impressive, it was suddenly by far the largest in the class.

Alas, it now felt too far from the desk. Her shorter arms having to strain to reach her parchment. But she refused to drag the stool squealing closer, or draw any more attention to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven trying to get comfortable, she felt the extra padding in her ass. It was like sitting on her own massive cushion. A little unstable, and she didn't like the way, her bust shifted either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a potion bottle, Harriet caught her reflection. Hopefully the flask was making her lips look ruder, and fuller than they could possibly be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as she thought that, she felt that too familiar squirming in her lips, and they inflated even fuller.

Wider, fatter, pressing unmistakably against the feeble resistance of her blouse. Harry breathed in ragged gasps as her bust also swelled in size, gaining first one cup size, and then another.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLeaning back, to counter the extra heft, the strain on her shoulders.

Her cheekbones made her just a little jealous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut without being too obvious, she had to estimate Draco's magical strength. She was a B-cup.

Crabbe moved behind Ron, and started to give her a shoulder massage, he whispered compliments into Ron's ears as he breathed deeply the aroma of her shampoo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe look of horror on Ron's face, was amusing, but she was also frozen in fear. Hermione didn't like that at all. She directed a scowl over to Draco who looked like this was her plan. Clearly Draco was meant to be distracting / flirting with Hermione, but her stern look, along with her unfamiliar body ensured Draco just stood by looking awkward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took the opportunity, to open the Rule Book, and with a quick hand she added a few lines to the book. Despite her haste, her script was elegant and precise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vincent Crabbe was always and will always be a woman named Victoria Crabbe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGregory Goyle was always and will always be a woman named Georgia Goyle.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hermione watched the magic went to work. Behind Ron, the rounded figure or Vincent Crabbe shifted and stretched. The statuesque girl who replaced him was startlingly beautiful. Her slender hands suggested she'd be an excellent musician. She was slim of hip and waist, and unsurprisingly she was petite of bosom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione had always known that Crabbe and Goyle were sycophants, and stupid. It was nice to confirm that they weren't blessed with great magic. Although only an A-cup, it suited her frame, giving her an elfin quality, and contrasting nicely with his formerly more dwarven dimensions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had a harder time, seeing the changes that passed through Georgia Goyle. Goyle was a good Quidditch player, and Hermione had to admit, he was an excellent flier too. Secretly she liked how he looked... NOT his personality, but his stocky, strength. He wasn't fat like Crabbe, and he looked powerful.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoyle's outline shifted, and she watched as her ass swelled up soon taking on very feminine dimensions. \"She truly has junk in her trunk.\" Hermione allowed herself a smile. With a booty like that, she'd draw men's eyes whenever she walked passed by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer Slytherin jumper clung tightly and revealed that she had small waist. As Goyle's trousers shifted, they raced up her legs, becoming first shorts, and then transforming into a skirt. Hermione enjoyed the changes, the fun was enhanced by the fact that everyone else was completely unaware of the changes even as they were happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGoyle's legs were in tights, with slender emerald and silver stripes, they showed her as a Slytherin girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So... give it a thought... Harry.... Harriet.\" she purred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as she lifted herself from the table, Georgia Goyle did that with grace and poise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione was a little put-off, when she lifted Harriet's hand and gave it a kiss. Their eyes met, and she didn't want to think what passed between Harry and Georgia.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sashayed back to Draco's side, swinging her hips, knowing that both the former boys would be watching and enjoying the sight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione was also watching, and trying to balance her world view. Something was very wrong... She saw that Goyle body was very curvy, she wasn't just bottom heavy, she was an hour-glass. She tried tried to estimate how busty.... how powerful a witch she was... but the answer was deeply unsettling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia Goyle was about as busty as Hermione herself. She didn't want to stare too obviously at another girl's bust, but she had to make the comparison.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVictoria Crabbe ruffled Ronni's hair, and inhaled the fragrance deeply, before returning to Draco. She stood proudly opposite her curvier friend. Although Hermione wondered how things would alter between the three Slytherin girls when the difference between their magical strength was so clear... so undeniable.</span></div></div>",

But there were times, when she felt there should be more bridge-building between the houses. Between the two boys. She resolved to be more even-handed. She looked down at her own bust, brushing against the edge of the table. She really hated Harry for that little trick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen an idea struck her, and her smile returned.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPerhaps, just perhaps this ... well ... it wasn't a good thing.

Professor Snape would never feminise Draco, but there would be other teachers that he'd piss off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut here she was transfigured into a girl.

It was like a mating display as she thrust her bosom, her tits in Draco's face as much as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt wasn't quite what Hermione had in mind, but she hoped that with their relative magical strengths so visible, that Draco would stop provoking Harry -damn it- Harriet, and maybe Harriet would feel less need to antagonise a weaker wizard, or at the moment a weaker witch.</span></div></div>",

She drove home the final point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Even if your father hasn't picked out a husband, I'm sure your mother has considered some options.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco's gasp was all the answer she needed. The blow had struck even harder than she expected, as the Slytherin girls were fond of taunting Draco with this particular idea themselves. Suggesting with a mocking apology that they can no longer consider themselves as a future bride to young Draco, but they might find HER a suitable husband.</span></div></div>",

An I bet she'd want you in Beauxbatons, now.\" Ronni interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSilently, Hermione cast her projection spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.cosplayisland.co.uk/files/costumes/51/520/8.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.cosplayisland.co.uk/files/cos...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can just picture it.\" she closed her eyes, and let a smile warm her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It might suit you better, a less gifted girl.\" Hermione's hand slid back down Draco's chin, down her neck, and between her modest breasts. Pinching the neckline, she gave it a small tug upwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You see, they focus on other skills as well as magical. They aim to make a girl into a better woman.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe paused allowing that to sink in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think Professor Trelawney was guided by one of her visions... I mean... I can't think of another student that she punished in this manner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hummed a few bars from the wedding march.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She might have seen a wedding in your future, and you enjoying the honeymoon.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA feeble whimper came from Draco's throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's fun to imagine this... isn't it. Do you think your lover.... your husband will he be gentle, or will he be the kind to enforce his will, passionate and driven. With just a hint of roughness in his manner.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe purred as she mused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes. I can just see it. He would want to ensure you knew you past was truly in the past, and your boyish days were long gone. Yes, he'd want to keep you as girly as possible, and himself clearly in charge.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe almost felt sorry for Draco, while still being glad she wasn't bawling her eyes out.</span></div></div>",

She had it covered with her other notes and pieces of parchment. As a first test, she had to confirm this was a resounding success. Looking over the table she caught the beaming expression of Harriet, the Girl who lived. Harriet was oblivious to her original gender and even ownership of the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione didn't like enforcing a change on anyone. But this looked to have worked out rather well. Harriet was happy, and Draco was learning a valuable lesson. Glancing over the table she had to look away. 'Ron!' she hissed. He just wasn't getting the difference between the sexes, and the different things they weren't allowed to do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonni's hands slapped onto the tabletop with a wet slap. \"I wasn't doing anything...\" she fumed, but her rosy cheeks suggested that her thoughts were guiltier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I have an idea you might like...\" she teased Ronni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think Colin Creevey would like a new photography project... The transformation of Malfoy... from Ferret to Foxy...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet's mouth opened as she went to protest, having suffered the persistent attention of the snap happy shutterbug. But her teeth clicked back together, as she considered it only fair game given the model.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon was oblivious to this little pantomime. Already out of her seat, and heading off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a mock sigh. She ruffled through her papers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry, Harriet could you return this to the desk.\" Without looking up she pushed a random scroll towards Harriet. It was time for phase 2 of her experiment with this book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRolling her shoulders she realised how much they ached from the weight of her bust. Her eyes went to Harriet's even larger tits, and as she slipped out from the bench took in the fully cushioned rear that she also carried. It did nothing for her, just made her miss the taut and toned ones she preferred.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat should be her next test, she decided. To reverse, to rewrite the rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a firm stroke, she scored out the line about a witch's powers being matched by her chest. Almost instantly she felt the weight lift, and on the page, both the rule and the score vanished leaving a pristine page behind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied, she decided to add a little refinement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Draco Malfoy can barely avoid punishments, and ends up being re-gendered so often that Professor Snape thinks it is deliberate.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked, already imagining Draco looking forward to Professor Trelawney's punishment being over after the lunch break.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom behind, she heard the slightly out of tune whistling as Harriet returned to the table. With another stroke, she removed the line about 'The Girl Who Lived'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pitch of the whistling shifted, becoming deeper, but remained just as imperfect.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was into a familiar face that she looked as Harry sat down opposite her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think <i>we </i>spend enough time here.\" Harry suggested, slapping Hermione's book closed. Hermione carefully put her books in the bag, and the two friends were still deciding where to go even as they left the library.</span></div></div>",

So she was curious to see if she could catch him in the act.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe asked Harry if he had his map... It was so much easier to follow someone if you didn't have to keep an eye on the directly. He unfolded the map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>I solemnly swear I am up to no good.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as Harry spoke the words. Hermione felt a guilty shiver run down her spine. She didn't want anyone to think of her as 'up to no good'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lines of the mark were forming, darkening, deepening. Quickly she found the library, and surrounding corridors. Her eyes skipped past Dru Malfoy, until she realised with a start, that the punishment spell was stronger than she realised. She tapped the map, and Harry nodded his agreement. Target Acquired.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey were still following after a corner or two, when they saw Crabbe and Goyle join Drusilla. They were heading towards the Quidditch field, where some of the second year Hufflepuffs were having a knock-about on their brooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs they left the castle, there was laughter from ahead. Hermione and Harry picked up their pace to investigate. It was a group of Ravenclaw seniors. They had their wands drawn, and were looking nervously alert. But from their faces it was clear they were the source of the humour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne of them nodded towards Harry. He didn't know his name, but recognised him as a friend of Cho's. They exchanged nods, as he tucked his wand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draco really doesn't have the legs to carry off a skirt.\" he chuckled in passing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe wasn't sure what to say, so just kept walking, smiling and nodding. Once the Ravenclaws had disappeared around the corner, he pulled the map out. It confirmed what he suspected. It was now Draco Malfoy who was being escorted along by Crabbe and Goyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLurking in the gate of the castle they watched as the three Slytherins walked over towards the pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrabbe and Goyle were walking beside Malfoy as normal, although they were giving him a little more room than usual. Hermione guessed because Draco was still dressed in a skirt and blouse. Marcus Belby was right, Draco did not have the legs to carry off the school uniform. With his normal body restored, it hung on him rather badly. The ass rather loose, while the stitching at the waist was clearly on the verge of bursting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe poor fit was spoiling Draco's concentration as he tried to cast the spell to restore his uniform to fit his restored sex. Both his friends were studiously not paying attention. Their focus elsewhere.... anywhere else, Crabbe was staring intently at a rather plain cloud. While Goyle was watching the lake ripple, as it caught the Sun.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally with a grunt, the Gryffindors watched, Hermione sniggering in a very un-Hermione fashion, as Draco's skirt turned first into a pair of shorts, before they completely transformed into a proper pair of trousers. And finally, Draco's heels changed into a pair of plain flat shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with his successful spell. He tugged at his jumper assuring himself that everything was fine.</span></div></div>",

She didn't get a close look at their faces, but they both appeared rather pissed off. Hannah Abbot and Susan Bones. The bristles from their brooms whipping by, just inches above Draco's head.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrabbe nudged Draco and pointed after the fliers. There was a smug smile on his chubby face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco looked over, slowly shaking his head, \"You don't like that fat-arse mud-blood do you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis face fell, and she shook his head, setting a ripple running through his jowls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a cough, she startled the students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning around and crooking their necks backwards. Crabbe, Goyle and Draco looked up to see Madam Hooch hovering there. Her lips were pursed tightly, her eyes glittering with anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss Malfoy.... It seems you need another lesson in empathy, a more severe punishment....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... no... pwease...\" Draco's voice rose in pitch even as he whined his protest. A hand came to his mouth, as soon as he heard the lisp.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded towards the second year Hufflepuffs, \"At least they are <i>working </i>for a place on the house team. None of them, are <i>buying </i>their way through.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDraco's lengthening hair was now touching his shoulders. His face no longer sneering, it had an androgenous beauty. She let out a little squeal, as she dropped five or six inches in height. Draco had to look up to both Crabbe and Goyle now. The punishment was progressing apace, as Draco felt her manhood vanished, she didn't like to think of what was replacing it. She felt her nipples widen and develop. They protested against the roughness of her shirt. The girls continued to develop, until Draco was firmly Dru...  Her bust not overly developed, but just as impossible to deny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione smiled at the uncomfortable look on her face as she saw Dru's chest shift as a bra sprang into existence. Madam Hooch was true to her word,  Draco's clothes no longer fitted his body. The sleek black that he favoured at the weekend replaced with a very feminine outfit.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And since you prefer your girls not to have a fat-arse...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDru gave a strained gasp, as a corset formed.

The lumbering lunks, just exchanged glances, and obediently shook their heads.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nApparently satisfied, Madam Hooch floated higher before shooting off towards the Quidditch pitch.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is <i>w</i>idicu<i>w</i>ous...\" Dru stopped talking.

It was a result of some Weasley brother pranks that the photographers were reluctant to be in the school any longer than necessary.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked down, and took in her body with a sigh. This would be the picture sent to the Malfoy home... A slender girl, not a powerful masculine figure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a last glance backwards to the pitch and the players on their brooms, she lead her friends back towards the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione had entirely forgotten about the pictures too.

With a silent spell, she made a wolf whistle come from the other side of the courtyard. With a shifting shadow spell, she gave the impression of someone darting away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tension built in Dru's shoulders, as she hunched forward and ignored it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't ignore it, as Hermione cast another spell. This one creating a draught, lifting the slight skirt that Dru was wearing, and caressing her soft sensitive ass. She let out a high yelp, with an oddly excited tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer cheeks turned crimson, as she saw the effect her mewling had had on her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was some sniggering and glances as Dru joined the end of the cue for the students waiting to get their picture taken. There was usually a second glance, as people tried to recognise her. This was followed by a smile, as they guessed who would have Crabbe and Goyle at her shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fumed at the glances, smiles, and such. But none were foolish enough to do more than that.</span></div></div>",

It landed with a soft, but solid thump on the table between them. Harry resisted the urge to pull the ribbon sealing the parcel. Instead happy to watch as Draco's finger approached the knot, before snatching them back. Her fear clearly written on her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnhappy, but needing to end the tension, she snatched at the bow, and the parcel fell open. Revealing inside the powder blue outfit for Beauxbatons. The hat, the blazer.... the skirt, the blouse. Reaching out as if expecting them to disappear, she touched the shoes... the heels. But they didn't vanish, instead getting knocked to the floor. Each sounding the telling note of heels. A note no pair of shoes ever made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... I'm... I'm not... \" she stuttered unsteadily, \"This is only temporary... it's just...\" she looked to Victoria and Georgia looked less upset.

The hand that had touched those damned clothes. Flicking her wrist, she hoped to throw off the magic that was progressing upwards. A few sparks fell away, but the magic proceeded unslowed. Draco knew it was setting her form... setting her sex for the year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt least she hoped it was only for term time. The idea of spending Christmas like this terrified her. Her breath became ragged, as the ring of blue sparks changed to a crackling circle of magic as it reached her shoulder. Desperately she fought for some ray of light, some hope.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only the vaguest, but she clung to it. Surely Beauxbatons would keep her safe from boys, safe from those taunting thoughts, temptations that... she hated to admit it.

Her part-veela heritage giving her magical skills a boost. She was about as busty as Hermione, and devastatingly gorgeous. Hermione wasn't plain, she too was beautiful. But it felt somehow more mundane. The bookish Hermione still clear in her mannerisms, her focus more clearly on her studies and intelligence rather than more superficial things.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSitting down beside Harry, she kissed him softly on the cheek, before turning to smile sweetly at Hermione. It was only a friendly peck, and not the sort of thing that should have worried Ginny. However, Harry knew Ginny was concerned, both by her familiarity, her ... allure, and the bond they shared through their Triwizard experiences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fleur adjusted her seat, shifting closer to Harry, her bra pressed firmly against her blouse. The delicate lacy trim clear through the material, instantly Harry felt himself stiffen, her proximity was intoxicating.

Her rear was the only thing that had a slight benefit in this oversexed form \u2014 the benches and chairs of Hogwarts were made of hard oak, and the times that Ron had risen from a History of Magic class sore as a soldier were numerous. But the way it <i>oozed</i> over a seat and <i>wiggled</i> whenever he walked was more than a little discomfiting, to say the least.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut what was the most worrisome was the classes that lay ahead. Ron had reached a precipice of femininity; Trelawney had hit him with the most severe body-hexes for talking during another student\u2019s crystal ball observation. The next penalty would be a tipping point from \u2018beautiful witch\u2019 to \u2018three-quarters Veela. Ron didn\u2019t need his arms to be <i>weaker</i> for the next Quidditch game.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, they could hit him with \u2018Bimbonicus\u2019...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon shuddered mid-sashay. <i>That</i> would be bad. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe spell had been shown to the class during a particularly interest Defense Against the Dark Arts class. A spell formerly used to targets witches who had wreathed themselves in countless beauty charms, the curse would have little-to-no effect on a witch or wizard who hadn\u2019t delved into magical cosmetics, its effects less debilitating than a poorly cast \u2018Stupefy\u2019.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut on any magic-user enshrouded in <i>half</i> the beauty enhancements on Ron, it would have a far more dramatic impact. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLupin had demonstrated on a piece of oak ensorcelled with <i>Labio Rosso</i>, which gave the dead limb a rather amusing picture of red lips. The wood had shifted and shaped its way into a statue of cartoonishly-proportioned woman, its timber hair a bright gold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough originally conceived as a harmless prank against self-absorbed witches in the 2nd century, the spell had been used to subdue Damien la Fey, a rather vain descendant of Camelot\u2019s greatest enemy. With all the charms the lad had put on his skin to keep it unblemished, all it took was a muttered word and an offhand wand-jab from a treacherous advisor and the greatest threat of the magical world was swimming in his own silk robes in a pink flash, absentmindedly giggling at how \u2018mega-huge\u2019 his \u2018boobies\u2019 were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe curse was extraordinarily easy to counteract, a mere ten-minute session of unjinxing, but anyone under its spell would be too interested in the rugged sex, fashion, and tittering at the lightest amusements to do so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd teachers in Hogwarts could choose to punish their students with it, other students warned that they would join their cretinous compatriot if they counteracted the curse. Fortunately, any teacher that liked you enough \u2014 usually your House Professor \u2014 would revert the curse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeville had been hit with it in Potions after his astronomy-acquired breasts knocked down his classwork cauldron. The effect was dramatic \u2014 the short-haired nervous girl (he had been punished an <i>awful</i> lot that week,) into a bodacious, ditzy blonde too vacuously concentrated upon chewing her hunk of Drooble\u2019s to cover the expanse of cleavage revealed by her robe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeville was well-loved in the Gryffindor Commons, fortunately, and a contingent of female students had taken the ensorcelled Neville into their dorms to prevent him from making or reciprocating the many passes at/of a large number of male students. Herbology was the first class for Gryffindors the next day, and Professor Sprout spent the first ten minutes of class fussing over and reversing the punishment on the embarrassed Neville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately for her, Ron had no such allies in the teachers, save for McGonagall and Hagrid. The next class of the former was a holiday-and-a-day away, and the latter was on leave. He could hardly count any female Gryffindorians among his fast friends either due to a few too many overheard judgments and lewd remarks; save for Hermione \u2014 who would probably see the hex as a cross that Ron had to bear \u2014 and Ginny \u2014 who would probably just laugh uproariously at her brother-turned-bimbo.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf worse went to worst though, Ron was at least thankful that he was in a two-bed room with Harry \u2014 punished students were bunked in the room of their original gender, to their usual protest. Ron allowed himself a sigh of relief. Harry would never do anything untoward.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div align=\"center\">~~~</div><br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny turned the page on her History of Magic textbook, kicking her feet idly underneath the library table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe fervently wished that she could be there for the fifth years\u2019 Herbology class. Pomona Sprout had a habit of reading the essays the class of their turn-in, and when her eyes swept across Ron\u2019s parchment \u2014 which confused the Wiggentree for the Flitterbloom, a mistake that one could make only if they hadn\u2019t been paying attention for the balance of their classes the year so far (An assumption that was actually fairly accurate to Ron\u2019s experience, so it\u2019s not like she wouldn\u2019t <i>deserve</i> this).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny\u2019s revenge was motivated by two things: the first being Ron\u2019s every judgment of a witch either lewd or ascribed as an inherent flaw to their gender. The second was the fact that her stupid brother kept <i>drawing Harry\u2019s eye, the bitch.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhich one would the petite Professor choose? A bust enhancement, turning every walk into a symphony of shakes and stumbles? A hair beautifying charm, giving her locks Rapunzel-length.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny frowned as she considered the \u2018Bimbonicus\u2019 curse. That\u2026 probably wouldn\u2019t be the best result. A Ron that might flirt with <i>her</i> Harry would be a dangerous opponent, even though her brother would come out of it with enough humiliations for Ginny to poke at for years to come.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill, she had nothing to fear. Harry wouldn\u2019t do that to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProbably.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The buttons undone, the strain of Ron's wide hips started to work the zipper downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Ron fought to hold the fastener in place, to battle to keep her skirt in place.

Moments later, grasping it firmly, she tugged it down to the bottom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStanding up, she wiggled the skirt off her hips, letting it fall to pool at her feet. The relief was clear on Ron's face, as she stepped out of the skirt, and sat back down in just her underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If we can move on now?\" Professor Sprout said, drawing everyone's attention back to the head of the class.

Once everyone else had filed out, she spared Harry a glance before dismissing him as irrelevant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you know the reason for the extra punishment?\" she asked towering over the cowed Ron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne by one she listed the stupid, and obvious mistakes that Ron had blindly copied down in his haste to complete the homework. Even Harry winced at some of the howlers Ron had put down. Mistakes even a first year shouldn't have... wouldn't have made!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you act the idiot... Then you'll play the bimbo role fully.\" she said rising up to her full, unimpressive height.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon could only nod, Harry watching spotted her fuller rump tighten in embarrassment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you trying your hardest?\" she asked. Harry was thinking the same himself. Was Ron lazy, or just afraid to try. Certainly Fred and George had a natural aptitude, Ginny was studious as a Ravenclaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no shame if you're not academic.\" Pomona softened her tone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Some witches prefer the pampered life of being a trophy... a breeder.\" Raising her head, she fixed Ron with an unblinking gaze.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You do come from good stock...\" She observed, measuring Ron like she would a plant ready for cross fertilization. Rather than assessed for her blood status. Harry smirked to himself, imagining Professor Sprout as a dark witch. The thought was ridiculous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suggest you apply yourself, unless you want to drift into that role. Do you want to be defined by your body... Can you imagine carrying about a fuller bust?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded to Ron's impressive bust. Ron cradled it protectively, as if she were afraid it would expand just from being mentioned. Certainly, she was mortified enough to dedicate herself to her homework now<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If she can?\" Harry thought distantly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you need help, you can consult your classmate Neville Longbottom... even your sister has a better understanding than... than This!\" her voice almost shouting. Her rage kept as withering as possible. Ron only nodded her head, and silently cursed Ginny. Knowing if she confessed that it was Ginny's fault she'd still be punished. A grunt, and a vague lift of her head, Professor Sprout mutely dismissed Ron from her class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wiped away the tears with the backs of her hands then turned to leave with Harry.</span></div></div>",

Like it tended to go with Ron, when one thing went wrong he just spiraled and he was very close to spiraling into full time bimbohood and eventually baby making if Harry didn't help him.  Harry thought about just erasing the feminization punishment from the Rule Book, but he was a bit hesitant.  He still thought maybe he could help Ron out through good old fashion studying and hard work.  Besides, he still hadn't seen Draco or his cronies get punished enough to undo it yet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut that thought changed when Ronni muttered a defeated, \"Come on Harry, I actually did my potions homework so at least Snape won't make this worse...I hope.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry froze in his steps, he had completely forgotten his potions homework.  And Harry knew Snape would use this as an excuse and punish Harry to the maximum and bimbofy him so quickly Harry will be boy crazy and in nothing but a DD cup bra by the end of class.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow that his own body and mind were on the line Harry immediately got out the Rule Book and found the page where he wrote the feminization rule.  Breathing a sigh of relief knowing he'd dodged a bullet with Snape he continued to follow Ronni to the dungeons.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's eyes went wide as he saw that, despite getting rid of the feminization punishment, Ron was still Ronni.  The red headed girl looked back with a smile, \"Like, come on Harry, the git Snape is still going to be there waiting for us, what's wrong?  You forget your potion homework.  Here, you can copy off mine.\"  Ronni smiled ash she held out her scroll that Harry glanced at and saw that it was signed, 'Ronni Weasley'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHastily Harry copied the homework as he tried to rationalize what happened.  He figured that because he erased the rule while Ron was punished as Ronni, she must have taken Ron's place.  So the only way to get his best friend back to the way he was, he'd have to re-add the feminization punishment rule and help Ron out with actual hard work and studying.  Harry finished copying the homework, and to his surprise, Ronni stuffed her homework between her ample breasts which made Harry's eyes go wide and for a brief moment actually thought this might not be the worst way this could have turned out.</span></div></div>",

Some people would say it was his Gryffindor chivelry and honor, other's would say it was guilt or stupidity, but as they walked he pulled out the Rule Book and re added the feminization punishment rule into the Rule Book.  Suddenly the previously confident Ronni's mannerisms turned back into that of the nervous Ron again.  Breathing a sigh of relief that he friend was back, at least mentally, the two arrived outside the potions classroom where the Gryffindors and Slytherin's were waiting for class to start.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was disappointed to see Draco hadn't been punished at all, maybe he was on his best behavior with this rule in place.  But on his sides were two of the most beautiful girls Harry had ever seen.  Two tall and lanky beauties in nothing but their underwear with enormous breasts that were practically falling out of black lace bras.  Both of them seemed to be unable to keep their hands off of Malfoy.  Seeing Harry and Ron arrive Draco sneered, \"Ah, it's the hero Potter and his pet bimbo weasel.\"  The Slytherins all laughed at the joke as Ron blushed in embarrassment and Harry put the Rule Book away to reach for his wand.  But before he could, Snape opened the door.  Looking at the scene before him Snape said, \"Slytherin's line up.\"  The Slytherin's did as their head of house said and with one lazy wave of his wand, any Slytherin with feminization punishments were cured without a second thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was disappointed and a little disturbed to see those two gorgeous girls had turned back into Crabbe and Goyle who looked a little embarrassed, but took their seat in class quickly.  Ron looked at Snape half hoping to have his punishments undone, but of course Snape just looked down at the Gryffindors with disgust and went to the front of the room to start grading homework before starting his lecture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry sat with Ron and Neville for class as Hermione still seemed a bit disappointed in Ron's lack of school dedication and didn't want him copying off of her.  As Harry and Ron handed in their homework, with a lurch in his stomach as Harry remembered he'd just finished copying Ron's homework word for word.  If Snape thought Harry copies off of Ron there was no way Snape wouldn't punish him to the maximum of his abilities, but if he thought Ron copies off of Harry, well...there was only so much more that could be done to Ron.  He might be hit with a 'bimbonicus' curse so powerful Ron would be boy crazy for days if not weeks.  Nervously Harry watched as Snape graded the papers one by one before finally reaching an essay that he obviously wasn't satisfied with.  Lifting his wand he pointed it at Harry's table and prepared for the worst.</span></div></div>",

He looked up to look at the very tall girl in the eyes.  Harry had never seen this girl before, she had prominent freckles and long red hair the reminded him of Ginny in all the best ways, although this girl's chest put Ginny's to shame and the look on her face showed she seemed more embarrassed by the run in than Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, it's my fault too, I should have said something but I just...\"  The girl said flushing even redder to match her hair.  As the girl trailed off, another red headed girl walked up beside her, \"No need to be nervous <i>big sis.</i>. It's just Harry.\"  And then Ginny hugged the girl from the side and made sure she gave a quick rub to one of the girl's breasts.  The girl gave a quick high pitched yelp that earned a \"Shush,\"  from the librarian Madam Pince.  Harry's eyes went wide and gave the tall girl in her lingerie a long look up and down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ron?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've been calling her Ronni,\"  Ginny said with a laugh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't laugh!  This is all your fault Ginny.\"  Ron said very quietly, he seemed to be wanting to avoid the wrath of the librarian and risk any more punishments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What in the world happened?\"  Harry asked continuing to take in Ronni's long legs, something he'd never admired in Ron before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny spoke up, \"Well, we were just playing some exploding snap outside of Transfiguration when Slytherins's class ended. It seemed Goyle got a few punishments in class.  And Draco the prat had his hands all over Goyle and wasn't letting up.  So I cast a bat bogey hex on him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And I was laughing at it, because it was bloody hilarious, but just my luck,\"  Ronni groaned as she continued the story, \"Snape turned around the corner at that moment and saw me and assumed I did it.  I tried to complain about it and tell him what happened, but he gave me triple the punishment!  The old miserable bat.\"  Ronni groaned looking down at her punishment as Ginny gave another quick hug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks for taking the punishment for me, you're the best sister a girl could ask for.\"  Ginny gave Ronni another hug as Ronni grumbled, \"But I don't want to be a sister.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry made a mental note to himself to be extra careful around Snape, or maybe make an exception for himself in the Rule Book when he had the chance, but Ronni's complaining wasn't over as she looked at Harry and said, \"And you know what the worst part is?\"</span></div></div>",

They finally made it down to the dungeons.  From the look on Ronni's chest, it seemed very cold down there so she immediately got close to the cauldron she'd be forced to share with Draco to warm up.  Harry took his place next to Herminone who looked confused and disappointed by Ron's new look.

At first, he wasn't sure, if it was real or not. But, as the lesson went on, Harry was sure that Ronni was putting on some feminine mannerisms. To tease Draco Harry thought, at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe seemed to simper around Draco, allowing Draco to steal accidental caressing contact, with only trilling giggles. She walked with a girly sway in her hips, and reaching for a high shelf she flashed the top of her stockings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione snatching the pestle from Harry's startled hands, she ground the ingredients in the mortar with a fury that made Harry step back a pace.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Ronni dropped a book, she bent from the waist to pick it up. Flashing half the class a view deep down her cleavage. The other half getting an eyeful of her stockings, suspenders, and panties. The smile as she straightened, telling the whole class she knew what she was doing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBelatedly, Harry realised, Ronni's transfiguration was more than physical. Hermione's eyes still burned with unsuppressed fury, as she watched her boyfriend giggle and smile at Draco Malfoy. She spared a glare for Harry, as he took her hand suddenly. Only snatching it back, as she spotted it was the wrong ingredient at the wrong time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked chastened, but didn't apologise, as she swapped it for the right one. Her lips moved in a silent curse, whenever she looked in Snape's direction. Until finally, the cauldron was bubbling contentedly, and they took turns stirring the softly boiling mix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quick look to the clock confirmed there was only a few minutes until the class ended. Hermione spooned a small portion into a phial for marking, while Harry snuck a second stoppered phial of the mix into his pocket.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThankfully, Hermione had put the phial aside when she noticed Ronni kiss Draco on the cheek, as the class ended. Harry shook his head in disbelief, as Hermione's hand clenched into a tiny fist.

But Hermione sat down and (of course) started reading a book so Harry just paced back and forth.  He thought if he kept moving it would help him keep his mind off of his new body, but each step practically rippling through his body made the changes all the more obvious.  He'd definitely have to remember to stay on Hermione's good side, because her not helping with homework was no longer the worst thing she could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after a few minutes a Slytherin finally came.

As he bounced that leg up and down, as if she were riding a horse. Ronni held onto Draco's shoulders for balance, as his leg bounced and bucked. Ronni giggled, and roared with laughter, as she gave Draco an eyeful of her just as mobile cleavage. At times she released one of Draco's shoulders, as she had to heave one breast or the other back into her straining lingerie.</span></div></div>",

The leg Ronni was bouncing on suddenly went stiff as Draco shouted out in pain and pushed Ronni off onto the ground.  Draco grabbed his crotch ran away screaming in a high pitches yell.  Harry was afraid to ask what Hermione had done to him, but there was no time.  As every Slytherin in the common room was standing up and looking at Hermione and Harry and getting ready to take action.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione called out, \"Grab Ron and run!\"  Hermione blasted open the common room door with her wand and Harry held his wand up and said, \"Accio Ronni!\"  The confused girl who was starting to chase after her love potion influinced boyfriend suddenly floated in the air and shot towards Harry.  Harry managed to catch the tall red head and fell on his inflated ass, and was now actually greatful Hermione had given him the extra cushion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut there was no time for this.  Hermione helped Ronni and Harry up and the trio made a break for it running as fast as they could.  They took every shortcut in the castle they knew of to get away from the Slytherin mob that was chasing them down, but finally the three friends stopped in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, a place no one besides them were foolish enough to go into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonni looked around the bathroom and moaned, \"Where is he?  Where is my Dracy poo?\"  Both Harry and Hermione gagged at this.  Hermione did what she did and pulled out a book, \"I'll start looking for a counter spell or antidote to the love potion.  You keep Ron distracted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you think you can turn me back now?\"  Harry asked Hermione hoping to get rid of Pansy Parkinson's punishment body, but Hermione was already in book mode and not listening at all.  Harry approached Ronni who was busy looking in a mirror practicing making out with Draco.  Harry figured Ronni and Hermione were both distracted so he could come up with his own solution.  Harry went into one of the girls stalls, sat down, and pulled out the Hogwarts Rule Book.  Harry muttered to himself as he dug for a quill in his new skirt, \"Maybe I should make it so only Slytherine's get the punishments.\"</span></div></div>",

She recognised those voices, the closest thing to friends she had in the whole school. She rushed through the pipes, heading back to her favourite, and least favourite bathroom in the whole school. Erupting from the toilet, Myrtle sent a spout of water gushing ahead of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did a double-take, when she saw Millicent Bullstrode, and Elizabeth Tuttle. The water rather announced her presence, but she saw the mannerisms of her friends beneath those ridiculous bodies.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harry.\" She said pointing a spectral finger towards Millicent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"and... Hermione Granger.\" she said less certainly as she pointed towards Liz.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Harry, you have been a naughty boy... to end up with those curves...\" she blushed, a faint hint of pink colouring her ghostly white cheeks. \"And who'd have thought Hermione Granger would ever earn a punishment...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry flushed, too aware of her busty body, and the Hermione stung by the idea of her being punished. But, she didn't react to Myrtle's verbal jabs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Harry... you're book... It's ruined.\" But she quickly turned her attention back to the still smitten Ronni. Who was preening, and practising coquettish looks to ensnare Draco with her womanly wiles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was suddenly far more concerned with the rule book. Every page saturated, it'd take time to dry, and at the moment was useless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Can we turn back, now.\" Harry asked in a hiss. Nodding her head towards Myrtle, as if blaming her for his own urgency.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, 'No', without looking to Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My Dracy... I want my manly Malfoy.\" Ronni insisted. \"I felt his love for me...\" she flushed, as she recalled the bulge she'd inspired in her man.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Ronni...\" Hermione said stroking Ronni's face soothingly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Draco's gone... She'd rather be a witch than with you!\" Hermione said softly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was nothing soft in Ronni's expression, as her head snapped around. Fire burning behind her eyes, \"Liar!\" she spat the word angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry flinched, and was impressed that Hermione didn't. \"I'm sorry, sweetie... I can show you...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving her hands, as if cupping an Quaffle, a cloud of smoke formed in the middle. Chanting, it puffed wider, filling the gap. As Ronni watched, hunting for the love of her life. The colours became apparant within, the green hue of the Slytherin common room was clear. The image shifted, as it attached to one figure in particular.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA very, busty blonde was raging, the words unheard. Everyone could tell she was swearing and outraged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That's Draco now...\" Hermione kindly told Ronni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/03/fe/3e/03fe3ed3b6b9fb84bdf4fe36114df6db.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/03/fe/3e/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't mention that it was her spell that gave Draco such a voluptuous body, or ensure it would last so long. Ronni recognised her future lover, despite the body, and she deflated. Shoulders collapsing, as she took in his new body. She couldn't compete with that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe collapsed to sobbing, allowing Hermione and her to sink to the floor. Rocking her softly back and forth like a child she muttered nonsense to calm and soothe Ronni.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Ronni's head cradled, she whispered to Harry that they'd have to wait out the potion. Keeping her separate from any temptations, until it left her system. She nodded towards the wall of toilet cubicles to underline the ultimate end to Ronni's enchantment.</span></div></div>",

Don't worry, it shouldn't be but an hour or so.\"  Harry thought about bring up he'd be willing to make the sacrifice of taking Ronni's affections so other boy's wouldn't, but decided he liked living so he went back to the books.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally after a half hour or so Harry found a drying spell intended for clothes, but surely it would work just as well on a book.

Alas, it wasn't as satisfying with her own curvier body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt had also taken the delight from her, as Hermione had reveal the transfigured Draco.

Yes...\" Hermione observed impatiently, \"You're still male deep down, despite that body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nComparing her arm against Ronni's body, she could see that Ronni's aura was pinker...

It makes it so that how that person feels and looks at that moment does not ever change.  It's usually something people do to make sure they stay in love with each other.

Ok, we know the problem, so how do we get it off of Ron to fix this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione looked uncertain, \"That's the thing Harry, I don't know if there's anything we can do, this bracelet contains the power of love magic, one of the most powerful types of magic there is, trying to simply override it could lead to disastrous consequences.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry thought that maybe his Rule Book might be stronger, but that might have to be a last resort, \"So, you're saying whenever someone get's one of those bracelet puts on, they're stuck like that forever.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well,\"  Hermione pondered, \"The bracelet can fall off, but it's a very specific circumstance.  The person of put on the bracelet has to fall in love with someone else.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry groaned, \"So unless pigs fly and Malfoy shows he's capable of love we're screwed.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione looked like she was about to cry as she looked at Ronni kissing the token from her 'boyfriend' Draco.</span></div></div>",

And then Harry got out his wand and cast, <i>\"Wingardium leviosa,\"</i>. Harry hovered the love potion tainted tart and began to float it towards Draco and Ronni who were busy pushing their hands in each other's clothing.  As he moved the tart close to Ronni's face he said, \"I know Ron, even if he'd been hit with avarta Kadavera he'd still get up to eat some sweets, I have no doubt this will work.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSure enough the sweet treat got the attention of Ronni long enough for her to break a kiss with Draco.  She eyed the sweet with a piece of her drool (or perhaps it was Draco's) and made a grab for it.</span></div></div>",

She took one bite and swallowed the whole thing, she turned to start making out with Malfoy again when she stopped dead in her tracks.  With little regard to his safety, Ronni pushed Malfoy away and almost sent him tumbling down the grand staircase.  Ronni looked at Harry and sashayed over to him with poise and grace which Ron had never walked with before.  Harry loved watching Ronni's skirt sway with each step and soon the tall red head was practically on top of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I love you so much Harry, take me away from here.\"  And she gave Harry the longest, deepest kiss he'd ever had, and considering how Ginny could get that was saying something.  Harry dropped his book bag and just held on for dear life.  Harry was enjoying the moment so much he didn't see Hermione glaring daggers at him.  \"Not only did you steal a love potion from class, you used it on MY BOYFRIEND!\"  Hermione looked like she was about to snap.  Harry broke the kiss and quickly said, \"I did it for Ronni!  It was either this or Malfoy and this is a much better option.\"  Harry couldn't continue the explanation as Ronni's tongue was now taking up space in Harry's mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For you maybe.\"  Hermione said her eye twitching.  She grabbed her two friends by their ears like a disapproving teacher, \"Let's find some privacy, there are too many eyes here.\"  Sure enough if Harry hadn't been so distracted by Ronni he'd have seen that half the school was watching him make out with Ronni by the Grand Staircase including a furious looking Draco Malfoy.  Hermione lead her friends away from everyone to find some privacy.  Unfortunately for Harry he'd left his book bag behind, with the Hogwarts Rule Book inside ready for someone to pick it up.</span></div></div>",

Ginny grabbed a practice quaffle and the two had a mini practice as she tried to get the ball past Ronni, but each time he jokingly deflected the ball with his ass, hips, or breasts.  One particularly tricky shot off Ronni right breast caused him to say, \"Ouch, careful Gin, these things are sensitive.\"  And Ronni just reached his hand under his uniform and started rubbing the sore spot of his breasts.  Harry didn't even notice he'd been staring with his mouth open until Ginny gave him a glare and gave a fake cough to get his attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh uh, right.  I think it's time for the game, let's go team!\"  Harry said to change the subject and stop himself from staring at Ronni any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quidditch stadium was packed, it was good for Harry to be back on the quidditch pitch without having to worry about the Rule Book or anything except finding the golden Snitch.  The Gryffindor team faced off against their opponents Slytherin.  They Slytherin team consisted of 4 giant brutes of men who looked like they had more braun than brain, Malfoy the seeker looking as sleazy as ever, and on his right and left were two girls with Beater bats who it took Harry a minute to recognize they were Crabbe and Goyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry had seen Crabbe just an hour earlier but somehow it seemed he'd gotten a few more punishments in that time period.  Both he and Goyle had super puffy lips, the fattest asses Harry had ever seen, and specialty quidditch uniforms they were just a black set of underwear with green trimmings.  And the mounds of flesh those uniforms were barely holding in, well, Harry wasn't even sure if Crabbe and Goyle's brooms could get those babies off the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I didn't know they could get that big.\"  Ronni muttered and Harry nodded in agreement.  Crabbe and Goyle noticed the two Gryffindors staring and both flushed red and unsuccessfully tried to hide behind the much smaller Malfoy. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the game began as Madam Hootch released all the balls into the air and the players took flights.</span></div></div>",

They were focused on hunting for the bludgers, and they missed the Gryffindor seeker who took a break from hunting for the snitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFlying stealthily, he was within inches, before he purred, \"Hello girls...\" startling a feminine squeak from Crabbe, and a squeal of outrage from Goyle. Neither was intimidating in their current bodies, and Harry was tempted to give them both a 'friendly' pat. His eyes obviously fixed on their juicy rumps. Presented so proudly, and those lush thighs clamped around their brooms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Harry was caught off guard, as a pair they elbowed him in the stomach. Their scrawny arms strong enough to wind him, and leave him breathless and vulnerable. Slender fingers, with scratching nails worked at his hands. Drawing blood, until they pried them free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a wrench of Harry's broom, the pair send him falling from the broom to the ground below. This foul behaviour went un-noticed, as the focus of the game, and Madam Hooch was with the quaffle at the other end of the pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was a short fall for Harry, with Crabbe and Goyle already shooting off. Harry's broom dropped automatically to almost brain him as it landed without it's rider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry only vaguely hearing the gong. Looking around, as he struggled to marshall his thoughts and remount the broom. He saw the points unspool from the scoreboard, as Gryffindor lost 20 points in an instant. Harry cursed his distraction, and being outwitted by the two dullest students in the year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, that paled compared to the personal consequences of touching the grass before the snitch had been caught. Harry was suddenly just as girly as Crabbe and Goyle.

At least these clothes were cute.  And the red and yellow looked much cuter than that garish green and silver those two hussies on Slytherin brooms were wearing.  <i>'Why was that red headed girl being so mean to me?'</i>. Thought Harry as she looked at the crowd who were chanting all sorts of lovely things to the new girl.  Instead of getting back on her broom to try and limit the damage of the Quidditch punishment, she just waved at the crowd and began to pose to get them to hoot and holler even louder.  After over a minute of this, Harriette felt two people grab her under her arms and lifted her in the air.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Up you go Harry, let's get you back on your broom so you can find that snitch.\"  Fred said grabbing Harriette's broom from midair. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yup, if you stay on the ground any longer you'll be dumber than a troll, or worse, Crabbe and Goyle.\"  George said making sure Harriette was seated on said broom.  The twin red heads flew off to protect Ginny from a rogue blunger leaving Harriette to float there for herself.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriette had no cares or ideas what a snitch or troll, or anything was.  All she knew was she saw some cute strong boys and wanted to follow them.  \"What are their names?  Gred and Forge?\"  Harry got a firm grasp of her broom and for the rest of the match followed Fred and George around occasionally trying to play with their hair or touch their muscles, but Fred and George knew not to tempt getting a penalty mid game unlike their seeker, so they just played keep away from the twin crazy girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally Draco caught the snitch giving Slytherin the win, the Gryffindor team went back to the locker room giving their ditzy seeker glaring looks along the way, but didn't scold her since they knew she couldn't take in much complicated info in this state.  Ginny quickly dressed and talk Harriette, \"We'll be having a talk later once you're able mister.\"  And she left in a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriette didn't know what she was talking about, but figured she was just jealous.  Harry did have a much sexier figure than the little red headed girl.  But the tall red headed girl, Ronni, came up to Harriette and said, \"What were you thinking?  You know the mid game penalties are pretty nasty at Hogwarts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sure, yeah, whatever.  Say, what do you know about those two cute boys who look like each other?\"  Harriette asked Ronni.  Ronni blushed embarrassed that his best friend was calling his big brothers 'cute'.  \"I know they're going to Hogsmead soon and...\"  That was all Harriette needs as she skipped out of the quidditch dressing room and went after the twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll have to put a damn leash on her,\"  Ronni said to himself looking at his best friend skip off.</span></div></div>",

Then 'Mione was much bustier with the changes, a solid F-cup, and still pert and perky as hell. Ginny was a firm D-cup, and Harry rather liked the spray of freckles across the girls. He was surprised, to see that Luna was just as generous D-cup, although edging towards DD.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nObediently, the girls followed, the occasional giggle coming from them, as they discussed their new needs. Harry found himself blushing, with their frankness. His mouth going dry, as he pictured the scenario the girls were picturing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWalking was harder with his growing erection. Keeping his books and parchments low, he managed to hide his excitement. Although he rather suspected that most of the students... male students were feeling the same. The number of books, bags, parchements and so forth held over crotches seemed to confirm Harry's guess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry also enjoyed the view of the other witches on display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a long instant, Harry reached the Gryffindor common room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas as the portrait swung aside, the scene of debauchery was beyond Harry's imagination. Feeling self-conscious, he backed away. Behind him the girls scuffled back too. He wasn't sure how long he could keep his cool. The others were all reacting as if this was normal.... for them it was. Even the girls were feeling frustrated, now. Harry felt teasing hands exploring his body. But for his first time, he wanted a little privacy. Then the idea struck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The Room of Requirement.\" Harry blurted out, a little louder than he intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA renewed burst of giggling came from the girls, as they imagined a whole new world of fetishes and scenarios.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling the pressure, he practically ran up the stairs. At the top of one set, he turned to check the girls were still following.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sight was gorgeous. The dancing busts a symphony of erotic movement. A rippling dance of abundant flesh. Ginny moved with a more sinuous grace her hips swaying as she ascended the stairs more smoothly. Harry's mind was momentarily on Quidditch. Dearly he wanted to be Ginny's broom, those perfect thighs wrapped around him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA squeak of excitement slipping free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We'll keep going 'til you're dehydrated.\" Hermione told the eager Gryffindor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then go further, until you be for mercy.\" Luna added. Her eyes twinkling with delight and promise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry wasn't sure whether she was joking or serious, though he was sure to enjoy finding out which.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally they reached the right floor. As the four of them walked towards it. The wall retreated into an intricately carved doorway, wooden doors formed from the stony wall. The room forming behind based on Harry's needs and desires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis sweaty hands shook as he pushed hard on the heavy oak doors open.</span></div></div>",

Leather collars, spreader bars, handcuffs, and paddles, were on the bare stone wall. Opposite this was a simple wooden wardrobe, the doors open revealing a range of clothes, abbreviated maid outfits, slinky sexy version of Quidditch strips, and a host of seductive underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBetween these two walls, a massive four-poster bed sat. The bed was big enough for all of them to share. The canopy draped with soft satins, and translucent silks. Harry hadn't had a very clear image in his mind as the room formed. Concentrating more on his fantasies regarding the three girls. It certainly seemed that their thoughts had guided more of the details of the Room of Requirement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a pained hiss snatched from Hermione's lips, and she clutched her arm protectively close to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny and Luna were at her shoulders, murmuring supportive nonsense. Solicitous and friendly. There was movement, in the corner of Harry's eye. Snapping his head around he zoomed in and focused on it. There was movement from the bed. There was already someone beneath the sheets. Sheets that rolled seductively, as a hidden body turned over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wild mass of curls surfaced from beneath the sheets, a soft feminine sigh as the head shuffled on the pillow trying to get comfortable. Harry tried to work out who the girl was. Although with her back to the four friends it was beyond hard. Despite this Harry's smile broadened, one of the girls must be bi-curious, and summoned them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSidling up to the girls he made his own supportive noises, about whatever was causing Hermione pain. Cautiously, Hermione slid her hand away, revealing to Harry the words etched in her flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'<span class=\"clred\">Mudblood</span>'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pieces leaped into place, as Harry worked out who was in the bed.

He also couldn't help but admiring her scrumptious arse, so round, full and enticing. As her hand appeared, she rested it high on her thigh. At her shoulder writhed a snake tattoo, it's emerald eyes sparkling with a magical brightness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhatever version of Bellatrix LeStrange that Hermione had summoned up, she wasn't the homicidal maniac he remembered. In fact, he managed to spare a glance for Hermione, as he tried to imagine what had happened between them at Malfoy Manor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she became more aware, of Harry's presence, of the presence of a boy she purred, \"Yummy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Bella's turn, and she gave him a shy wave, her lips forming an enticing pout as she seemed to look through his clothes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry swiped in front of his face, as it tingled. Damned spider webs, and threads were everywhere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe turned to Hermione, \"For me?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just look at him and giggled, \"It's all for fun?\" Ginny said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For everyone's fun...\" Luna said with a smirk.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe noticed that Hermione's gaze was held low, and her cheeks burned crimson. She was completely incapable of looking at Bellatrix.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry started unbuttoning his shirt, and soon the three girls were helping, in a flurry of delicate fingers. The shirt was unbuttoned, his belt removed, and an eager Hermione kneeling in front of him, as she pulled down his zipper. Alas, at that point she seemed to lose her nerve. Harry already anticipating what would happen next. Instead, he felt her pull his trousers down, to allow him to step out of them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile he was distracted, Bellatrix had shifted position. She was now lying on her front. The girls squeezed to greater prominence, as her head rested on her hands at the apex of the triangle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her, that shapely arse had lost none of it's appeal. Her feet flapping slowly up and down, as she admired Harry's body being revealed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna's hand reached for his cock caressing it through the fabric of his underwear. He sprang free, as Luna pulled them down. On the opposite side, it was Ginny easing them down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally he was as naked as all the girls. The idea of paddling Bellatrix's perfect arse, or having her squealing in delight across his lap. Those magnificent legs flailing wildly, as he landed blow after blow. He almost wished there were fewer girls, that he could devote more attention to each of them individually.</span></div></div>",

Their faces looking up at him in anticipation. He noticed a couple of things. The first was that three of them now seemed to be wearing identical make-up. The second was the stiff leather collars around their necks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hadn't summoned them from the walls, and he couldn't recall them taking the time themselves to actually fetch their own bonds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning his attention back to Bellatrix, she was now kneeling on the bed. Her legs spread, and her bust tipped with diamond hard nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Petrificus Totalus!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstantly Harry froze in place, the girls peeled away from his feet. Harry rocked back and forth, until even that movement was stopped with a tender hand on his shoulder. His lips were frozen, unable to command, unable to plead, unable even to ask the simplest question. Only Harry's eyes were mobile, and under his control. His breathing was automatic and slight, the slenderest of flaring nostrils showing that he was still alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress.\" the girls chorused, as Bella approached. Her hips swayed, and her breasts bounced, as she approached. She was taunting him with her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped inches from his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're still in there, aren't you?\" she taunted, the answer well known to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe batted at Harry's cock with the back of her hand. \"I don't have much of a taste for those.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingernails traced their way around Harry's waist, until she grabbed a handful of Harry's taut arse. Her nails dug deeply, drawing five tiny trickles of blood, where they pierced his flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I do know how to deal with that.\" she purred, \"Don't I?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe addressed her last question to a trembling Hermione. Her face flushed, and she nodded, her gaze never higher than her mistress' knees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a single beckoning finger, she called Hermione around to stand in front of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stood there, and as she ran her hand over the proud swell of her arse, Harry saw as the glamour faded, tattooed on her round rump, was an emerald snake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yes, Harry. She's mine now, body and soul. She craves my every touch, my tenderest caress, or my fiercest rebuke.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave Hermione's well displayed arse a resounding slap.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cry of pain was ripped from her lips, but her smile, her eyes, every aspect of her expression testified to her soul-deep joy at her mistress' attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning her attention back to the impotent Harry she held up a hand mirror. There in the reflection, Harry saw that his face, his familiar face was made up, exactly the same as the girls. The same subtle green eye make-up, the same deep, glossy red lips. The light powdering of make-up giving his cheeks a healthy glow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing himself, his arrogance, he even recalled the spell. The spell he'd dismissed as him walking into a spider's web... a spider's silken thread tickling his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if deliberately taunting, she traced her wand once around her belly button. A silky, slinky satin corset spread outwards. Harry was incapable of groaning at his own blindness. But Bellatrix was no Hogwarts student (not anymore), so she wasn't bound by his rules, his descriptions. He wanted to swallow nervously, but even that was denied him. Instead, he could only feel the chill dread in his stomach as he felt absolute horror and fear churn there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Bella's spell completed, she wore a midnight chemise. The thin strap resting on each shoulder. The hem brushing against her gorgeous thighs. Her hypnotic nipples still showing their hardness, their excitement, tenting the soft, supple material.</span></div></div>",

Luna and Ginny were eager to feel the calm assurance that they weren't weird... that weren't flat chested....<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"He doesn't feel your pain, the arrogance of his words. He's blind to the hurt. Though... She... if she were in your shoes, she might have a greater understanding. She might be more cautious about judging a girl on her body.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSparks shot from her wand, backwards to strike a wardrobe. She didn't even look, happy to hear the tiny lock shatter as the wooden door flew open. Inside was a range of female clothing. In stark contrast to the rest of the items in the room. These were frilly, girlish, and screamed out submissive at a shrill pitch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think she's earned her own collar.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione darted across, to the new selection of items.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A pink one.\" Bella told her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Kneel.\" she clenched her fist, and Harry dropped to the floor. He rested on all fours. His arms and knees propping him up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who's a good boy.\" she mocked, as she ruffled his hair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe traced her fingernails down to the base of his spine. Before slapping one cheek with the palm of her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alas, I don't have a use for good, little boys.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe patted his cheek twice more, \"This might sting, a little.\" she warned him as she lifted her hand away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA searing pain ripped through his body, his cheek felt like it was on fire. But he was still held motionless, unable even to writhe in agony. Unable to even look at Hermione as she fastened the collar around his neck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBellatrix crouched down, nearer to Harry's head. Her legs spread on either side of his head. The aroma was strong, but not unpleasant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Want to know what it says....\", again she ruffled his hair, playing with his ears.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It says, 'Bella's Bitch.', do you like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hissed, \"Such crude thoughts, such crude language...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry decided rather belatedly to try to raise some defences. To put some effort into hiding his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe didn't see Bella beckoning the girls forward. But he did feel it, as one of the girls started to cup his balls. Her fingernails tracing along the underside of his cock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBella crowed her laughter, Harry's defences shattered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf he could have, he'd have laughed himself, as he felt the second assault begin on his control. One of the other girls was tracing her fingernails round and round, circling his male nipple. At times jumping from one to the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You can decide how best to dress my newest bitch.\" she told Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a skip in her step, as she returned to the wardrobe to find the perfect outfit to humiliate Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"By the end, you will be a bitch, body and soul, my creature. Fighting the <i>other </i>girls for my favour.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis body was starting to respond to all the attention. His cock slowly straining toward a harder erection.</span></div></div>",

The hand pumped away,  as Harry's breath came in ragged snorts. His nostrils flaring at each stroke. He felt his lips twitch, as a low moan slipped free. There was also a teasing response from his fingers as the spell weakened. Not enough for him to do much but know that the end, that freedom was fast approaching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe grunted in time, and just as he was about to cum, Bellatrix tapped him on the nose with her wand. His world changed, instantly he felt his arousal still teasingly imminent, but now he felt different muscles. The tension was internal, he clenched new internal muscles, trying to satisfy himself, trying to cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBellatrix cupped his chin, and eased his head upwards. His neck craned to an awkward angle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... oh...\" she mocked him with her insincere sympathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can fix this.\" she purred. Her hands slithered down his restless spine. Again she slapped Harry's vulnerable ass. The opposite cheek, \"A snake for a snake... even if it was more of worm.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lip curled in contempt, as Harry's spasmed in pain. He knew bone-deep, that he now had a matching tattoo. A twin to Hermione's one, and a partner for 'Bella's Bitch', on the other side.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, the poor dear, needs her modesty.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe beckoned Hermione closer, the crimson red panties, were shown to Harry, inches from his face. It was the work of a minute, to slide them into place. The cool, soft material bliss compared to the pain and heat of his tormented flesh. As Hermione slid her palm over them, she cooed. It was impossible for Harry to resist the conclusion, he was now a she. Her fingers sliding over her crotch. Harry tried to shift, to drive herself onto those teasing fingers. Her hips moved, but not enough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry knew that if the spell shattered now, her first actions would be to end this torment. To finish herself off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBellatrix eased herself aside, revealing a mirror behind her. Harry saw her reflection. It looked like her hips were wider, were rounder, were fuller. The satin of the panties was smooth, filling them out in all the right places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer posture was different now, still on hands and knees. But those knees were further apart. A new vulnerability was exposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe face in the mirror was a mask of horror. Identically made up, as Hermione, sitting beside her. Her slender fingers tracing circles around his small male nipples. Behind her, and giving a cutesy wave, was Luna. It was her hand that had brought her to the verge. Harry felt Luna's other hand, as it caressed and teased her.... her pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she looked more intently, she saw his familiar face. A male face, that despite the make-up was an unconvincing female. It was shifting. She wanted to rage, to cry. She focused on her lips. The edges of her mouth were drawing in, to balance this, they were also plumping up, giving her a natural pout.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her mind spoke of the uses for lips like those, she looked elsewhere. Her blush was still the same, it took her a moment to work out what was changing. She was getting cheek-bones, they were high and perfect. Next there was a crack as bones shifted beneath her perfect skin. She watched, as her jaw took on a new softness, a feminine, girly roundess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mother's emerald eyes had never looked more at home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not bookish, and boring...\" Hermione hissed angrily.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey felt the same, but the mirror told a different story. Harry's eyes took on a wider look, a more innocent look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shudder raced down her spine, her pussy twitching at the sight. Her blow-job lips, and those naive eyes completed a face that would never look serious or intelligent. A raven haired bimbo, glared back at Harry. Although with those features, it looked more like a pout, the kind that promised so much.</span></div></div>",

The cups were soft, smooth, and deep crimson, decorated with some black lace trim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe dragged it up, over Harry's face, allowing Luna a better look. \"Mmmm, looks comfy, and sexy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny wasn't so happy. \"Bigger. She won't want to feel inadequate. She'll want to be exceptional.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're a D-cup, now, aren't you?\" she asked Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione didn't answer, merely taking a slow deep breath. The air filling her lungs, as she rolled her shoulders backwards. The girls were impossible to ignore.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger?\" she finally asked, slowly exhaling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she did, the bra transformed. The straps thickening for better support, and the cups growing, wider, and deeper and fuller. The damned thing looked ready for smuggling bludgers. The label now reading <b>32HH</b>. She swallowed again, wondering how heavy, how mobile, how... they'd feel.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna gave Harry's flat chest a last playful squeeze before slipping off his back. As she did, she eased Harry into a seated position. Her expanded arse coming to rest on her heels. The immobile bimbo sat there powerless to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione eased the bra into place, shifting Harry's arms as needed. This let Harry see her reflection properly, the panties matched the bra. With a soft catch, the bra was secured, and Luna patted the fastening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a single deliberate strut, Hermione stepped aside, allowing Harry an unimpeded view of her reflection. Her head was at the same level as Hermione's crotch. Behind her, also crouching were Luna and Ginny, their faces painted with smiles. Harry watched as the empty cups of the bra slowly, but relentless filled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione rested a hand on her head, gently playing with her hair. Her eyes looked around for Bellatrix, but she was out of sight. However, Hermione's posture, and Luna and Ginny's behaviour made it clear who was in charge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe progress was teasingly slow, first she reached the same size roughly as Ginny. But the cups were still mostly empty, and gave her no support. Within a minute, she was the same size as Luna, perhaps a C-cup. But still with a huge amount of room for expansion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please.\" she managed to whimper, through her almost locked teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" answered Hermione. \"You will please.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was on a par with Hermione, about a D-cup.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so weird looking now.\" Luna observed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not so annoyingly flat.\" Ginny chipped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you don't look bookish or boring.\" Hermione told the tortured Gryffindor. Her bimbo face a pouting mask of horror, and innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, she filled the bra. The strain building on her shoulders, as the straps started to dig in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, she felt like they were overflowing. Surely these were bigger than intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes glistening with tears, she looked for pity from Hermoine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Call me, '<i>Mistress</i>', and this ends.\" she spoke plainly and clearly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed to clear her throat, and through gritted teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mistress.\" emerged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind Hermione, Bellatrix pranced into view, she gave girlish little claps of approval, before blowing her own pouting air-kiss to the newest Gryffindor witch. At the same moment, she felt her petrification end, and with a puff of smoke Bellatrix vanished from the Room of Requirement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://41.media.tumblr.com/55224b7c1759f36c330a11d9ed52b451/tumblr_o5lldnFRSg1u3wdwxo1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://41.media.tumblr.com/55224b7c1759f...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://40.media.tumblr.com/ec7dcff13e992cb1b9a39fa0ad184650/tumblr_o5lldnFRSg1u3wdwxo4_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://40.media.tumblr.com/ec7dcff13e992...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://40.media.tumblr.com/462fa54b905a41d0bd1207ce8fc327de/tumblr_o5lllcjJpJ1u3wdwxo7_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">http://40.media.tumblr.com/462fa54b905a4...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry leaped to her feet. Her huge bust following an instant later. Desperately she poked and prodded her bust, hoping it was as illusionary as Bella had been. She tried cradling them, crushing them, mauling them. Alas the girls gave every evidence of being real. She wanted to rip off the offending bra. The magic forcing a smile on her face to cover her true emotions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scissored her thighs together, finally able to move, her aching need returned. There was a gasp of horror and realisation from Hermione, as if she'd woken from a dream to find it was a terrible reality.</span></div></div>",

Her crimson nails could only riffle the edges, like a tightly shuffled pack of cards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bigger Breasts.\" Ginny's voice was filled with malice. But Harry still tuned her out, her already epic breasts were so much bigger, so much heavier than she realised, that she couldn't muster the fear to imagine them any worse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe also suspected that her punishement was not complete, even without further intervention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer dread was confirmed, as she felt a waxy strawberry flavour with her tongue. Her lips now coated with thick lipstick. Her tongue slipped all around, and she confirmed that they felt fuller than she'd imagined possible. They were set in a natural pout, she looked ready to suckle on her own proud nipples (or a cock), she thought with a shudder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was the punishment, she'd imagined for any witch that attempted to steal her book. A punishment, to reduce her to even more of a slut. Hot shame burned her face, and tears welled up in her eyes. She felt new knowledge intrude, with spells and potions being pushed further away as make-up, and feminine skills replaced them. She knew the skills weren't just present, they were already a compulsion. Despite her crimson nails, and strawberry lips, she felt incomplete. The desire... The need, to check her make-up, to refresh her blush, to check her hair, to ensure she looked her best already had her glancing around for a mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStruggling to remember spells, she silently mouthed them to herself. Afraid of further mockery, from her former friends. She knew she deserved this... punished by her own hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<b>Alohamo<i>wa</i></b>.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A lisp.... A fucking lisp.\" she thought, suppressing a groan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut her whispered incantation had been overheard, the tittering, and giggling coming from behind her another nail in the coffin of her dignity.

The compulsion to obey the girls' whims, submit to... conform to their desires faded. The Rule Book was clasped tightly to her bosom. Buried in her cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, her problems were far from over, as she was ruled by her own additions to the book. The chill of her pierced nipples, and the thin chain between them still far too real. Curses spilled from her full lips as she ran. That same lisp turning them into a mockery of girlyness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of the Rooms' additions faded as the door to the room swung shut behind her. The handcuffs, collar and ankle shackles faded like morning mist. Despite Harry's glaring, glowering look his body... her body remained lavishly female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hid herself in the half-shadows beside a pillar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pages refused to open, stubbornly resisting her efforts. Only the cover opened, revealing her ownership of the book. At the bottom of the page, the words scribbled in her own hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>'Take a month off'.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShuddering at the prospect, Harry wondered if there was any way to avoid this month of hell. Pain focused, penetrating her adrenaline rush. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe allowed the book to tilt forward, forming an impromptu shelf supporting... displaying her bust. She could see the piercings clearly now. Hell, she could see the width of her new nipples, the broad areola.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat formed an field of burgundy as a background to the golden lion rampant.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pair facing each other, a thick full nipple clenched between their outstretched fore paws. She was truly a Gryffindor girl. Even the walk back to the common room was <i>different</i>. As a nude girl with piercings, she drew glances, appreciative glances. But nothing more, hell, she was used to worse because of that damned scar. Now it looked like everyone (except maybe Ginny, Hermione and Luna) she thought with a scowl, knew her as a witch. Even the blasted, Fat Lady seemed to know her as <i>Harry</i>... short for Harriet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she crawled through the hole to the common room, she felt the extra heft of her rump. The extra shake as she crawled. But worse, she felt another piercing. Dreading, knowing, she emerged into the common room. Passing a mirror, she confirmed it. A pair of tiny silver wings either side, her clit also pierced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe groaned, She had a 'snitch in her snatch'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sense of exposure was hard to bear, even seeing her fellow women in the same position, though for them, this was how it had always been. Whereas Harry had the misfortune of remembering the real past.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harry walked up to her bed, the spiral stairs, both familiar and alien she climbed the girls' tower. She searched her memory, discovering another torment, she was considered a bimbo, relying on her fame, each subject a band or two lower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn each one, her spell casting impeded by her lisp.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As the weekend passed, Harry was faced with coming to class as a witch. The previous two days, had been tricky with her feeling self-conscious and exposed every minute of the day. Even now, as the only one aware of the rule book, and the school before the changes, she was skittish. She found she could tolerate wearing minimal clothing, a thong and bra being the most she could tolerate. Covering any more flesh than that, made her skin itch painful and feel as if it were burning. Wearing her cloak, or even her jumper was impossible for more than the briefest time. Her experiments ended with her ripping the clothes off, to reveal the tauntingly painful but unblemished skin. The other witches having already learned this growing up in this world, were more confused and amused by her apparent stupidity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the week started properly, Harry found another humiliation, that an eye-catching scar was no competition for a jiggling cleavage. Almost as if it had magical hypnotic powers to distract, and as she found with Ron to compel him to do jobs for her. The Gryffindor grades were up on the wall, as inspiration and warning for every student to see. Harry found that all of her marks were much lower, her potions (probably due to Snape's hatred) were 'T' for Troll, the lowest grade. Transfigurations was also much worse than she should have got. The first class was Transfiguration with Professor McGonagall, so she was eager to show that she could do better than a Poor. She was damned sure she could earn an acceptable, and her memories of Exceeds Expectations was almost too much to bear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon sat between the girls in class, his attention divided between the class and his peripheral vision. He favoured glancing at Harriet's sumptuous bust, so full, so firm, so well supported and displayed. As they went around the class practising Sean's goblet shattered, rather than change into a mouse. Hermione's changed perfectly, to subdued muttering from Ron. The look of concentration on his face encouraged Harry. But the mouse's fur was transparent, clear as the glass it came from, and the internal organs were vividly visible, as Professor McGonagall scribbled down her notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen it was Harry's turn to transform the glass goblet....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMinerva's eyes narrowed as she watched Harry. Her brow furrowing, as the lisping words spilled from her lips. But Harry's concentration was clear on her face, as she squinted, glowered at the goblet. She flinched herself, on hearing the mispronounced spell. But it was the pronounced movement of her bust, as she waved the wand, that threw her off. The shifting of her bust, tugged at her shoulders, at her arms, making the gestures awkward and uneven.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe goblet trembled on the table, as if suffering it's own earthquake. Moments later, emitting a wailing pitch, rising higher and higher, until it shattered. As it shattered, instead of glass shards, it was mouse entrails that exploded outwards. With a soft splat some internal organ landed in Harry's cleavage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nProfessor McGonagall's quill flicked as she wrote, but the movement told Harry everything she knew, as a large 'T' was scratched in the parchment beside her name.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout making too much of a fuss, she moved on to Dean Thomas. Harry had to suppress the mixed scowl, and frustration as she plucked the liver? from her cleavage. The squeak announcing Dean had succeeded was almost too much. The vermin even jumped into Dean's lowered outstretched palm. It preened and groomed it's fur, as he held it up for Professor McGonagall to admire.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class dragged on until lunch, when Harry was almost eager for Potions class. A disturbing thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn equally disturbing thought was also forming, that she needed Ron's help to pass this class. Her hypnotic bust worked well on Ron, and not at all on Hermione, drawing out only contempt. It was humiliating to have to trade her charm, for assistance. Bad enough to be 'The Girl Who Lived', and dismissed as a bimbo. But worse for her to actively court that title, and play into the role.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's spirits were low by the afternoon, as she stirred the cauldron. It didn't matter how quickly or slowly she stirred, her bust would pick up it's own movement, and in moments, she feel Ron's gaze burning her bust. The derision directed at her from the potions master was relentless. With her dismissed as a celebrity, and openly mocked as an idiot without redeeming virtue, beyond an ability to jiggle. As the girls bumped into the glass beakers for the third time that afternoon, the chiming of the glass really, really not needed to draw any more looks from the guys, or any more anger from the other girls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fourth time was the worst, as she reached across the table, she felt her bust shift, lurching in the cups. This time, the chiming glass, was followed by the sounds of them being knocked over, the hiss of their contents burning the oak, and then the piercing sound of glass rolling and shattering against the stone floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ten Points from Gryffindor.\" he snapped, barely even looking up, the direction the sound came from identifying the offending student.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hatred from the other Gryffindor witches could have powered a small town. A disturbing mix of contempt at her uselessness, and jealousy over her body, were mixed in with frustration over her '<i>ability</i>' to influence the boys, and their quickness to forgive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the week, was just as bad. With her cleavage gaining a speckling of ink spots from her quill. Even note taking in the History of Magic was an embarrassment. Every gesture, every movement had be planned, she had to consider '<i>the girls</i>' before an movement. By the end of the week, she toppled a pile of books, in Divination, earning a rare angry glance from the otherworldly, and distracted Sybil Trelawney. Inkpots had been knocked from desks. Harry was living on her nerves, and no-one wanted to help or be nearby when she was the centre, the cause of the next disaster.</span></div></div>",

Her sense of self-worth at it's lowest point, even when they thought she was the heir, she could count on her friends. With a resigned sigh, from her isolated table in the library she resolved to tackle the problem. 'Hurricane Harriet and her heaving H-cups', a title smirked and sniggered amongst the girls quickly caught fire and spread amongst the boys too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough she'd heard worse, the 'Jiggly-Giggly Troll-tempting titty transporter', reduced beyond a scar to a pair of walking tits. Even her rescue of Hermione from the toilets... with Ron's help, now a far different story.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first of Monday's classes was an isolated walk, her solitary footsteps echoing, as if she were the only girl in the castle. Her faith in the plan wavering, but as she looked from friendless side to friendless side she gave a curt nod. She would use the weapons she had to help herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat down beside Dean, in the History of Magic, and kept his attention, with whispered questions, and simpering giggles and promises of more. If she couldn't copy Hermione's work, she could at least study... or get help from some of the boys. As her confidence rose, it seemed it was the boys who were turning shy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuccess boosted her morale, and as she settled in for Arithmancy, she <i>accidentally </i>brushed against Seamus Finnegan. A caress arm against his own '<i>checking for bruises</i>', and he too was putty in her hands. Harry felt a little queasy, as he kept his crotch covered, sitting awkwardly close to the desk. One thing wasn't putty when she was nearby. But again, she left with a friend and ally, and the promise to share his notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe afternoon was trickier, Potions. But, she'd picked up a degree of subtlety. Her flirting improving in leaps and bounds, and the silence aiding in her newest study mate. It was Eloise Midgen who blushed, and looked away at the end of class. Her hidden smile revealing some naughty thoughts, her furtive glances reduced to a note. A time and place to meet later for an exchange... a <i>private </i>study session.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's stomach churned, nervously, flirting as a weapon was disturbing, but this felt more transgressive, oddly made her feel more vulnerable flirting with a girl... with <i>another </i>girl...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTransfiguration was the last class of the day, and Harry felt like Professor McGonagall was keeping a scarily intense eye on her. But she sat beside Ron, and began the most awkward of her attempts at coquettish seduction. Ron's notes were useless, and she cursed her short-sightedness. A look beyond to Neville made things worse. While she couldn't read them, she could see how neat, orderly and full they were.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the class, she chased after Neville. Putting just the right amount of speed into her walk to set the girls jiggling, and keep their motion eye-catching.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd catch Neville once she rounded the corner. As she did, she spotted Lavender Brown at his side. An unsettling sense of jealousy filling Harry, as the pair were pressed close together. Lavender shot her an acid smile, and nodded and sneered, as if his appearance had confirmed her gossip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeville flashed through a range of expressions: Surprise, Flattery, Betrayal and Disbelief all flickering across his features.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Lavender seemed happy she'd made her point. She walked right past Harry, pointedly staring through her. A strut, and wiggle a final present for Neville's appreciative eyes as she disappeared around the corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNeville watched her suspiciously, as Harry stood there. The pair fixed to the ground like the most inelegant pair of statues. Harry's history of flirting revealed to Neville, it was the only reason he could think of for Lavender's look of triumph, and Neville's self-doubt. There was pain in Neville's eyes too, as if she expected Harry to betray him, to use him simply for his notes.... simply for her own marks.</span></div></div>",

Once again her bust more an obstacle than any help. Self-consciously she wove her way amongst the tables until she found a quiet corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still felt the chill gaze of Hermione Granger, and avoided any confrontation with her. Organising the notes into piles by subject, she hated not being able to confide with her best friend. Even now, cold indifference was the best reaction she received from her fellow witches.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA deep loneliness filled her studies, her illusions vanished. The bust not drawing her any positive attention, any more than the scar that she'd... he'd hated so passionately. It was worse than when (almost) everyone thought she was the 'heir', at least then she had two people she could rely upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the isolation allowed her to study, and after a few hours she at least felt more knowledgeable on the day's subject. Looking around to the full shelves, absent any friends, Hermione's words from first year struck a cruel reminder 'Books and Cleverness. There are more important things.'.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA snarl crossed her face, she wasn't even considered clever... just busty! Busty and in the wrong place at the wrong time, 'The Girl Who Lived', glowered at her bust, so expansive it had to rest on the table amidst her notes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs time passed for lights-out, she headed back to the common room, to the dorm. She tried to find the positive, that at least now, her marks would improve, she could show her worth. But through the common room, was filled with low muttering, and sharp glances. She passed the borrowed notes back to her friends.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn return, receiving 'accidental' pats on her bum, and equally 'accidental' brushes against her bosom. The muttering getting louder, and more clearly feminine as she retreated upstairs to the comfort and safety of her bed.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Each girl was connected by hoses snaking back towards the wall. A glass container was perched nearby, allowing them to see how much milk they'd produced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It'll earn a house point, for an hour of milking.\" Dobby added, seeing the concern on Harry's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't get much chance to object, as she didn't notice the levitation spell shifting her towards the wall, and the bench. It bumped against the back of her legs, and she collapsed onto the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSensing a new arrival, two of the hoses snaked over her shoulders, and struck like cobras. With a hiss of pain, Harry felt them attach to her nipples. The chain tugging painfully, as she fought to adjust herself, her fingers working around the seal, trying to release the pressure from the chain, trying cautiously to see if the cups would come away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gave a startled yelping squeal, as the pumping started automatically. It felt incredibly good, an intimate massage with invisible fingers. She struggled to keep from giggling and moaning as the machine milked her. She didn't feel quite in control of herself, as she adjusted to the amount of pleasure she was getting. One hand chimed against the empty glass vessel beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breathing shifted, and started coming in ragged gasps, in time with the pulsing from her breasts, as the pump sucked and released each nipple. She found herself squirming in her seat, as her arousal built. She tried to ignore it, to quash the sensation, crushing her thighs tightly together. That only intensified the sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's nice.\" Dobby said, not even a question.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry could only nod her agreement, her teeth gnawing on her lower lip, she didn't trust herself to answer, for her voice not to warble with delight.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As she looked down the line, she took in the other ...<i>contributors</i>... There was one girl from each house, herself included.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt the far end, there was a Ravenclaw girl, with a look of concentration on her face. As Harry watched, she saw the girl was giving the creamiest richest milk, and the faint glimmers sparkling inside the collecting jar told of enhancements. A Hufflepuff girl sat between Harry and the Ravenclaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe just sat there, dutifully allowing the machine to do it's work. Though, she kept gnawing and sucking on her lower lip, at times in harmony with the suction of the machine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harry eased herself into a more comfortable position, Dobby worked diligently to keep her comfortable. His eager hands roaming over her fully-laden breasts with the familiarity of the Octopus Cormac. The pleasure of the constant suction was building, as Harry sat there. Perhaps if both tubes were timed to pump at the same time, it would have been easier. Instead, the intensity shifted constantly from left to right, constantly teasing her. She felt her own breathing shift in timing with the machine, a soft grunting moan, with each pulse of the pump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was hard to explain the pride she felt about her milk. The quantity, the quality. Sure it wasn't enhanced like that Ravenclaw <i>bi</i>.. girl: Hazel Stickney? But she knew her milk was good milk, just naturally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course, none of the other girls could compete for capacity either. Though the other girls were at least C-cups, she was much further along the alphabet. She imagined the other girl talking to Cho afterwards, and Harry felt her excitement shoot through the roof, as she imagined sharing the experience with Cho, their milk harvested together.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCrossing her hands in her lap, she tried to dismiss those thoughts, the warmth that made her squirm. Even now, as her fingers fidgeted, she caught the sideways glances from the other girls. This was a guilty pleasure, you really weren't meant to admit liking it. However, jilling off, was absolutely frowned upon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEager for the distraction, she turned to her left and the Slytherin girl there. Her gaze was just as intent as Hazel. However, she was studiously ignoring the world around her, the bustle of the house-elves, and her own milking. This was clearly beneath a Slytherin, this wasn't the highest any Slytherin could aim, this lacked cunning, ambition, cleverness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry turned her attention back to herself, once more concentrating. She clenched her fingers into a tight fist, determined to stop the fidgeting. However, now she found herself imaging Ginny in her place. Instantly her cheeks burned beetroot, it felt too real. Ginny perfect rump, sitting exactly where she was sitting, squirming exactly as she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven changing to imagining Ron, surely Ron was a safe distraction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her humiliation burn, her fire kindling. She substituted Hermione, tried to picture her in the kitchen, to picture her being milked. But it just didn't, couldn't come into focus. Hermione would never, could never do this... every time, Harry tried, she found her thoughts wandering to Hermione in the library. Hermione was better than this... better than <i>her</i>. She sighed when the revelation washed over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry knew this would defeat her. That if Voldemort found out her weakness, she'd be doomed. Harry knew that she was resolute against any pain, any punishment. But the assault of pleasure would wear her down, that the provocative, relentlessness of her joy would break her would doom her.</span></div></div>",

As she went, she pulled the cloak out, and wrapped it around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHeaving the door open, she spared a single glance back at her tormentors. They were all smiling, rejoicing in her fate. She pulled the cloak over and covered her head, disappearing entirely from sight. She didn't want them to hear her cry, so she slammed the door closed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOr she would have, had she the strength. With her spindly arms, and heaving bust, is slowly swung closed. Her feet slapped on the cold stone floor, as she raced away round a couple of corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinding an empty room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was filled with cobwebs, bare tables and chairs, empty bookshelves lined the walls. Sunlight streamed in the dust covered windows, but essentially it was an unused classrom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sneaked inside and took out the Maruader's Map, her breath caught, there on the map was 'Harriet J. Potter'. Hell, even her image on the map looked more girlish, the feet just a little cuter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe took in the damage the girls had inflicted. The massive bust pulled constantly, and the straps dug into her shoulder. Even leaning over the map kept her intensely aware of their weight, their presence. Her eyes being drawn to them at the edge of her vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a snort, she angrily pulled a chair up, and sat down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis too, was unsuccessful, as the girls crashed solidly against the edge of the table. Tears welled in her eyes, as she fought the pain and humiliation. Pulling her shoulders back, she cautiously settled her bust onto the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls were still not visible on the map, so she assumed they were still enjoying themselves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow she felt safe, she took the Rule Book out of her bag. Her fingers were numb and couldn't get a good purchase. However, she did manage it after a couple of attempts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fears built once more, and she slipped from her chair, sliding the bolt closed on the door. She wanted no surprise visitors. With the back of her hand she wiped away the tears obscuring her vision.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe view out the window covered the Quidditch pitch, and that hint of normality brought her some calm. Wiping the tiny diamond shaped panes of glass clear she got a better view of the match. Or rather it looked like a practice, the colours were Ravenclaw, and she smiled appreciating the accuracy of their formation. She had to admit they worked hard, but lacked the passion of Gryffindor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven now, Harriet was amused by her loyalty to her own house. Slytherin's were too selfish for these team games... and Hufflepuff... well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlthough, she was quite willing to admit, things might be more interesting once the game had started.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the view, her reflection intruded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw the vacuous smile of a bimbo, a mask to her true joy. Her eyes were wide and innocent, looking entirely incapable of serious thought. Her perfect white teeth impressing just enough cuteness, on her pillowy lower lip. Angrily, she tried to smear away the make-up, to destroy the bimbo in the glass.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, any impact she had, she had to watch in horror as the make-up repaired itself, restoring her like a model of femininity. Hell, even her scar was gone. Either obscured beneath the make-up or wiped from her skin entirely. She never imagined missing that mark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sob, she took a deep breath, trying to ignore the shifting of her chest, and the slithering of her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was not some helpless bimbo, incapable of controlling her destiny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned to the table, resolved to fix this. Flipping the book open, she was relieved to see the words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>The Property of Harry J. Potter.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt soothed her like a balm. As she felt a modicum of control returning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a quill from her bag, she quickly scribbled down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet Potter is male.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words lay there on the page, powerless and dull. Until, they turned to smoke, boiling off the page, and blowing away. As if taunting, a black gloss shimmered across the name 'Harry J. Potter'. a reminder from the map that currently she was most definitely not Harry Potter. She was Harriet Potter.</span></div></div>",

Harriet felt the slithering as her blouse formed, the buttons doing themselves up, as they met over her sumptuous bust. Her Gryffindor tie wove itself into a presentable knot before sliding up and into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it was the swish of the hem against her thighs, that reminded Harriet Jane Potter of her femininity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's... what's going on...\" she squeaked in protest.

Her hands clasped her bust, shock written on her face, as it dawned on her how real this all was...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But... But... But...\" she blubbed like a tug boat going upstream.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've not affected your mind.\", Hermione said rather primly, \"Just ensured, you have the appropriate mannerisms to suit your new gender. You are unbearably proud of not working, now you get a chance to prove you're not a bimbo.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last words were twisted with a little more anger than she intended.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"All you need to do.\" she explained, \"to be restored to your male body, is to prove me wrong. All you, Harriet Jane Potter have to do is pass all your exams. No 'Trolls', No 'Dreadfuls', No 'Poors'. A shudder ran down Harriet's spine, she hated History of Magic, Professor Binns was just -<i>like</i>- so boring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If you don't, you'd better get used to being 'The Girl who Lived'.\" Hermione finished. \"Though I hope you do manage a couple of Exceeds Expecations, and even an Outstanding or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping forward, she put her hand on Harriet's shoulder, and her anxiety drained away, the memories of ever having been male faded like morning mist. Once more her mind was in harmony with the rest of the school, she was Harriet Jane Potter, the orphan child of James and Lily Potter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll the other artefacts of the Room of Requirement faded too, leaving only the girls standing in a empty, cold stone-lined room with a heavy oaken door.</span></div></div>",

How dare this unintelligent... bimbo, ask her for help with her homework! However, this gave her the basis of a new idea.<br>\r\n\"Fine, but I'm going to have to make sure that this does not happen again. Congratulations, Harriet, your brain power with increase to above average! Unfortunately, your weight will increase even more so. Hold on...\" <br>\r\nAs Hermione filled in the wish, Harriet's body began to change. To her intense joy, her breasts pushed out even more, nearly bursting her top. Any joy she might have had, however, was destroyed when she saw her giant chest start to sag, and her belly begin to push over her pants and hang down. Her ass has swollen to the point where her pants had become obscene, and soon ripped down the middle. Finally, she was given a shy, introverted demeanor.<br>\r\n\"What..., What have you done?\" <br>\r\nHarriet whispered fiercely, letting out a blast of gas that turned more than a few heads.<br>\r\n\"I let you be the fat, nerdy, and gassy girl who lived. Surely that's better than living as a slutty bimbo? Besides, I can't wait to see that cute little ass of yours tonight.\"<br>\r\nAs the two rounded the corner into the common room, Harriet, for the first time, felt completely at the mercy of Hermione. She knew she should be angry, but all she could think about were the possibilities for the evening.</span></div></div>",

Hermione was working to unbuckle his belt, while Luna and Gina stood on either side. Between them, they worked to unbutton his shirt, the girls spent as long caressing his eager flesh. Some times teasing him with their fingernails.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHalf the buttons were undone, as Ginny and Luna took a break, each take one small male nipple, running their nails over the bumpy flesh. Harry felt the belt sliding round his waist, as Hermione pulled the belt free. He could feel her hot breath, teasing his chest hair. Her fingers working on the trouser button.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe zipper sounded the loudest it ever had in Harry' recollection. Looking down, he peered past Ginny and Luna's slender finger. He locked eyes with Hermione, she winked, as the lowered the zipper, slowly teasingly. He wanted to rip off his own shirt, to shout at the girls to hurry up, to rage against the delay, the anticipation unbearable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry went to swallow the toffee. Then realised he couldn't. Relentlessly, he kept chewing, the sweet flavour filling his mouth. Belatedly he realised it was a 'Weasley' toffee. The twins were working on new ideas constantly, and Harry didn't interfere with their research. He was glad it wasn't the 'Ton Tongue Toffee'. Although he looked forward to telling them HE wasn't their test subject, once he was able to stop chewing and finally swallow this damned sweet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas for Harry, it wasn't simply an unswallowable toffee.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny and Luna silently agreeing to continue unbuttoning Harry's shirt, their nails tracing their way over his skin back to the shirt. Harry's body was trembling with anticipation. The immense bed looking remarkable empty without anyone to appreciate it's sturdy frame. The four uprights leading up to a canopy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the last button was undone, and Harry's zipper reached it's lowest point.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA giggle burst from Hermione, an unsettlingly bimbo-ish sound, that started Ginny and Luna in turn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally the toffee melted away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies. I think we should test the bed, thoroughly.\" he croaked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry tried to swallow, as the Ginny and Luna each took an shirt arm, and ease it from his body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione's warm hands sliding the trousers lower, until he sprang free. Only the thin cotton of his underwear between the girls and him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped free from the trousers and shoes, his socks remaining unsexily on his feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a shriek, Ginny and Luna darted the two paces across the room to leap on the bed. They landed, bounced, and looked lustily towards Harry and Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ladies.\" Harry's smile wide, his voice still sounded off. Covering his mouth with a loose fist, he tried once more to clear his throat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione slipped ahead, sitting on the edge of the bed. Harry was wracked by a coughing fit. Doubling over the coughing intensified. His whole body shaking, from messy mop of hair, to his sock covered toes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe girls watched with concern, but didn't approach. Harry's chest was pressed against his knees. He was on the verge of toppling, when he spotted his socks unweave themselves, the threads unravelling, turning to dust and fading to nothing. He felt the same happening to his underwear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis chest shifted heavily, as he gave one last cough. He spat out the last piece, instantly feeling better he stood upright.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he did, there was a rolling, shifting weight that he wasn't used to. The girls looks shifting from erotic need, to disappointment. Dreading, and guessing what he was going to see. Harry looked downwards. He had his own cleavage now. His hands reaching, he hoped against hope. Merely confirming what he suspected. Harry Potter was now Harriet Potter, a witch rather than a wizard. Blushingly, her hands rose away from her crotch, she cupped her bust. It was only 'us' girls here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was the first time seeing them from this angle. But her best guess told her she was at least a curvy as Ginny, certainly a D-cup girl. She felt a burp rising in her throat, but instead of burping, she saw the girls expand instead. The girls overflowing her spread fingers, she was easily as big as F-cup Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sense of feminine pride was battling with vanishing horrified masculine memories. Harry dearly hoped this was only for an hour, Harriet wanted to see how powerful a witch she'd be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head in impotent denial, as she felt another burp coming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione clapped enthusiastically, enjoying the display, as Harriet bust swelled ever larger. She had to be a KK-cup, after that last episode.</span></div></div>",

Without Harry Potter, Cormac McLaggan was the Head for Gryffindor. Her gasp catching, as she felt her submission growing. McLaggan was her owner. Her body for his pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFear took a grip, and she dived for the bag on the floor. Her breasts heaved, almost throwing her over, her wide, round, full ass shimmying from side to side, as she ripped through her bag for the book. In frustration she upended it. From the bed, the other three girls were enjoying this display of abundant femininity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe breathed a shuddering sigh of relief, as she flicked the book open. Inside were inscribed the words, 'Property of Harry J.

Just a moment.\" her voice shook. It felt right, her submission, Cormac's ownership, she almost didn't want to add to the rules. But pulling a quill from the bag, she gripped it tightly. She took a deep breath, her chest shifting and she slowly let it out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Harry Potter can never be a girl.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as she wrote it, even as she regretted, doubted whether she should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn absolute horror, she saw the page refused to take the ink.

For the moment she was Harriet Julie Potter, and not the owner of the 'Rule Book'.</span></div></div>",

Before she could do anything beyond drop the Rule Book. Harriet scrabbled backwards, her feet barely managing to keep pace. Her massive bust shimmied and shook, threatening to topple her, until her heels cracked heavily against the foot of the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a tumble of limbs, and a whoop of joy from her kidnapper. Her arms went wide, and her bust leapt in the air as she went flying. She landed with her arms wide, and the girls bounced heavily, before ricocheting upwards and threatening to blind her. She would have pushed her wild bust off her face, and away from smothering her, if her arms hadn't been pinned to the still rolling and bouncing bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't have to worry for long, as soft hands lifted them away. Luna sat atop her right arm, using both of her hands to cup and control Harriet right tit. On the left arm, Ginny was likewise kneeling on either side of her pinned arm. In her hands she too, wrestled for control of Harriet rolling and rippling left titty.<br>\r\nThere was a giggle, and Harriet felt a weight settle on her stomach. Straining to look, she peered past her cradled bust. She spotted Hermione. Her back to her, and Hermione's ripe ass holding her in place. The sight was magnificent, the wild hair cascading down her back. Her slender, supple waist, before swelling elegantly back out for her hips. The ripe round buttocks took her breath away.<br>\r\nOr that's what she thought, until she felt Hermione's finger nails. They were tracing a circle around her own cute belly button, before sliding teasingly south, only for her to lift them away. Harriet was in an agony of ecstasy, she thrust her hips up, trying to skewer herself on Hermione's retreating fingers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Naughty, naughty...\" Hermione chastised playfully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a playful slap to her upthrust pussy, Harry squirmed, she almost came just from that alone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sure Cormac likes to keep his girls eager rather than satisfied.\" There were titters of approval from either side. As if a signal had been given, she felt teasing fingernails caressing her large, and so so sensitive nipples. Their readiness visible to everyone in the room. Their fingers barely touching her areola. Harriet tried to roll her shoulders, but the girls kept circling, around and around, until Harriet shrieked her delight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shuddered and shook, as she was ripped from crown to pussy by an orgasm, the like of which she'd never known. But the girls didn't relent, instead, they drove her wild. Adjusting their positions, Luna and Ginny shimmied down Harriet's arms, until as one they sank forward. Their warm, wet mouths engulfing her rude nipples. Their tongues lashes back and forth, round and round. They reduced Harriet to a mewling ball of raging hormones, her mind could make no defence as she climax after climax ripped through her body, again and again she warbled as she came, she begged, she pleaded, but still she came.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body bucked, as instinct drove her to higher and higher peaks. Finally she felt Hermione's fingers caress her lips. A moment later, they slipped inside. She thrashed and moaned, wishing she could experience such pleasure in a male body, she wished she could bring such pleasure to her girls. That she could share this ecstasy with these gorgeous generous women.<br>\r\nAs her mind came back to her, and she became aware of more than her body, she realised how slick she was. She smiled, at the realisation. Her body was soaked, every inch of her body glistened with her sweat.<br>\r\nHer eyes fluttered open, to see a backwards glance from Hermione, as she peer coquettishly over her shoulder, and down at her vanquished foe. Harriet tried to smile her appreciation, as Hermione slowly licked each of her finger, sucking the juice down like the finest nectar.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The coppery mane of Ginny's hair and her spectacular body was there to be drunk in. Her svelte waist flaring out to her gorgeous hips. Harriet's eyes fluttered, at the leatherwear that framed the perfect cheeks that kept her attention. It was a quiet but distinct sound that entered her ear, a simple -<i>click</i>-. She watched as Ginny waved her hips from side to side. The reason obvious as she turned back towards the bed and Harriet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my...\" Harriet sounded excited.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes drinking in the large strap-on that Ginny was wearing. It was made of the darkest mahogany, engraved with very life-like veins, and of a dimension that wouldn't put a stallion to shame. She drank in every inch of it's length, imagining it entering her, filling her, splitting her, ripping another warbling cry of soul-deep ecstasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer tongue darted out wetting her lips, although sure it wasn't heading there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe eased herself back onto the bed, beckoning Ginny closer, as she opened her legs wide inviting her home. As the bed shifted and Ginny got into position, Harriet closed her eyes, and pictured the strong Cormac being the man between her legs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a strong powerful, single thrust Ginny slid her full length into Harriet welcoming body. Using her capable thighs, honed by hours astride a broomstick, she lifted the skewered Harriet from the bed. It sank even deeper than Harriet knew was possible. Instinctively she wrapped her own legs around Ginny's torso. Together she bounced up and down on the shaft impaling her, joining her to Ginny. A euphoric sensual grunt forced from her body, she tossed her head wildly. Her hair thrashing as she sought every last slick inch of her penetration.</span></div></div>",

Her legs wrapped around Ginny's holding her in place, ensure her continued pummelling. Ginny didn't need any more encouragement, as she squirmed at the sweaty embrace of Harriet's Quidditch toned thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna and Hermione, added a teasing caress, stroking the girls flanks whenever they could. Harriet clenched at tightly as she could with those new muscles, teasing out every intimate friction. She felt her own climax coming, and from Ginny's grunting pants, the girls were synchronised. Harriet felt a teasing fizzing tingling in the very centre of her being.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew instinctively, what she was feeling. It was the final taste of the trans-sex toffee wearing off. The last vestiges of the savour were vanishing. However, Ginny was lost in her own thrusting, heaving pleasure. Her smile a rictus of concentration, her eyes scrunched shut, as she focused her soul in her hips, driving them relentlessly back and forth, just one more time, as often as she could.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was only as Harriet writhed beneath her, her Gryffindor lover finally succumbing to her efforts that she slumped, Harriet sated, and herself a quivering wreck. Her last ounce of energy, she slipped out and off her lover. Her fingers trembled, and with two soft clicks the harness was unfastened. Twisting sideways she kissed Harriet on the cheek, as the slick strap-on fell to the floor, the excess, their juices spitting a few drops onto the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet's chest heaved, as she lay there. Her whole body was electric, and she wanted to thank Ginny. But she was terrified, too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe returned Ginny's kiss, and struggled to sit up. Her chest had never felt heavier. Finally she made it upright, and she felt her bust pulling her forward. Weakly Ginny's fingers clawed at the base of her spine, as she wanted her lover lying beside her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet however, had a more immediate, if less intimate need. She made her way over to her bag. Her breasts shifting from side to side as she went. Sincerely, she wished she were smaller, only now appreciating why some women were envious of smaller breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Rule Book still taunted her. The inside cover, still maintained that 'Harry Potter' was it's owner. Angrily she slapped that aside, as her arm went further into the bag, up to her elbow. With it's target acquired, she withdrew it. The small paper bag, but it was entirely empty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was too light, but she upended the bag all the same. No trans-sex toffees dropped out. She scrunched it up in her tiny fist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gulped, it felt deafeningly loud as she realised she'd need to get more, and that meant crossing the school. Crossing the school, as a nude, top-heavy witch, with a natural submissive streak, and ... and a master.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had to find the Weasley brothers, avoid Cormac, and restore herself properly to her original gender. She hoped that once she took it, she'd be male long enough to correct the Rule Book, to restore herself to her properly place as the Mistress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No. No.\" she quickly corrected herself, \"restore <i>him</i>self.\" Even inside her head, that didn't feel, didn't sound quite right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe rummaged around some more in her bag, until she found the next thing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I solemnly swear I am up to no good.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe outlines of Hogwarts walls, painted themselves onto the parchment, followed a few seconds later by the footprints of the staff and students.</span></div></div>",

Blindly she fumbled, until Ginny slapped her hands away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is mine now.\" she hissed. Though even as she hissed, her voice deepened. Still impaled, she could only move her head, Harriet looked over her shoulder. Her gaze tracing it's way down her spine, to those cheeks split and filled by Ginny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harriet watched, Ginny's chest flattened, losing it's feminity. Her jaw also squared, and hardened, a hint of stubble darkening it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as comprehension dawned on Gerry's face. She knew that Ginny was a memory, and Gerry was her master. She knew that Gerry controlled her, she knew that Gerry controlled the Rule Book. The smile on Gerry's face told her that Gerry knew all this too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat she didn't know was whether Gerry knew of the book, of his book. Possibilities danced through Harriet's head, as she considered destroying it, of killing Gerry... of all the other options. Something had to change, and radically, as she was now just a possession, herself, incapable of ownership.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerry eased himself back, allowing his slick cock to drizzle the combined juices, their mingled juices oozing down Harriet's spread thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn shock, Harriet looked at the too, too real cock at Gerry's crotch. It felt oddly unreal, and she wanted to reach out, to touch it, hoping against hope that it would vanish like morning dew. Simultaneously, she was afraid what might happen, what <i>she</i> might do, as her hands caressed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe knew that her name was now, and always had been Harriet, at least as far as everyone here knew. There was triumph in Gerry's eyes, but she didn't detect any wariness, any concern for Harriet. Part of her died, as she felt Harry Potter vanish entirely, even now Gerry looked at her merely as another conquest, another of his possessions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe slipped off the edge of the bed. Her wider rump rippling as it cushioned the impact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Perfect height.\" Gerry purred, \"You can lick me clean.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet swallowed, though whether in fear or eagerness she wasn't even sure herself. The bed at Harriet's shoulders bounced and rolled, as Luna and Hermione slithered closer, eager to scoop up, to suck up this opportunity should Harriet not take it.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Her senses confused her, as she looked up at the lust filled, wild grin of Gerry. She inhaled deeply, the scents of their recent ... of her recent fucking. It was intoxicating, an embodiment of her new sexuality, she was torn and she loved it. Gerry's cock lightly bumped against her nose, and her mouth instinctively dropped open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she looked up to her conqueror, she spotted that Gerry was no longer focused on her, on her pleasure. There was no confusion there, no uncertainty. He looked entirely comfortable in his skin, with his gender. Harriet wished she felt just as easy. But Gerry was growling hungrily, as he looked over at the other tasty morsels in the room. Luna smiled and posed, while Hermione pouted, and purred, both eager for the attention of their master. Apparently she wasn't fast enough, as she felt him brush past her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet felt a surge of jealousy, tweaked with a hint of relief. She wanted Gerry's cock, but knew also what that would mean. He strode away from her towards the two smiling minxes. His cock slapping against his thighs for those few steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom her spot hunched on the floor, Harriet looked over her shoulder at the retreating arse of Gerry. It flexed, firmly, powerfully, masterfully, and she gasped, partially in disappointment, partially in relief, and partially in shame. Their activities still unsettled her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe scuttled over to the bag, not even rising off all fours. She didn't feel the tempted look from Gerry, as her arse danced and shimmied, as her pussy flashed between her slick thighs. It was the caress of Hermione's hand that brought Gerry's attention back to more immediate concerns. Her fingers leaving a trail through his pubic hair. Seductively, she licked her fingers clean, while Luna paid more attention to restoring Gerry's erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShame filled Harriet, as she looked backwards. She was just another juicy piece of arse for Gerry, the girl who lived. A trophy to be claimed. Absently she felt hot tears streak down her cheeks, as she dug the book out from her bag. Her... Her... Her... It was impossible to deny her new sex, after that. But the book still stubbornly declared it's loyalty to Harry Potter. She tried adding some new rules, but the ink just evaporated from the page, rising up as a faint black cloud before dissipating. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBehind her she heard, the unmistakeable sounds of one of her friends grunting in time with Gerry. A soft mewling, sometimes interspersed with a pained, but sensual grunt. Gerry huffed, and thrust as he worked towards getting a rhythm going. She didn't want to look, was afraid to look. She feared envy, she feared the need to join in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was only one way out of this tempting, teasing nightmare for her. She needed more of those bloody 'Weasley Trans-toffees'. The thought of crossing the school, as a submissive girl terrified her. She wasn't raised with that as her normality. She still recalled rather clearly her original sex, her own clothes, and not this enforced nudity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust as despair threatened to overwhelm her, she felt a couple of items deeper in the bag. Her heart soared, as she pulled them out. In her left hand, she held her father's invisibility cloak, and in her right, the Marauder's Map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe grunts were fading behind her, becoming clearer words, \"Take it... Take it... Take it...\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThese were synchronised, with warbles of pleasure. An alien noise, that he'd never expected to hear from Hermione, she was a bookworm. But now, she sounded like a sex-goddess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet felt a tickle as she slid beneath the cloak. The familiar words on her lips.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'I solemnly swear I am up to no good.' she whispered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer words drowned out by the shriek of unbridled passion as Hermione came, and came.</span></div></div>",

As the door swung closed, she heard the sultry cooing of Luna, as she'd waited patiently for her turn. It cut off in an instant as the door clicked into place. The Room of Requirement once more separate. Even as the door vanished behind her, she wanted to retreat to the safety of the room, to the safety of Gerry's masculinity. As she recognised the thought, she gave a shudder. How much had she changed mentally, was she now more submissive. No. No, she told herself, it's normal for a guy to be nervous, when he's stuck as a naked woman, on the wrong end of his own rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClutching the cloak tighter, she heard the sound of others approaching. Her other hand held the bag, and the book pressed against her thigh. She didn't want it slapping against her, and giving her away. She hadn't appreciated how draughty Hogwarts was until now. Already it whirled around her body. She felt it chill every part of her flesh. But she was especially aware of her slick thighs. The cold penetrating them deeply. She scuttled off to find a quiet corner, where she could check the map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer knowledge of the castle was good, and as she hid behind an immense statue of a knight, she was finally free from teasing gusts and shudder inducing breezes. She then became rather more aware of her scent. The aroma was distinct, unique. She recalled how she'd earned the coarse mix of sweat, and cum. Bile rose in her throat, as she tried to repress it all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the spell already cast,  She unfolded the map, and scanned desperately for Fred or George.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of Harriet's sight, and mind. Back in the Room of Requirement, Luna was bracing herself on the frame of the bed. She swished her arse from side to side. Just enough to drive a rippling wave across her fundament. Gerry didn't need much encouragement, already he was stiffening in anticipation. Purposefully, he strode up, and grabbed her hips firmly. His erection rested at the base of Luna's spine, as she waited. Her breathing coming in ragged gasps. Slowly Gerry eased himself backwards. His cock slipping in fits and starts, his flesh sticking and slipping alternately.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen he was in position. His cockhead was poised. Hermione was by his side. Her hands pulling Luna's sumptuous cheeks apart. Luna's asshole twitched in eagerly. Gerry eased forward, his tip entering. Luna gasped, her breath catching. Soon she was panting as Gerry sank in slowly, inch after relentless inch. Until his balls bounced softly against Luna. She let out a grateful sigh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this your ass virginity?\" Gerry asked in a throaty voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLuna's head turned, and with her plump lower lip bitten, she nodded 'yes'.</span></div></div>",

Her growl turned to more of a warbling purr, as a particularly intrusive gust reminded Harriet of her current sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Damn it.\" she whispered to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cloak wasn't warm or particularly draught-proof. And she certainly couldn't wrap it any tighter around herself, it just wasn't big enough. She decided to conjure up some clothes for herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vestiti Uniformis.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tapped her chest, and immediately felt a warmth spread outwards. From thin air, she felt clothes weave themselves into existence. She watched fascinated as the spell progressed. A thong wove itself into existence, the fabric a field of crimson, with a lion embroidered in the centre. Slender golden threads of lace clung high on her hips, as they raced around the back. She felt them meet at the back. The damned thing was buried deep between her sumptuous cheeks. Already she wanted to dig it out. But was afraid to interfere with the ongoing magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breath caught, as another band of golden lace wrapped around her middle. Up from the band, weaving intricate, delicate designs, Harriet watched as her bra formed. It was the same shade of crimson, and surprisingly large, too. As the lace darted over her shoulders, it tickled her. Her low giggle changed to a soft grunt, as it lifted her bust. Putting the girls more prominently on display. Harriet marvelled at her own incredible cleavage. Very, very glad to be hidden beneath the cloak. A part of her did want to flaunt her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gryffindor themed underwear disappeared beneath a layer of silk, as she felt a blouse shimmer into place. A tickle ran across her upper thighs, and she saw a grey mini-skirt forming around her soft thighs. As it firmed up, she gave it a tentative tug, trying to pull it lower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't realised how cute and long her legs were, especially in these clothes. The final item was a jumper, nice, thick and warm. Although it too clung to her curves, they just didn't look quite so obvious, although the rampant lion on her left breast was rather distorted by her generous bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet was a little disappointed to end up with the girls' uniform. Though she'd probably draw more attention, if she tried to squeeze into the boys' uniform. She told herself once more that it was purely for the warmth. Although she felt a swell of feminine pride in how gorgeous she looked even in a plain uniform.</span></div></div>",

It was warm, and that's what mattered at the moment. It was tight for space, and she yelped as she felt something sting her. Her head bobbed to see around the statue, luckily nobody was near enough to hear her. As her gaze fell to the Marauder's Map, she wondered if Harriet was a bimbo. With the map, she didn't even need to look over the stone knight's shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was then she noticed the cuff of her jumper was unravelling. She went to pluck, out the loose thread. She plucked it free more violently than she intended, this time as she again felt the sharp, sting her arse. At least she managed to keep the noise down to a low grunt. Twisting around she saw simply a plain cut alcove, semi-circular and with nothing that might cause her to get caught, or stabbed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA moment later, she realised what was happening. This was her punishment, for being a female student wearing clothes. A quick glance at her cuffs, and she confirmed it. The threads were drifting lower, and vanishing into smoke, and the smoke drifting away to nothing. She managed to brace, and grit her teeth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe third spectral slap to her arse, left her flinching, but still quiet. She knew she couldn't escape the punishment, but she wriggled past the knight's blocking elbow.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe clothes were falling apart quicker and quicker. Her already too brief skirt was just a tangle of loose threads hanging from a waist band. Her jumper slipped from her shoulders, banding around her waist before she slipped free of it. Already the magic was working on her blouse. The thin soft material meaning it's destruction was rapid. The last threads of her skirt surrendered too, and it slid to pool around her feet. The circle of material almost evaporating, as she stepped free of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe skipped and danced, as the next blow fell. Her feet scuffing the bare stone floor. It was a mixed blessing, but she couldn't see any damage to her rather skimpy underwear. The thong would surely fall apart at the least provocation, and her bra was under significant strain, just from her bust. Brushing cautiously over the silky fabric, it felt fine. But she worried about transferring something to them, to triggering their destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWaiting, she knew there would be two more swats coming. She took them as best she could, as quietly as she could. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet double checked her bra for damage, but gasped, as she discovered, that the spanking had left her with a couple of imprudent nipples poking forward demanding attention. She was mortified to be turned on by her own spanking. Her hand flinched, twitched, as she considered checking her thong was still dry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe sooner she found Fred and George the better. She snarled to herself. With the punishment over, she was better able to concentrate. And not a moment too soon, as she heard the pounding of approaching feet.</span></div></div>",

The cloak floated to the shadows of the alcove behind the statue and out of harm's way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt did create a rather more pressing problem. The sounds of approaching feet became clearer, as Cormac McLaggan rounded the corner. She wasn't sure which was louder, his footsteps, or pulsing of the blood in her veins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe looked magnificent, a strong, confident Gryffindor, and potentially a great Quidditch player. She found herself feeling giggly, hoping it was down to the rules. She found herself posing, relaxing against the statue, she pulled her shoulders back, and gave her spine that little twist. It all added to make her curves stand out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCormac walked towards her, his walk becoming more of a strut with every pace. His arrogance dripping from every gesture. She even found that confidence alluring. She wanted to be on the arm of this man. The thought of those jokers, Fred and George... was amusing, but she had to consider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSmoothly, he slid up beside her. His arm sliding around her waist, patting her hip as it reached around. Pulling her closer, her breasts did a brief dance before she felt the warmth of his body pressed against her. She leaned in close enough, and rested her head against his chest. If she concentrated she could feel his heart beating, strong, steady. She allowed her own arm to wrap around him. It was lower, her fingers barely fitting around his waist. But they ended up near enough his crotch, that she felt his heart go up a gear, even as her fingers slipped into the waist band of his trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA sense of ownership filled her. She wasn't the object of Cormac's affection. She wasn't the target of his octopus hands. He was her toy, a gift that a bookworm could never appreciate. A power, that she'd be afraid to embrace. A soft purr slipped out, as she played Cormac like a violin.</span></div></div>",

She felt a new kind of control, a new power, as Cormac's warm flesh responded intimately, instinctively, almost instantly to her every gesture.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpotting a dusty door, she fumbled it open.

Cormac's foot scrapped over the floor, the noise feeling dangerously loud and likely to draw attention, until he caught the door.

It bobbled and danced in anticipation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA muffled groan slipped out, as he looked down. Harriet's crimson lips were an inch or so, from him. Harriet's bust prominently displayed, acting like a frame for his erection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt her hot breath, and in one smooth motion, she swallowed his cock whole.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet wasn't used to sucking cock.

Her tongue, exploring the intruder, teasing it, tasting it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt Cormac's steadying hands on her shoulders.

Reflexively she swallowed, she had to. Her nostrils burnt, as he slid his softening member from her throat, from her mouth. He left a slimy, salty trail to drip from her lips, and trail down her chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had never felt more humiliated. She never felt more complete.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>It was the sound of the door closing that brought Harriet out of her shock. She only realised Cormac had left, when she heard the sound of the door closing behind him. She was still struggling to work out, why she'd done, what she'd just done. A niggling, teasing voice whispered, 'Because you wanted to, Because it was fun...'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shook her head, but the idea remained. Unsteadily, she got to her feet, and tidied herself as best she could. It was like a cloud lifting, she remembered Fred and George in the Grand Hall. She remembered the Toffee she needed. Straightening up, she lifted her chin and headed out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCormac had other girls to fuck, Harriet thought to herself. She wanted to convince herself that she was free to seek out Fred and George, free to end this. A flare of jealousy still fired off, as she thought of him with other girls. Even the idea of 'other girls' felt more natural now. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tried not to think about the salty taste at the back of her mouth, as she walked. She tried to pretend this was normal for her. Just another lingerie clad female student. Although, it felt more dangerous, more sexist. She wished she hadn't  made a witch's power so obvious. Her own bust always felt alive. Bobbling about as if it had a mind of it's own. Stopping it's eye-catching movement a moment or two, after she'd stopped moving herself. She was eager to be free of this eye-catching body. A brief jogging-run down one of the staircases, reminded her of her sex. Specifically, as the girls threatened to leap out of the bra, and the ache from her shoulders and back intensified. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStopping outside the Grand Hall, she steeled her nerves. The Grand Hall was always bustling with students, and she could hear the Weasley's selling their Wizarding Wares. She was relieved to hear their voices, that they were still there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet realised, that she'd left everything in that alcove. Not just the cloak, but her bag, and even the book. The sight of Cormac had rather scattered her thoughts. Even now, she found her memories shifting, focusing on her blow-job. Every aspect flooding back, his cock's warmth, the taste, the smell, the satisfied moans and groans, from him (and her). Her cheeks warmed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon, that would just be an unsettling memory, soon, she'd be male again, and in control of the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins were keeping a wary eye open for teachers paying too much attention. Even keeping her head low they spotted Harriet quickly, as she approached. Closing up their case, and dismissing the growing crowd, they watched intently as Harriet stopped beside them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I think Harry's been trying out our stock.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think your right, Fred.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Best to check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, best to check.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlowly, perfectly synchronised, the brothers slowly turned to look Harriet over.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The toffee?\" Fred asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet's head bobbed a 'yes', in answer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I need another one, to change back.\" Her voice was low, her teeth barely moving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You'll turn back automatically in an hour or two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, an hour or two.\" George repeated. \"If you wait, we'll know how long they last.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That is the reason for ...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Product testing.\" George completed Fred's sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, product testing.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please...\" Harriet's voice sounded more plaintive than she wanted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't know she was holding her  breath, until she saw Fred open up the magical case of tricks. A long, slow breath came out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think our Harriet here, is making a rash decision.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How so?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFred's hand darted towards Harry face. She recoiled, and Fred stroked the underside of her chin, before pulling back his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tip of one finger glistened in the candle light of the Grand Hall. Tentatively, Fred sniffed his finger, before turning to his brother with a smile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTogether they turned to face Harriet, a slow disapproving shake of their heads, and tutting disapprovingly. It was clear they were loving this.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet's cheeks burned as red as their hair. Her humiliation held up for anyone to see. Instinct took over, she could hide the evidence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands flitted forward, taking Fred outstretched hand, and in one swift gulp, she swallowed the offending finger. Her tongue snaked around it, clearing every last trace from it. Regaining control, she let go, as if stung by a jellyfish, and sank backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they might need a little work.\" Fred said, almost sympathetically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you think, she'll do for another toffee?\" George asked, still enjoying Harriet's squirming.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe waved the foil wrapped toffee back and forth. Harriet's eyes were locked on the target, glittering in the light. She refused to snatch at it, well aware that it would just show her desperation. She swallowed, redemption was within her grasp.</span></div></div>",

Eager for her restoration before more of her memories faded or altered, she looked at the smirking twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth chewing away, just like Ron at the breakfast table. However, the twins' faces were shifting. Their copper hair lengthening, and their jaws softening, rounding, their lips ripening, becoming fuller and redder.

Her hand patting her pocket, assuring her that she still had two more toffees left for later. She really only needed one, and that was once she had the book back in her ... his hands.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tension left her shoulders, as she felt the weight melt away from her chest. Her hands ran down her flank, as she felt her rear lose it's plump fullness, her waist, it's tucked perfection.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWherever her hands passed, the uniform was restored, blouse restored to a shirt, the jumper losing it's strained stitching, returning to the dull, flatness expected of the boys uniform. However, it was the vanishing of her skirt, that she ... he felt most comfortable. The feeling of the hem brushing over his thighs, as it dropped lower and lower, until he felt it come to rest at his ankles. Taking a cautionary step, he confirmed it truly was a pair of trousers, and not simply a longer skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHolding his hands in front of his face, they too, lost their softness, returning the coarse, slightly dirty look that Harry best recognised. Tidying his hair, running his fingers through the unkempt mane, he was happy to find it didn't cascade away from his shoulders. It was simply a boyish, untidy mess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe allowed himself a few calming breaths, to enjoy not being the centre of attention, the centre of the boys' fantasies. An H-cupped beauty with a reputation for rule-breaking, and experimentation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he walked back towards the statue, the invisibility cloak, and the book. Harry picked up on the sullen looks he was now getting. The unhidden sneers from the boys. It only took him a moment to work it out, well, a moment and a few overheard 'whispered' comments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEverybody knew Harriet Jane Potter, the bustiest witch in school, and everyone knew she was girlfriend of Gerry Weasley, the luckiest Quidditch player in the school. He could only grind his teeth angrily, as he walked, his pace increasing with each comment, each glance. How dare she hide her natural beauty, with this mocking male skin? How dare she deprive the school population of her grace, with this stomping boyish stride.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven the girls were getting their claws out, poked and prodded to insult, by this girl who outshone them, even as a boy.</span></div></div>",

The school rules, already having reduced their  uniforms, to little more than revealing lingerie. Their ample bosoms were dusted with a line of freckles. Their size was full and firm, as the exaggeratedly leaned across the table, stretching for racks of toast, as they teased their fellow Gryffindors with their ample and openly displayed charms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite his predicament, their joy, their enthusiasm boosted Harry's spirit. Although a worrying worm was eating away at his calm. The twins were playing at being witches, and in an hour, their own bodies would be restored. She might be seeing her own future, as a giggly bimbo to be dismissed, or admired for her beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scar, that damned scar still marked her -<b>no</b>- him out, as the 'Chosen One'. It felt like everyone knew she was really a witch, that if the her being a wizard was unnatural and unwelcome. It felt like everyone was hoping that whatever was keeping her male would expire while they were talking. That everyone wanted to engage her in conversation, to be there as her uniform once more dissolved and dissipated, leaving her once more as a busty, bimbo. As she was meant to be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe muscles in her jaw twitched, as she kept them clenched shut. It can be over soon, she told herself. With this toffee, he'd be recognised by the 'Rule Book', and he'd be able to restore things. To restore himself, his breath hissed, to restore Ginny to the world. A harsh lesson learned, he also had to take away some of those rules he'd written. Fun as they were, being under them wasn't a comfortable experience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe headed back to the statue, to the alcove as quickly as he could. Just keeping himself from running. It felt good not to jiggle, shimmy and sashay as he went. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs he waited for one of the staircases to swivel into place, he adjusted his clothes. They felt a little uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHands down the back of his trousers, he found the soft, smooth satin of panties. His body still not the right shape for them, but the nearing end of the toffee's magic obviously approaching. Slipping his hand free, he pulled his jumper down to hide them. Smoothing the jumper down, he hoped his arse wasn't expanding. It felt the same size, and he didn't want to start obsessing about that. Oh God, was this the start of the mental changes, worrying about the size of his... her arse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe stone stairway ground into place, and Harry set off once more.</span></div></div>",

Wafting his finger under Harriet's nose, her nose crinkling in what she hoped was disgust. However, she found herself taking a deeper breath inhaling the mixed scents of her own shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt her control weakening, a more animal instinct surfacing wrenching the decision from her. It was all she could manage to say, \"I'll need the whole bag.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer head nodding towards the bag of toffees.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you sure you want to...\" George asked, \"You seem to enjoy your current body.\" she could barely hear the words, as her attention was caught by the unmistakable sound of a zipper being lowered. It was joined a moment later by the same sound.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFred nodded his readiness, and Harriet watched as he pulled himself free from his trousers. With a feigned reluctance, he allowed his free hand and the bag of toffees, to slip below the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCasting a shy glance around, Harriet knew that even if everyone were watching she'd still oblige the twins. Sinking to her knees, she found herself face to crotch with two rapidly stiffening cocks. In a relaxed hand between the twins, the bag rested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea of stealing the bag and slipping away, teased her. But there were two tasty treats she had to savour first. The confined space beneath the table intensifying the aroma of their readiness. The twin cocks bounced and danced their readiness, twitching as if seeking a new warm home. Instinctually her mouth watered as she imagined taking them, satisfying them as only she could. Her lips parched her tongue darted out moistening them in readiness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey truly were twins, and they truly were redheads, with the collar matching the cuffs. Shuffling forward on her knees, she saw him twitch, as her hot breath drifted over his erection. She took a moment to gather her thoughts. It doesn't do to be too eager. However, the decision was made for her, as she felt two hands take the back of her head and guide it to the target.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Fred's cock slipped past her lips she felt the hot flesh swell once again, her tongue teasing the underside. Distantly she heard him moan, his fingers quaking as he fought not to cum so quickly. Her hands drifted lower, exploring and teasing her own needy pussy. But it was over too quickly, a hair trigger. Nothing like Gerry... Nothing like Cormac... she thought with disappointment. As the cock softened in her mouth, she slipped free of the now limp hands, and allowed him to slip free.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe left a new trail of cum running thickly from her glistening lips to her chin, a white trail marking her once again as the victim of her own needs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeside her, she caught sight of the other half of her bargain. Still stiff, and still waiting for her attention. She barely noticed the bag, as her gaze shifted over. But she snatched it, with both hands, one slick with her own juices, the other thick with Weasley cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was George's patient turn, and she glanced upwards her cum painted face blushing, as she made eye contact with George. His only response to widen his legs slightly. Again, she felt his hands guiding her warm mouth towards it's destination. It brushed tightly against her lips as it slid home. Sticky fingers mauled her breasts through her blouse, leaving trails on the material. Distractedly, she tried to work the buttons loose, to better pleasure herself. She paid only cursory attention to George's needs. However, he still let loose soft moans of pleasure, as her tongue teased him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed the hot gushing jets, as George came. Again too quickly, this time she felt him pat her beneath the table like he was rewarding a pet.... a bitch on a job well done. Eagerly, she swallowed the last of his seed. The excess already burning her nostrils as she tried to breathe more clearly. She felt it trickle and scald her nostrils, until it spilled from her nose too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the twins tucked themselves away, it felt like an elastic band snapping, as her intellect returned. A wave of thick shame flowed over and through her sicking her. Her face was streaked with her humiliation, and her clothes stank of contempt and indignity. Looking at the bag of sweets she doubted it was worth the price.</span></div></div>",

Their limp legs sagging wider, as they man-spread, their softening cocks losing their appeal. A pair of hands reach beneath the table as Fred and George slip themselves back in. One of the twins, fumbling blindly spares a hair-ruffling reward for Harriet, as if she were a dog scrounging for food.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's our entire stock of those toffees.\" Fred offered, as if only now appreciating what Harriet had done for them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"They're extra strength.\" George added, \"You can swap for at least two hours with each toffee.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill not satisfied, but knowing she's got everything she can from them. Shuffling back on her heels she emerges from beneath the table cloth, rising to sit on the bench, as if she's recovered a dropped fork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA roar of applause erupts from around the Gryffindor table. All of them having an excellent understanding of everything that's gone on. A flash of light, and Colin captures the moment for posterity. The flash illuminating the cum still spread over her face. The twins smile their approval and appreciation at Harriet. There's less enthusiasm from the witches of Gryffindor, with most being frosty faced, with their arms crossed in disapproval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Harriet isn't about to forget her actions. Even if she's the only one who recalls being male, it was still a nasty piece of blackmail. She still felt the same compulsions as the other witches, but for the moment, they were deeper, less urgent. Her craving so recently satisfied, she felt her control at it's strongest, her mind clearest. The problems of her gender were humiliatingly her own fault, but she could fix this, and then those additional rules. Their cruelty now personally appreciated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeigning flattery at the attention, she leaned across the table. With a shimmy of her shoulders, she drew the twins attention to her mobile bust. Lifting her arms off the table, she held herself upright resting her waist against the edge of the table. Beckoning for them to copy, she formed a succulent pout, readying herself to kiss them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of distaste, flashed briefly across their faces, at her cum-streaked face, her puckered lips ready and waiting. Slowly, but smoothly the twins rose to meet her, almost battling for who received the first kiss.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir eyes closed in readiness, Harry slipped a toffee between each pair or thin lips. Followed almost instantly by a sharp jab in each of their stomachs. Fred and George collapsed coughing across the table, gasping for breath, as Harriet returned triumphantly to her seat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSpluttering and unsteady the twins struggled back to their seats. But they had both clearly swallowed the toffees. Their lips now fuller, and redder. Each cough set their hair in motion, hair that grew past their shoulders with each spasm. Their chest also surged with each cough, rising higher each time, and not sinking back quite as far either.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTheir faces softened, too, as they took on very pleasing aspects. The coughing stopped them from saying much of anything, but Harriet detected amusement in their own fate, enjoying the prank even if they were the victims. Fred gave her lengthening hair a very feminine flick. George tried to make a pout, puckering her lips for a kiss. But a cough rather spoiled the effects.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking advantage of the new focus of the humour, Harriet made her way out of the Grand Hall.</span></div></div>",

Many disappointed, or even annoyed at the girl who lived 'playing' a boy. He found his thoughts wandering to Gerry Weasley, and his and her swap in the room of requirement. A niggling thought bothered him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Ginny prefer being male. If given the choice would she choose to remain male. A chance to be just another Weasley, instead of the only Weasley girl. Nonetheless, Harry kept trudging through the castle, towards the statue, the alcove, the cloak and the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRounding a corner, he crashed into another student. It was Gerry. His eyes raced up and down Harry's body, the disappointment clear on his face, at his Harriet being boringly male. Hiding those inviting curves, and jiggly, shimmying shaking figure, with a dull masculine body. But he gave him a slightly awkward hug, just the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExchanging glances, they both blushed crimson, their cheeks flaring with heat of their encounter. Harry and Gerry, both recalling the moment, that reality shifted. Harry alas the only one with a complete memory, Gerry smiled, the memory of sinking himself hip deep into his lover, the gasping pouting face, as her, as Harriet's thighs spread wider, skewered on his stiffness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe moment became even more awkward for Harry, as Romilda Vane came round the corner. Her eyes darting over Gerry's Quidditch toned body, she barely paid any attention to 'Harriet', even if her potential rival was currently female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry recalled the warning from Hermione, that Romilda was trying to sneak him a love potion. However, here and now, in this reality, he was dismissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rule book, imposed fashion made it tricky for Harry to forget. Romilda's body was .... <i>well</i>, <b><i>wow</i></b>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/b996e92bef0b555e257441a436a14dd7/tumblr_oxyvm9Z5mZ1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/b996e92bef0b...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer clothes, were a carefully, carelessly wrapped scarf. As an observer, a dismissed, distant observer. Romilda's behaviour seemed so blatant, to transparent, that he wondered how Gerry didn't just laugh in her face. The look on Gerry's face was so clearly lost in a dream. He wondered if he'd looked that ... distracted... to Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry headed off, taking a moment to snatch Gerry's arm as he passed. Pulling him, mid-sentence, back into motion. Romilda's face flashed angrily for a moment, then triumphant that she'd inspired fear, jealousy, a reaction from the girl who lived.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomewhat reluctantly, Gerry turned his head away from Romilda as he kept walking, being pulled along. Behind the pair, a fluttering, crinkling sound came. Moments later, an origami bird landed on Gerry's shoulder.</span></div></div>",

Harry noticed it slip inside Gerry's cloak rather than he burned it with an incantation. His head bobbed from side to side. \"She is attractive, but can't compare to you Harriet.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe hand reached out as if to mess up his hair, or take her in a hug. Half-up, half down it stops self-consciously between them. Instead his arm hung uneasily between them, before becoming a soft tap of a friendly shoulder punch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry gaped at Gerry, not sure how to react, Gerry's stiff behaviour falling into focus. He found it difficult to be with him, while Harry was male. Groaning, Harry belated realised that Gerry loved her.... <i>her Harriet</i>, as intensely as Ginny loved Harry. Their encounter in the Room of Requirement clear in Ron's mind, while Harry anxiously remembered both histories. His own, and Harriet's. He remembered being skewed by Ginny, and the transformation of the faux-cock to a real one. The squaring of Gerry's jaw, the coarsening of his features. But mostly she remembered being filled by him, completed, and her ecstatic joy at that moment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe idea that Gerry viewed himself as male, and Harriet as female. Eager for her to return to her barely clad female form, made Harry squirm. As the pair reached the statue, Harry found himself staring at the stone floor. The rule-book still hidden beneath the protection of the abandoned cloak. He toyed with the idea of telling Gerry, the truth. He was also playing with a range of others. A new role for Ron, but firstly, he didn't want to fall foul of his own unwise rules. He had to remove the clothing rules for female students. Oh, and just as important, restore his sex permanently, so this whole disastrous sex switch couldn't leave him without the access to the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHuffing uncertainly, Harry still wasn't sure about telling Gerry about Ginny. Or simply confiding some of the powers of the book.</span></div></div>",

Lying or even withholding information from her that he'd share with Ron, just didn't sit right with him. Besides, she'd had her own experience with Riddle's diary. The corner of his mouth quirked in amusement. Hell, she'd probably be more cautious than him about a powerful magical artefact. As he picked up the book and cloak, he let her see the book he was hiding.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nConfusion clear on his face, but he kept his questions quiet until Harry was ready to reveal the truth about the importance of the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven in Harry's mind, it was confusing. He found himself recalling the events in the Chamber as they happened, his discovery of Ginny, the battle with the Basilisk, and Ginny waking and hugging him. But just as clearly, she remembered rescuing Gerry from the Chamber. Her heart racing in her chest, his inability to look her in the face. Her curves a curse of her early development, and promise of the heft of the KK-cup girls to come. He oddly wished there was a memory where they were both male, without the awkward tension between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe siren call of the book, reminding Harry that that was a very real possibility. Just as real as Gerry's memory of Harriet always being Harriet, he squirmed as he walked, his hips doing an odd flexing motion for a couple of paces.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMore recent memories surfacing too, had Harry stumbling. Previous encounters with Gerry, and their physical relationship. Secret passionate sessions before the Room of Requirement. Harry blushed to the roots of his hair, as he recalled squeezing into a broomstick cupboard with Gerry, to escape Snape. The pair terrified of being discovered. Harry remembered the surprise she'd felt at finding it was making Gerry hard. Her hand brushing against his trousers as she sought his own hand for comfort.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe remembered the pair of them crashing out the cupboard, long after the danger had passed. A wild, thrashing flurry of limbs, half-removed clothes, and clattering broomsticks. Bursting out laughing as they corrected their uniforms, and threw the broomsticks back before fleeing at the noise they'd made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry swallowed as he walked, it suddenly hitting him, how hard it would be for Gerry to find out he truly was Ginny, that every memory he trusted was false. That she... that she was a she... that she was just as girly, flighty and curvy as Romilda Vane who'd been making him horny so very recently. Harry sought another solution, but none came to mind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a hand on his shoulder, Gerry apparently now low on patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tell me about the book.\" his voice firm. It took Harry a moment to realise Gerry was trying to be comforting, was trying to comfort him as a good boyfriend should.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I do have experience with....\" his voice trailed off. His encounter with Tom Riddle's soul, not his finest hour. But had renewed his concern about magical artefacts when you couldn't see where they kept their brains.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You don't know if it's dark magic, do you. Do you, Harriet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe name pronounced with a choking tone, as Gerry looked at Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe hand on his shoulder steered him towards an empty class, and thrust him through the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Harriet, I'm sorry. But, I'm not really asking. Tell me about the book.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was determination in his voice, but also concern and kindness. He was intensely aware of the appeal of whatever the hell the book had, of whatever power it held over his girlfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry sighed again, this felt like the best time. Or at least, as good as times were going to get. They were alone, and Ginny/Gerry was demanding the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe softly pushed the door until it clicked closed. Unfolding the book, from the cloak he put it on the desk. He allowed Gerry to read the cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hogwarts: The Rule Book\" in gold embossed letters on the cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's not dark magic.\" Harry offered, hoping to calm Gerry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOpening the front cover, the names, the signature of the original founders were clear. Each signature familiar, each signature genuine. Gerry's hand brushed over the page as if touching history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe paper crackled, as Harry flipped the page to reveal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Property of: Harry J. Potter.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt a wave of relief, perhaps this could be the first clue for Gerry about his true gender, and Harry's. Harry's gaze drifting awkwardly to the ceiling. A guilty sense of relief, that since the book hadn't responded to Harriet, it certainly wouldn't answer to Ginny... or Gerry Weasley. His hand trembled, but slapped into place, stopping Gerry from turning the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next few shameful pages were his own additions to the Hogwarts Rule Book, and he was ashamed for Gerry to see them. But equally he knew it was necessary for Ginny/Gerry to see them to understand the truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReluctantly, but deliberately, he lifted his hand, and patted Gerry's.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Think kindly of me.\" he choked out.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harry couldn't bear to watch as Gerry picked up the book. His gaze low, on the pale pine floor. He listened to Gerry's echoing steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDistractedly, Harry brushed his mop of hair away from his ears as it shifted. Dismissing it as a draught blowing across the room, he took a few more moments to realise his hair was gushing from his head. The untidy mop of dark hair, becoming a wild untamed mane of hair. The sense of dislocation as his bones shifted, returning him to her... The direction and inevitable destination sent Harry scrambling for the bag of toffees. He didn't want to become busty Harriet, with her KK-cup chest. The memories of her and Gerry too fresh, too real, she didn't want the body that would cement them in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA squeak, higher, and more girly than Harry liked burst out, as he felt his chest start to surge forward. The weight, the lack of muscle, unsettling. One arm slapped against her growing chest, in a futile attempt to crush it back to masculinity. If anything, the magic fought renewed against this resistance. Harry's other arm wandered south, confirming what she'd feared.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlready, beneath her questing hand, she felt the material of his trousers as they unravelled. The swell of thighs, and rump as they developed their soft feminine smoothness. The seams already falling apart revealing her bare flesh. In desperation, and need, she reached into her bag and pulled out the toffees. Only to have them snatched away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA shriek of outrage cut off, as she saw Gerry's face. The confusion written there, as he tried to square his memories with what was written. There was a stark, curt shake of his head. Harry felt his T-shirt, as it transformed into a bra. The cups far too large, for the moment, but even now giving her some support.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enough! Enough changes! I need the familiar.... Let's keep it like this for the moment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerry jammed the paper bag of toffees, into his bag, ending any debate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet didn't have the heart to argue, as the changes accelerated. The ticklish sensation working up her legs. Harry's socks transformed into tights that rose higher and higher. The sensation like ants crawling over her skin, she fought the urge to scratch away. As they reached the top of her thighs, she swallowed a wail. Not tights, but stockings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe lace crawling around her soft belly. It teasing, caressing, elastic embrace impossible to ignore. It's sensual torture a provocative reminder of her new sex. Even the very fabric itself, mockingly feminine, the chill almost chaffing against the most alert and aware flesh.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe certainly hated the change of being cut in half by her thong back underwear. The comfortable, cosy boxer, just a memory. As if even the magic had it's limits, Harriet felt her bra disappear. Turning to loose threads, and from threads to dust, and from dust to a mist blown away with the least zephyr.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA slender arm slapped fleshily to cover her bust. She tried to ignore the crimson coat of polish that decorated her nails. That was the least of the changes. But her display was drawing amusement from Gerry. His pleasure, obvious, both on his face, and the bulge in his trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet found herself confused, both oddly satisfied in the reaction her body had inspired in her boyfriend, and still deeply humiliated by the changes too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, her arm slapping was the final straw, and with the changes of his shoes to her heels, Harriet collapsed to the floor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/6d1040a0fd4002ee01741cb5b041a05d/tumblr_on91yuADcC1w2lwkto3_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/6d1040a0fd40...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands covering the dome like breasts that rose from her chest. But the groan was more sensual than frustrated. Slipping onto her side, Harriet groaned again as she felt her bust slosh heavily to the side, the solid slap as one breast clapped against the other.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/0390c522c5aaa86250ad202a2343cca1/tumblr_on91yuADcC1w2lwkto2_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/0390c522c5aa...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe leering Gerry was hypnotised by her. The only struggle in his eyes, the restraint needed to not just start humping her straight away. The idea had it's appeal to Harriet, even as she read it on his face. But struggling onto her hands and knees, she fought to get to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/d0253ab7bd56b1a29670e878daee3dbb/tumblr_on922nFUZ51w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/d0253ab7bd56...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet's bust swung back and forth, making her feel more bovine, like a cow needing to be milked. Each swing the girls threatening to knock her arms away. She'd never felt more sexual, more wanted, more womanly. She paid no attention to the scratching of quill on paper, no attention to Gerry, as she finally to her feet. The wobbling legs, like a new-born fawn, atop her high heels, she looked for support to Gerry. Either emotional or physical!</span></div></div>",

The feather of the quill just moving as Gerry walked, and the light draughts of the empty room, not with the more deliberate pace of writing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harriet looked for Support Gerry was walking around the end of the row. The book still in his hand. Deciding no help was coming from him, she brushed the dust from the stool and settled down at the table. Her toes could just reach the floor once she was seated. Still self-conscious from the restoration of her female body, she hunched forward, resting her bust on the table. An abandoned book adding to the barrier, as she shifted it to give her more protection.

Another solid oaken bench and desk between her and the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she recognised the tone of voice. The same concern she'd heard in his voice, after his encounter with Riddle's diary. She had to concentrate to remember Ginny's concerned tones too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No...\" she assured him, \"It's not dark. Not at all, it the combined power of the founders.\" Her voice didn't carry the same weight, and she only coughed, when she tried to say it again in a deeper voice. Her coughing masked the scratching of quill across the page. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe teacher's table scraped loudly across the floor, setting both their nerves on edge. As Gerry turned to face Harriet, the rule book open in his hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/d1442e0081d73119aad6e50fb7f1fa3c/tumblr_oythcsawQL1w2lwkto2_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/d1442e0081d7...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So this doesn't bother you then.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerry held open the book. Harriet swallowed, as she saw her... his name scored out with a swipe of parchment, and beneath in his neater hand, Gerry Weasley. Harriet watched, as both his name, and the score disappeared from the page. He flipped through the first few pages, showing Harriet. They were all blank, or fading toward blankness.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut Harriet still felt their force, the idea of her wanting to wear more clothes, made her nauseous. Her pulse quickened, as she admired the cool confidence of her man, of Gerry. The memory of the truth were still there, but felt less real, less true. The truth was confirmed by her body, and as certain as her love for Gerry. A shudder ran down her spine, as she questioned reality. A niggling doubt that maybe, just maybe, Harry was the fiction, that he was her fantasy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as the concerns, as her worries multiplied, she saw... she recognised the faraway look in Gerry's eyes. He was being flooded with memories. Harriet spared him a weak, sympathetic smile. As a variety of expressions flashed briefly over his face: doubt; fear; amusement; anger all flickered there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerry's gaze returned to more mundane matters, and the room. He looked vaguely horrified, and looked to Harriet to confirm what he'd just learned. Their eyes met, and silently, sadly Harry nodded. The meaning clear, that everything Gerry had just experienced was real.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

It's strength seeming to feed Harriet's happiness, her calm also increasing, at the sight of the book being put down on the desk. She nuzzled closer, inhaling his musk, and teasing him with her soft, sweet body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerry purred his satisfaction with the way of the world, a throaty growl that resonated through his body, a confident vibration that encouraged Harriet to press herself closer. Even as she did, she could feel the beating of his heart against her chest. His firm, toned body, against her supple curves. Squirming her hips, she eased herself onto Gerry's lap. Her eyes focusing on his face, and the pleasure shown there. She also felt the pleasure that was pressing upwards from his trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer mind on other things, more distracting things, and the jumble of memories that kept her from focusing on less sexual thoughts, Harriet didn't hear the scratching of quill on parchment. An enchantment that Gerry had learned from observing Rita Skeeter. His brow furrowed, as thoughts of learning as Ginny also intruded. A shake of his head, and a look to the beauty resting her head on his shoulder cleared his thoughts once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down at Harriet's tempting body, Gerry felt once again the thrill, the temptation of his new strength. The soft breathing of Harriet, and the way her chest moved reminded him of the distracting soft power that came with femininity. She seemed happy with her body, fewer comments coming from her scar. He smirked, perhaps not the distraction he'd have preferred, but that bust did start more than a few conversations.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerry felt it was time to add a few rules of his own to make school life interesting. The quill responding to his thoughts, as he felt the warmth of Harriet's body against his own. To appease his sense of selfishness, that was niggling at his conscience, he thought of something.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quill scratched away at the page, lifting from the page just before putting the full-stop to the sentence. He kissed Harriet on the forehead, as he thought his sharing of the blessings. Mentally, he nodded, and the quill stabbed the page, marking the end of the sentence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAcross the castle in a dusty alcove, near the library, Hermione and Ron were snuggling on their own. Ron enjoying the break from the study session. This was the sort of session he would enjoy with Hermione. The side of her that was passionate and not bookish and measured. With their lips locked together she couldn't even spoil the moment with unwise, unwanted words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonda and Herman, didn't even break their kiss, as they were re-written to their new genders. Ron's hair lengthening to run the length of her spine. She didn't feel the changes. Ronda's hand stroking over the taut stomach of her partner. Ronda pressed against Herman's firm hand, cupping one full breast. She swallowed the whimper of need, as his thumb brushed back and forth over her nipple. The sensation working as much in the pit of her stomach, a need swelling that would certainly end any hopes Herman had of returning to the library and studying. She giggled delightedly at the thought, squirming as she pictured it, already imagining the sensations. Her breathing deepened, became slightly more rasping, more animal.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like this... don't you?\" Gerry asked. Harriet didn't say a word, her nodding head resting against Gerry's chest being enough of an answer. Harriet didn't read any deeper meaning to Gerry's question. All questions felt more distant, less significant in his arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You like being the youngest seeker... and a girl, like yourself can be lighter and faster.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Harriet only answered with a murmur of distracted approval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And a chaser, can use his extra bulk, when tackling other players.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain Harriet muttering agreement, her thoughts more on Gerry's body, and how it filled his Quidditch strip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother couple of lines were added to the rule-book. As Gerry dotted the full-stop at the end of the sentence. Harriet's male memories became duller, more vague. Gerry's memories of being Ginny, also became weaker, more dreamlike.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe quill flew high, wild and uncontrolled Gerry's control slipping, it almost crumpled against the ceiling. Harriet's hand was working on his trousers. Her plump perfect rear shifting on his lap. Her fingers working to unpop the button at the waist of his trousers. Her fingers already shifting to lower his zipper, her goal absolutely clear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching down, he took her hands and reluctantly lifted them clear. Lifting them to her face, she kissed them, \"There's time for that later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet pouted her disappointment, but gave Gerry her best impression of puppy dog eyes, all sadness and unsatisfied lust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much for her, as himself, Gerry's quill returned to the page. More working from his imagination, than any coherent words, it ran over the page. Gerry's thoughts of Harriet on her broomstick. Those thighs wrapped tight around it, and her perfect ass the greatest distraction on the playing field. But the quill still wrote. Harriet was oblivious to the change, but Gerry felt the changes, as Harriet's ass swelled from perfection, to eye-wateringly gorgeous. Just as firm, but fuller, her waist just as taut and small. Her hips cracked and widened, as she gained an extra inch... a second... a third... It was a wonderful hourglass, as Gerry took in the changes. Harriet's final dimensions almost a foot further round.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTrying to stop his basest urges, Gerry directed his attention from his needs, from his erection. Instead turning it back towards Herman and Ronda. The thought of her sister worked. He owed the same pleasure to Herman, and to the Gryffindor team. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/9a5c0631beeb45cfde6dcf0b85e8cd95/tumblr_ouddd2kGbV1w2lwkto3_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/9a5c0631beeb...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Herman and Ronda were blind to the changes. Deaf to the sounds as Ronda's hips widened, her rump now wide enough to block the goals itself... or at least one of them. A smirk formed on Gerry's face, a distant memory of body insecurity triggering it. Looking down at Harry's smiling face, and closed eyes, confident and cosy in the protective arms of her man. He knew that Ronda would find similar comfort, and Herman would appreciate the gift himself.</span></div></div>",

The room was tilting awkwardly, and he gripped the edge as the dizziness faded. His memories were too jumbled. Memories of being Ginny, of being rescued by Harry, were garbled together with those of being rescued by Harriet from the chamber. Similarly, his recollection of certain Quidditch games were uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes fixing on Harry's taut muscular ass, wrapped tightly around his broom. Mixed uncomfortably with those of Harry falling from the broom, and the thought of her sumptuous ass breaking her fall, her bust rippling at the impact in just the way to make him hard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerry dismissed thoughts of further transformations.... further rule changes until his nausea faded, until the world felt more settled, more familiar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, back in the Gryffindor Dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreya and Georgia had retreated from the public eye. Their new bodies making them feel self-conscious and 'on display'. But, their humour was irrepressible, even with their new bodies. The pair exchanged a glance, as they looked over their shop stock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs one, the twins smile widened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bust boost bubblegum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNodding eagerly, Freya continuing, \"It's probably our best opportunity for an experiment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia adding, \"It's what Hermione would want, for us to use willing participants.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut both girls' hands shook, as they plucked a packet from the box.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took a moment to open the packet. But soon both were chewing away. \"It's tasty. I think Strawberry was the right choice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The flavour is secondary.\" Georgia observed, \"If it doesn't deliv....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped talking, as she felt the magic go to work.

In moments, paper was rustling in their hands, as they tore open a second piece of gum. Their jaws working furiously to chew faster, to savour the taste, to initiate the magic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain the pair felt the tingle in their stomach, the anticipation of magic working on their body. A sideways glance to their competition. Both swallowed the gum in an instant. A gurgle from their stomachs being the final hint. Both girls grew even larger, busts as big as their heads. With counter-balancing butts. The Weasleys had hour-glass figures. Their ample curves enhanced by the slender waist between.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/c24c888654cd305b66ff649c553bd284/tumblr_p6q1mjmkdV1w2lwkto3_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://78.media.tumblr.com/c24c888654cd...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"With these bodies we could sell more.

Georgia was moving with a fluidity that felt imposed by her new wider hips and narrower shoulders. But, it was too late, as pain ripped through them. The blessed relief of unconsciousness freeing them from their own squeals, rising to shrieks before fainting.</span></div></div>",

The darkness a welcome relief from the pain, as they writhed on their bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe twins had no knowledge of who found their slumped bodies, nor of how long they were unconscious. But with a snorting swallow, and a startled coughing yelp, the pair woke. Freya waking first, the sumptuous bust pinning her in place. Her head flipping from side to side, as she looked for physical restraints or the glow of magic holding her to the bed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe did spot Georgia in the neighbouring bed, the shape of the sheets confirming what she already knew. They were still abundantly, obscenely female. As she watched, Georgia's eyelids flickered, and she too woke up. They shared a look of relief, another shared experience they'd survived. She also recognised the green tiled walls, and ceilings of St. Mungo's. Their childhood causing more than a visit or two, with their younger experiments.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut the relief was short lived, as a familiar 'ahem', came from the foot of their beds. Recognising the tone of disapproval from years of experience, they looked past their mountainous breasts, to see Molly Weasley, her face crimson with anger. Her arms folded beneath her own bust, her eyes burning holes in the recumbent twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nArthur Weasley stood at her side, his expression perhaps more relieved to see them wake. But it was trickier to tell, as he seemed to find it hard to look directly at the pair.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly's lips unpursed, \"I told you. I warned you. But did you listen, and now look at you.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't need to tut, or nod her head at their bodies. But she did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFleur and Bill joined Molly and Arthur. Molly's eyes darting to Fleur, and her appearance. The contempt quickly masked, but the look spoke volumes about her own feelings about being plainer than her future daughter-in-law. The darting glance, perhaps wondering if she inspired this experiment of her boys. But, as Bill wrapped a friendly arm around Fleur's shoulder, Molly's expression softened...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA playful grin split Freya's face, \"I think you're missing the positives. We can sell more with ourselves as spokes models, and you always wanted a daughter... Now you have two.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, Weasley's Witches Wheezes, will dwarf the previous incarnation.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMolly flinched, as Georgia chipped in her support for her sister. The tension of something unspoken clear on both parents face making an awkward silence fall.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, the reason was also clear, as the graceless looks revealed the cause. As one, the twins hands darted beneath the sheets. Their busts sloshing, as they were brushed aside by the exploring hands. The sheets rolled like a tempestuous sea, as both discovered the uncomfortable truth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magical interaction between the toffee and the gum had left the pair with their own enormous cocks. Each was as well endowed as a centaur. The tip resting against their belly, brushing against the underside of their equally impressive busts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNaturally, it responded to the touch, of soft feminine hands stiffening, and lengthening. The hardening cocks heading for the harbour of warm cleavage. Every erection would lead to titty-wanking their own excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBoth Freya and Georgia shared the same bimbo look as comprehension dawned on the pair.</span></div></div>",

As gerry wrote, the quill scratched it's way across the page. Ronni was oblivious to the changes. Though she shifted in her seat, as her ass grew even rounder, even fuller. Gerry giving her the full girly experience of <i>'Does my bum look to big?'.</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ef/b7/e3/efb7e349b29d4418e99d7fe0bc110065.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ef/b7/e3/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerman enjoyed the sight of his girlfriend, who'd hopefully grow into being his fianc\u00e9e with time. Gerry mused for a moment chewing the end of the quill, as Harriet watched. She was getting jealous of the book. Hungry for that attention to be directed back to herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerry chuckled, a little lower in tone, but for a witch would be considered a giggle. He touched quill to page once more. Blessing Ronni with hips that'd be wide enough to block one of the goals on their own.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile across the castle. Herman was loving the rumptastic view of Veronica Weasley. The widest hips, and the fullest ass of any witch in the whole school. And she was his. If only she could get over her insecurity, for Herman it was a positive. Her finest feature, a unique blessing that separated her from everyone else.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/56/7a/16/567a160ceaca99cef7a7ea6715accdf9.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/56/7a/16/...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, for Ronni, it was the cause of a deep insecurity. Herman knew she was obsessed with those wide hips, and that immense arse. Even using her insecurity to manipulate her. Herman told himself it was to make her confront her doubts, to embrace them. But, the sight of that joyous ass in motion was poetry he could never put into words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerry chuckled imagining his little sister, as the not-so-little sister.</span></div></div>",

Anything done can be undone; why not let loose?\" With one hand, she firmly caressed Gerry's groin through his trousers. \"Just think of it - if you go too far, you can always return things to normal later.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerry smirked at her. \"You want me to let loose, Harriet? How far should I go?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRepositioning herself, Harriet sat up, showing off her already-ample chest. \"We could be the pinnacle of humanity if you wanted. <i>Titans</i>, forces of nature... utterly inexhaustible.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost unconsciously, Gerry let Skeeter's spell take hold of the quill once more, and he set it aside to more firmly grab hold of Harriet's ample hips. \"Titans? You want to be bigger? Stronger?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinding herself against him, Harriet let out a loud moan. \"<i>Yes!</i> Make me stronger, sexier...\" And with a wicked grin, she draped her arms over his shoulders and leaned in close. \"And make yourself even more,\" she breathed, teasing his ear with her lips. \"Make yourself the man of all men, and <i>take</i> me.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nImages flooded Gerry's mind, and he almost didn't realize that the quill was moving again. Images of Harriet taller, bustier, and stronger flashed through his head, along with images of himself, an adonis, a giant of a man, carved from stone, and he could feel the changes starting to echo through them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet moaned aloud as her body shifted further, her bust growing larger right in Gerry's face, and the rest of her body followed suit. She grew stronger, too, as hard, smooth muscle added itself to her limbs. Quickly, Gerry had a veritable Amazon in his lap, her hair a cascade of messy black down her strong shoulders and ample bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut he wasn't far behind. His own body strengthened beneath her, filling out his robes quickly and causing him to shift in his chair as he grew taller. Muscle packed itself onto his already-strong frame, and he quickly found himself tugging at his buttoned shirt to try to escape its tightness - and it wasn't long before one sleeve burst, and then the other, and soon he found it easier to just tear his shirt off entirely, revealing hard, strong muscles he barely could have imagined.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, <i>fuck</i>,\" Harriet breathed, running her hands over his still-growing chest and back up to his shoulders, her own chest heaving as the book's effects dialed up her lust further and further.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs uncomfortable as his shirt had been, Gerry's trousers were quickly becoming intolerable as well, so with two hands he grasped Harriet by the arse and <i>stood</i>, eliciting a fierce moan from her as he put his still-growing strength to good use. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoments later, another wave of growth passed through him, and as he shot up several inches and grew larger and stronger still, his confining trousers burst at the seams -and finally freed, his cock bobbed out, then quickly grew fully hard, pressing up against Harriet's arse, a solid foot of meat throbbing against her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, she couldn't help herself, and she brought her lips down to his even as she shifted her hips needily to try and capture his massive hardness within herself. Not far behind her, Gerry shifted her weight slightly to support her with one strong arm, then grasped his massive cock and helped line himself up with her entrance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she sank down on him, they both screamed aloud, shouting out their pleasure as his girthy, seemingly-endless cock shunted its way into her tight tunnel. She had to stop a few times on the way down, breathing deeply and drawing back slightly before continuing, but eventually he was fully buried inside her, his massive manhood pressing against her inner reaches and filling her to her absolute limits. Her massive breasts pressed up against his own impressive, heavily-muscled chest, and for a moment they just stayed that way, shakily breathing as the overwhelming sensations crashed over them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd then the moment passed, and Gerry inhaled sharply, turned and shoved Harriet up against the wall, and started absolutely <i>railing</i> into her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet's world exploded. She'd barely managed to start handling the changes to herself, and now Gerry, an absolute Adonis, a massive god of a man, turned his full strength towards absolutely demolishing her. Pleasure she never could have imagined utterly overwhelmed her as his massive cock filled her over and over, each thrust more mind-blowing than the last, and she came, and came, and came, screaming out her pleasure as he pummeled her like a force of nature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerry, too, was overwhelmed, as he hammered brutally into the absolute goddess before him. Her walls, powerfully tight, were trying to milk his seed from him like nothing before, and he could barely contain himself as he drilled into her. He knew he couldn't truly hurt her, so he put every ounce of his new strength to use, and he gloried in the incredible power and pleasure he felt as he hammered himself into her again and again.</span></div></div>",

Every <span class=\"clgrey\"><i>tik-tik-tik</i></span> of the metal zipper lowering, was like a clock marking eternity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer slender fingers looked inadequate, as she eased Gerry's manhood free.

The final addition in the rule-book, a selfish little addition of an extra few inches felt unnecessary. He couldn't imagine being harder, being longer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith an effort he lifted his head forward, to catch the sight of Harriet's wide mouth engulfing his erection. The brushing caress of her lips, almost too much to bear. A whimpering moan of need spilling from his lips. Matched by a groan of hunger, as she took it deep in her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a smirking, grunt, he took in Harriet's face. The cheeks billowing, and collapsing like a sailing ship in an uncertain wind.

Harriet's breathing quickened, her tongue working the underside of Gerry's cock, until her mouth filled with salty cum.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHungrily she swallowed as much as she could. Even as the excess spilled from the corners of her mouth. With a groan, Gerry collapsed forwards. Harriet feeling the sad withdrawal of Gerry's cock, as it softened. Her cum smeared face, split with a broad smile at the pleasure she'd brought her partner. Absently, she fingered stray trickles of cum back into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer gaze shifted, to her cleavage, the soft abundant flesh now speckled with droplets of cum. Raising her eyes, she met Gerry's gaze, directing it back to her tempting bust, and the inviting chasm of flesh between.</span></div></div>",

The blood flow also being confirmed by Ronda's new seat, a response she liked, as well as steadfastly ignored.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith Herman and her arms now able to move together, she replayed the rolling turn as she felt the rasping, uneven breath of Herman burning the nape of her neck. \"You see, how it works...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHerman was lost for words, an incoherent mix of gurgles, choked syllables, and an unnoticed nod of his head were his only response. However, as Ronda crashed the two flyers, to a rippling fleshy crash in her cleavage Herman's resolve finally collapsed.</span></div></div>",

A smile flickering on her face, uncertainly, as Freya's arm wrapped possessively around her. It was odd, the familiar scent in her nostrils, that she associated with Fred. It battled against the brush of <i>her </i>breasts, against her own. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFreya's fingers finding the chance to tickle and tease her. The nervous tension vanishing, as she felt his personality shine through. There was also something about her smile, the roguish grin, that on her feminised face was endearing and enchanting. It also made her blush to think of how experimental both of them could be.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe still giggled, as Freya plucked a flower, and offered it to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLee Jordan was awkwardly being lead by Georgia through the less used classrooms, as she sought some privacy. Finally satisfied, she stopped pulling him forward. Instead, planting her arms on either side of him, she looked up to his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis cheeks flushed, as he tried to avoid the view down her fantastic cleavage. Her uniform, only adding to the problem. Weirdly, Georgia found it less of a concern than himself. A squeak, bursting from his lips, as she closed the last inches. Stepping forward, her body crushed against his. Her bust pressing warmly, firmly against his simple shirt. Her diamond hard nipples against his firm chest. Rising onto tip-toes, she planted a passionate kiss on his face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGeorgia not easing off, until she felt the passion return as Lee succumbed to the inevitable, and his hands rose to wrap around Georgia, and lift her off her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe was still startled, though that was buried as a muffled groaning grunt, as Georgia took the chance and wrapped her legs around his body. Grinding her hips against him, she giggled softly, her breathing ragged and nasal, as she felt him stiffen in response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer goal achieved, she purred delightedly.</span></div></div>",

He was bitterly regretting some of the things he'd written; they'd been intended as an outrageous test to see if the book worked, but now that he was living the consequences, he wanted nothing more than to rectify his mistake.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, well, the next time I see him, I've half a mind to knock him down a few pegs,\" Gerry growled. \"I can't believe him, just strutting around like he owns the whole bloody castle...\" He continued ranting as they walked through the halls, heading generally back in the direction of the Room of Requirement.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

I'll meet you back there?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerry eyed him skeptically. \"A boys' loo, Harriet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry gestured down at his body with his free hand. \"When in Rome, and all that. Given that this is from something the Weasley twins made, I'd be surprised if it didn't react poorly to a girls' room.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I suppose,\" Gerry conceded awkwardly. \"Are you sure you know how to work your current, er... equipment?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt that, Harry put on a smirk, hoping that he looked more confident than he felt. \"I've worked yours plenty of times, haven't I? I don't recall you having any complaints about my skills.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGerry smirked back, though the look faltered slightly as his eyes flicked down to Harry's current body. \"Er... right. Well, I'll just meet you back there, then. Unless you want me to wait here? Wouldn't want you running into Cormac accidentally again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry shook his head. \"I'll be fine. The Room's not far from here, and the twins said this version of the sweet would last a while, so I'll probably still be looking like this by the time I get back.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFailing to entirely hide a grimace, Gerry nodded. \"Alright.\" For a moment, he wavered, looking like he might lean in, but he settled on clapping Harry awkwardly on the shoulder before turning and walking away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry let out a sigh of relief. At least the awkwardness between him and Gerry had a bit of a silver lining to it, if it allowed him to get away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDucking into the loo, Harry quickly made sure he was alone before shutting himself in a stall and sitting down on the closed lid, and for a moment, he just sat back and let out a long, relieved breath. He'd made it to safety.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe still had things to take care of, though, so he leaned back forward and dug the book and a quill out of his bag. Slightly nervous, he turned the book over in his hands, then opened it to the first page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Property of Harry J. Potter</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking a deep breath, he turned to the next page, where he'd written down his first rules. A dull feeling settled into the pit of his stomach as he regarded them. They'd seemed so funny at the time, but now, they made him faintly sick.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTentatively, he put quill to page and struck out the first rule, drawing a line through <i>All female students must remain nude at all times</i>. For a long moment, nothing happened... and then rule and line alike started to evaporate off the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a sigh of relief, he watched as the last remnants of the words vanished from the book, and once they were gone, he turned his attention to the rest.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Not an easy task in a loo. But, Harriet was appreciative, \"Should we do... something... about the... toffees.\" Harriet said between kisses. Gerry perhaps sensing the looming restoration, was enjoying his last moments as a wizard.... Harriet's last moments as a witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands roamed over her body, squeezing, teasing, keeping Harriet gasping... and frankly needy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, his hands stopped, and he whispered a suggestion into Harriet's ear.

But the twins recognised the look on her face from their mother, quiet determination, mixed with the end of her patience.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet's fingers curled around the sweet, as it was dropped into her open palm. She didn't want to consider how close she came to answering George's question. Especially when she saw the inspiration over at the Slytherin table. It was one of those rare occassions where Draco wasn't crowded by Crabbe or Goyle. His face was contorting wildly, as he bit fiercely at his lip as if trying to gnaw his way through. Then Harriet saw the girl beneath the table, at least he assumed it was a girl from her long hair. The hair could have been Pansy's, and she fancied herself as a future bride marrying in to the Malfoy family. However, Harry knew that Draco was aware of her manoeuvering and found her contemptible. Was it possible that it was her lips wrapped around Draco's .... Draco's cock. Shaking her head, she dislodged the image, though not before imagining herself below the table. Her lips stretched wide by hot flesh, her tongue eager to taste that hot salty treat. The musk of an aroused man teasing her nostrils. Although in her imagination, the tickling pubes were a coppery ginger. She was kneeling in front of Draco, her head bobbing and dancing, a glimpse of Draco's fingers knotted in her hair as he held her in place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the twins, she found her cheeks burning, as she tried not to picture herself like that Slytherin girl, satisfying a growing itch. She just hadn't realised how sexual her body would be. How driven. Perhaps it was because she was so ... so endowed, such a level of hormones must play some factor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a start, she found one hand wandering towards her crotch. One finger plucking at the lacy trim, she looked between that, and the wrapped sweet in her other hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Probably best not to change back here.\" George warned, his strong hand easily wrapping around Harriet's holding it closed tightly, pressing the sweet into her palm. Her heart skipped a beat, as she looked into his eyes. Alas, they were sparkling with playfulness. No hint of romance, or sign of a devoted protector.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she nodded her understanding, and fled the hall. Afraid of revealing her feelings, or once more succumbing to this body's powerful urges. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFred and George enjoyed what should be their last chance to admire the jiggling, dancing cheeks of Harriet Potter, as she darted from the hall. A toffee clutched tightly in her hands.  She headed back to the alcove, to complete her restoration. To recover her cloak, her bag, and map, and most importantly her book. Gritting her teeth, she shook her head, the changes... this body was feeling more natural, more right and proper, and her needs were becoming harder to resist.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe needed to recover, <b>his </b>cloak, <b>his </b>bag, <b>his </b>map, and <b>his </b>rule book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, what Harriet didn't know, and if she had, she would be racing full speed towards the alcove to recover her treasures.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe glimmer caught Daphne's eye. It was just the way the light shone through the window lighting the statue in the wall recess. She spotted something glittering behind stony knight. She went to mention it to her friends, but they weren't paying her much attention. Her status in the group wasn't great. She was tolerated as a pure-blood witch, and so respected as a Slytherin. But she lacked the ruthlessness of her friend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne Greengrass, didn't like to think what Pansy was capable of, and sometimes Millicent's ideas felt particularly cruel and vindictive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA twinge of caution held her, and she let her friends pass around the corner, still chatting away. It was a book, the gilt writing on the cover had caught the Sun. It looked slightly odd, as if it were missing a corner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlucking the abandoned book from the floor, it felt somehow alive. She didn't feel the invisibility cloak, as it slipped from the corner of the book, keeping the rest of Harriet's possessions covered. Turning the book back and forth in her hand, it looked complete, no missing corners or other oddities. With a shrug she dismissed it as a trick of the light. She felt a rush of memories, as a warmth spread out from her hand, racing up her arm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was swept up in a wave of embarrassment, she was standing in the empty passageway in nothing more than her underwear. Her fingers numb she almost dropped the book in shock. Her anger turned to fury, at this humiliation, at this offence. Rightful vengeance swelled in her chest, and she was a proud Slytherin, once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile across the castle, Harriet felt something snap inside her. Nothing physical, nothing painful, but it felt important and unsettling. She picked up her pace, something was wrong, something was terribly wrong.</span></div></div>",

Her teeth ground angrily, as she watched history unfold, and Harry's quill scratch in the new rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe cradled her bust, aware of her lingerie clad-body being due to these rules. Her legs responded unsteadily, as she staggered towards an empty class, as she sought some privacy. She didn't know how recently it had been occupied, by who, or what they were up to.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as Harry wrote down the rule about a witch's power showing in her bust. She saw him assemble his favourite girl in the Room of Requirement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA harsh, barking laugh burst cruelly from her lips, as Harry transformed. The newest girls bust leaving her switching between envy and sympathy. Her immense KK-cups dwarfing even the swot Hermione Granger. A throaty, purring laugh followed, at Harry's belated attempt to return to masculinity. The words evaporating to leave a blank pristine page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw as the rules compelled the girls to pleasure Harriet, as it sought to find a new balance, an equilibrium. The struggle as Harriet found her new body's wants and needs overwhelming, and the impact of the rules applying to her equally.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was impossible for her to look away, as Ginny attached a strap-on, and went to work satisfying Harriet. She blushed at the sight, at Harriet's moans of pleasure, of her grunting breathing in time with Ginny thrusts...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe saw the gap at the peak of the Gryffindor Hierarchy, as the absent Harry Potter was replaced by Gerry Potter. Her eyes fascinated as the toy shifted, and became flesh. It looked quite, quite impressive, and Daphne licked her lips. It was the flash of movement that drew attention. As Hermione and Luna came forward to satisify their new master, Harriet Potter fled the room. Her new sex established and set.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne's brain raced ahead, she knew what Harriet was after, why she had fled the room. She needed to restore herself and take back control of the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking down, she clasped the book tighter as if afraid it would vanish, somehow fly out of her hands and away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes darted to the door, as if she expected Harriet to burst in and snatch the book back. Quickly she found a seat and pulled a quill from her bag. It was certainly time to correct these rules. Time for Daphne to set things right!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirstly, she scored out the rule about female students being nude or wearing only lingerie. The effect was virtually instant, as she felt a skirt weave itself into existence. Her thighs no longer in direct contact with the wooden seat. She felt the warmth of a blouse, and a jumper as well as the skirt. Her whole look was more practical. She also scratched out the rule about a witch's power and her bust measurement. The ache in her shoulders eased, and the base of her spine felt less tense.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile across Hogwarts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet had her slender fingers wrapped tightly around the toffee. She just wanted to get her ... -<i>damn it</i>- <b>his </b>things back, and ....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that point, as she darted upstairs, her bust dancing at her trotting pace, that she found herself dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe swish of a skirt, as it danced back and forth across her upper thighs. The satin tease of her blouse as it caressed her skin, and the embrace of her jumper atop that. The jumper was straining to contain her ample bosom. Her KK-cup breasts even more obvious as they were outlined by the jumper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA frightened 'Eeep' burst from her lips before she could stifle it. Something was very wrong. Abandoning all decorum, she raced full speed towards the statue, the alcove and her restoration. She fought down the sickening sensation that it was already too late. Her bust threatened her balance at every heaving, leaping step, as she rounded each corner, it tried to send her flying.</span></div></div>",

She felt properly dressed, and the thought of Harriet Potter, 'The Girl Who Lived', she knew that Harriet would be struggling with her old memories, and her hefty bust. She tucked it inside her bag, and darted off to join her 'friends'. Being a Slytherin taught independence and self-reliance, but brought with it doubts about friendships.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nClosing the empty storeroom behind her she scuffed her shoe on the stone floor. There was something sticky on it's sole. She headed off to the Slytherin common room, to plan the next target for the rule book. Should she settle more personal scores, or use it to improve things for her house as a whole. The idea of boosting her own popularity by winning house points, had appeal. She smirked as she walked, inspired by Harry's fate, she tried to imagine Draco Malfoy in the girls uniform. She snorted, his plans lacked subtlety, Draco could never survive the intrigues of her sex.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet crashed into the statue, as she raced along the corridor. Her mind painting nightmare scenarios, but she heard the scuffing sound as her bag skidded along the uneven stone flooring. Her knees pressed against the cold stone, as she reached into the shadows. Quickly she retrieved the bag and cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFingers trembling she confirmed that the book was no longer in her possession. Her uniform a reminder that it had found a new master.... or mistress. She felt tears welling up, as she looked at the toffee in the palm of her hand. No longer a ticket back to masculinity, and control of a mighty magical artefact. Just a teasing visit to a world that would return her to ... to this. Her eyes dropped to her generous bust, and the brief skirt resting across her rounded thighs.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSucking a sob back to her chest, she wiped her eyes on her sleeve, and stood up. The door to the empty storeroom caught her attention, and she looked away, shamed by her own reactions... her own urges.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSniffing, she thought back over them. Harriet realised something. She wasn't so driven any more, her hormones weren't driving every other thought from her mind. Snapping her crimson tipped fingers, she guessed whoever had the book was female.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes.\" she hissed in a low voice to herself. Her uniform served as a confirmation for that idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResolutely, she tucked the sweet away. She intended to keep it as a promise. A promise of her future restoration. Harry Potter would return, and vanquish Harriet. She looked once more to the empty store room. Even the memory brought the taste back, and she hurriedly swallowed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was unwilling to move far, and sat instead on the edge of the windowframe. While things were still fresh, she wanted to see what she could work out. She needed to recover the book, but first she needed to work out who actually had it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe guessed it was a student, rather than a teacher.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought it was a girl, rather than a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe nodded to a couple of passing students, as they passed her. They were a couple of friendly Hufflepuffs, possibly a little more than friends. Harriet knew them from their Quidditch team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sank in, that they seemed unaware of the recent changes. The book seemed to have given her... not immunity, but some kind of awareness, to changes in the rules. Harriet was certain that would help in recovering the book. If she looked for the girl the least comfortable with the changes... or maybe the most comfortable with them. Perhaps, they might reveal themselves blatantly, with an austentatious new rule.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to believe it was a Slytherin, who'd taken the book. But she couldn't find any clues, and didn't want to dismiss any other possibilities. The book would certainly be tempting to a curious Ravenclaw, and it had already tempted one Gryffindor, she realised with a shrug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a resigned sigh, she eased her plump bum off the cold stone. Piles wouldn't help her at the moment, automatically, she reached to smooth the short skirt, simultaneously brushing the dirt away.</span></div></div>",

It was only sensible with a new artifact, especially one where she couldn't ask a teacher... anyone if she ran into trouble.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe sat in a dark corner of the Slytherin common room. Sitting around the fireplace she spotted Pansy and Millicent chatting away. They weren't talking about school work, the malicious smile on Pansy's face made that more than obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith the rulebook in her lap, she tapped her quill on the blank page as she considered the various choices she could make. While not wishing for tits as big as Harriet's she felt a little boost was in order. Dipping the quill, in the inkpot, she scratched out the new descripions. Every scrape of the nib against the paper felt deafening, as if it demanded questions, investigations, suspicions. But the common room was oblvious to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stabbed the full-stop at the end of the sentence with more suppressed anger than she realised.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer anger vanished, as she felt her bust swell larger, her bra expanding to accomodate the full-cup size she'd grown. She rolled her shoulders, too, enjoying the extra firmness than never came with a bigger bust. She hid her smile as Pansy and Millicent both shrank at the same time. Their own busts dwindling. Narrowing her eyes, the victims appeared unaware of the changes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt bouyed up by the success. Overjoyed, she glanced around the room. Blushing, she spotted Draco Malfoy, her mind suggesting a range of enhancements for that little coward. She despised Pansy and Millicent, and their fawning on Draco, but that at least was understandable. The Malfoys were an old, established, well-regarded wizarding family. Her head shook, as she thought of Draco though. He hid behind his family's wealth, behind his father's reputation, and behind Crabbe and Goyle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a slow huff, she let out a calming breath, dismissing Draco from her thoughts, she didn't want to use the rule-book while angry. Then Daphne was hit by inspiration. She inked the tip of the quill once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet was wandering the corridors, she was lost in her own thoughts, her own fears. The idea of being 'The Girl who Jiggles' as well as 'The Girl who lived', the only survivor of the fatal curse was more unsettling than she liked to consider. She'd ... He'd never enjoyed the attention the scar brought, let alone an eye-catching bust.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer bust gave a rippling roll, as someone pushed past her. It was Colin Creevey, with his camera.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey...\" the protest came unbidden. It's softness undermining the anger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry...\" Colin answered, only now seeing who he'd bumped into.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going for your broom?\" he asked. As Colin raised his camera, Harriet was torn between posing for the shot, or pushing the camera away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Broom...\" she half-asked, as the flash went off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's Quidditch practice today, isn't it?\" he answered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA groaning sigh slipped out, Colin was right. As the captain, he couldn't avoid it. The thought of facing Ron in this body warmed her cheeks. The memories of ogling Angelina Johnson's ass, on the broom, deeping her reddening cheeks. Her hand slipped over her hips, smoothing out imaginary wrinkles. Now she was going to face that attention too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe didn't even see as Colin went on his way, thoughts of how tightly she clung to the broom for aerodynamics. A slow seeker was useless, she couldn't dismiss the image of giving her broom a tit-wank, as she held it close to her body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet realised she was just a few corners away from the Gryffindor common room. She still had responsibilities, she darted for the portrait entrance, and her broom.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA smile spread on Daphne's face as she added to the rulebook.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Harriet was in the Great Hall, enjoying a simple breakfast, when she first heard the rumour. Looking over at the Slytherin table seemed to confirm the rumour. A jubilant atmosphere, almost pleasant, friendly, it looked out of place among them. She spotted a few goblets raised to toast Daphne Greengrass. She looked pleased and a little unsettled by the suddenness and intensity of attention she was receiving.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStabbing angrily at the lettuce leaf on her plate, her appetite had shrunk since she had become a girl. She cast an accusatory glance at the head table, though she kept her head low. Professor McGonagall had awarded her fifty points, when she'd successfully managed to transform herself into a Golden Retriever, and back again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was also struggling with her memories too. She clearly remembered rescuing Ginny from the Chamber of Secrets, but they were blurring together with the parallel memories. She remembered her chest heaving, as she fought Basilisk, as she ran for cover. The distraction of the straps digging into her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs her bust brushed against the edge of the table, she concentrated and the true events returned. She recalled kneeling beside Ginny, trying to hide his fear and pain as he sent her to find Ron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking again at Daphne she couldn't resist the idea that the book was behind this. She wasn't entirely convinced, the memory of James, Sirius and even Peter Pettigrew had mastered the spell. In fact, he'd investigated to see if they had found some tome that taught that particular spell.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor the moment, though, she looked down at the plain toast, the cabbage leaf and the glass of Orange juice that was her preferred breakfast. Looking over to Gerry's fry-up, her stomach gurgled. It was a Weasley characteristic, that appetite Ron's plate was heaped with bacon, and the aroma of coffee teased Harriet's nostrils until they twitched eager to taste a nice filling breakfast. She wondered if Hermione felt the same, despite herself, she kept an eye on her weight, not excessively, but more that Harriet ever had as a boy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne remembered her nervousness, as she had walked up Professor McGonagall's desk in Transfigurations class. She tried to suggest that she'd been working on this in private. The professor's eyebrow quirked up, suggesting a degree of doubt. Her 'Oh.... right.' came in broad Scots that she fought to keep polite and interested.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer lips moved silently, as Minerva gave a nod of approval. The world retreated around her, as the she shrank downwards. Her eye line dropping beneath the level of the table. She felt her balance shift and, she sat backwards. The oddness of a tail being a distraction, alongside the teacher towering over her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe thought she detected a feline hiss, as her teacher's eyes narrowed taking on a hint of emerald.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A dog... Well done.\" The words were shocked, and sincere.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, her tail wagged in response to the praise, thumping against the leg of two of the tables.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fifty points to Slytherin House.\" the words came out very slightly choked, and the class had erupted into cheers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGetting down lower, she discreetly if she could change back unassisted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne's tongue lolled from the side of her mouth, but she nodded, her canine features unmistakably happy and confident.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let the teacher stand upright, before she cast the reversal incantation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eye line rising as she regained her human form, as she changed back, she stood upright. The tail retreating inside her body was oddly erotic and she felt herself restored. Punching the air in joy, she basked in the adulation of the class. Overcome with her success, this was her first real test of the book. She jumped up and down on the spot, giving herself a little quarter turn as she did, pumping her fist in the air, she caught everyone's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was at that point that a polite cough came with a hint of Scottish phlegm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem... A little more concentration next time... and you need to remember clothes on your restoration.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer arms slapped her flesh loudly, as she cradled and covered her still bouncing bust, the other hand sneaking down to cover her ... modesty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as her cheeks flushed crimson, she spotted a few appreciative looks from the boys. She barely noticed the tap of Minerva McGonagall's wand on the crown of her head. However, she was aware of the uniform weaving itself into existence from the empty air. The blouse tickling it's way down her arms, and the intimate underwear cleaving to her skin as it wove itself into existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnly when she felt the jumper and skirt finish materialising, did she lower her arms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKnowing that nothing productive would happen for the rest of the class, Minerva dismissed them with a beaming smile, to celebrate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe suspected that the embarrassment would be leaked by jealous rivals, when the details of her initiation into being an animagus was revealed. Already she'd overheard herself described as a bitch, mentally filing away who said what.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe'd even taken her breakfast cereal in a dog's bowl. Choosing to take it as compliment rather than be insulted in her moment of glory.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The common room was too noisy for Harriet that evening, and she retreated to her dorm. It was an almost physical effort, to choose the other staircase, heading up to share her room with Hermione rather than Ron. She had always felt eyes flicking in her direction, pausing on the verge of a question, about ... that night... or some more recent event since coming to Hogwarts. But now she was glad to leave behind also the unsettling staring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe dorm room was empty, with Hermione in the library, Harriet pulled her trunk from beneath the bed. It was more of an effort with her skinnier arms, and the delayed rolling from her chest a reminder of her situation, as it scraped it's way out, inch by inch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe animagus research was something she didn't want falling into the wrong hands, or even of being known by certain people. The risks of animagi were hammered home to Harriet, when Rita Skeeter had been revealed as a bug.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't help but wonder if she succeeded what her animagus form would be. A stag like his father felt admirable, although her mind still teased her with the idea that if she learnt the spell now she'd become a doe. The form that really concerned her though was a snake. With his bonds to Voldemort, and his parsel tongue, was that his destiny, if he managed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe swallowed, she didn't want any reminders of the isolation, she'd felt when the school was obsesssed with Salazar Slytherin's secret chamber.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere weren't many books on animagi, and those tended to list the wizards who'd achieved the feat, detailing their animal form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as she looked over the rolls of parchment, and books scattered on the bedspread, something caught her eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere was a book she didn't recognise. Plucking it, she turned it back and forth. It was bound simply in leather, without a title or even an author on the cover. Her breath hissed noisily from her nose, this was just another of those unforeseen changes that came with her new gender.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pages crackled softly, as she leafed her way through the new discovery. The pages were hand-written rather than typed, and annotated with scribbles of diagrams. The book triggered no memories, and seemed to be more concerned with werewolves.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... Remus..\" she said under her breath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book grew warm in her hands, and she dropped it back onto the bed. It bounced once and fell shut. Light played across the surface of the cover, brightening and shimmering. It came from within the book, rather than reflected light.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shimmering light came into focus, forming letters on the cover.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Messers. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs, congratulate you on your discovery.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet ran her fingers over the letters, excitement filling her veins. A hiss came from her lips, as something caught her fingers like an insect sting, or the pricking of a thorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstinctively, she snatched her finger back, a bead of blood sat on the cover of the book. It disappeared into the leather, drawing a pulse from the book, as it beat once like a heart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnbidden, the front cover snapped open and the pages riffled back and forth by an unseen, unfelt breeze. All the writing had vanished, each page was pristine, vacant of any words, pictures of anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pages slowed, and stopped at the first blank page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello James.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe words appeared playfully in the cursive script.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore Harriet could examine it further, each of the pages became awash with black, as the pages swept away their unblemished innocence and the contents appeared. She couldn't be sure, but, they looked to be different. Flicking through the book, she spotted four different styles of handwriting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breath caught, as she realised she'd just discovered an artefact from the Marauders themselves. An achievement to rival their map.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe clutched it to her sumptuous bosom. Surely a breakthrough couldn't be far away now.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLower in the castle, in the Slytherin dungeon common room, Daphne was discovering the price of fame. The level of attention, the jealousies, the curiosity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome of her housemates were still doubtful of her new abilities, assuming it was some type of trickery. Others suggesting it was a ruse, to cover her breakdown, and nudity in Transfigurations. A story to cover for an incompetent student. Her teeth ground helplessly, as tales of her nudity became a defiant streak... with some adding even more lewd and lurid details.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't get a moment's peace to settle any scores, against the rapidly growing number of enemies. Probably a good thing given how angry she felt.</span></div></div>",

It was one of the advantages of living in a magical castle, the shifting stairs and passageways tended to ensure you ended up where you needed to be, even when that wasn't where you wanted to be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut she found a quiet room, and settled down there to gather her thoughts and plan her next move.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet read the notes voraciously, eagerly absorbing every detail, every insight. The book was a personal treasure, an account of three friends trying to share... trying to ease the burden of another. She was sure, she knew enough to discover his animagus form, a dream quest that would reveal her true nature, an insight into her soul that was more intimate, more revealing even than a patronus. Thinking back over those she knew were animagi, she saw it clearly, Professor McGonagall's eternal curiosity, Sirius' loyalty....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGrinding her teeth, she cursed her father for not recognising the signs of Peter Pettigrew's weakness, his inevitable...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe let out a long, low sigh. James didn't have her 20:20 hindsight, was perhaps showing kindness, in not pressing his friend on the humble nature of his animal form.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA twinge of pain spiked through her spine. She leaped off the bed, looking around for danger. But the pain... the danger, wasn't physical. In her soul she knew the book had been used, reality had been re-written. Harriet darted to the full-length mirror her eyes looking for changes, as her hands raced over her body. She was sure, she'd know if the change affected her. But a mocking chuckle came from deep inside. She wasn't immune to the rules. Would she be aware of <i>mental </i>changes?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTucking the Marauders' book away, she took a break, heading down to the Grand Hall. A nice meal, and she'd feel better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gryffindor table was sparsely populated, but sitting down, a bowl of warm soup appeared in front of her. The thick vegetable broth refreshed her, the chunks of beef adding to the whorls of steam rising from the surface. She was half-way through the soup, when she looked around. Her eyes were drawn to Crabbe and Goyle, or rather to the stunning blonde sitting between them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked uncomfortable in their presence, shrinking into herself as she tried to avoid the boys on both sides. A muffled choking laugh came, with a revelation, she was looking at a transformed Draco Malfoy.

That Harry knew who to keep an eye on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe would have to speed up her own research, she couldn't give away that knowledge, if Daphne knew she was aware of the changes, that she was coming for the book, then she shuddered to think how vulnerable she was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAn unregistered animagus form, might just be the edge she needed to observe her. She wished she'd brought the map down with her. She was eager to confront her... Eager to retrieve the book... Eager to be back to her normal male self.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHmmmh, The last sentiment didn't feel as important... She wasn't sure it was good that she was becoming used to this voluptuous body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe listened distractedly to the crude attempts of Crabbe and Goyle, as they complimented Drusilla on her curves, the blondness of her hair, and the purity of her blood. It gave Harriet a vicarious thrill as Drusilla squirmed her plump arse, lower into the bench, hoping it would swallow her.</span></div></div>",

A memory intruded, of Professor Slughorn, and that night at Hagrid's cottage.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer eyes watered, as she left the greenhouses behind. She had to stop herself from running up the stairs. Not just to avoid the eye-drawing jiggle, or the pain at her shoulders. But because, she knew that Harriet Potter's eagerness would be noticed. She was afraid that she'd talk in her sleep... in her trance, so she kept on climbing the stairs beyond the Gryffindor dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe headed for Myrtle's bathroom, she'd already prepared the room. With a basic bed (well more a couple of thick blankets), and a portable cauldron. She had fond memories of it, of the polyjuice experiment. When the three friends meant to sneak into the Slytherin common room. Herself and Hermione disguised as Millicent Bullstrode and Pansy Parkinson, with Ron as Crabbe. Well, that was the plan, but Ron's potion was accidentally contaminated with a strand of Crookshanks' fur. She recalled too, the very un-Millicent eye-roll, that spoke volumes about Hermione's faith in Ron.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer step faltered as she climbed, but she dismissed it as the treacherous nature of some of the staircases and corridors of the old, and frankly sometimes cranky castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet crushed the leaves into the bubbling cauldron. A fresh aroma rose, the vapour dancing upwards. Thankfully, Myrtle wasn't in a talkative mood. Just happy to quietly observe. Scooping out a glass, she sniffed it, taking it deep into her lungs. A wave of dizziness threatened her, and she rocked unsteadily. It was only to be expected that it would induce sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA quickly stifled giggle came from Myrtle, as she enjoyed the swaying intruder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet placed the cup beside her make-shift bed, and extinguished the flames heating the cauldron. She was sure her animagus form would be a deer, either a doe like her mother's patronus, or a stag like her fathers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt tasted minty and sweet, as she swallowed it in a few swift gulps. She was already yawning, as she pulled the sheets into place forming an impromptu sleeping bag. Her eyes fluttered and closed, and she sank into a deep sleep.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOut of the darkness, she felt the Castle form, it loomed high above her, threatening to crush her. Looking around, her vision swam. But she could see she was outside. Beneath her feet, was the path to Hagrid's hut. The hut was lit from within, every brick glowing with an ethereal pale green light. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd beyond, was the forbidden forest and all it's denizens. Surely including deer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe trees shimmered, each branch and trunk radiant with a haunting blue. Her feet were silent as she walked. In a blink, she was surrounded by trees. The sounds of the forest echoing around her, tempting her with their cries. A chill shuddered down, as she recalled the meeting with Voldemort, and unicorn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs if summoned by the thought, her view changed again. The body of a dead unicorn lay on the ground, it's silver blood glistening, in the dappled moonlight. There was no sight or sound of Voldemort... or Quirrell. But she was filled with sadness, at the loss of such a beautiful creature.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom nowhere, a shadow leapt over her, and Harriet dropped to the ground. When she raised her head, she saw a centaur in front of her. It wasn't Firenze or Bane. Harriet knew, knew in her heart, that she'd discovered her animagus form. It was spectral and white, with burst of rainbow brightness bursting free in places.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe awake, with an sudden inhalation of breath, and shot bolt upright.</span></div></div>",

Even if she talked in her sleep, in that trance, she knew the words, 'A centaur', on their own wouldn't betray her secret.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, Myrtle although not a Slytherin, might be tempted to spill her secret in exchange for some company, a tasty piece of gossip was a valuable commodity in Hogwarts, especially concerning <i>The Girl who Lived</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe chatted with Myrtle, as she packed away her equipment, friendly, meaningless nonsense, about Quidditch, and Hogsmeade, before heading back to the busier corridors of the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet needed to find another part of the school for the next stage, for her initial transformation into a centaur. Somewhere more spacious than a bathroom. Lost in thought, she waved back distractedly to passing students. Hagrid was a potential ally, or even the centaurs in the forbidden forest, although, she was unsure how they'd take him becoming one of them, through a spell. She dismissed the idea, as there were a host of other creatures in the forest, that might be more openly hostile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe needed somewhere like the boat-house, that was seldom visited. Thankfully it was the week-end, and she was free to roam the entire school.</span></div></div>",

Hermione mentioning again the Room of Requirement, while Gerry and Ron were happy to explore the castle for an empty room. Gerry brought up the Chamber of Secrets, while Ron was happy to tag along with Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat gave Harriet an idea, while the Room of Requirement was unplottable, after it's discovery, the Chamber appeared on the map for Harriet. She assumed it had to fill in the details as the owner explored the castle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe four friends soon found themselves wandering through the lower levels. With her nose buried in the parchment map, they were free to explore without being surprised. It also helped her ignore the way that Gerry's gaze followed the slightest bounce and dance of her significant bust. Her jaw clenched, a sense of jealousy at Hermione's more modest dimensions filling her, allowing Ron to appreciate <i>her </i>for her brains as well as her beauty.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione mentioned something about mentioning stables, in 'Hogwarts: A History'. Harriet nervously swallowed. A new appreciation building already, of the centaur's plight. To be dismissed as a dumb animal like a horse, to be saddled, ridden, whipped and controlled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer body drew all sorts of conflicted emotions from her, and inspired all kinds of behaviour from her friends too. When Gerry had a suggestion, he'd point to a place on the map, with one hand, while sliding his other arm around Harriet's waist. That just made her uncomfortably aware of her femininity, of his masculinity, his musky aroma, and the response that came unbidden from her own body. She felt hyper-aware of the girls shifting on her chest, and how close Gerry's hands were, while still not caressing her. She was alert to every movement, every slight shift, either towards her significant breasts. That always threatened to overflow the cups of her sturdy bra. Equally she felt it, when his hand slipped lower, towards the curve of her hips, or backwards to her plump, but very pleasing rear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNervously swallowing, she put her mind firmly back on track, as his finger pointed to a door on the map. It might be an abandoned classroom, or a spider infested cupboard. However, for the moment it was simply a door in the wall with nothing behind it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione was peaking in her bottomless bag, as she walked. Mentally checking, and re-checking in preparation for Harriet's animagus transformation. It was something with which Harriet was now familiar, before any new, unfamiliar or experimental magic. Hermione buried herself in research and preparation. Shyly, Ron was holding her hand, eager to see if this would work. Harriet read in his eyes, the desire to follow in the Marauder's footsteps, to be their own little secret collection of animagi.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the door, Harriet was hopeful. The door was actually a set of double doors, both wider and taller than she'd expected. It looked promising.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door was stiff, as Harriet struggled with the handle. Grinding and complaining, it finally gave a crack and shifted, years of rust and neglect succumbing to her efforts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, the sturdy hinges were just as decayed. She tried to shoulder it open, but just ended up bouncing off. Her tits almost heaving free of their containment, and a rolling ripple running from hip to hip at the impact. As ever, Gerry caught the entire jiggly display, a scowl from her causing him to blush.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Hermione drew out her wand, Gerry was doing the chivalrous thing, and crashing against the door himself, eager to prove up to the physical challenge. Soon the door was protesting at the impact of the Weasley boys, as Ron and Gerry repeatedly threw themselves at the wide doors.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Nobody saw the sparks of magic crackle between the saddle, and Harriet's broad equine torso.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeneath that powerful ribcage, the straps of the saddle swung, gaining an extra magical sway, until both sides touched. The strap cinched the saddle into place without human assistance, tightening and drawing another disapproving huff from Harriet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe surprise on Gerry's face was clear, and Harriet found herself merely shaking her head with mild disapproval. She didn't realise the forgiveness was being imposed on her, by the magic of the saddle. A saddle enchanted for a smoother ride for the inexperienced, less confident rider.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet thought about how offended she should feel, about the implied insult that her friend now saw her as a simple beast, a simple beast of burden. That thought was derailed, as she realised it would be a shame to remove it so quickly, so with a smile spreading on her own face, she tilted her head towards the saddle inviting Gerry to climb into the saddle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm spreading my legs for you.\" he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fury on Hermione's face was enough to stop him there, the crudeness of his humour.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith one hand on the pommel, and one foot in the stirrup, Gerry was ready.

She had the excellent peripheral vision of a horse, a prey animal eternally alert for predators.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe started, as she felt the soothing caress of Hermione's hand.

It all had the effect of making Drusilla look even more sexual. Harriet almost felt pity for Draco, and as she stared intently at her, he was hit by a realisation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDrusilla wasn't just uncomfortable with Crabbe and Goyle's coarse attempts at flattery, she was genuinely uncomfortable in her own skin. Harriet couldn't be sure, but there was an unevenness to her movement, her gestures, her behaviour as a whole that cried out to Harriet, that Drusilla was uncomfortable being a woman. In fact, he was sure that Drusilla had kept her memories of being Draco. But with everything around her telling her that she was female, and abundantly so.

At least Harriet knew how she became a girl, and had a way back, <i>if she wanted</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe watched as Drusilla finally left satisfied, getting up, she revealed that her skirt too was too tight, clinging to her thighs, and cleaving tightly to an abundant and pert ass.

It was dangerous though, as a failed attempt would put Daphne on her guard, possibly even spoiling any or all future attempts to steal the book back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was still quite confident that she had the advantage, with her invisibility cloak, and the Marauder's Map, she just had to select the right moment to make her move, a quick petrifying spell, and snatch the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSince it was a Saturday, there weren't any classes to attend, and she retrieved the cloak and map from the common room. Her hand brushed against something in her pocket. Pulling it out she saw a toffee. The one that would restore make her male, though without the book, she'd revert back to this busty form one it's magic wore off. Her current body no longer felt so alien to her, and there was something decidedly pleasant about the power it gave her over the boys in the school.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKeeping the cloak in her bag, she spotted Daphne on the map and headed off. Once she was closer she could find a quiet corner and slip on the cloak.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard Daphne's voice round the corner, as she berated a first year, for daring to bump into her. A babble of apologies cascaded from the terrified student, a piping male voice struggling to escape.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Mischief Managed', she purred, and refolded the map.

Harriet's joy changed to horror, as the spell ricocheted off Daphne's shield. Heading straight back towards her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne's smile was cautious, as she approached.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe invisibility cloak crackled with magical energy as the spell hit. But it gave Harriet no protection, as she felt her joints turn to stone. A moan slipped from her lips as she should have guessed that Slytherins would be more paranoid, more prepared for a random attack. Toppling forward, her shoulder crashed against the wall, and Harriet learned an important lesson about the sensitivity of large nipples, atop generous breasts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was frozen face down, unable even to see the feet she could hear approaching. She felt the swish, as the invisibility cloak was peeled away to reveal her to the gloating girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'll keep this...\" she purred, as she jammed the invisibility cloak into her bag.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne became aware of how open this whole incident was, and grabbing the immobile Harriet, under the arms she dragged her towards a spider-web laden door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Alohamora!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe door burst open, the heavy hinges casting off a layer of rust, and a sour stale gust of air spilled from the long-empty room. Propping Harriet up in the corner, she headed back to the door. Taking one last look for any unattended items or debris, she sighed to see nothing. She looked once more to check nobody had spotted her, or her victim.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nResting her back against the door, she paid attention to the room for the first time. It was an abandoned class, a few toppled books on the shelves suggested it was previously a potions class. Though the wooden target dummies in one corner suggested something else. Suggested spell practice, or a training room for duelling.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smirked at the pose of one of the dummies, spotting a similiar pose, wand half-raised that Harriet was also holding. But the dummy lacked that slightly surprised look, a mouth slightly open, the eye brows high and a look of doom frozen on her features. From bitter experience, she knew her victim was aware and alert, even if she were immobile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA low, filthy, witchy cackle came from her, as she came up with her plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vestes Pulvero!</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe tapped Harriet with the glowing tip of her wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We should do this in the dark, like it's shameful. I want you to see everything.\" Daphne said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Incendio.</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne after another the torches flared into life. The yellow light filling the room as more torches were lit. Turning to watch the progress of her earlier spell. Daphne was treated to the sight of Harriet's clothes turning to dust, and drifting towards the floor. Already, her jumper was just a memory, and she saw Harriet's wide, wide eyes, as she felt her blouse turning to dust, the hem disappearing as if fraying itself, relentless rising towards her shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome very sexy underwear was revealed, and a chest, a body, a waist, and some spectacular hips that showed Gryffindor was the house of the hottie, as well as the brave. It took only a few more teasing seconds, for the magic to complete. The stockings, barely there becoming not there. The panties and bra were the last to go, and revealed some impressive nipples, and a bust that should never have been that firm given it's size. Daphne felt a wave of jealousy, and intrigue as she admired the helpless girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You hide such prettiness.\" Daphne purred, tracing her hands over the curves of Harriet's body. \"Not like that bookish bitch... But bad enough.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe stopped herself, not wanting to sound as intrigued as she felt by Hermione Granger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"If only you'd come to our house, if only...\" she sounded genuinely regretful. \"We could help you develop your skills, use all the weapons in your arsenal.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe erect nipples drew her eyes like a hypnotic lure, she tried to dismiss it as the cold of the dungeon, rather than the flattery that it was an indication of her excitement. An easy lie to make a boy believe, that any... that every boy was eager to believe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shrugged, and turned to her bag resting on a nearby table. If Harriet could have, she would have swallowed nervously, as the 'Rule Book' was pulled out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I thought, you'd make a good muggle. Take away your abilities, perhaps just torture you with the memory of what you've lost.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet's nostrils flared. Hogwarts. The wizard world was everything to her. Every good memory came from that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Then I decided, I would prefer a little assistance. Thus...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe gestured up and down to Harriet naked body, as if it served as explanation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTaking out a quill, she headed towards the Rule Book.</span></div></div>",

Harriet finally felt the tip of her pinkie twitch. A long way from freedom, and any hope of escape. Sheer rage driving her to try to form a fist, and smash that smug face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut as Daphne finished talking, she raised her quill high, theatrically. Harriet watched, as she stabbed it down onto the page. Marking the full-stop on the sentence. It was then her turn to look towards the naked Harriet propped up in the corner like kindling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she been able, she would have closed her eyes. But then she'd have missed the look of confusion, followed by rage that flew across Daphne's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason was clear... Or at least Harriet hoped so. Her eyeline remained the same, roughly eye to eye with Daphne, she didn't feel the room rise up around her, or herself shrink down, and contort into a weak, submissive house-elf body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was Daphne's turn to curl her fingers into fists, as she returned to the book. Anger and frustration battled across her face, as she fought the impulse to rip the page from the book, against the danger of damaging an obviously powerful magical artefact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFiercely, she ripped the book from the table and thrust it in Harriet's face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This!.... Is this your doing?\" she snarled. \"How are you doing this....\" her eyes flashed, her cheeks reddened, and flecks of spittle decorated Harriet's immobile features. She couldn't even smile, as before her eyes, the damning, dooming words faded from the page.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne's angry scrawl faded to leave a blank page. A newer more elegant cursive script formed in answer to Daphne's apoplectic words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Masters and Mistresses past and present, are immune to my direct magic....\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe corner of Harriet's mouth quirked up into a smile or smirk, a tiny movement, but enough to be caught by Daphne's eagle eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe book whirled around, and Daphne read the message. A derisive snort came from her, annoyance with the book's limitations, and her... apparent humiliation in front of the target of her rage. But also relief that it wasn't Harriet's power that was to blame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe page crinkled, as her grip tightened, and the idea of tossing the offending book across the room was dismissed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"You... This... I don't need this.\" she said drawing her wand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tip dazzlingly white as she held it inches from Harriet's face.</span></div></div>",

She remained frozen, as she felt a steadying hand take her arm, guiding her like an over-large party balloon. She wanted to turn her head, even her peripheral vision was now of the ceiling hanging over her rigid horizontal body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tip of Daphne's wand was brilliant white, the glare lighting up a corner of the room. Harriet felt the dusty table top, as she drifted lower. Her full round cheeks flattening as more of her weight was released from the spell. As her shoulders came to rest, she felt her full weight return.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's a shame.\" Daphne observed, softly tutting her disapproval.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're in too much of a rush. I think you just need to experience something... <i>something </i>wonderful.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet felt some ropes wrapping themselves around her wrists and ankles. Once they were secure, they slowly, relentlessly started to pull. Each towards the opposite corner of the table. She felt tears well up in the corner of her eyes, at this humiliation. She couldn't even see the hand that Daphne slapped down on her left tit. She couldn't even flinch (outwardly) at the rough treatment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That impetuous rush to return to being 'The Boy who Lived'.\" the words came out loaded with contempt, as she circled a long fingernail round and around Harriet's enlarged, and oh-so sensitive nipple. To her eternal humiliation, she felt her body responding, the offending nip, stiffening up tautening at the attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"A little -<i>mmmm</i>- ostentatious for me. But I see, they are wonderfully sensitive.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe shifted her grip, cradling one breast in both her hands like a potter ready to work some clay on the wheel. She teased it once more brushing both her thumbs back and forth over the diamond hard nipple.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe heard Daphne mutter some spell in a low voice, and a shot of pain shot through her chest. Or more precisely between Daphne's wandering thumbs, as a piercing flashed into existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet wanted to thrash, to dismiss that pain, as if to throw off the pain. She was unaware of Daphne's true delight at Harriet's gorgeous, curvy body, or the pleasure she'd have felt, at the sight of her breasts heaving and rolling, a symphony or erotic dance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe felt Daphne release her grip, a slight huff or relief was the only freedom she had. Her relief was brief, as Daphne mused aloud, \"<i>Mmmm</i>, It's a shame to leave a girl uneven.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer shoes clicked loudly on the stone floor, each one counting down to a repeat of the same pain, the same humiliation, as she walked around the table to repeat the piercing in her other breast. If she could have, she'd have begged for mercy, shaken her head in denial. But instead, she lay mute, and unresponsive, as she felt Daphne's hand caress it's way up from her ankle, passing her wide hips, her toned tummy. She tried to marshal her mental reserves, as once more she felt Daphne's two hands cradle her breast. Once more she felt those thumbs teasing back and forth. She didn't want to think about her body's responses. The ecstasy of powerlessness, must be magically imposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUntil, once more she heard that low voice, the muttered spell, and the flash of pain, as she was blessed with a second nipple piercing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne leaned close to Harriet's immobile head, \"They're not too obvious, just a jewel tipped pin.\" she explained, \"Naturally, they're immune to magic themselves.\" she smirked, \"And for the more attentive, for those who get to see them, there's a lovely little detail. The pins are silver, and the jewels emerald. The Slytherin colours to remind you every time you see them of your defeat at my hands.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDaphne walked down Harriet's body, one forefinger tracing it's way through her recumbent cleavage, and circling her naked belly button. A whimper escaped Harriet's lips, but either the whimper was enough for Daphne, or she missed the opportunity. Harriet briefly felt her pubic hair, as it tangled the tracing finger.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet remained immobile, as Daphne's fingers explored her pussy. Teasing her with the knowledge and experience that Harriet hadn't known. Inside she was begging for mercy, her mind under assault from her emotions, her hormones, as she lay there, she came and came. Her orgams entirely hidden from the world, beyond a widening of her eyes, and a faint tremor in her thigh muscle.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut this was enough for Daphne, as she threw her head back and laughed and laughed.</span></div></div>",

Plucking at her stiff clit, she heard Harriet's breath catch in anticipation. As she spotted her nostrils flare. Harriet was regaining her mobility the Petrificus spell was wearing off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgain she silently cast the spell. Harriet's thigh muscles tightened, as she felt the newest piercing spring into existence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This one's golden with an elegant ruby. I think you know why?\" Daphne snorted and continued nonetheless, \"A Gryffindor pussy for your pussy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet's pinky twitched.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>'Oblivio'</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe tension faded from Harriet's muscles as her memories unwound. She stared at the ceiling of the unfamiliar classroom. Trying to work out where she was, and how she ended up there. There was a few interesting stains that suggested a potions class. She was worried about the sharp pain she was sensing from her nipples and pussy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHad she been over-enthusiastic in exploring the peaks of her body's pleasures, or... or what?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo her side, she heard a door open and close. Desperately she wanted to see who it was, but stubbornly her head refused to move. As the door clicked closed, she managed to force her head sideways. But it was just a doorway with no hint who'd been here. No hint who'd brought her such pleasure. She felt gross, sticky and so aroused, so satisfied. Her bloods still sang with the joy she'd recently experienced...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe smiled as she sat up musing on who her potential lover might have been.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was totally naked from head to toe, and a small pile of ashes on the class floor was probably all that remained of her clothes. Swivelling sideways, she eased her legs from the table and hopped down. It wasn't far, but her thighs were already aching from their exertion. Her wandering hands had already discovered the chill silver metal piercing each of her plump nips. Diving downwards, her probing fingers confirmed the presence of the third one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe couldn't remember agreeing to them. But even the slightest brushing attention made her intensely aware of the piercing, and that particular part of her body. Harriet wondered, worried about the significance of the emerald and silver of the nipple rings. Was her lover a Slytherin, was it a clue or a coincidence....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn any case, she wasn't going to solve it in this room, naked and alone. Touching the tip of her wand to her head, she summoned up the image of her uniform, and started chanting the spell in a low voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDespite the chill air of the room, she felt a hint of sadness at covering up her wonderful body. As she felt the tickling caress as her blouse slithered over her skin until it was complete. She felt warmth return to her body as the Gryffindor cardigan formed atop the blouse.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/4d/c6/da/4dc6da79f53d2bf108f7503839b9dc27.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nSummoning a short skirt, she enjoyed the sensation of the pleated hem brushing back and forth across her thighs. She had considered a longer one, but hiding legs like these should be a crime. The air shimmered in front of Harriet, and smoothed into a perfect silver sheen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarriet admired her reflection, as she felt her tie knot itself, and slide upwards into place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CeLa5YgUAAAPikt.jpg:large\" target=\"_blank\">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CeLa5YgUAAAP...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe practised her pout, intending to reward Gerry with an instant erection.

There was a delightful bounce from the girls, just another perk of being a girl, she thought happily to herself. Though she looked forward to sharing her joy with Gerry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer fingers brushed over her bust, the touch exciting her nips, as her bra held the chilly metal against her sensitive flesh. Unbuttoning her blouse buttons, she double-checked her piercings. Her memory foggy, only the pleasurable bite, as she received them her strongest memory. Plucking at the cups of her bra, she admired them once more. The emerald jewel contrasting with the soft pink of her nipples. It might be her imagination, but the silver twists around the jewel... They sort of looked serpentine, and from this angle... kind of like a snake taking an intimate bite at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA cutesy frown furrowed her brow. Surely it wasn't accidental, surely it was Gerry that gave her these wonderful reminders, that kept her aware of her femininity of her appeal to her special man...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlas, nothing sprang to mind, and reluctantly, she smoothed her bra back into place, and redid the buttons on her blouse. Once more the fabric pulled tight, accentuating her lush curves, and outlined the soft cups of her bra.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo answers would be found, if she kept hiding in this classroom. Throwing her shoulders back, and lifting her chin, she strode purposefully towards the door. A proud and sensual woman. A huntress seeking her prey, seeking her answers...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was barely a couple of paces, but she stopped, had to stop. The gentle tap-tap, with each strutting, stride was too much. Her cheeks flushed, and despite confidence, she plucked at the hem of her skirt.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLifting it as if ashamed, like a naughty girl expecting punishment, half-excited, half-scared, she looked beyond the swell of her chest to the sparkle of the ruby, and the winding golden wires securing it to her stiff clit. The twists of filigree made the head of a lion quite clear, the ruby like the blood of it's victim held between it's jaws. Hanging down from that it was split in two pieces, each swinging loose, the body of the lion, and flicking back and forth the tail of the lion. The details were incredible, Harriet thought she could even see muscles on the tiny torso of the cat.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIdly her fingers wanted to flick and pluck at it. The sensations addictive, even unmoving the chill of the metal was stimulating. Walking... Walking was just too much.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wicked smile flashed over her face, she looked forward to confront Gerry with her problem, of pointing it out to him. How needy it made her feel, and how only he could solve that problem.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No!\", She stopped that train of thought.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Vestiti Intime</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith resigned necessity, she tapped her wand, and watched as the lion was hidden, she felt the thong form up, holding everything in place, and keeping her stimulation to a minimum, a just barely functional minimum. Shimmying her hips from side to side, she eased the thong into place over the swell of her hips, and the cutting pressure of the thong, as it pressed against her back-hole. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe hadn't consciously chosen it, but the soft suede of her thong felt softer than the silkiest satin she'd ever worn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStepping out from the room, she went off to confront Gerry.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

The teasing lingerie clung to her over-ripe body, the suede panties cleaving to her pussy, and the lion's head jewellery was outlined in the material. The design might be hard to make out, but the evidence of 'a' piercing, if not what it was, would be clear to any roving eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer KK-cup bust was heavy, and awkward sloshing from side to side, despite the best efforts of the bra. Again, the heft of the girls ensured that those piercings were driven forward. Her classmates could tell she was pierced in each of those temptingly, teasingly immense nipples.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCursing the school rules, and her spotty memory, Harriet tried to summon up more clothes... more of a uniform to hide these degrading piercings. The Slytherin ones would be impossible to explain even if she knew herself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAdjusting herself, Harriet gasped, as she felt them bite down. They were obviously enchanted, the tiny mocking snakes clenched tightly to those nipples, their silvery bodies writhing enough to draw attention through the strained satin of the cups. As her hands recoiled, her breathing steadied, and the snakes settled back into immobility.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHunching her shoulders, she hoped to minimise their appearance, but it was pathetic. Nothing could disguise her immense bust. A feature that defined and ruled her life every bit as much as that damned scar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, she decided to lean into them.

Smirking to herself, as her cleavage framed his chin.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA back heel, opened the door further and Harriet was carried across the threshold like a new bride. Every bit as giggly and eager. Her body now in full control, Harry's intellect just along for the ride... and hating enjoying every moment, every touch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnother back heel closed the door, with a slam that made Harriet clutch Cormac closer. Sure they'd be discovered, that he'd be her champion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInstead, it was only the sound of their breathing that filled the room. No sound of anyone stampeding towards them ready to stop, or voyeuristically watch her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCormac put her down atop one of the benches. Looking down on him through her cleavage, his lust clear on his face... Just as hers surely was too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis hands rose teasing their way over her ribs, rising higher and higher. Teasingly slowly, the octopus finally allowed his warm hands to slide forward, cupping Harriet's bust. Her nips stiffening against the palms of his hands, as he mauled and kneaded her breasts like bakers' dough.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer breathing became even hungrier, her lust insatiable. Cormac stepped closer, Harriet's thighs either side of him spreading wider on the table top.</span></div></div>",

As she got closer and closer, she drank in his aroused musk, the obvious reaction also straining his trousers. Draco shifted uncomfortably, unsure whether to hide his excitement, or not.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'He's Draco Malfoy.' she screamed inside her head, 'It's Draco -fucking- Malfoy.' she cried silently from behind powerless eyes.

Pressing her body to his, she allowed one hand to snake downwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA murmurring purr of approval, as she felt Draco's cock through the fabric. It twitched, and bobbed at Harriet's touch. Draco's hand rose firmly to her cheek. As he pulled her in for a deep passionate kiss, keeping Harriet close as if still expecting a trick. Harriet's blood pounded in her ears deafening her, excitement made her giggly and submissive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMirroring Draco's gesture with her free hand, she caressed Draco's cheek. Her touch copying his touch. Her eyelashes fluttered uncontrollably, as her body took control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe only fly in the ointment was the sticky mess in her palm. 'It's Draco -fucking- Malfoy....' echoed around her head once more, only curiosity and discomfort making her think about her palm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA lightning bolt fired through Harriet's brain, as she realised it was the last sticky toffee, she'd spat into her hand. As much to remove the sticky mess from her hand as for any other reason, Harriet grip shifted on Draco's cheek. His passionate lips finding the sticky toffee, and a fascinated tongue snaking it into her mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe amorous kissing continued, with only the chewing of Draco interrupting the kiss.</span></div></div>",

Even as Harriet eased her back away from the wall, Draco was kissing her just as passionately. Inside Harriet's head, the compulsion snapped, and broke, the rules no longer forcing her to accept Draco's attentions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, she wanted to draw out Draco's misery, as she felt '<i>little Draco</i>' wither in her hand. Still locked together, Draco was shrinking, making it easier for Harriet to drive her across the hall. Pressing Draco's back against the opposing wall. They were momentarily eye-to-eye, Draco didn't feel the rules change his uniform. Harriet's fingers teasing, and tweaking his shrinking cock, he was too lost in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe shirt transforming to a blouse passed unnoticed. Even the long trousers changing to a short skirt raised barely an objection, a questioning moan, swallowed by the kiss. Draco mistook his growing hair as Harriet's, her closed eyes missing the platinum blonde locks that danced over his shoulders.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEven as he slipped from Harriet's questing fingers, Draco was blind to her new gender. Harriet's fingers soon finding a new rhythm and the moans, mewls, gasps coming to replace the groans, and gulps. But it was probably the change from T-shirt to bra that Draco couldn't ignore. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe soft chest that Harriet had felt develop, to press against her sumptuous bust, was small by comparison. It was hard to tell without a proper look. The tones of Draco's moans took on a more panicked tone. Her hands instead of caressing Harriet's cheek, and generous chest were trying to force the Gryffindor witch backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey had lost even their boyish energy, slender and lacking any muscle, she was powerless.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRealising that Draco was now aware of the change, Harriet broke the kiss and took a couple of steps backwards.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://66.media.tumblr.com/4ef1040ebf365228f6427cd9ba24c29d/tumblr_prjlffxaDh1w2lwkto1_1280.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://66.media.tumblr.com/4ef1040ebf36...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pouting Draco's eyes flashed with fury. Perhaps, an A-cup, or maybe a B-cup, it was clear she was far less powerful than Harriet, her power too weak to compare. Dismissive words died on her lips, as she took in Harriet's immense bust. Her questing hands mauling her own bust, Draco couldn't deny she was a witch... Far more than a squib, but not in the same league, as the woman opposite.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe scent in Harriet's nose was different now. The musky male aroma replaced by a different smell, the aroma of an aroused woman hanging heavily in the air. Draco's hands went to her skirt, too late to hide the damp patch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA look of fear, and dread flickered behind her eyes, as something made her want to run.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe reason coming clear to Harriet, as Draco's uniform started to breakdown. The skirt, was fraying, patches falling to the floor. <br>\r\nHer hands tried slapping at it, as if putting out a fire. But as she watched the Slytherin serpent patch hit the stone floor, it continued to break apart, the threads falling loose, and the loose threads turning to dust, and the dust turning into puffs of smoke and vanishing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe cloak fell from her shoulders revealing for them both, the shortness of her skirt, and the swell of her bust. The plain bra pressed forward, her chest heaving as she gulped air deep into her incredulous lungs. As if hypnotised by it's progress, Draco could only watch, as the pleats of the skirt dangled then dropped free. A bare band of frayed material served more as a belt than a skirt revealing silk panties.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the magic of the school rules continued to eat away at Draco's uniform, she fled the corridor, her shoes slapping down the first set of strairs. Harriet guessed she was racing for the 'safety' of the Slytherin dorm.</span></div></div>",

He dismissed it, not the most impressive welcome, and then to claim authority to teach his fellow students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the ornate snakes finished clanking and chiming aside, the door heaved open.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe chaos, the destruction of Ron's backfiring wand, and Gilderoy's casting were still evident. Apparently, the chamber was largely left alone. It's reputation enough to keep most everyone away. The danger of further traps always a possibility given who crafted and created it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnyway, Harry entered, eager to explore without a basilisk on his tail trying to kill him.

A hall like room, they could use to practise spells in privacy, away from the roving eyes of Dolores Umbridge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe devastation was more severe than he remembered. The place where the backfire had thrown Lockhart. Idly, he kicked at some debris, probably a dusty brick. It flew further than it should have, with the sound of paper flapping... pages flapping.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nScrabbling after it, he discovered, Ron's old wand, the two halves barely held together with sellotape. Then he discovered the book. It had to have fallen from Gilderoy's robes, a book too precious to have been packed in his cases.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Hogwarts: The Rule Book', the words sparkling as the gilt embossed title shimmered against the plain leather of the cover.

Running his thumb over the esteemed names, Harry realised they weren't printed. This book actually was signed by four of the most powerful witches and wizard's of history.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe snapped it closed, something he could show Hermione when he wanted her to be quiet, when he wanted her to change the subject.

But, it was the signatures at the end that startled him. Godric Gryffindor, Salazar Slytherin, Helga Hufflepuff &amp; Rowena Ravenclaw.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBrushing his fingers over them, over the surface of the page, he was sure it and they were fakes. But his touch only confirmed they were real. The page was uneven and crudely made, the signatures written with a quill scratched at the surface, the slight indent into the surface ensuring they were real.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry almost dropped the book as he worked out it's age. His fingers trembled as he realised it was over 1,000 years old. He smirked, Hermione would know exactly. Flicking through the rest of the book, Harry found that the remaining pages were blank. It seemed odd, given how hard paper was to make in those days, and it was obviously enchanted not to surrender to time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter the rules were written, there was a short explanation about keeping the book in the headmaster's office, and updating the rules as time and circumstances changed. It warned against frivolous changes, and unforeseen consequences. Annoyingly it also warned about being too reverential to existing rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile Harry was sure the book was genuine, and not a Weasley Wheeze, he was concerned about defacing an ancient artefact. He decided to give it a small task to perform.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"cblue\"><i>Ron's wand is not broken.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs his quill dotted the end of the sentence, Harry watched as the spellotape unravelled from around the wand, flying off into the air. Revealed beneath the wand was the Ash of it's structure, it's perfection clear to Harry's eyes. Even to his touch there was no trace of a join, or sign it was ever broken.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Lumos</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt didn't feel as good a fit as his own wand, but it performed the spell without flaw. Only a little dimmer, a little weaker than his own wand would have responded to his will. It saddened Harry that his best friend didn't have his own wand, that he'd inherited one. Only now realising how important that visit was to Ollivander's, how important it was to have the wand choose the wizard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry sat back down and thought about what this meant. The power of this book was terrifying and intriguing. Initially he thought he best keep it from his friends. Promising himself he'd return the wand to Ron, as a repair and leave out the rule-book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFinally, he left the chamber of secrets, it felt like everyone's eyes were on him. As if everyone could see what he carried, and it's latent power. Certainly some were spying on him for Dolores Umbridge, but the friendly 'Hello's' echoed from the walls as he passed. The vast majority of students only nodding to him, or just oblivious to his passing.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Gryffindor Common room was busy, as Harry passed through, heading with his head down to his dormitory.</span></div></div>",

It'll be easy to concentrate on schoolwork.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds like a plan to me.\"  Harry said as he dug out his trusty old invisibility cloak and handed it to his best friend.  Ronni motioned Neville to get behind him and he whipped the cloak over the two of them.  Although because Ronni was so tall and his ass was so wide the two had to get right up against each other to keep their feet from showing.  Harry chuckled as he heard Ronni swear under her breath by the stairs, \"Hey, watch where you're putting that thing!\"  Followed by an embarrassed, \"Sorry sorry,\"  from Neville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter they had left Harry looked back to the Rule Book.  He felt bad about what the book had done to Ron, but he knew it would be all worth it once he got a load of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle.  Harry grabbed his Marauders Map and set out to find the troublesome Slytherin trio so he could check out their punishments they probably had gotten.</span></div></div>",

The unfamiliar Neville's feet kept on appearing on their own. Eventually, she warned him, to almost hug her, and keep pressed against his spine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonni was only happy once she could feel Neville's body pressed against her spine, and his breath in her hair. She didn't fancy being caught and punished for Neville's carelessness. Neville's hands shook as they held on, forcing Ronni to clutch and hold them in place. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonni scowled, as Neville gave an awkward squeak at the contact. She snorted in amusement, as she felt Nev's embarrassment. It wasn't like she was really a witch. However, they were almost out of the castle, when Ronni felt Neville's excitement.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wanted to elbow him, to recoil in horror and humiliation at the response she'd provoked from Neville. \"Calm down, This isn't really me...\" Ronni hissed in low agitation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA muttered mantra of \"Sorry... Sorry... Sorry...\" came from behind her. His agitation growing, and rising in volume, until she hissed for him to be quiet. \"The invisibility cloak.... doesn't block apologies...\" she said in stern warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonni tried not to think about the bobbing cock, and the rhythmic fleshy tapping against the base of her spine. Desperately tried not to picture it. She wanted to ignore it, pretend she was still Ron, that somehow it was his... his own. But she was red-faced, her cheeks burning hot.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually, they made it beyond the castle, and out of sight. The walk to Hogsmeade was awkward, as Ron swept the cloak aside. Glad for the extra space, and free to walk into the village.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Should we walk hand in hand?\" Neville asked half-joking, half-nervously.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonni ripped her gaze from Neville's trousers, and the telltale bulge there. It just wasn't going away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTucking the cloak away, the pair wandered the village until the reached Miss Puddifoot's Tea-shop. Neville opened the door, and gestured for Ronni to enter. The chime of the bell making their arrival impossible to hide.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe bell chimed a second time, as Ronni's wide hips crashed against the door frame, still not used to the new width. She smiled an apology. Leading the way, she found as inconspicuous a table as she could, and led Neville there.</span></div></div>",

Ronni adjusted her skirt as she sat, but of course it barely covered it's colossal contents.  Ronni felt lace and silky texture of the seat against his thighs and the odd feeling made him blush a little bit.  Thankfully as Neville sat down his eyes weren't on Ronni's face, his face was just as red as he alternated from looking at the fine tablecloth and occasionally glancing up at Ronni's chest like it was a magnet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two barely had time to settle down before a witch with a very sweet sounding voice asked, \"And what can I get for the cute couple?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Not a couple.\"  Ronni grumbled.  \"Uh, we're just here to study.\"  Ronni said as he put some paper and a quill on the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course you are dear, in that case I'll get you two some tea with a shot of concentration solution to help you focus on what you think is important.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, you don't have to, that sounds expensive.\"  Ronni said hoping the witch would go away so he could just get this homework done with but Neville feeling bad about the awkwardness of the trip said, \"I'll pay for it, no problem.  It's the least I can do for the uh...awkward trip.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonni's face turned even redder as she flashed back to the thought of Neville pushing so hard against her back she could feel his heartbeat among other things.  As the waitress walked off to turn in the order, Neville and Ron got to work.  In just a few minutes Ron was already half way through the work of labeling the parts to a couple of magical plants when the witch brought by their tea.  A thirsty Neville downed the tea in one gulp as Ronni continued to write.  After a minute Ronni asked, \"And what's this dangly bit of the plant called it's kinda shaped like a...Neville what are you doing?\"  Ronni looked up to see the Neville had a slightly glazed look in his eyes as he stared unabashedly at Ronni's chest.  \"OI!  Eyes up here Neville!\"  Ronni hissed, but as Neville looked Ronni in the eyes she felt even more uncomfortable.  Looking for something to do, Ronni put the velvety looking tea to her lips and the second she did she felt her eyes go wide as she looked at Neville.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRonni had never thought of it before, but Neville had a cute chubby little face.  In fact, the more Ronni stared at it, the more handsome she thought he looked. The two Hogwarts students just stared at each other from across the table silently.  But words were not needed at the time.  They just concentrated on what was before them, taking in each inch they could see over the table.  The two were so lost in each other's eyes they didn't even notice they had begun holding their hands over the forgotten homework.  Eventually the day had to end as the sun began to set and the witch came back over to the table, \"Can I interest either of you in desert before we close shop for the day?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What was that?  Huh, oh no!  What time is it?  Damn it, Neville we need to finish the homework before night fall, let's get out of here.\"  Ronni said in a huff.  Neville just gave a noncommittal, \"Huh?\"  as he left some silver on the table and dutifully followed Ronni out of the store.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the two walked down the street of Hogsmeade looking for a place to finish the homework Ronni said, \"There, the Hog's Head.  Nobody goes there anyways so it should be quiet.\"  Ronni practically dragged Neville into the bar and the two stopped by the only person there, the barman.  The bearded man squinted his piercing blue eyes the two who entered his store.  He bluntly said, \"You're Hogwarts.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And you're a bartender.  Could you get us two butter beers...and if you can some fire whisky?\"  Ronni asked a little hopefully.  The bartender continued to stare at the two and Ronni noticed his eyes had fallen on his hand.  It wasn't til then that Ronni realized he'd been holding Neville's hand since they were inside the tea shop.  Ronni let go embarrassed and the barman shrugged and poured two glasses of fire whiskey for the students.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both downed it in one gulp feeling a warmth spread throughout their bodies as they sat at a table and finally got back to the herbology homework.</span></div></div>",

As the butter beer drizzled down Ronni's face and rolling down his bosom Neville finally gave in after hours of trying not to and starred as the golden liquid oozed its way down until it was absorbed into Ronni's top.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd Ronni was too excited to finally be done with her homework that she didn't even notice Neville's staring, but she did notice what was going on out of the window.  \"Oh bollocks!\"  Ronni cried, \"Come on Neville, we need to get back to school so I can turn this in!  I don't want to wait until tomorrow, let's go!\"  Ronni got up to leave, and after being hypnotized briefly by the jiggling of Ronni's ass and thighs, Neville followed.  Ronni got out the invisibility cloak and held it up for Neville to get under, \"Come on, we have to hurry, just hold on.\"  Neville didn't need to be told twice, and holding on tighter than he had any broom, Neville wrapped his arms around Ronni's waist and hugged close as the two now closer than ever friends began to lightly jog back to school.  Ronni was annoyed by the constant bouncing of his chest, but she knew that it would be gone soon.  And she was actually grateful for Neville holding her so close, his ass would be jiggling just as much as her chest but Neville was pressed so hard against it, Ronni felt weirdly secure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey made it back to Hogwarts in record time, they sprinted past Hagrid's hut and made their way to the greenhouses where thankfully for Ronni, Professor Sprout was just locking up.  \"Professor!\"  Ronni called out leaving the safety of Neville and the invisibility cloak behind.  Professor Sprout jumped a bit in surprise before smiling, \"Ah, Miss Wasley, what are you doing out so late.  It's nearly curfew and a young woman shouldn't be out alone at this time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But I'm not, or at least I won't be for long.  Look!  I did it!  I finished the homework!\"  Ronni handed over her homework with pride to the earthy professor who scanned the notes and raised her eyebrows in surprise.  \"Well done Miss Weasley, and it's your own handwriting this time instead of Miss Granger.  Well done.  Your punishment is lifted, but don't fall behind again Mr. Weasley.\"  <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd sure enough, Ron looked down and his bra was containing nothing but his average pecs.  Ron jumped for joy giving anyone looking decent look at his 'weasel' as the skirt he was still wearing flipped up as Ron celebrated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You really should wear this,\"  the voice of Neville said as he took off the cloak and offered it to Ron trying not to look at Ron who did not look as good in a skirt as Ronni did.  Ron seemed to realize for the first time that he was still wearing the girl's revealing uniform.  \"Merlin's hat!  Thanks Neville, I owe you one again.\"  He put not he cloak to hide his ridiculous look from the world.  Neville sounding a little sad this little adventure with a friend is over said, \"Well then, I guess I'll see you back in the dorm room.\"  And he closed up his cloak and began the long walk back to the castle.  He'd only taken a few steps when Ron opened the cloak in front of him, \"What are you doing you twat, get under here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"But, I already helped you, you don't need to hide with me again.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRon rolled his eyes, \"Stop being thick Neville, curfew just hit, get under here or else Filtch will have you in chains,\"  And with a smile Neville joined his friend under the cloak and the two made it back to the dorm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry and all of his friends had a relatively normal week at Hogwarts, although there occasionally new temporary female students in some classes, but nothing too out of the ordinary until trouble came around.</span></div></div>",

However, Ginny did very well to keep him occupied, and also filled in his place on the house Quidditch team. She even slipped into the inner circle, already being friendly with Harry soon, she was studying with Hermione in the library, and strengthening that friendship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny confided that it was being kept a family secret... well, shame really. Only herself, Fred and George were being informed of Ronni's progress or lack of it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFred and George were as ever, unhelpful, asking Harry when he was marrying into the family.... and which Weasley he'd be marrying!?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's face went crimson with shock, as he was with Ginny when these questions were asked. Usually, Ginny would land a punch on their arm, if they were within range, or they'd risk being cursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe question still ate away at the back of Harry's mind. He truly didn't want to think about it, and tried to distract Hermione and offer her support for her missing boyfriend.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuietly approaching Hermione in the library, he heard her and Ginny confiding. Some instinct made him keep out of sight at the end of the book case. The low muttered conversation, covering shameful Weasley secrets. It was a traditional wizarding family, and the roles for witches were normally house-based, and house-work focused. The snort of disapproval was clear from Hermione. Drawing a reassurance from Ginny that she'd be an exception had she married Ron, as the more powerful magic user.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe confessed the daily taunts she'd face about being raised to marry, and keep a tidy home... and -<i>she shuddered</i>- squeeze out more wizarding children.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny's tone walked a fine line, as clearly the whole family agreed with this philosophy to one degree or another. This drove her to work harder, to excel and generally rise too high to be a simple home body. There was a hint of joy in Ronni's fate. That Ron's words were coming back to bite her in the ass. Then her tone would flip.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOffering sympathy, and encouragement, perhaps she'd be happy with that life-style. Even if she fancied a more challenging life, had Ron shown much interest in his work, or being the best wizard he could be...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOn the verge of tears, and afraid he'd reveal himself, Harry stepped out gently whistling. Instantly the conversation changed, as Ginny patiently explained the details of Quidditch to Hermione.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt sounded so natural, Harry almost doubted what he'd just overheard.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe time dragged on, Harry's friendship with Ron was different than that of Hermione or Ginny. And he missed his dorm-mate.

As soon as Binns went back to his droning on about goblin rebellions for the 100th time Harry took the chance to whisper to Ron.  \"Hey Ron, what happened to you?  Mrs. Weasly wasn't too harsh on you?\"  But all Harry go was a stern look and a 'shush' from Ron that would put Hermione's to shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Guess he's trying to be a good student so Binns will turn him back.'  Harry thought as he went back to taking notes.  Although Ron, or at least Veronica kept 'accidentally' brushing up against Harry while they were taking notes.  Each time Harry would turn to look, Veronica was just scribbling away so furiously she actually had a bit of a jiggle to it.  Finally Binn's class ended and Harry tried to talk to his best friend, but Binns floated over and interrupted by floating through Harry and looking down at the table's notes.  \"Miss Weasly, you've made excellent strides in class.  I believe we may end your punishment now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry and Hermione both shared a smile before frowning as they heard Veronica curtly say, \"No thank Professor.  See you next class.\"  Veronica turned to leave and other two members of the trio left to follow her.  Harry was glad they had lunch in the great hall next, but Veronica took an unexpected turn towards a portrait of a bowl of fruit.  \"Hey Ron, or uh, Veronica.  The great hall is this way, aren't you looking forward to a return feast?\"  Harry asked but Veronica just smiled sweetly at him, \"Oh Harry Hogwarts food is better than what those muggle give you in the summer but it's just not good enough for you.  The house elves need to learn to cook with an element of motherly love and I'm going to go help them.  Don't worry.  I'll make sure I cook your food myself so you'll be eating a little piece of me.  Enjoy.\"  With that Veronica tickled the pear in the portrait gently turning it into a handle which she used to enter the bustling Hogwarts kitchen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell did Mrs. Weasley do to him?\"  Harry asked dumbfounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What she always wanted to do with me.\"  A voice said from behind Harry, it was Ginny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this what you were telling me about?\"  Hermione asked quietly so passerby's couldn't hear.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, and then some.  Mom always insisted I be home schooled and become a proper home witch and clean the house and raise the family.  But I didn't want that and dad always stood up for me insisting she let me try out school first.  And she never had the chance to raise my brothers like the because, well, boys don't made good house witches.  But because of Ron being too lazy for even dad's liking and Hogwart's punishment rule it gave mom the chance at a homebound daughter she wanted.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry felt a pang of guilt at this revelation realizing this was all partially his fault because of that rule he wrote.  \"But it's only been a month, how can Mrs. Weasley turn our lazy lovable Ron into little miss housekeep such a short time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny looked harshly at Hermione, \"Don't look down on mom's magic just because she used it to raise a family.  Mom was one of the most powerful witches in her year when she went to Hogwarts, especially in charms and potions.  I'd bet you anything Ron got a daily does of mom's magic until she became the Veronica you saw today.  I almost didn't recognize my brother when she moved into the Gryfinndor girl's dorms earlier.  Mom's training unlocked something in Ron.  With one wave of her wand she cleaned the entire common room.  She's more efficient than a house elf.  Hell she might be the most powerful witch in the school now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHermione scoffed, \"Well now you're being ridiculous,\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I?\"  Ginny said as they sat down in the great hall, and suddenly on Harry's plate was a feast of chicken, bacon, eggs, fresh vegitables, and fancy cakes that were the best looking and smelling Harry had ever seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Her own and Hermione's plate were loaded up with the usual rich house-elf fare. While Harry's plate was far from mundane, it was loaded with his favourites.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Tsst..\" Ginny hissed a warning, as Harry raised his fork.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe passed her hand over his plate in a circling motion. As she chanted, certain items on the plate took on a glow. Outlined in a magical aura, she withdrew her hand.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Enchanted...\" Ginny announced with a huff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"She's cheating to win you over.\" A grimace on her face, suggesting a deep hatred for her new sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maybe it's just enchanted to taste better...\" Hermione offered, sensing an explosion on the verge of occurring.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Or, perhaps, it's a love potion.\" Ginny snapped back, as if accusing Hermione of some idiotic innocence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSnatching the fork from Harry's hand, she reloaded it with scrambled egg, and reached across the table.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So do you want to risk it?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe fire in Ginny's eyes kept Hermione's lips pressed together, as she shook her head 'No'. Not even risking speaking and having it thrust between her lips as she spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe allowed it to hover there. \"When it was Ron, he was your choice... are you sure Ronni wouldn't please you?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny's tone was hard to read, \"You could still have Viktor, to scratch certain urges, and have Ronni to keep your house in order.\"<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Trust me, Weasley women don't give up that easily.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I think I knew about that part already,\"  Harry said taking some time to admire how Ginny's body looking in her short skirted uniform.    Harry was about to lean in for a kiss when an oddly dangerous voice came from behind him, \"Oh Harry, no need to be silly, why haven't you eaten your lunch yet?  Are you not feeling well?\"  Harry turned and saw Veronica standing there with a determined smile on her face.  Although there was a bit of a twitch there showing she wasn't very happy.  Veronica was letting off an aura Harry had only felt around Mrs. Weasley that made him want to shrink away in shame.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, I'm sure it was great it's just...\"  Harry found himself meekly saying, but Ginny decided to do the speaking for him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You tried to trick Harry into falling in love with you with your enchanted food bribes!\"  Ginny said standing up at the table.  A few members of the other houses began to turn their attention towards what looked to be a brewing cat fight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nVeronica's smile didn't waver, \"Oh little Ginevera.  Harry already loves me.  And I love him.  We've loved each other as brother's for years before you had strung two sentences together for him.  We've shared the same bedroom for 5 years now.  We've seen each other's bodies in the showers.  What we have always had is a love.  I'm just helping Harry take that final step towards a lifetime of love and happiness in my arms.  All that you can offer him a teenage crush from a stubborn, little, girl.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny wasn't having any more of this, she did even reach for her wand, she just closed her fist and demonstrated some muggle dueling.  Many of the students watching cheered on, but Hermione ruined their fun by putting up a shield charm between the Weasley girls.  Ronni only took one blow to the face but that's all she needed as she looked to Harry with tears in her eyes, \"Do you see her?  Is this the woman you love?  Someone who would attack her own sister?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry looked between Ronni and Ginny.  He was flattered that these two beauties were fighting over him, but he needed to do something and make a decision or else the two were likely to tear the whole school apart for him.

And while Harry was very happy and a bit turned on to have two beauties fighting over him, he knew both of the Weasley's well enough to know that neither of them were going to let the other win.  And since this was a battle for Harry and not something with a set of rules, they'd be at each other's thoats for months, maybe even years.  Harry loved the attention but the idea of basically serving as a referee in Ronni and Ginny's love feud sounded a bit much for the teenager.  But then an idea came to him, and idea to settle this little feud once and for all.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry got up and practically sprinted back up to the Gryffindor boy's dormitory and pulled the ancient Hogwarts Rule Book out of his trunk.  Making sure nobody was around Harry began to write.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i><span class=\"clgreen\">If two or more witches proclaim their love for the same person, a contest shall be held called the Triwitch's Tournament.  Witches or Wizards turned witches around the school will submit their names and top three candidates as determined by an unbiased judge will compete in three events for their beloved.  The winner gets their love interest and the losers must acknowledge their defeat.</span></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLooking at the text Harry was decently satisfied, he could always go back and edit it later.<br>\r\n______________<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOne day later in the great hall at supper Dumbledore addressed the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I am happy to announce the return of an ancient tradition that hasn't been held at Hogwarts for a generation.  The TwiWitch Tournament.  The Goblet of Lust has awoken and given us the name of a student who's affections will be competed over.  Please come forth, Harry Potter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry tried to feign surprise, but took his place at the front of the hall and enjoyed the whispers from the other house tables since for once he was actually asking for this.  Harry looked at the ancient looking pewter black goblet with emeralds embedded in it that was spewing forth a red smoke.  As Harry looked at the curious magical artifact Dumbledore continued, \"If you wish to compete for the affections of Mr. Potter you will submit your name to the Goblet of Lust.  You have 24 hours before the 3 witches shall compete in 3 different events.  And to ensure there is none, or at least limited possibilities of pranking I will be putting a Ditzification Curse line around the goblet so if you do not cross the line with a heart of love for Mr. Potter you will suffer the consequences.  Good luck to all the applicants.  Let the preparations for the TriWitch Tournament BEGIN!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo nobody's surprise, the second Dumbledore stopped speaking Ginny and Ronni were the making their way to the Goblet of Lust.  Ginny was the first to put her name in as Ronni couldn't find her quill and had to settle for writing her name in lipstick on a piece of paper.  Harry didn't notice anyone else submit their name, but perhaps they needed time to work up the nerve or didn't want to do it in front of him.  Harry could see Fred and George scheming and taking glances over to the Slytherins table for some reason, but Harry didn't think anything of it.  Harry went to be knowing that tomorrow would be a very interesting day.</span></div></div>",

But Ronni didn't even speak, she just shook her head and covered herself in her bedsheets.  Harry sighed, \"Well, then we'd better get it over with and go to the quidditch pitch to get ready for the game against Slytherin.\"  Ronni just curled up under the bedsheets and moaned, \"Just tell Angalina I'm sick or something, I don't wanna fly like this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh wah wah Ronni.\"  Ginny said as Ronni let out a small squeal as he sprung another leak upon hearing Ginny's taunting cry.  \"Oh, sorry, that one was an accident.\"  Ginny said but she smiled and shook her head to Harry implying it wasn't.  \"Angelina doesn't have any backup Keeper's so either you play or Gryffindor has to forfeit.  And if that happens you'll be the most hated person in the house.  Not to mention what Fred and George will do if you wimp out of this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry could see Ronni shiver in fear at the thought of her brother's tormenting her.  Finally he said from under the sheets, \"Fine, I'll do it.\"  Reluctantly Ronni came out and went to her trunk which thanks to the Rule Book and the magic of Hogwarts now had a female uniform ready for him.  Before Harry could realize what was happening Ronni was stripping out of his ill fitting guy uniform into his new one.  Harry just stared slack jawed at his best friend admiring her bare chested beauty.  Ginny gave Harry a dirty look and let out a cough to get Ronni's attention.  Ronni turned and her face and breasts turned as red as his long lochs of hair.  Ronni gained enough composure of let out a girly scream and shouted, \"Oi!  Get out!\"  And he threw a pillow at Harry's face who was so distracted by the view his seeker instincts didn't take over and he toppled over, but before leaving he did get another peak as Ronni stared at the provided bra trying to figure out its mysteries.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry and Ginny played a game of wizard chess in the common room until Ronni finally made her public debut.  Her hair was a bit of a mess and her skirt was actually on backwards, but Harry wasn't going to risk making the emotional girl angry so the two members of the Gryffindor Quidditch team made their way to the pitch with Ginny in tow.  When they made it to the dressing room the rest of the team was already putting on the team robes.  As they went to their lockers Fred called out, \"Watch out George!  Ron's let loose a pair of Bludgers in the dressing room!\"  Ronni ducked instinctively before hearing Fred and George laugh and finally got the joke.  \"Very funny.\"  Ronni retorted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah, lighten up little bro, you're doing a good job of giving Ginny something to shoot for if she ever grows up.\"  George joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny's eye's lit up as she looked at the laughing twins, \"Angelina?  Where are the beaters bats?  I've got a pair of hard headed Bludgers I've got to beat.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe captain of the Quidditch team looked at Ginny and said, \"I can't let you do that until after the match Ginny, we need them if we want to stand any chance of beating Slytherin.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nGinny sulked and looked at Harry and said, \"I'll be cheering for you from the stands,\"  and she looked at Ronni for a second as she struggled to tie the front of her robes around her new chest.  \"And I guess I'll root for you too.\"  And she left while ignoring the twins.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe team finished changing into their robes (Angelina, Katie, and Alicia helped Ronni get finished including giving him a tie for his hair) and made their way to the pitch where Malfoy and the rest of the Slytherin quidditch team were waiting as the crowd cheers.  Harry was disappointed to see Malfoy hadn't been punished by a teacher yet under the new Rule Book rules, but Harry was pleased to see that the new Slytherin Beaters were two tall lumbering women with black hair who both looked incredibly uncomfortable as they kept adjusting their robes.  Harry could recognize the stupid looks on their faces as those of Crabbe and Goyle.  Malfoy smirked at Ronni and gave him an uncomfortably long look over of his new body.  \"I've got something very special for you planned for the match, and who knows, maybe I'll have something for you after the match.  I'd even forget my 'no blood traitors' standards for you.  After all, you actually turned out pretty unlike your mum.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFred and George stepped forward with their bats at the ready, \"Watch it Malfoy, nobody talks down to our sister except for us.  And NOBODY is aloud to talk about our mom.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMalfoy smirked, \"We'll see.\"  And with the trash talk out of the way Madam Hooch let loose the ball and the match began.  Gryffindor got off to a quick lead, after all the Slytherin beaters seemed to be more interested in their own kludgers under their robes rather than the ones they were supposed to hit.  Finally Slytherin got the Quaffle and made their way to Ronni who was trying to concentrate on the ball, at least until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"WAH WAH!\"  Harry looked to the stands and saw Draco was leading the Slytherin section in a chorus of baby like wails that seemed to have the desired effect.  Ronni became so unbalanced by his chest suddenly leaking uncontrollably that Slytherin scored easily.  The game continued like this, each time Slytherin got the ball the crowd would make baby noises making Ronni useless in goal.  This went on for almost an hour when Harry finally saw the golden snitch hovering beside Goyle who hadn't noticed.  He sped by causing Goyle to shriek in fear as the boy of lived sped right towards her.  With one hand Harry caught the snitch and for good measure with the other hand 'accidentally' grazed Goyle's new chest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n'Not bad'. Harry thought as he flew to the ground.  He saw Ronni flew right into the locker room without even celebrating.  Harry and the team celebrated in front of the stadium as the Slytherins sulked off.</span></div></div>",

He nodded a hello, wanting to talk, but already late to meet Hermione. A pang of jealousy hit him, as he took in her clothes. Her long Quidditch cloak and boots made him want to go for his broom to join her for whatever practice she was planning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a quick furtive glance, Ginny opened her cloak wide. She was wearing her Quidditch cloak and boots, and not a stitch more. His mouth dropped open, gaping like a landed fish, his jaw silently worked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSatisfied with her impact she leisurely closed the cloak, folding it to hide everything again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe undoubtedly had the twins sense of humour. Surely she wasn't really going to practice like that. His mind raced, as she passed him, her hand slipped out, running down his chest. With a quick squeeze confirming that Harry had appreciated her display.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill stunned into immobility, he took a moment to appreciate that Ginny was truly blessed. Her bust was never that ample, that full, that firm before. He didn't want to guess, but he knew she was a EE-cup girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe trembled from head to toe, as the power of the book sank in. He wanted to change it back, to restore Ginny. However, a wicked angel urged him to caution. Ginny looked so much happier now, so much more confident. He couldn't take that away... not without a good reason.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA snort escaped Harry, as he remembered what else he'd put in the book. He wanted to see the insecure Drusilla, the witch who tried to use seduction rather than brute force to get her way. He wondered if the busty daughter of Lucius and Narcissa were more blessed than Ginny. He imagined her leading a girl gang, from the back. With Daphne Greengrass, and Pansy Parkinson as her new associates.</span></div></div>",

Harry more flustered than Ginny, as if he were the one wearing only a cloak. Both smiled to Madam Pince, as they passed her desk. They walked deeper into the library passing numerous studious students studying.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly, she whirled around to face him. Her cloak briefly flying open as she spun. Another tempting view for Harry sending his cock twitching. His eyes goggled, as he looked around there were two other students who could've seen. At the opposite end of the rows of books, Ginny's display went unobserved.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Harry approached, she stepped closer. Wrapping her arms around him, she pulled him close. Pressing her naked body against his, a purr of approval as she again took control. The cloak hung close enough to hide Ginny's nudity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHer hands snuck around his waist, sliding effortlessly into the back pockets of his trousers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe felt her hands grope, and squeeze him, drawing a stuttering cough out. But he felt too scared to break loose, would that draw more attention. His mind raced.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"For luck.\" Ginny whispered, in the shocked and stunned Harry's ear. Withdrawing her hand, arms rising she ruffled his hair, before turning away. Tugging the cloak closed, she left the library, her hips swaying. The movement intoxicating even through the cloak. Harry felt nailed to the floor, his erection too obvious.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe almost laughed at that! He wasn't the one barely clothed in the library. He was barely conscious of where he was, finding an empty table and bench more by habit, than intelligence.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill dazed, he sat down. All thoughts of seeing a Dizzy Drusilla banished by the gorgeous memory of Ginny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n- - - - -<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSquirming, as he sat the bench not feeling as smooth, polished by centuries of students sitting. Rising again, he ran his hand over the smooth oak. Then it hit him, he snatched two items from his back pockets. Ginny's items,<i> 'for luck'</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNoisily his hand banged against the table, as he saw Ginny's panties, in one hand. Awkwardly, he jammed them back out of sight, in his lap beneath the table.Shaking his head, at her actions, his pulse slowing to that of a racing rabbit, he saw a folded piece of parchment.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"chotpink\"><i>I always won, when I wore these. Wear them, for me.</i></span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe pink quill scribble was undeniably Ginny's. Smirking thought he could use some luck on the Quidditch pitch. The dementors, that damned Lockhart, it felt like he was cursed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSlyly looking beneath the table, he pulled them wide, checking their size. Surely, they'd be too small for him. The lacy detailing, the design was ultra-feminine. He'd never imagined Ginny wearing anything so... so sexy. He swallowed, at the image of her wearing them. Again, as he imagined wearing them himself. Finally, a third time picturing something happening, and waking in the infirmary to curious expressions, and unasked questions.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLicking his parched lips, he smiled at the idea, after Ginny's delivery surely he couldn't be less daring.</span></div></div>",

Thankfully, the corridor was empty, and after a quick inspection found the toilet was too. Hands shaking, he double checked all the cubicles, before slipping into the end one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnsure, why he was doing it, but not wanting to stop in case he lost his nerve. Harry struggled to undress in the tight confines of the toilet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling Ginny's panties into place, he was amazed at how much they stretched. They clung to his hips, the lacy pattern stretched out of shape. Quickly he pulled his trousers on again, only breathing easily as he tightened his belt, and tugged his jumper back down.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was impossible to forget them, as Harry felt them shift with every movement he made.

A cry of joy, came out as an owlish shriek. He felt the wind caress his feathers, as he soared reading the breeze with his body. Down on the ground, the wolves were shrinking away, as he climbed. He had a magnificent view across the treetops of the forbidden forest.</span></div></div>",

She watched with amusement, as he cast a quick glamour over Harry.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry was oblivious to the spell, as his reflection changed in the bathroom mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CeLa5YgUAAAPikt.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CeLa5YgUAAAP...</a><br>\r\n<br>\r\nHarry's wild hair replaced by a flowing, leonine mane of curls. She felt a twinge of jealousy, as she followed her friend out of the toilets. Despite enjoying the joke, she hoped it faded before they reached the dungeon... and Professor Snape. She rather suspected the Potions Master didn't like Harry, even more than Gryffindors in general. He'd do something nasty, make the glamour a reality, or just make fun of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut, the speed of the glamour was impressive, as she tried to recall the details. She smiled absently, and nodded when Harry looked back to her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFor Harry it was a more confusing than amusing experience. The dizzying effect of experiencing that compressed time, and the re-writing of History. He was just glad Dumbledore was restored, and didn't want to press his luck too much. He ignored also the amused smile on Hermione's face, and the smirks from the other students he passed. As the boy who lived, he was used to being stared at. He knew that for everyone else Dumbledore had never died, and Voldemort was now completely dead. He shared Hermione's smile, even as his brain teased him with worries about the remaining Death-eaters, and other dark thoughts.</span></div></div>",
