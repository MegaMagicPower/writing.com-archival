One of the rings has come to be in the possession of Mr Burns and word soon leaked out of the rings and their powers. They each allow the person wearing them to wield supernatural powers and if anyone could collect them all and perform a ritual they would create a ring of unique power: A ring of unlimited wishes.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">There is talk throughout the town of the artefacts and where they might be. Many people are trying to find them including Mr Burns, Sideshow Bob, Lenny and Carl ect. Even the Simpson's themselves are after the rings as Lisa's research has suggested that there may be something in the supernatural powers that are attributed to them. They each grant the user the power to transform themselves or others in some way for example the ring of age allows one to AR/AP a subject while the ring of Inflation allows people to inflate/deflate themselves and others.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Many people in Springfield are seeking the power these trinkets might bring the only question is which pair of them will the story focus on?</div></span></div></div>",

So it was true. These magic items existed and Mr Burns had one of them. The rest she supposed given what happened to the aircraft carrying them must be somewhere in or near Springfield. Marge thought grimly that if something wasn't done then that nasty angry greedy old man would probably get his hands on *all* of the rings. Then god only knows what he'd do with them. For one thing probably de-age himself a bit so he wasn't so old and frail. Great thought Marge: Just what this town needs a new younger fitter but still crooked and spiteful Mr Burns.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">\"Marge! MARGE!\"</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Marge shook here head and looked at her husband who was sitting across the table from her shouting to try to get her attention. She frowned a little. \"Homer, do you mind I was trying to weigh up the situation and decide if we should do something. This is serious especially if that evil old man gets his hands on this magic power.\" Marge stated.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">\"Well what do we do? Mr Burns already has all the money in town. If he gets all these rings he'll be a million times worse Marge!\" Homer replied.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Marge sighed. \"Well I suppose we'll have to do something.\" She smiled at Homer somewhat. \"Don't worry, together we can find the rest of the rings and stop that old tyrant getting his hands on them. Maybe we can even get the ring he has if we play our cards right. Your with me right?\" Marge asked.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Homer nodded his head. \"Of course Marge. But do you think you can find the rings?\" Homer said.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Marge shook her head then spoke. \"Not specifically but I'm a witch so I can sense powerful magic items like Santa's Little Helper smells pork sausages.\" Marge answered.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Homer looked confused for a second or two. \"Soo..you smell them by sniffing the ground a lot?\" Homer asked.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Marge half closed her eyes and growled. \"Lets just go Homer, get the car ready.

So she instructed Homer to drive out to Springfield gorge too see if any rings had fallen there. Marge had a \"feeling\" that at least one of the powerful magic items was either in the gorge itself or in the woods nearby but this was more than a mere hunch. After all Marge was an accomplished witch and therefore had a knack for finding powerful magic artefacts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter an uneventful drive the Simpson's pink sedan pulled up at the picnic area near the side of the gorge. Marge and Homer got out of the car which Homer soon locks then looks at Marge who is looking around as if trying to gauge the direction to the location of the ring/s.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarge grumbles looking concerned. \"Mmmrr..Homer I'm getting mixed signals. I feel something down in the gorge itself but there is something in the woods on the other side. There's all so something else I'm feeling too. I don't know what it is but is sure as sugar isn't any magic item. I wonder if someone else is here looking for the rings too.\" She says before looking back at Homer who just shrugs and says. \"Well shouldn't we grab whatever we can and then get out of here? I mean it's kinda dangerous to be walking around alone in the woods like this. Besides there are other rings in Springfield and we've got to stop my boss getting them.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarge nods and then decides to head for.</div></span></div></div>",

She knew something magic was out there, maybe a wizard, warlock or another witch. Maybe some kind of magical creature from another world. One thing was for sure it was extremely unlikely to be friendly and Marge didn't like the idea of looking over her shoulder the whole time they where here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok Homer, follow me and try not to make a noise.\" Marge using her magic to call down a cloak of invisibility on herself and Homer she began to search the immediate area trying to find out what if anything was here and if something was what kind of threat it would pose.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey spent maybe half an hour walking back and fourth through the woods playing a game of cat and mouse with..what? Something was out there. Marge was surer of that than ever. Eventually they confronted whatever it was in a clearing.

She suddenly went through a flashback of when she was Lisa's age and her mother, who was one of the most powerful witches in the world, would tell her the story of the Dekokaun tribe. The tribe was destructive, wore cloaks and masks, and was known only by magical beings not just because it was secret, but also because they were where the darks arts started. A long time ago, the Denokuans forged the ring of Unlimited Wishes which was the mother of all magic in the universe. One time, a legendary pope, Pope John the First, took the tribe's ways as respect of the devil and assaulted their base in Asia. During the battle, one of the tribes members hid the Ring where it was never seen again. But the reason why there were so many little rings was a mystery. Sadly, she never even told Lisa about the tale.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarge immediately shook out of her flashback when the cloaked figure saw her and teleported in front of her. \"Sorry if I scared you miss, I am Rinusha,\" the being said. \"What do you want from me?\" Marge asked curiously. \"I want what is mine!\" Rinusha roared when he tried to grapple Marge only with failure. \"Homer! Run!\" Marge commanded him when he didn't do so and just watched. Marge and Rinusha then both released bolts of lightning from their fingertips. Both energy beams collided for a while until one pasted through the other and electrocuted the loser. Who was the victor?</span></div></div>",

If Rinusha had a face, he would be smiling because the spell was complete. Instead of a middle-aged woman, Marge was now an eight-year old. Luckily for her, she still had her magic powers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe green chain that took away Marge's age began to curl itself into a energy sphere. The sphere had a glass surface with green energy running around inside. The glass surface had a inscription with said \"Marge Simpson\". She didn't need to ask what it was for it was obvious that the sphere contained her age energy. Before she could do anything, Rinusha spoke, \"Have a nice second childhood.\" And with that, he threw a magical smoke ball at the ground and he was nowhere to be seen by the time the smoke cleared. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarge thought about her new situation.

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"left\">Marge realised that she was facing another sorceress although she didn't seem familiar so she asked the mysterious being to identify themselves. \"Excuse me. But who or what are you to be walking around in the woods here at night?\" Marge asked the obviously female silhouette that was leaning on a tree a few meters in front of them. There was a chuckle and then she got a response of a sort. \"Well I could ask you the very same question. I'm Kyleen, a sorceress by trade, don't bother straining your memory, I'm sure I haven't made your blue haired acquaintance. I'd have remembered something like that.\" Marge was taken aback for a moment then the figure stepped closer towards herself and Homer. Marge could see an exotic looking woman with tanned skin, dark hair wearing what could only be described as a set of robes and wearing on her right hands middle finger what Marge supposed was probably a magic TF ring. Certainly she was feeling a magical signature from it and not just from the person who was wearing it, although Marge was certain that she wasn't bluffing either. This person *was* a sorceress of some kind.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarge decided speak, perhaps she could talk some sense into this woman but then it was just as likely that they would end up fighting a magic dual if she was determined to seek out the rings for herself. \"Well I'm Marge Simpson, a concerned local..\" Marge hesitated and Kyleen interrupted. \"Witch. Sorceress. Wise woman. Gypsy. Whatever name you care to use. Yes Marge I know you\u2019re a magic user. Your not the only one who can sense the presence of magical beings and items you know. So what is it you wish of me? Or perhaps I should ask what are you intentions towards the artefacts that are present in and around your town?\" Marge replied somewhat gravely. \"I intend to take possession of them in order to keep them out of the hands of the wicked, criminal or otherwise irresponsible individuals who would abuse them.\" Kyleen pauses as if considering this for a moment. \"So you don't seek them for powers sake but to stop them being used to harm other people. Very noble. If you believe in that sort of thing.\" she muses. Marge meanwhile speaks again. \"Well perhaps we could work together to find the rings and put an end to this dangerous situation. After all neither of us would benefit from these artefacts falling into the hands of crooks or delinquents.\" Marge proposed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyleen looks at Marge and Homer for a moment. \"Well it would be safer to have someone to watch my back and you make a persuasive if rather straight laced argument. As you probably guessed I already found one of the transformation rings\" She holds up the ring on her right hand middle finger. \"But the question is should I join you? Well normally I work alone but it might be nice to work with another witch and her..partner for a change.\" she says and steps back away from Homer and Marge slightly. \"Well you'd better make your mind up because I intend to secure those rings either with your help or without it. Oh and yes Homer and I are married.\" Marge stated somewhat bluntly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nKyleen thinks about co-operating with the Simpson's and then decides...</div></span></div></div>",

I mean it sounded too cool to be true. Bart had learned from experience that such things tended to be hoaxes or peoples delusions.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Still. What if it was true. A plane exploded. Right here. But the part about magic artefacts must be bull surely. Bart didn't think much more about it until he overheard Homer talking to his mom about it then Bart got an idea. If this really was true and if Mr Burns did really have one of these things then maybe just maybe...</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Well Bart reasoned he was a fairly accomplished thief and occasional vandal. Not that his exploits where anything to brag about in prison but still. Maybe he could find the rings first. It had to be worth a try surely. He'd need help though. His mom and his square of a sister would probably want to destroy the rings or use them for the good of mankind or some other bullcrap. Bart of course had other ideas. Mainly around personal gain and power. Perhaps even revenge on his teachers who'd made him stand there and write lines on the blackboard in detention.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Bart snapped back to reality. Right help..help..maybe Jessica? She was bad to the bone, worse than him in many ways and he knew he couldn't trust her. But he all so knew she would work with him to get the rings because she probably wanted them too. Bart then supposed he could double cross her or maybe something else. He'd cross that bridge when he got to it.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Bart slipped out of the Simpson's house and expertly made his way to the Lovejoy's house without being seen. However he didn't get all the way there as he saw Jessica walking along the pavement towards Evergreen Terrace. Without thinking Bart jumped out from his hiding place and said hello startling Jessica who he noticed was wearing a very cute expensive looking dress that he'd never seen her wear before.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">\"Bart?! Ah! I was looking for you. We need to talk. I need your help with something.\" Jessica said smiling at Bart and batting her eyelashes at him which caused Bart to raise an eyebrow.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Bart sighed. \"Ah Jessica, I have only one thing to say to you.\" Bart said.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">\"Um..and that would be?\" Jessica asked.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">\"Knock it off. I already know about the rings and I guess you probably have one of them there.\" Bart said taking Jessica's hand and pointing to a strange looking ring on her right middle finger.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Jessica smiled and shifted her feet. \"Well actually Bart your right, I swiped it right from under old man Burns nose while he was having his longevity treatment. Now I need someone to help me find the rest of them so I can finally get the power, wealth, respect..\"</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Bart frowned. \"Yes Jesse, we all know about your sense of entitlement and how your bad to the bone but really what dose that ring do?\" He asked.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Jessica laughed. \"Well I'll give you three guesses Bart.\" She said and pointed at him.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Bart then looked down at himself and realised he was wearing an exact copy of his sister Lisa's sunday best outfit including the pink shoes, dress and hat. Jessica was laughing so hard she nearly fell over. Bart blushed bright red and pouted crossing his arms.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">\"Turn me back Jessica. Now!\" He said feeling ridiculous wearing such a girly outfit.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Jessica stopped laughing and Bart's cloths reverted to his normal red t-shirt and blue shorts outfit with no hat. Bart glared at Jessica. \"What? I just wanted you to get in touch with your feminine side Bart!\" She said sticking her tongue out at him.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">\"Ha ha. Let's go. It's gonna be a long night co's we'll have to search on foot. Heh how are we gonna find the rings anyway?\" Bart said slightly worried.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Jessica smiled at Bart. \"Well Bart let's say there are some things about me you don't know. Although you where right about what you said earlier.\" She said as they both set off to look for the rings.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">The pair decided to search first in a particular part of Springfield which was...</div></span></div></div>",

After some short distance Bartina began to ask Jessica if she could change her back to being a boy or at least reverse the clothing TF that Jessica did to her. After a while Jessica began to get annoyed at Bartina's nagging and turned around to face her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBartina flinched thinking Jessica was about to yell at her or grab her then her angry face changed and she looked conflicted. Jessica wasn't sure if she wanted to turn Bart back or if she should just make him stay as a girly girl. On the one hand this was pretty funny and she didn't really care about Bart that much. Their partnership was more an alliance of convenience than anything. But then again he (she) wasn't much use to Jessica if she was a little sissy girl that would probably cry or run away if something bad happened. Jessica knew if she got in trouble normal Bart was more likely to help her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile as Jessica pondered this thought Bartina was getting impatient and putting her hands on her hips she said. \"Jessica. Turn me back into a boy. This isn't right. It's a mistake. I'm supposed to be a guy.\" Jessica had to do something and in the end she decided too...</div></span></div></div>",

Jessica meanwhile finishes searching the other side of the roof takes a quick look off of it to see if anyone has spotted them and then goes back over to Bart. \"Well Bart did you find anything?\" She asks.

If these came from a plane way up there I knew there was a chance they could end up on a roof somewhere.\" Jessica looks around behind her again before speaking. \"Well we'd better get moving anyway. Heh I wonder what that ring does. I mean which type of TF it causes.\" she says which gives Bart an idea. \"Well why don't we find out Jessica. I guess I should get to transform you some time after all the times you've changed me.\" Jessica looked nervous for a second then conceded. \"Yeah well I guess just as long as you turn me back again Bart. Like how I changed you back into a boy.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't worry I will.\" Says Bart as he grasps the ring and concentrates on TFing Jessica.

More specifically she was gaining weight. Her body swelled, widened and generally bloated in all directions. Soon she was the fattest kid in Springfield even more so than the chocolate loving German exchange student Utter. Fortunately because she was wearing an outfit she created with the ring of clothing TF which she still possessed her cloths grew with her so she didn't stretch or rip them. It was a small mercy though as far as Jessica was concerned. As suddenly as it had started her transformation ended though leaving a huge Jessica blushing widely as Bart stared at her shocked at what this ring had done to his partner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man. This thing better have a reverse setting.\" Bart commented. Jessica sighed. \"Well we know what it does now. It's the ring of weight gain. You might as well turn me back so we can go look for the other rings.\" She said and waddled towards Bart who was slightly amused by the entire turn of events. \"What's stopping you?\" Bart asked. Jessica glared at him and replied. \"Bart. There's no way I'm waddling around Springfield like this so make with the reverse on the TF ring.\" Bart looked at the ring then back at Jessica. \"Well ok then. I guess you'd just get tired quicker or fall through a roof or something anyway.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart concentrates on the ring and it glows again and soon enough Jessica is back to her normal weight and appearance. \"Wow.

He outfit didn't really change but her body instead of being normal flesh and blood became several sticks, a pumpkin for a head and lots of straw to add volume. At first Jessica was puzzled by what had happened, she hadn't changed size and she was still able to see, hear and feel but she couldn't move or speak for some reason. But one thing was for certain by the reaction on Bart's face she had definitely transformed and probably quite a lot too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart for his part looked at the ring then at Jessica and said a rather flustered \"aye carumba\" before walking up to Jessica and then around her looking at her. \"Well I guess if she was a scarecrow this is what she'd be like. So I suppose that this ring must be the..huh.\" Bart said to himself while figuring out that the ring is the ring of inanimate transformation.

Go do your business and then help search the school.\" Jessica ordered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay.\" Bartina said, not wanting to get changed again by her other rings. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter that, Bartina desperately hobbled into the girl's bathroom and into the nearest vacant stall. She quickly pulled down her new panties, which she discovered was a pink Hello Kitty brand, much to her chagrin. After that, she sat on the toilet and began to heavily release her rock-hard bladder into the toilet. As she continued to pee...</span></div></div>",

She placed her hands on her sides as her entire body bloated especially her rear which got more than it's fair share of the new weight. She did manage to hold onto the TG ring and clothing TF ring until the transformation completed but much to Bart's amusement she then immediately fell onto her much bigger butt and dropped them. As Jessica struggled to her feet she managed to get back the TG ring but not the clothing TF ring. Bart grabbed it and turned her clothes into a normal dress almost identical to her sister Lisa's, her shoes turned into flat shoes as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"See what happens when you try to use two rings at once Jessica? I think I'll just hang on to thing one for safe keeping now.\" Bart stated as Jessica stood there looking unhappy with her new weight. \"Well we better find the weight ring so we can reverse this. I don't want to be stuck like this for any longer than necessary.\" Jessica said. \"Hey, I just thought of something.\" Bart blurted. \"What?\" Asked Jessica. \"Well since I'm a girl now I should have powers, after all I'm from a family of witches.\" Bart asserted. \"Really Bart? Are you sure it works like that when you become a girl through magic?\" Jessica questioned. \"No but there's one way to find out.\" Bart replied then tried to use his magic powers, he concentrated then managed to launch a fireball into the air which exploded above their heads in the darkness. \"Wow I really did get magic powers. This is so cool.\" Bart enthused. \"Oh great, you get magic powers and I just get to be fat. Well isn't that just swell?\" Jessica said annoyed. Bart turned to Jessica. \"Well maybe I could use my powers to make you thin again, that is if I wanted too.\" she suggested. \"I don't know Bart, are you sure you know what you're doing?\" Jessica asked. \"No but do you wanna be a fatty forever?\" Bart replied. \"I don't know, what if it goes wrong?\" Jessica said. \"Well you'd better make your mind up Jessica, we can't stay here much longer since I just put up a signal flair for anyone to see.\" Bart said urgently. \"What the hell, give it a try.\" Jessica answered. Bart concentrated as hard as he could and he did manage to take some of the weight off Jessica. When Bart had finished she was still fat but not obese, Bart was tired from the effort of all that magic it took to undo some of the magic weight gain. \"Well that's better, I guess. Bart? Are you ok?\" Jessica asked. \"Never better, I think we should get out of here though.\" Bart suggested. \"Agreed.\" Jessica replied and they started to go.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid they get clean away or did they run into someone in the woods?</span></div></div>",

You almost look like a different person, except for that outfit.\" Bart flicked his hair back and responded. \"So what's your point anyway?\" Jessica grinned as she spoke and held up the ring of clothing TF. \"Well if your cloths and hair where totally different then no one would be in a danger of recognising you. It's just that if someone did we could both get in to trouble. We don't actually have any magic rings except this one and I don't think this will help much in escaping from trouble so it would be safer if I changed your outfit.\" Bart smiled cynically and said. \"Ok fine change my cloths into something really pink and girlie.

It's just safer this way ok.\" as she winks at Bart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica concentrates on the clothing TF ring and Bart's outfit begins to change. The shorts and T-shirt merge to form a pink dress similar to the one his sister Lisa wears to church and special occasions. In addition Bart suddenly finds he has a charm bracelet, a necklace like his mom's and a ribbon that ties his long hair back into a ponytail. Of course her boy pants turn into girls panties as well but you can't see them as her skirt covers them up. Finally Bart's shoes become little black girls shoes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart examines herself and frowns. \"Oh Jessica. You could have at least got the shoes to co ordinate with the dress.\" Jessica laughs then responds. \"Don't worry about that Bart. No one is going to be looking at your feet. Not now your such a pretty pretty girl.\" she teases. Bart just shrugs and says. \"So where are we going anyway?\" Jessica puts the ring away and says. \"We're going to the Kwik-E-Mart.

Bart looks awkward and hesitates. Jessica takes his hand and says. \"Bart no one is going to notice. If anyone asks just say your Barbara a friend of mine from boarding school. Strangers will believe that. Unless they no different I suppose. But it should be enough to fool this lot. If they even ask.\" Bart just says. \"Yeah I guess.\" and enters the shop by Jessica's side. There are a handful of people in, it's not busy really. Apu notices them but says nothing as he is serving another customer. Bart and Jessica look at the candy and snacks available, buy a few sweets and a couple of squishies then leave. No one suspects \"Barbara\" is really a TGed Bart Simpson. As they exit the shop holding their drinks Jessica says. \"See? I told you no one would notice.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart and Jessica hang around outside drinking their squishie drinks until something happens which is.</div></span></div></div>",

I guess he's a little shocked at what's happened here. Come to think of it what has happened here?\" Marge asked. Jessica decided to lie to Marge and not mention the AR ring as she figured that Marge and Homer where probably looking for it too and if not they would probably want it anyway if they knew what it could do. \"Well..we where walking through the woods and suddenly this dark figure appeared and used his magic to make Bart a baby!\" she lied. Straight away Marge thought it might be Rinusha or one of his kind as the description matched him. She thought it was odd he didn't transform Jessica as well though. \"Oh dear. My special little guy. I always worried something like that would happen. Jessica give Bart to me I can fix this.\" Marge ordered. \"Yes Mrs Simpson.\" Jessica complied but made sure to remove the AR ring and hide it in her pocket before she handed Bart over. Bart looked at Marge who was now holding him. \"So you can fix this huh mom? How are you going to do that?\" He asked. Marge responded. \"Oh you'll find out soon enough little Barty.\" she smiled and said. \"You know part of me wants to leave you a baby but I guess this is something which should really be reversed. Jessica, Homer stay here. I'll be back in a minute.\" Marge says then walks off into the woods with Bart. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nA few minutes later she returns with Bart who is now walking by himself and is ten years old again. Marge smiles at Bart and he hugs her saying. \"Thanks mom. I thought for a second there I was gonna end up being the baby of the family.\" Marge smiles and says. \"Well you nearly where. But seriously Bart it's not safe out here you and Jessica should head home right now. Your father and I have some..buisness to take care of so we'll be out late tonight.\" Bart realised that his mom and dad where looking for the rings too and responded only. \"Uh huh.\" Marge turns to Homer. \"Come on Homer lets search this area. Maybe we can find out who turned Bart into a baby.\" Homer shrugs. \"Sounds like a plan. See ya later boy.\" He says as Marge and Homer head off to search the woods.

As the pair walked through the streets they skilfully blended in with the crowd something they had both learned to do in order to avoid teachers/policemen and other authority figures. Bart was especially good at this from all the times he'd played truant from school and even that one time when Skinner chased him halfway across Springfield and he only escaped by diving into Freddy Quimby's open top car. Jessica marvelled at how Bart moved among the throng without drawing attention to himself or her. Her only concern was that they'd meet someone who knew Bart well and they'd spot his change in appearance, then again that wasn't that likely.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart and Jessica eventually got to Main Street and began quietly looking for any sign of the rings. No one payed them much attention they where far to busy trying to get somewhere or worrying about they own problems. They looked all around in bins, gutters, behind dumpsters in alleys. However they had no luck for quite a while and Bart was getting restless. \"Aww man. At this rate we'll never find it.\" He said. Jessica replied. \"Bart, no one said this was going to be easy but there's a good chance we can get to this first. After all other people are probably using their cars to look elsewhere.\" She reasoned and the pair continued looking for the transformation ring that was lying around somewhere around the shops and pavements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually...</div></span></div></div>",

Bart ignored it because everything looks the same. There was the trees, twigs, leaves, bushes and branched-obscured night skies. Just then, he saw something he didn't see before. To his left was a giant tree that had showed lively leaves of many different colors and had a knothole nearby the base.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWondering if it would help him figure out what happened with the ring incident, he headed towards it.

Plus, his hand looked smaller and more delicate than usual. He flinched and turned his head down when he found something else that doesn't fit. He was wearing a dress, which would explain the windy feeling on his legs. Just then, the wind zoomed at him from behind and pushed his hair forwards. He picked it up and found it wasn't blonde and spikey, but rather long, black and silky.

She layed him down on the mat. Lisa grabbed talcum powder and one of Maggie's diapers. After diapering him she said \"There we go, all set. I'm Lisa and this is Maggie's room. It will be your room while Mom and Dad are gone with Maggie. Can you talk at all?\" Bart responded by saying \"I'm ........ er.... Bongo!\".\"You're so cute, but that orange shirt is bad. You can just wear a diaper\" Lisa said to Bart when she pulled it off. She carried him downstairs and gave him some of Maggie's food. Bart was then given a bottle of milk which he gulped down at the speed of light, feeling the need to go to the bathroom moments later \"Can I go to the bathroom?\" Lisa responded\"When you get older\" Bart responded \"But you don't understand I-!\" Bart stopped when he felt the warmth trickle down. It would be difficult to get his message across \"See!

Bart's former partner turned rival soon realised this and she managed to control her laughter long enough to advance on Bart who shuddered as he looked up at the now intimidating form of Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart was about to say something when Jessica picked him up and then smiled as she took the ring of age regression and the ring of clothing transformation away from him. She then put him down and spoke to him. \"Well Bart.\" said Jessica. \"It looks like I'll be setting things right then. The way they *should* be.\" Then Jessica reversed the shrinking on Bart who returned to his normal size. Then she made herself ten again with her normal pink outfit using the other two rings before regressing Bart to a five year old and changing his cloths to an adorable looking overalls outfit with a smiley face on the front. Bart was furious and it showed. Jessica just stood there and mocked him. \"Well Bart I guess your new..status suits your level of maturity better. I'm going to give you a choice. Either you come with me and help me get the rest of the TF rings and I might make you older again. Or if you prefer you can go join the kindergarten class and be *little* brother to your sister Lisa.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart was torn.

At least he was going to help her for the moment, but if the opportunity presented itself to get his own back on her well..who knows what he might do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart's thoughts where interrupted by Jessica. \"Well? Are you gonna help me or are you gonna run off home like a mommy\u2019s boy?\" she said. \"Yeah I'll help you, just make me ten again.\" Bart replied. Jessica looked at Bart for a while then said. \"Hmm..okay.\" She took out the ring of age regression and concentrated on reversing the transformation, the ring glowed as the magic surrounded Bart and made him ten again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah! That's better! El Barto is back!\" Bart said. Jessica just said \"Yeah yeah, enough of that Bart. We've got more rings to find.\" then she got right in Bart's face and said \"Oh and don't you ever betray me like you did when you left me a five year old and took the age regression ring or I'll turn you into a baby so fast your head will spin.\" Bart gulped and nodded but secretly he was starting to get sick of Jessica.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the pair of them ditch school and head off to look for more TF rings but where in Springfield do they look?</div></span></div></div>",

Get bent!\" then still surprised at how much more high pitched and childish his voice sounded he ran away leaving Jessica chuckling to herself about making one of the badest kids in school a cute little five year old wearing some kiddie overalls.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Bart was rushing off the school grounds. He couldn't just walk out the front gate as it was watched but he knew how to get out in one of the gaps in the hedge surrounding the perimeter of the school playing field. Soon Bart was on his way home, he didn't know where else to go, after all if he wandered around for too long in Springfield then the police would probably pick him up as a lost child. Fortunately for Bart he managed to make it back to Evergreen Terrace before anything else happened. Bart thought: I'll go in tell mom what happened then she'll force Jessica to give me the rings back. Yes Bart was going to tell his mommy. However there was one little problem with this as Bart soon discovered when he knocked on the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Marge opened the door Bart suddenly remember his row with her earlier that day and how he'd used the ring to make her five years old again. Marge looked at Bart and smiled. \"Well well well. Looks like somebody\u2019s had a taste of their own medicine.\" Marge said smugly as Bart glared at her and pushed past her into the house. Marge closed the door with a little difficulty as she was now just a small girl. Meanwhile Bart was sulking on the couch. \"It's not fair.\" He said. \"Jessica betrayed me. Well kinda. The point is I was gonna use those rings to make things better.\" Bart continued. Marge looked sceptical and crossed her arms over her small body. \"Yeah. Better for you mister. It serves you right messing with such things. Magic artefacts I mean. Didn't you think that eventually something like this would happen? That you'd get outsmarted or ambushed?\" She asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart jumps down from the couch and glares at his \"mom\". \"Heh! What would you know anyway? Your just a five year old like me now. I mean if your so smart why did you let me turn you into a five year old?\" Marge walks right up to Bart and looks him in the eyes. \"Well for one you caught me by surprise. I didn't realise you had one of those magic rings and I certainly didn't know which one you had. Believe me Bart if I had known it would have been very different for you see Lisa and I are witches.\" Marge stated to Bart who looked stunned for a moment then shouted \"Woohoo!\" Marge looked at Bart uncertainly. \"So I suppose you think even after you turned me into a five year old girl I'm just going to go help you get the rings back. As for Lisa. She isn't even here she's still in school.\" she said. \"Well I guess. But we can just wait for her to come back then go after Jessica together. With your magic and my cunning plans we can't fail.\" Bart replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarge just rolled her eyes. \"Bart. It was one of those \"cunning plans\" that got us into this mess in the first place. In fact now that I think about it maybe Lisa is in danger. Is Jessica at Springfield elementary with that age regression ring you had?\" Marge asks. \"Well uh yeah but..\" Marge frowned. \"But what?\" She asks. \"Well Jessica has a couple of other rings too. The shrinking ring and clothing TF Ring.\" Marge reaches immediately. \"Oh my! We've got to go warn Lisa and get her out of there before it's too late!\" She says. \"But mom. You're only five years old. I'm only five. If we go there now the teachers will see us and stick us in a class..or even worse detention.\" Marge nodded sadly realising that she could really just go and grab Lisa. They would have to wait.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the meantime did Jessica TF Lisa or did Lisa come home without a run in with Jessica?</div></span></div></div>",

Although she was a witch Lisa was far to scared and shocked to think about doing anything clever like using her magic to help her escape or reverse her shrinking.

I guess I probably would have run into your meddling self sooner or later but now I won't have to worry about you stopping me collecting all the rings.\" As soon as Jessica mentioned that Lisa reacted. \"So *that's* what your up to! I knew you'd never go to this much trouble just to get back at myself or Bart.\" Jessica smiled again smirking slightly. \"Well maybe not Lisa but then I never liked you much anyway and now I guess I can do whatever I want with you.\" Lisa gulped at the thought of what Jessica would do to her and then began speaking once more. \"Jessica. Listen I know you think you can just collect all the rings and gain ultimate power but you don't know the half of it! The rings are cursed! They've betrayed people before and will again. They have a will of their own..an evil will. You have to unshrink me and get rid of those things!\" Lisa pleaded with Jessica who laughed and replied \"Do you really think I'm going to give up this power now? You're just trying to scare me so you can have the rings for yourself. I know what you\u2019re trying to do Lisa and it won't work.\" Lisa groaned and muttered something to herself about already being a witch.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJessica then began to tease Lisa by poking her and tickling her and there was nothing Lisa could do about it because she couldn't concentrate enough to use her witch powers.

Soon little Jessica was going backwards through the months until she was just a new-born baby wriggling around in her clothes that no longer fit.

It seemed her instincts and indeed her magic was right. Something was going on. Could it really be true? Where the tales going around Springfield actually real? It didn't seem likely she thought as she descended the stairs of the Simpson's house. Then again she knew something was up and she shuddered at the idea that Mr Burns might get his hands on all of the magic artefacts and then abuse their power. Lisa hadn't forgotten the last time she'd tried to help him after he ended up bankrupt and the power plant was sold to Germans. The thing about Mr Burns was that he was selfish and evil and when he tried to be good he was even *more* evil.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Something needed doing and Lisa didn't much like the idea of what might happen if her dad or her annoying brother got their hands on the rings either. Lisa was a witch so she knew that the hardest thing about having great power is not to use it. Any mortal just acquiring such items of power was she reasoned bound to lead to suffering and harm for all except maybe the person with the power. Even that couldn't be ruled out really. But what if she got hold of one or more of the rings? Could she trust even herself? Well she reasoned the odds where better than just letter Bart or Mr Burns or dad get them. It was<br>\r\ntime for action.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Lisa put on her coat and headed outside where she locked the door using her powers. Simple spells to lock/unlock doors where after all merely cantrips to someone as skilled in magic as her. Besides the lock was hardly a complex one it was just an average civilian front door. Lisa then turned invisible and headed towards where she knew Milhouse lived. After a short walk Lisa arrived at Milhouse's house and hoping he wasn't with his dad she let herself in and snuck into Milhouse's room.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Milhouse for his part was sitting on his bed reading a comic book and chuckling to himself occasionally. There was a can of soda on his bedside table. Obviously he wasn't busy. Lisa suddenly appeared in front of Milhouse or at least it looked like she did in fact she had entered the room while invisible and then allowed herself to be seen because she wanted to be.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Milhouse lowered the comic and stared for a moment. \"Lisa? What are you doing here?\" He said not a bit phased at her sudden appearance in front of him.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Lisa suddenly looked worried. \"Milhouse? Didn't you wonder how I just appeared like that?\" Lisa asked.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Milhouse smiled. \"Well I am friends with your brother and you know what they say bro's before hoe's.\" He replied.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Lisa looked irritated screwing up her face somewhat. \"Damn Bart, I mean I know it's impossible to keep such a secret within a family but you aren't family Milhouse. I can't believe he told you.\" Lisa said looking rather irate.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Milhouse shrugged. \"Well it's ok. I didn't tell anyone or mention it and I won't. I don't want anything to happen to you or your mom. Anyway what did you come all this way for? Did Bart tell you he told me you where a witch?\" Milhouse enquired.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Lisa sighed. \"No Milhouse. That's not why I'm here. I need some help for a..task I need to undertake. I guess I'd better explain what happened.\" Lisa said then told Milhouse all about the exploding plane and the magic rings and how Mr Burns and Bart, Homer and probably half of Springfield is out to get them. She all so told him what could happen if any one person gets them all.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Milhouse sat quietly before looking up at Lisa who was standing on the bed having been explaining what was going on. \"Well.\" he said. \"We'd better get started I suppose. This is too weird.\" The pair sneak out with Lisa using her powers to make sure no one see either or them then they head out into Springfield to find the magic artefacts.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">As the invisible pair stop to catch their breath on a street corner Milhouse asks where they should start searching.</div><br>\r\n\u00a0<br>\r\n<div align=\"left\">Lisa thinks for a moment then says..how about...</div></span></div></div>",

Guess what? Great news! This is the age progression ring and that means I can make myself eight again!\" Lisa said enthusiastically then placed the magic ring on her finger and began to concentrate very hard. Soon the ring started to glow and then some magic surrounded Lisa who began to get older. First Lisa became a toddler with her diaper turning into some bright pink overalls but that only lasted for a few years as she got older and now her overalls where replaced by her trademark red dress which grew with her as she became six then seven then finally eight again. Now the ring stops glowing and Lisa took it off her finger and climbed down from the crate, which she had been sitting on because Milhouse placed her there. She smoothed out her dress then smiled at Milhouse before saying \"Well. What are you waiting for? Lets go find some more rings and defeat Rinusha.\" Milhouse nodded and said. \"I guess your eager to get your powers back huh?\" Lisa then looked annoyed and said. \"Yeah, that and I want to stop that robed freak before he turns anyone else into a baby or worse..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both head off to look for more rings and maybe even a run in with Rinusha who knows?

Her clothes stretched out with her as she became first inflated then spherically inflated in a matter of seconds. Milhouse cowered against a wall as Rinusha just grinned maliciously at Lisa as she started to float and her limbs began sticking out to her sides as they became inflated. \"Mmmmmphh!\" Lisa tried to say something but by now her limbs where being absorbed into her body along with her head, she fell silent as she inflated and transformed further now looking like a rubber ball of herself but floating helplessly in mid air. She did the only thing she still could and wiggled her feet and hands as her head sunk completely into her body except for her spiky hair which arrayed itself along the top of her spherical form. This did Lisa no good however as her transformation completed her body became squeaky and rubbery with a string tied to the bottom like a party balloon. Lisa blinked then floated helplessly in mid air like the powerless balloon she had become. Rinisha approached her and sneered. \"Ha! This is the best you could do? You couldn't even defend yourself from me much less stop me from collecting the rings. Oh well I guess I'll hand you to your boyfriend here and be on my way then.\" said the masked overlord before taking Lisa's string and handing it to Milhouse then walking away chuckling to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMilhouse could only stand there trying to make sure he didn't let go of the string and pondering what to do next.

Needless to say a riot soon began and Bob and his brother used the ensuing chaos to escape. Bob then linked up with some criminal contacts he'd learned about while in prison, committed a few crimes to raise some cash along with his brother then they bought the weapon that would enable then next part of their machiavellian plan. They bought a shoulder held surface to air missile launcher. Now one might wonder exactly why to common criminals would need or want such a think. Cecil certainly did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look Bob I *still* don't understand why of all things you spent most of our money on that stinger missile system we've got in the back of the truck. I mean I suppose you could wait until the Simpson's next to on vacation then blow up their plane but really? Why bother? We could kill that meddling Bart and his sister a hundred times before that!\" Cecil ranted to Bob who was driving their second hand pick up along the road through Springfield forest towards Mt Springfield.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe arch villain gave his brother a derisory look then began to explain his wicked plan. \"Look Cecil, we COULD do that yes. We COULD just head straight for the Simpson's and probably get shot/arrested/beaten by the dozens of cops who'll be waiting for us because that's exactly what they expect me..expect us to do but I've got a better plan. I saw some odd paperwork while we where escaping Springfield prison. Surfice to say I want to get my hands on something on a plane and I don't believe such a thing could be accomplished at the airport. To heavily guarded now. Thank you very much Mr Osama Bin Laden! Anyway where was I. Oh yes, the plane. I believe it may contain the ring of wishes or possibly the component rings. Either way if we get one or several or maybe all of them then the Simpson's are doomed and my..our revenge will come to pass. That's just for starters as well.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCecil sat bolt upright in his seat, then regained his composure. \"So that's what you've been doing isn't it Bob. All this time, all those crimes and trades it was all working towards getting us a shot at a plane. Uh. You do realise if you miss I'm going to FEED YOU that stinger missile system.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob laughs maniacally. \"Oh I won't miss brother, think about it. The plane will be slowing down, turning ready to land. We'll be right where we need to be to take them down before they have time to react. They won't know what hit them.\" Cecil nods and Bob carries on driving until the pair arrive at the base of Mt Springfield. Once there they park the truck remove the weapons/supplies which are in backpacks and a case then begin climbing the mountain path to get into position for firing the missile.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome hours later halfway up Mt Springfield...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob and Cecil are looking frantically at their watches and scanning the skyline for signs of an approaching aircraft. \"Bob! There! That's a cargo plane!

Are you sure you shot the right plane down?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Of course I'm sure!\" says Bob infuriated, \"The paperwork said today at 3 PM, and guess what, I fired the missile at precisely 3 PM. There must be at least some rings around here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Bob sees a sword embedded in a large stone. The hilt of the sword has a colorful circular pattern on it with blues and greens. Bob examines the hilt for a while and decides to try to remove the rings from the hilt. However, his intentions are not instantly seen by Cecil.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell are you trying to do King Arthur? We not looking for Excalibur, we looking for the rings!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ho ho!\" says Bob struggling with the hilt, \"This sword's hilt has two of the rings I need!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rings abruptly fly off the hilt and flew through the air, and Bob and Cecil raise their hands to catch the rings. The blue ring slides into Bob's finger while the green ring falls in Cecil's finger. Bob and Cecil wait to feel the power of the rings. And then they wait some more hoping their struggle was not in vain. Finally Cecil says \"You know I'm gonna call you a complete dumba--\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly Cecil become overcome with power as his ring gives him the power to...</span></div></div>",

You ain't been in all night, Homer's gone god only knows where and I've had about as much as I can take of Barney, Sam and Moe for one night.\" Carl says to Lenny who still looking worried/excited at the same time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLenny composes himself then begins to speak. \"Well Carl this is pretty whacky stuff but you gotta listen because this could be big I mean really big bigger than hot pants, the eight track and betamax!\" Carl responds by folding his arms. \"I knew it there is something going on. How come you never mentioned anything about this at work?\" Lenny looks unsure then replies. \"I didn't know about it then, I only discovered what happened since I got home and checked my equipment.\" Carl rolls his eyes. \"Oh here we go, you got yourself a police scanner and all of a sudden you think your James Bond. You do realise that whatever it is the cops probably have it under control by now? Right?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLenny still carries on talking excitedly. \"No Carl, seriously. This is bigger than anything the police can just handle. Ok explanation time. Basically a cargo aircraft with some very rare valuable artefacts exploded directly over Springfield. But get this these artefacts, rings I think they are. They're supposed to be magical! They can transform people and if you get all of them they can grant wishes!\" says Lenny looking at a decidedly sceptical Carl for validation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCarl shakes his head. \"Look Lenny, I don't go in for non of this hockus pokus junk but those artefacts could be valuable. We ought to try and find some of them, best case scenario we sell em back to their owners worst case we stick em on e-bay. Either way we'll be in the money.\" he states looking at a disappointed Lenny.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well whatever Carl, but I'm telling you there's something strange about these rings. They aren't just any old random treasure. Anyway either way we could get rich off this so what do you say?\" Lenny asks.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah sure lets go find em, why not otherwise we'll just waste another night getting drunk and pulling Barney out of the toilet.

Lenny begins to talk as he takes out a set of keys. \"See Burns forgot to ask Homer for his key back because he's always forgetting about him so I asked him if I could have it and he said yes.\" Lenny says as he takes a key and opens one of the smaller doors leading into the casino. The pair walk inside. It's dark as the power has been cut and as they move into what was the kitchen most of the fittings are no longer there having been removed ready for the building to be demolished. \"Man this is creepy.\" says Carl and Lenny replies. \"Yeah it really changes the acoustics of a place when you take all the stuff out doesn't it? Makes it seem like a haunted house.\" They head through a double door which leads them into what was one of the main gaming rooms where the slot machines, card tables and roulette used to be. Now it's just a dark empty space with the odd crate, pile of rubbish and the odd rat sniffing around.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ok lets split up now. I'll take this floor you go check the next one.\" Lenny says. \"Sounds like a plan.\" Carl replies and they both switch on their metal detectors and begin sweeping through the abandoned building. They find nothing on the first two floors so they decide to go check the other two upper floors. Lenny is on the second floor up and Carl is on the third and top floor.

Marge put the book down in shock and began to look at herself just as she felt bloated and began to expand outwards as if she was rapidly gaining weight. At first she just sat there getting bigger but soon she got to her feet and found she was indeed heavier. Marge put her hands to her middle and found that as her belly expanded under her hands it didn't feel like just normal fat because it was too firm. Marge thought this must be some sort of allergic reaction so she walked towards the bathroom, soon her walk became a waddle as she grew bigger, wider and rounder the rest of her body ballooning along with her belly now sticking out several feet in front of her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBy the time Marge got to the medicine cabinet in the bathroom she was beginning to realise that this was something unusual and not just an allergic reaction. She had swollen to over 300lb and even more strangely her cloths had grown with her, her dress, necklace, shoes etc all seemed to fit her perfectly although Marge knew looking down at herself they should have burst off her a long time ago. Marge looked down at her tubby body and grunted as she watched herself gain at least another hundred pounds putting her at about 450lb! She was HUGE! An enormous housewife wearing a massive green dress, her necklace and her shoes had turned into very large plastic sandals. Still Marge realised that her gain had stopped at least for the time being and this gave her time to examine herself properly in the bathroom mirror. She simply confirmed what she already felt about her body that she was huge, fat and fully clothed still even though she didn't know why any of this happened. It was weird, looking at herself. It felt wrong, Marge knew she was a thin woman, an attractive woman not what she was looking at which was an enormously huge FAT WOMAN! At least Marge assumed it was fat, it certainly didn't jiggle or bounce like fat should. Damn it how did she get so big?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis thought aside Marge's mind was racing. What happened to me? Why did my cloths grow too? What will Homer think of this? Can I get back to normal?

This would have been good news for her mobility was it not for the fact that she began to feel puffier as well. It was getting harder and harder to walk and move her hands. As Marge got lighter and lighter she began to realise why. She was inflating, she was blowing up, becoming nothing more than a big round balloon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarge's body inflated and began to swell as it floated up from the bedroom floor only inches at first but soon ascending several feet into the air. Marge's feet and hands flapped uselessly as she floated completely helpless and still expanding. Bigger, wider, rounder she gets and at the same time her arms and legs are absorbed into her body as it begins to take on a spherical shape. Marge wondered how her cloths where still coping with all this expansion and for that matter how much bigger she would get and what else was in store for her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe had time to wonder as she floated around the large master bedroom now reduced to a simple balloon with her head, hands, feet and sandals still poking out. In fact just when Marge thought it couldn't get any worse it did: Her face puffed up her cheeks swelling, her lips bloating and her hair began to turn strangely shiny and proceeded to inflate as well then her hands and feet inflated including her sandals. Marge then floated towards the middle of the room and inflated until she had tripled in size and was nothing but a huge balloon with puffy over inflated hands, feet and a head. She now more or less filled the room and anyone coming into the room would bump into her balloon body almost straight away. As her inflation stopped Marge began to feel dazed and dizzy and her thoughts slipped away as all she could think about was inflating, expanding and becoming a bigger balloon!

She was standing in the middle of the room \"back to normal\" that is not inflated and certainly not dead.

She all so noticed her shoes where back to the red heeled shoes she wore not the sandals they had become when she was expanding earlier.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarge was puzzled. What was going on? Was she insane? Did what she remembered just happen? Was she hysterical? Hallucinating? Dreaming even perhaps? She decided that whatever was going on she needed to find the rest of her family. After all maybe they could help her deal with this whatever it was. Then again Marge was curious as to what was going on. She had just blown up like a balloon and popped and yet here she was. Alive and well. It must surely be something about this place, this house she thought. After all she didn't go swelling up and floating in the house they used to live in so Marge reasoned it wasn't likely to be something about her. Besides who ever heard of spontaneous human inflation?

After all she'd never experienced or heard of anything like the expansion she had just gone through, therefore it must be something about this creepy old house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarge set off and headed too the landing to look in all the upstairs rooms noticing nothing much out of place or odd she decides to check the attic. Marge opened the hatch and pulled down the ladder. She climbed up and poked her head out into the gloom before she switched on her torch and took a look around. The attic was dark and cobwebbed but at least had some flooring down, there where various chests, piles of old \"junk\" and a table of all things with some objects on it. Naturally Marge approached the table first and found it covered with strange looking magical runes or pictograms. Or was it a ancient language such a cuneiform? Marge wasn't sure but she knew she didn't like the look of them and backed away to look at the piles of stuff and chests. Marge opened some of the chests then eventually got to the only unopened one.

Well not quite as weird anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarge then jumped when she heard a surprised voice behind here and knew at once it was her daughter Lisa. She sighed. She really didn't want anyone from her family to see her like this huge and fattened. She was even fatter and wider than her husband Homer in fact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mom! What happened?

Well fat would be an understatement of course.\" Marge said looking to her daughter for some sympathy.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked worried and furrowed her brow. \"Mom, this could be serious! We've got to get you to a doctor quickly in case there's something really wrong!\" She said. Marge nodded, that did seem like the logical course of action although Marge knew full well her weight gain and expansion was more supernatural than anything and the doctor would likely be of little use.

She ended up as the mother she was to Bart, Lisa, and Maggie, wanting to give them the love and attention she never really had from her parents, hoping to feel those feelings herself in the process. Maybe this second chance will give her the loving life she always wanted. \"No!\" she shouts in her head. To her, it does not feel right. She is supposed to be Lisa's mother and Lisa is supposed to be her daughter, not the other way around. She has responsibilities... but she wants to play with her mommy.<br>\r\nA few seconds passed while Marge was in her train of thought. She shakes a little before happily hugging her new mommy. Marge starts to feel relief, no longer feeling scared by her surroundings.<br>\r\n\"Come on. Let's get you back to the others,\" Lisa says.<br>\r\n\"Okay!\" Marge says gleefully. Lisa lifts her up onto her back. Marge giggles to herself as Lisa gives her a piggy-back ride.</span></div></div>",

The house meanwhile was watching all this and decided this was a perfect opportunity to transform Lisa while no one else was looking, then when they found her they would wonder what on earth happened to make her a little toddler or baby. That's right, the house had noticed how Lisa was very mature for her age and decided to send her back to overalls, training pants and possibly even diapers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa entered the toilet, sat down did her business, washed her hands and was about to leave when suddenly she felt odd. A weird sensation shot through her body. \"Huh, what was that. Maybe my blood sugar is a little low or something.\" Lisa said out loud not knowing she was about to turn into a toddler. She opened the bathroom door and walked down the hallway on her way back to the car as the changes began to occur.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt happened quickly, Lisa began to get smaller and younger, her cloths changed too going from her usual red dress to her old pink overalls and pink sandals she had worn when she was about 3 or 4 years old. The only thing that didn't change was her hair, which was still incredibly spiky and her pearl necklace, which she had even back then. Lisa noticed something odd was going on when she got to the staircase and it looked huge to her, she thought to herself \"Where these stairs this big when I climbed them?\" then she looked at herself and noticed her smaller chubbier toddler body complete with her pink overalls outfit. Lisa gasped and nearly screamed except she was too shocked to scream. She just stood there in silence wondering why she was apparently about half her age all of a sudden. \"Heh! I'm supposed to be eight..nearly nine! Why am I three and a half again?\" Lisa said to herself annoyed. Then she looked at the stairs again. This was going to be a problem, she could probably climb down them but it wouldn't be easy not at her new size and age. Normally when she was eight it wasn't too bad but now..what if she slipped and fell? Then again her family where pretty tough, her dad fell down a cliff and had a vending machine fall on him and he still survived stupid, impulsive and reckless as ever.

And at three years of age, she also donned a diaper. \"Homey...\" she croaked as her husband passed out. The last thought in his mind was that this was just a drunken illusion. Maggie's hair had grown out in spiky blonde layers. Her baggie had been replaced with a sky blue shift-style dress, and on her feet were flats. She took stock of her situation and decided she needed to take charge of this family. First, she fed Baby Lisa a bottle, and then changed her into a fresh diaper and a sleeper, before tucking her into what had been Maggie's crib. Then she put little Margie and Bart into the tub, giving them a bedtime bath. It appeared to help them relax, especially Marge, who was overly worried and rightly so. With Homer passed out on the couch and the other kids' beds not yet prepared, Maggie decided to tuck the toddlers into her parents' bed with her. After dressing them in clean diapers and smaller-sized clothing (which was difficult for Bart because there were only baby girl clothes), she tucked little Margie and Bart into bed with her, and even donated something from her former stash to make their transition easier: two brand-new red pacifiers. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLong before infant Lisa awoke expecting a feeding, Maggie knew she had to get up. She recognized the odor emanating from the toddlers in bed with her. She knew the smell, as just hours before, she had been a baby, pooping in her diapers. But now, as an adult, it seemed more repugnant. As a baby, Maggie hadn't realized how badly it smelled to others. Trying not to awaken the tots, she quickly changed her mom's and Bart's stinky diapers. Then she went downstairs to fix Lisa a bottle. When it had warmed, Maggie headed back upstairs to the nursery, stopping only to cover her snoring father with a blanket. \"G'night, Dad,\" Maggie whispered. \"Goodnight, Maggie,\" Homer mumbled in his sleep. His youngest-born child did a double-take at that, before bringing Lisa her bottle. When Maggie reached the crib, Lisa was stirring in her own poopy diaper. She awoke and whimpered while Maggie changed her. Once Lisa was clean again, Maggie fed her a bottle, stopping to burp her occasionally. Then just as Lisa began to fill her diaper again, something weird happened.....</span></div></div>",

Because Homer wasn't at home Marge made the kids eat all the food that he would normally eat, Bart hadn't felt this full since that time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe began to walk towards the door but soon his hands fell to his midsection as he felt even more acutely bloated and it was getting worse.

This was like something out of some old cheap third rate horror movie or b movie sci-fi. Although he didn't know quite what was going on Bart was sharp enough to realise it probably had something to do with this house and the room he was in, after all he didn't start inflating until he actually entered the room did he? Maybe if he left the room he'd stop swelling or even shrink back down to normal proportions. It was worth a try. Soon Bart reasoned he'd be too big to do anything anyway so he might as well try the door now while he still can.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart walked over to the door somewhat awkwardly as his legs and feet where all so inflating and it was affecting his gate.

Bart tried again and again but as time passed he simply grew more and more inflated and began to loose mobility all together. Bart could only watch helplessly as his entire body began to round out denying him any chance of escape or being able to fetch help.

As Bart stared at his sister who appeared to have switched ages with him she smiles and walks towards him until she is standing right over him. Bart tries to speak to Maggie but all that comes out is some cute baby talk. Maggie then reaches down and picks Bart up as he objects but of course he is to small and weak to wriggle out of Maggie's much bigger stronger arms. Bart looks at Maggie who then says. \"Heh Bart. How is my *baby* bro doing? Heh guess what? I got a present for you!\" Maggie then takes out a red pacifier from her pocket and places it in Bart's mouth. At first Bart wants to cry out and make a fuss but suddenly he finds himself sucking on the pacifier which makes him feel better. Maggie then says. \"I'm glad you like it.

Next she takes out of talc and powders Bart's little baby behind before taking a clean diaper which she puts on him then puts him back in his baby cloths again. \"There. Good as new.

Soon her entire body had a shiny balloon like quality to it as she floated helplessly towards the windows, which the house had caused to swing open. \"Oh no!

If I knew THAT would happen, I would've never bought it... It's all my fault... said Homer, guiltily, and incredibly sad<br>\r\n-It's not yours (Not entirely at least), that's the house's ! answered Lisa.

They went insane : they broke everything breakable, they set the curtains on fire, they even borrowed (Err, I mean, stole) explosives to blow the crap out of this house !<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few hours, absolutely nothing remained of the house, not even a single brick. A minute later Bart suddenly felt funny, as his arms and legs got longer, and his voice got deeper. Soon enough, Bart was a 10 year old boy again ! And if destroying the house brought Bart back to normal, then...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maggie !!!!!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Simpsons ran back to their original house and headed straight to Maggie's room. They opened the door, and miraculously, she was there ! She didn't seem to remember how her big brother became her little brother, and how she inflated and exploded into pieces. She was sleeping peacefully, like nothing happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Simpsons hugged her for a long time. Maggie seemed to wonder why they hugged her like that, though.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFrom now on, the family promised themselves to stay the hell away from any creepy looking house, to prevent this kind of stuff from ever happening again.</span></div></div>",

As it turned out Lisa had already seen Marge, a massive yellow hand swooped down to scoop her up then Marge was brought face to face with her daughter who now looked like a giant to her. \"Mom, what happened to you? Was there some sort of supernatural event?\" Lisa asked. \"Well I guess it was something like that although I didn't really see anything, this just happened all of a sudden. I'm so glad you found me though, someone could have kicked me or stepped on me if you hadn't picked me up.\" Marge replied then Lisa began to get a strange smile on her face which Marge didn't like the look of. \"Lisa, what are you up to?\" Marge asked. \"Well I was just thinking that since your the size of a doll maybe we could play dolls together. Since I already have so much Malibu Stacy stuff anyway.\" Lisa stated. \"Well actually I was wondering if you could help me to go see the doctor or maybe turn me back to normal size.\" Said Marge. \"Oh I can probably help you, I've been experimenting using potions with my chemistry set but first I'm going to have some fun playing with my doll.\" Lisa said then ran upstairs to her room carrying Marge.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon arriving in her room Lisa shut the door then locked it with the latch. Then she put her shrunken mother down on her bed while she busied herself grabbing all her Malibu Stacy doll clothes and accessories. Marge was not impressed \"You know Lisa, dressing me up like a doll isn't really going to help me get back to normal size.\" Marge said then made her frustrated noise. Lisa wasn't listening though, soon she had assembled all of the clothes and her doll house ready to play. Marge wasn't really in the mood to but then again she knew Lisa could and eventually probably would help her to return to normal size so she decided to play along. Lisa even had the Malibu Stacy catwalk play set which she set up so Marge could model the doll clothes properly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Lisa dress Marge in first?</span></div></div>",

Not that Bart noticed this fact until he caught his reflection in the bathroom mirror and noticed that his normally vertical spiky hair was now in a style more like his sisters Lisa and Maggie. More disturbingly when Bart went to pee he got the shock of his short life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa opened the bathroom door. \"What's wrong? Did they finally cancel Krusty..WHAT ON EARTH! Bart? Is that you?\" Lisa asked in shock. \"Of course it's me! Who else would it be! Maggie's already a girl and a baby! Mom and dad are adults!\" Bart responded irritated. Lisa while slightly annoyed understood why Bart was angry having suddenly and for no apparent reason changed genders overnight. She walked up to Bart and hugged him. \"It's ok. We'll get to the bottom of this, I promise.\" Lisa said. Bart didn't reply he was far to upset by what had happened to him. \"Well have you ever heard of anything like this happening before?\" Bart asked as Lisa stopped hugging him. \"No. But then again I'm not a doctor, I'm an elementary school student. This does seem pretty weird though. No offence.\" Bart nodded thinking that he'd be stuck like this for a very long time if not for the rest of his life.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat now?</span></div></div>",

They would remember the old Bart, but would accept that Bart had turned into a girl. \"What was that all about?\" said Bartina. She clapped her hands to her mouth. This wasn't his voice.

Bartina nodded \"At the end, I gained memories\" <br>\r\n\"They're probably the same ones I remember about Bartina\" said Lisa. Bartina nodded. \"I guess I'm Bartina now\" said Bart, not sounding very confident at the idea. <br>\r\nNow that the house had finished with Bart, it explored it's other options.

Bart immediately squeezed his eyes shut, prepared for the beating the semi-naked females in the room were sure to give him. <br>\r\n\"Hey Bartina, are the lights too bright?\" said one girl, as the others laughed. Bart opened his eyes, then immediately closed them again at the sight of at topless girl. Then, he realised something. Shouldn't he be being turned on by that girl he had just seen? <br>\r\nHe opened his eyes again, and smiled at the girl standing topless in front of him. She was wearing nothing on her bottom half either, and yet Bart was not getting the familiar male arousal he had been used to all his life. He walked over to one of the benches and sat down, opening his swimming bag. His surprise at his lack of arousal was nothing compared to what he found in the bag. Instead of his normal swimming trunks, there was a skimpy two piece bikini! <br>\r\nBart was about to shout his protest, when he realised where he was. The fact that the girls were continuing to undress, regardless of his presence, told him that the whole world viewed him as female already. He removed his male trousers and girl panties, realising that his manhood had vanished, now replaced by a vagina. He resisted the temptation to probe his new sex, and pulled on the bikini bottoms. He then removed his shirt and put on the bra, still with a lack of breasts, but the bra seemed to be made to fit his still masculine upper body. Once he was changed, he followed the other girls out to the poolside. </span></div></div>",

As Kang and Kodos space ship whooshes off Homer simply says. \"Hmm..weather balloons are flying low today.\" Ignoring the OBVIOUS UFO that's just abducted his son. \"Heh where is Bart anyway? I thought he wanted to continue our game.\" Homer says still unbelievably non the wiser as to Bart's fate. Finally he says. \"You know I wonder if it was a weather balloon or maybe it was swamp gas. Nah probably a weather balloon since we're not in Florida. Ah the \"Truth\" is so satisfying man.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile aboard the alien space ship..<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart shakes his head and looks around finding himself in what can only be described as a cargo bay. There are strange looking containers and alien markings on the walls. He has just enough time to think \"Aye carbuma. I've been abducted by aliens.\" before some doors open and Kang and Kodos slither through each holding a strange looking ray gun in one of their tentacles. Bart shudders and recoils as the two green, one eyed aliens approach him and then loom over him pointing their ray guns at him. Bart looks at them, they look at him. Then he says something. \"Uh..peace man..\" He says uncertainly. The aliens both laugh and then Kang begins to speak. \"Foolish earthling. You have been watching too many bad sci fi movies. We are not here to invade your puny planet but rather to test out technology out on you.\" Bart looks a bit upset now and asks \"Why?\" The aliens respond. \"As a preparation for invading your planet of course.\" The aliens then laugh again and Bart crosses his arms over his chest. \"Well I'm not going to help you. You can't hold me here forever. No security system is perfect, sooner or later I'll figure out a way to escape then you'll be in trouble so if you could just drop me off near my house it'd really save you a lot of trouble.\" Bart says trying to persuade the aliens to let him go. It doesn't work. They merely laugh again then rebuke him saying. \"Silly earth child. You do not understand the power of our monumentally advanced technology. Did not your own Arthur C Clarke say: Sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic? Well ours is *MORE* than sufficiently advanced to stop you escaping or ever doing anything we don't want you to again. Observe.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe aliens then fire their ray guns at Bart transforming temporarily him to show him the futility of trying to escape but what do their alien rays do to him for the moment?</div></span></div></div>",

Of course he struggled to get up but was unable as he just sat their getting fatter and fatter until he was completely immobile.

The same treatment was done unto Bart, the plant beginning to forcefully feed the two it's unique fluid. They were powerless to resist as their arms and legs were bound and restricted, leaving them to watch in terrifying awe as they would switch physical attributes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bart's arms and legs grew out to be longer and clearly more adult. Bart would have appreciated this, except the arms were slender and hairless, as his legs were now shapely and also hairless. That of a grown woman's. Lisa's limbs shrank accordingly, not too far off of what they were before the plant altered her. Bart's torso began to cave in, forcing his spine to arch and his waist to shrink, hips and rear expanding to form the beginnings of an hourglass shape. To Bart, this feeling was akin to that of hitting puberty. Just, instead of hitting male puberty. this was female puberty. Lisa's torso shrank as Marge's breasts became nonexistent on her now flat boy chest. Bart swallowed hard, watching Lisa's boobs deflate, as he could feel his chest tingling, the two love muscles growing out in small buds at first, then jettisoning outward into full, voluptuous breasts. They had to be almost D's. Lisa would have laughed at seeing her usually sexist brother forced into the body of a grown woman, had she not been involved in the process of becoming a young boy. Bart's clothes had all been torn except for his Krusty the Clown underwear. The garment was struggling to contain Bart's growing rear, but his young underdeveloped member shrank as well, vanishing as his pelvis rearranged its sexual organs to form that of a womb and a working vagina. Lisa underwent similar treatment but she grew his member instead of losing it. Bart's hands and feet became dainty and feminine, growing to be that of an adult woman. Lisa's hands and feet shrank down to fit the rest of her body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Bart's hair grew, instead of being gray, forming a yellow beehive as his, now her face rearranged to exactly clone that of her mother's.

Lisa now looked exactly like Bart, just in a torn dress.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"What just happen-\" Bart stopped, covering her mouth and blushing slightly. She now sounded exactly like Marge. \"That thing keeps changing us!\" Lisa replied in Bart's voice. Marge just stood there watching, in partial shock from watching her only son change into a grown woman. Not only that, but he also became her. Or at least, what she used to look like. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat happens next?</span></div></div>",

I haven't been this sober in a year and we need to get back to civilization so I can get booze! Put your clothes on. I'll be at the beach.\" Homer retorted, turning and leaving with his spear. Marge stepped out of the dress, bra, panties, heels, and even took off her red beaded necklace, presenting them all to Bart as she covered herself. It took Bart a while to figure out how to get into the clothing, but eventually she got it and was now dressed as the spitting image of Marge Simpson. Lisa and Marge put on whatever articles of clothing were left. Then the transformed trio went to the beach where Homer built a small fire, his coconut raft on the side. The survival supplies they had with them contained a few meals that only required a heat source, so they had food for now. Homer was busy trying to work the radio transmitter to call for help. Lisa offered to take a look at it, but Homer saw her as Bart and shot the idea down immediately. </span></div></div>",

Marge, Lisa and Maggie went to try and find fruit and other types of fruit, while Homer and Bart stayed on the beach in case a boat passed by.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUnfortunately, Marge and Lisa's search wasn't going very well, as none of the trees or bushed they saw had fruit that looked edible. Most of them looked poisonous, and others seemed downright rotten, and they didn't want to risk tasting them in case they were as dangerous as they looked. Eventually, they found a strange flower. It had a small, round head that looked like a soft ping-pong ball. Lisa got closer to the flower and touched its head out of curiosity, and to her surprise, the flower head burst like a miniature balloon, releasing a cloud of dust. Instinctively, Marge grabbed her daughter by the hand and ran away as fast as she could. However, while Marge and Maggie managed to avoid breathing the dust, Lisa didn't, as she was directly in front of the flower when it burst. When the cloud dissipated, Marge asked:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, I didn't expect this flower to burst like that... Are you OK, sweetie?<br>\r\n-I kinda feel light-headed, but aside from that, I'm fine. Good thing I didn't breathe in too much of the dust...<br>\r\n-We should hurry back to the beach. Hopefully your father and your brother found a boat, or at least a nice spot for us to make a shelter...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey headed back to the beach, but the more she walked, the worse Lisa felt. She didn't pay much attention to it at first as she thought finding food and shelter was more important, but eventually she felt so dizzy she had trouble standing up. The dust's true effects showed not long afterwards, as Lisa was starting to transform. But how was she transforming?</span></div></div>",

They had a pre arranged meeting place that they would meet if Bob ever escape from jail and soon enough Bob managed to hot wire a car and drive out to it. It was a remote pool near a sewage outlet from the power plant where Homer had found the dead body of Mr Smithers father all those years ago but today it was a place for Bob and Cecil to meet up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBob parked his stolen truck at the side of the road then touched it and imagined it turning into a toy version of itself. It quickly shrunk down until it was the size of a kid\u2019s toy and then Bob picked it up and pocketed it. \"Well well. I guess I'll never have to worry about parking again.\" He said to himself smugly and then set off into the woods. Before long he arrives at the area where Cecil should be and sure enough his brother emerges from the woods to greet him. \"Bob. You finally escaped from prison. What took you so long?\" Cecil says as Bob looks at him and rolls his eyes. \"Very funny Cecil. Now are you interested in helping me nail that brat Bart Simpson and his meddling sister Lisa or not?\" Bob asks. \"Well actually brother its funny you should mention that because I was hoping to talk you out of that very course of action.\" Cecil replies. \"WHAT? But Cecil I need my revenge! You ended up in jail too because of those meddling kids!\" Bob says becoming irate.  Cecil just sighs and responds \"Bob. Going after Bart right away is what the police will be expecting you to do. They'll set a trap for you then unload so many bullets into you it makes the gun fight at the okey coral look like reasonable use of force. Surely even you can see that?\" Bob rubs his chin for a moment and says \"Yes. You may have a point. That is what they would expect me to do. Go to the boys house or school to get revenge on him. There has to be another way.\" Cecil shakes his head. \"I doubt it Bob. I doubt Marge could allow her two older children out of her sight until you are caught or she believes you are a long way away and no threat.\" Bob replies \"Well there must be SOME way of nailing those brats. We just need a plan. A diversion of an opportune moment when they'll be away from home or school and vulnerable. Or I could use my powers in some way.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe brothers continue discussing the problem of how to get to Bart and Lisa for revenge and eventually come up with several plans.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1: Hack into the government computer system and send the police in Springfield a false report that Sideshow Bob has been sighted in a city in South America. Maybe the cops will stop protecting Bart if they think Bob has fled the country.<br>\r\n2: Wait for Bart and Lisa to go on a school trip or wait for the Simpson's to go on holiday then ambush them.<br>\r\n3: Bob and Cecil exploit Bob's powers to disguise themselves at police and then get close to Bart and his sister.</span></div></div>",

She rubbed her arms to loosen them up, figuring she was feeling the results of the previous night's accident. She was technically correct, just not in the way she expected. She climbed out of bed and headed for the bathroom, absentmindedly tugging at the sleeves of her nightgown, which felt just a little bit tight around the shoulders...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe school day passed fairly uneventfully...until gym. Lisa's class trudged into the gymnasium, dressed in their uniforms. (Lisa's felt oddly snug, though she presumed it had merely shrunk a bit in the wash.) Lisa groaned inwardly at the sight of the dodgeballs littering the hardwood floor. \"The most dreaded of all P.E. sports...\" she quietly muttered. Ms. Pommelhorst, the gym teacher, blew her whistle, and the class fell into line. \"It's dodgeball day, class!\" Ms. Pommelhorst bellowed. \"You know the rules, so split into the two teams and start pummeling each other!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa shuffled to the nearest side of the scotch-tape line dividing the floor and closed her eyes, awaiting the inevitable. She didn't wait long. Mere moments after Ms. Pommelhorst signaled the start of the first game, Lisa heard the unmistakable sound of a dodgeball making contact and felt the hard rubber ball strike her body. Strangely, this time the feeling didn't instantly leave as usual. She opened her eyes and looked down. The ball was wedged firmly between her hands. She had caught the ball without even trying!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe looked around. Her classmates were too busy trying to hit each other to notice her sudden display of athleticism. She shrugged, gripped the ball with one hand, and pulled her arm back. She really didn't know why she was bothering; she threw even worse than she dodged. <i>Still...</i> she thought as she hurled the ball with all her might. Much to her surprise, the ball zoomed across the gym and knocked Ralph Wiggum clean off his feet. <i>That</i> got the class's attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god!\" Lisa shouted. \"Ralph, are you okay?\" Without moving from his position on the floor, Ralph brightly responded, \"The lights make everything like a collider-scope!\" Lisa exhaled in relief. Ralph was fine...relatively speaking. Then she realized the entire class was staring at her in mute shock. She blushed sheepishly. Someone on the other team dropped the ball they were holding. It rolled across the floor and came to a rest against Lisa's foot. She bent down, picked it up...and felt a predatory smirk spread across her face as she looked at the other team.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe class played five rounds of dodgeball that period, and in all five rounds Lisa dominated the game, singlehandedly demolishing the other team. By the third round, the rest of her team just huddled in the back, gawking at the girl who had suddenly changed from bookworm to dodgeball machine. Some of the students swore that the few times Lisa missed her target, she left dents in the wall. Ms. Pommelhorst was ecstatic that she had finally \"gotten through\" to Lisa. Everyone kept their distance from her as the class headed back to Ms. Hoover's room, and Lisa felt an odd mix of pride and embarrassment over what had happened. And for the life of her, she just couldn't figure out where this sudden rush of power had come from...</span></div></div>",

Beyond the shocked stares of her classmates, the day had held no other unusual events. She had tried to convince herself that what had happened in gym was just a fluke, and that she would be her old unathletic self again by next week's class. It hadn't worked, but once home, she was able to put it out of her mind. Until...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, Lisa,\" Marge asked, \"how was school today?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa gulped. Fortunately, she was chewing a mouthful of food at the time, so it didn't call any undue attention. \"Oh, you know,\" she responded with an unconvincing casualness, \"it was... normal. Nothing out of the ordinary happening.\" Seated beside her, Bart snorted. \"That's not what <i>I</i> heard.\" Lisa's mouth went dry as she silently cursed the playground grapevine. She should've realized how quickly reports of the gym incident would've spread across the student body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarge looked at her son in confusion. \"What do you mean, Bart? Did something happen?\" Ignoring his sister's whispered pleas for mercy, Bart elaborated: \"Well, it seems that our beloved brainiac here discovered her inner jock during gym today. The way I heard it, Lisa was throwing dodgeballs so hard, she put holes in the wall and sent four kids to the hospital!\" Marge gasped in shock. Reflexively clutching her fork tight, Lisa stood up, glared right in her brother's face, and bellowed, \"<b>I DID <i>NOT!</i></b>\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe silence that followed was deafening. The family hadn't heard Lisa yell like that since, well...ever. Unwilling to put up with awkward stares for the second time that day, Lisa quietly excused herself and ran up to her room, slamming the door and locking it. <i>Great,</i> she thought bitterly. It was bad enough the whole school thought she was a freak by now. She didn't need her idiot brother convincing their parents she was turning into some thug. She sank to the floor and wrapped her arms around her knees. The feel of metal against her skin made her realize she was still holding her fork. She unclenched her hand and gasped. The fork was mangled and bent out of shape, the dents lining up with her fingers! \"What is happening to me?!\" she wondered aloud.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The next morning started no better.  The nightgown which was tight the night before barely fit now and had ripped out some stitches.  And as she pulled it off she looked in the mirror and could tell why.  Her shoulders were wider.  And the reason they were wider was because her muscles were bigger.  Not a lot, but enough.  In fact as she let out a surprised gasp as she noticed that her chest had swelled slightly, pressing hard against her underwear.  Lisa rubbed her stomach and felt unfamiliar lumps that she quickly surmised was an underlying six pack, ready to press forward into view.  Not that she was going to be showing it to anyone.  Raising her arm she gasped as she flexed and a small but noticeable bicep popped up above the plane of her arm with an equally thick tricep to balance the bicep out.  Her muscles couldn\u2019t compete with the likes of Nelson, but she was convinced they were as big as Bart\u2019s.  If not bigger.  Smiling riley at the thought, she still had to let out a nervous sigh.  Her dress would be stressed against her newly added muscles.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDigging through her dresser she found an athletic top she had taken from her mom months before for some type of dress up show.  The top was thick and stretchable, and as she pulled it on, it was a bit big.  But that wasn\u2019t all bad since it hung down to her waist instead of exposing any of her stomach.  Her arms were still bare, but as long as she didn\u2019t flex for anyone she figured she\u2019d be OK.  She then pulled on a pair of loose fitting shorts that no longer felt so loose, but still covered up her legs to her knees.  Slipping on her sandals, Lisa slumped down the stairs to join the family for breakfast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching the table, she mumbled a good morning and picked up the cereal box and dumped some in the waiting bowl, added milk and munched away.  Bart looked over at her and snickered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up with workout outfit?  Looking for another dodgeball game already?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa shot him daggers with her eyes, but simply responded with a muffled \u201cNo.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarge looked her over.  \u201cSweety, why aren\u2019t you wearing your dress?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked up at her mother with pained eyes.  \u201cI just wanted to wear something different today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNot looking to pry just yet, Marge nodded, but let out her worried moan.  Lisa stared back at her bowl and finished her breakfast.  Grabbing her lunch and backpack she ran for the door with Bart and getting on the bus, she headed for the back and stared at the ground, unwilling to make eye contact and ignoring the whispers from the other kids.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce Lisa made it to class she let out a sigh of relief.  At least she could concentrate on her studies.  Then maybe later she could look into what was happening to her.  However, the class had barely begun when Principal Skinner\u2019s voice came over the loudspeaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLisa Simpson, please report to the Principal\u2019s office.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the class let out \u201cooohs\u201d and other jeers.  Sighing, Lisa walked out of the room and was soon being led into Skinner\u2019s office.  There were three men in suits standing off the side.  The two huge men on either side had on sunglasses and looked menacing.  The one in the middle looked ex-military, probably an officer.  Lisa looked at Principal Skinner with concern.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cI didn\u2019t intend to hurt anyone yesterday, honest.  It was just that I never felt that athletic before.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPrincipal Skinner let out a familiar \u201cHmmmmm.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe paused for a moment, shooting a glance toward the stern looking men.  \u201cWell that may be Lisa, but apparently enough parents heard about it from their children and now these men from the government would like to ask you a few questions.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man in the middle, Agent Jones stepped forward and did just that.  He was direct, but sounded friendly.  Lisa answered all of the questions about what happened yesterday, but didn\u2019t elaborate or let them know about her newfound muscles.  Eventually, Agent Jones looked back at Skinner.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cTell you what.  Let\u2019s head to the gym and see what this little girl can do.  But from what I can see, there is nothing that abnormal about any of this.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSkinner nodded his head and Lisa let out a sigh of relief.  Now all she had to do was convince them that she wasn\u2019t any stronger than a normal 7 year old girl and they would leave.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe men had set up a bench press just for her with more weights than she had remembered ever seeing in the gym.  Shaking that off, Lisa did as they instructed and was soon bench pressing 50 pounds.  The weight felt light, but she pretended to struggle.  Lisa racked the weight and professed to the difficulty.  With that Agent Jones grunted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cShe may be fit for a girl.  But she\u2019s nothing special.  Those parents must have been exaggerating.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf Lisa had left things alone, then all would have been back to normal.  But it was his tone.  And his words.  \u201cfor a girl\u201d.  She was sick of hearing those words.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa is smart \u201cfor a girl\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa can play the saxophone very well \u201cfor a girl\u201d.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe predatory feeling from the dodgeball game returned and as Agent Jones droned on, Lisa interrupted him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cYou know what Agent Jones.  I think I\u2019m feeling a bit stronger after all.  Why don\u2019t you add some more weight and let me try again.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgent Jones shot her a quizzical look, but nodded his head to the other two, who quickly added 10 pounds to either side.  As Lisa slid back under the bar, Agent Jones snickered.  \u201cNow don\u2019t hurt yourself little girl.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa growled.  Little girl, huh?  She\u2019d show him what this little girl was made of.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd as she reached for the bar she felt her strength well within her and she knew that she was going to be able to lift this weight.  And a lot more.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Before she could lift, however, a deafening ringing filled the room. \"The fire alarm!\" Skinner gasped. \"Everyone out!\" He quickly hustled Lisa and the three men outside, where the classes had already begun to gather.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce among the other students, Lisa quietly slipped away from the adults and watched from a distance as Skinner and Jones talked. She couldn't hear what was being said, but after a few exchanges, Jones and the two larger men left. Lisa sighed in relief (why, she wasn't quite sure), but suddenly jumped when someone tapped her shoulder. She spun around to find Bart, looking quite pleased with himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't <i>do</i> that!\" she hissed. \"Fine way to talk to someone who just saved your hide, sis,\" Bart replied, mock-offended. \"What do you mean?\" Lisa asked. \"Duh! Think about it, Lis,\" Bart said, \"I saw those guys taking you to the gym. Something weird happens and a bunch of creepy suits show up? I bet those guys were totally from some secret government agency. If I hadn't pulled the fire alarm, they probably would've hauled you off to some secret lab for all kinds of freaky tests and stuff!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So, <i>you</i> pulled the alarm, eh, Simpson?\" Skinner intoned, looming up behind Bart. \"I should've guessed. Off to detention with you!\" So saying, he grabbed Bart by the arm and dragged him away, leaving Lisa with her thoughts as the classes began to file back into the school. The more she thought about what Bart said, the more sense it made. She barely understood what was happening to her. If she had continued to let Jones get to her, who knows what would've happened. Jones certainly didn't seem like the benevolent sort...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs she headed back into the building, Lisa felt a slight chill in the air. <i>Winter's finally starting,</i> she thought. <i>At least now I can wear more concealing clothes without anyone getting suspicious.</i> She just hoped her winter clothes would be baggy enough to hide any further growth spurts for the time being. Now that she thought about it, Lisa realized she had no idea when or if she would stop growing, how big she would grow, or even what her rate of growth was. She resolved to start taking note on her condition when she got home.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The rest of the day was less eventful, although the other children continued to point, stare and go hush when Lisa approached.  She made it back home and immediately ran up to her room to take some measurements.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPulling out a tape measurer and a ruler, Lisa noted her height and let out a sigh of relief when she saw that it was unchanged.  But when she started taking measurements across her body, she became worried.  Not from the measurements per se, but from hard muscles bulging when she flexed them.  Her legs were thicker now than they were even yesterday; and when she flexed them, the muscles below surged to the surface and formed intimidating slabs.  Her calves were now small balls of muscle.  As she moved up, her abs were now flat and hard and when she tensed them, the outline of the muscle blocks that would form a six pack were clearly seen.  Bringing her arm up, she wrapped the tape around her lower arm and tensed, gasping at the lemon sized muscle that bulged up above the plane of her arm.  She looked at the tape.  8 inches.  The number didn\u2019t mean as much as the shape.  Lisa knew her muscle was bigger than it was just yesterday.  But strangely, the more she pumped her arm the less afraid she became.  After all, she reasoned, bigger muscles, more strength, less chance of bullies.  After a few more pumps a small vein began to rise up along her arm and for the first time today, she smiled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWhoa, that\u2019s quite an arm you\u2019ve got there Lis.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa flushed red and releasing her flex, letting the tape fall to the ground.  \u201cBart!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s my name, don\u2019t wear it out.\u201d  He smiled and turned his head.  \u201cFigure out what\u2019s going on yet?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa sighed with excitement and fear.  \u201cOh Bart, I haven\u2019t.  My muscles appear to be growing bigger, but I don\u2019t really know how much or if that means I\u2019m getting stronger.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart stepped into the room and looked at the tape measurer.  \u201cWell if you need some help, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa smiled at Bart.  \u201cWell, to start with, you could help me finish up my measurements.  I just need to go around my chest and then I\u2019ll at least have a baseline for today.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart nodded his head, picked up the tape and tossed it over her head, pulling the end to the middle of her back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWell if you want to test your strength, all of those weights are still in the gym.  I saw that creepy guy talking to Skinner again while I was in detention.  I tried to sneak in closer, but by the time I did, he had left.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lisa wrote down the last of the measurements, Bart dropped the tape.  She turned toward him and gave him an out of place smile.  The predatory Lisa had returned.  \u201cI would love to try and lift those weights.  I felt really strong when you pulled the fire alarm.  I feel even stronger now.  After dinner, we can say we\u2019re going to the library and head there instead.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart gave her a curious look.  \u201cSneak out on a school night and lie to Mom and Dad?  Whatever is happening to you, I like the new Lisa.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa turned sullen.  \u201cUh, no Bart.  It\u2019s, you know, for science.  And to find out what is happening to me.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart chuckled and turned to head out of the room.  \u201cWhatever.  But since there\u2019s a mystery to solve, our normal pact for such things apply.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa sighed, but then brightened.  \u201cRight.  Truce on all previous fights until the mystery is solved.\u201d  Lisa then blushed.  \u201cThanks Bart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart was already in the hallway.  \u201cNo problemo.  But you\u2019ll have to do the talking to convince Mom we\u2019re heading to the Library.  Dad won\u2019t care, but Mom will be suspicious.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDinner went smoothly until Marge asked Lisa if anything unusual happened at school.  When she began to stutter, Bart jumped in about a fire alarm, neglecting to mention his involvement or the detention.  Once assurances were made that everyone was OK, Lisa brought up the library and a science project and that she needed Bart\u2019s help.  Homer laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cBart?  Are you sure?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa nodded quickly.  \u201cYes.  You could say we\u2019re working on a mystery.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarge, seeming to sense that something was up but trusting her children, simply nodded.  \u201cWell OK, but be back before dark.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that both kids chimed a \u201cThanks Mom!\u201d, jumped off the table and ran out the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJumping on their bikes they pedaled quickly, with Lisa staying in the lead.  Her bigger muscles propelled her forward and she was parking her bike when a breathless Bart skidded up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, Lis.  That has to the fastest I\u2019ve ever seen you pedal.  Something is definitely going on.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa blushed, realizing what had just happened.  \u201cUh, yeah, I guess.\u201d  Scratching her head Lisa walked toward the door.  \u201cSo how do we get in?  The door must be locked.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart smiled and pulled out a key.  \u201cI\u2019m sure it is.  Too bad Skinner can\u2019t afford to change the locks though.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart walked up, unlocked the door and held it for Lisa as she slipped in.  \u201cBart, how did you\u2026\u201d  She paused and shook her head.  \u201cNever mind.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart chuckled as they turned into the gym.  The bar was still resting on the holder, apparently untouched.  As they walked closer, Bart looked over at the weights.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cGee Lisa, check out the size of those plates.  How much weight did they think you could lift?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa shrugged her shoulders and pulled off her coat.  She was still wearing the same outfit from this morning.  \u201cI don\u2019t know Bart, but I believe it\u2019s time to find out.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Lisa slid on the bench and reached up to grip the bar.  Taking a few breaths she smiled.  \u201cYeah.  Time to find out just who that Agent Jones is dealing with.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with one quick push, Lisa pulled the 70 pound weight off the bar and smoothly brought the weight down and back up.  Smiling, she pressed the bar up and down several times for effect as Bart looked on.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow Lis.  Pretty good.  Is that a lot of weight?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa sat up and smiled.  \u201c70 pounds!  That\u2019s more than I weigh.\u201d  She then moaned.  \u201cOr at least more than I used to weigh.  I forgot to weight myself at home.  We\u2019ll have to do that when we get back.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart looked around.  \u201cSo, what next?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa smiled confidently.  \u201cNow we see just how much weight I can REALLY lift!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Lisa picked up some weights and added another 20 pounds and slid back on the bench.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart looked on with interest, but also with a bit of concern.  \u201cSure thing Lisa, but I have to wonder why they left all these weights here anyway.  And why so much.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lisa grunted after her fifth repetition, she racked the weigh with a loud clang and sat up with a disappointed and slightly angry expression.  \u201cToo light!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time Lisa grabbed the 25 pound weights and started to stack them on the bar.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cLisa.  Are you listening?  I wonder if there isn\u2019t something going on here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Lisa finished loading the bar at 200 pounds, she turned toward him and grinned wickedly.  \u201cWell that\u2019s something else to look into before we leave.  But right now I\u2019m feeling really strong and want to see what I can do.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart sighed and looked around.  \u201cWell, OK.  You can keep going.  I\u2019m going to take a look around the gym.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa grunted an acknowledgement and slid back under the bench, her thoughts focused on the weights.  \u201cSure thing Bart.\u201d  Lisa pictured Agent Jones and grinned with cruel satisfaction.  \u201cJust a girl, huh?  Know any girls who can do THIS?\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa pushed the bar up and with a low pitched growl, brought the weight down to her chest.  A chest now bulging with more muscle than she was sporting just minutes before.  And with an even exhale, Lisa pushed the weight back up, staring up with satisfaction.  \u201cI\u2019ll show him what this girl can do!\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn a van parked in a lot across from the school a dull light could be seen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nInside the van a technician focused the hidden camera on Lisa.  Agent Jones leaned closer.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cWow, sir.  You were right.  That girl did come back.  And just look at how much weight she\u2019s lifting.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgent Jones leaned back.  \u201cYes.  She appears to be very stronger.  This does prove that there is something strange going on here.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe technician pulled up another camera.  \u201cHow much longer do we let her go?  I don\u2019t trust her brother.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgent Jones stood up.  \u201cYes.  The troublemaker.  We could have already had Lisa if it weren\u2019t for him.  Don\u2019t worry, they aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe technician stared on as Lisa sat up and headed toward the weights.  \u201cShe\u2019s adding more plates.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAgent Jones grimaced.  \u201cWell, this IS what we wanted to see.  Perhaps we give her an opportunity to see what level she\u2019s at.  And then we deal with her and Bart.\u201d<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart walked around the large weights and finding a dark corner, looked up.  Cameras.  At least two of them.  They were likely being watched.  Not wanting to tip his hand, Bart looked for other exits, figuring whoever was watching would have the doors well covered.  Until he could think of way out they were stuck.  He looked back at Lisa as she finished adding more plates.  Bart\u2019s eyes widened.  How much weight was on the bar?  It had to be 400 pounds!  He wanted to tell her about the cameras, but that would likely bring the men in quicker.  Well, if Lisa kept getting stronger, maybe she could knock a hole in a side wall.  Either way, if they were to escape, it was going to have to be up to him to figure it out.<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

But first, Bart spoke in a normal voice.<b> Lisa, I got something on my mind</b> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa have not yet started lifting weight but sat down on the workout bench. She looked at him inquiringly. Bart tugged on his ears. He whispered very low <i>' There are cameras in here filming us. I think that the agents knows that we are here and know about your strength. Pretend that you can't lift that much even though you actually could....now bluff an answer back at me.'. </i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was able to hear that faint whisper but the agents could not pick up what Bart was saying. So they turned up the volume. Lisa thought of a fake answer. She replied. ' Yes, I like classical music too. Jazz is not my only favorite.' She winked at Bart. Then she went to 'try' to lift the next weight. But Bart was looking around the room for a way to escape. Then he remembered Willie talking about a stairway that lead to a little used cellar. It had a window but it was too high to reach. But Bart felt that Lisa could do something about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was so good at faking not being able to lift the 400 pound weight. She grunted and grunted and said 'Rats, I am not that strong after all. I need more practice. It might take another 2 years to barely lift it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart said to Lisa,  ' Let us go to the cellar. That is something that I want to show you- a book on a famous Jazz Musican.'<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa stood up and said 'That is great, Let's go.' Then they headed to the cellar. The Agents looked at each other but felt that Lisa and Bart would return. But when Bart entered the cellar with Lisa, he said in a low voice.. We are gong to escape. See that window, Carry me piggyback and jump. The window has no glass in it and we might be able to crawl through. Just be able to grab on  something up there. Lisa nodded. But first she grabbed a book on Scott Joplin(who composed the ragtime song 'The Entertainer') and tucked in her sweater.  Bart climbed on her back and held on to her abs. Lisa breathed deeply and focused on the window high up near the ceiling and jumped. She was so good that Lisa managed to jump high enough that she was able to even do a flip out of the window and into the lawn.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa looked at Bart and said ' We have another problem... how are we going to be able to get to our bike withuot being noticed.

Suddenly she was aware of being picked up. This was no dream! She looked at herself, conscious that she no longer possessed limbs nor any other human body parts. She felt very soft and thick, not unlike a plush doll or toy, yet much flatter. What used to be her skin now had an outer coating of thin plastic. 'Like a raincoat?' she wondered. Lisa's answer came when her mother slid her beneath her baby sister's naked bottom. Lisa coughed as Marge powdered Maggie, whose skin was velvety soft. Then Marge grasped the front of the new Lisa, and pulled it up over Maggie's lower front, taping the sides. If Lisa had still been in human form, her legs would have been over her head now. She was thankful that she couldn't suffocate. \"There you go, Sweetie. One clean Happy Little Elves Enchantment Diaper!\" Maggie squealed and cooed as holographic images danced across the Lisa diaper. 'I wonder why they're called Enchantment,' Marge thought to herself. She brought Maggie downstairs to play before supper. Placing her in the playpen with her blocks, Maggie sucked happily on her pacifier while she played. </span></div></div>",

Her stomach and hips ballooned out, with her red dress starched to cover her new form. She looked around at her surroundings. She wasn't in her bed today; Lisa was in Maggie's room. She appeared to be sitting in the baby's crib while Maggie ws changed and fed. 'Oh, I must be a baby too,' thought Lisa, 'This won't be so bad.'  Lisa then realized how large the crib was in relation to her new size. She tried to stand and sit. In time, Lisa realized that the only movement she could make was to roll. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt took some effort, but finally Lisa was able to roll across the crib to the slats on one of the sides. Maggie was a toddler, so she no longer had bumper pads around her crib. That was the next thing Lisa noticed when she fell out of the crib. When Lisa regained consciousness, she found herself contained in a smaller place. She looked around to see stacks of disposable diapers, baby wipes, Powder, lotion, and diaper rash cream on one side of the structure. On the other, an insulated pocket with baby bottles of milk, juice, and water; burping towels, and several blue \"baggie\" gowns. Lisa jumped suddenly when a large hand began rummaging through the bag. Marge dug through the diaper bag frantically as Maggie wailed. \"I know it's in here somewhere --\" She suddenly spied Lisa. \"There you are!\" Marge grabbed Lisa by her wrists and pulled her out of the bag. Lisa finally learned of her purpose when her mother brushed off Lisa's legs and popped them into Maggie's mouth!  'I'm a pacifier?!' Lisa mused. 'That explains why I could barely move...'</span></div></div>",

Bart smiles then walks up to Lisa who he pokes in her belly and says. \"Heh Lisa. How ya doing fatty? Want some more ice cream fatty? Maybe some cakes or sweets eh fatty?\" Lisa was not happy about this but it didn't bother her as much as being changed by Bart in the first place. As Bart poked and pushed Lisa her tummy started to wobble somewhat similar to the way Homer's had done in the past. Lisa blinked at the unfamiliar sensation then grabbed her belly with her chubby little hands to stop it jiggling, she was surprised how far her fat fingers sank into her expanded abdomen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bart. Pleeeeeeassse can you turn me back? At least make me thin again and put some cloths on me! I can't just walk around naked after all.\" Bart says. \"Hmm.\" and considers this before her goes back to the book, grabs it and writes in it. Instantly an extra extra large set of pink toddler overalls appear on Lisa but otherwise she is unchanged and is still half her normal age and fat bordering on obese. Lisa grumbles to herself as Bart ignores her and writes something else in the book making her...</div></span></div></div>",

As if to match actions to words Lisa gasped then inflated into a blue sphere about her normal height as her limbs were absorbed up to her hands and feet. Lisa was now an immobile blueberry with Bart laughing at her from across the room. \"So how do you like your new body Lisa?\" Bart asked giving Lisa a smug look.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Lisa respond?</span></div></div>",

Next he made sure his parents were out town before tying Lisa to the weight and placing her in the back yard, then he walked away from her towards the house and turn to face his sister. \"Time for some target practice blimpy.\" Bart said then pumped his BB gun. \"Oh you have *got* to be kidding me.\" Lisa groaned as she floated at an angle with the string from her foot to the weight holding her down. Bart started firing and hit Lisa with his second shot, she burst like a balloon but then instantly reformed and Bart shot her again and again and again each time Lisa popped and reformed thanks to the magic of the book. Soon Bart was doing trick shots as Lisa was a large stationary target which made her really quite easy to hit. Bart started to get bored and thought of ways to spice the game up.

Other than that there where the usual dolls, toys, a bookshelf, a desk with kneeling chair and of course Lisa's saxophone on it's stand.

Then Bart realised that of course the comic wasn't growing he was getting smaller! Bart let out a yell and threw the comic on the floor before looking down and seeing himself getting smaller but he realised that he was not merely shrinking although he certainly was loosing size. No Bart was not shrinking he was in fact getting younger and rather rapidly so. As he panicked and looked around trying to think of something to do he lost more years and now he was no older than a toddler. Bart's cloths changed as he became younger first into a set of overalls and then into a diaper much to Bart's dismay. In moments he was a diaper clad baby the same age as his sister Maggie. Bart looked around at the bed, which seemed huge now along with the rest of the room but then it began to change due to Bart's age and the book. Bart's bed became a crib with bars to stop him climbing out, his desk became a changing table with nappies and a diaper bin appeared next to it then finally all his toys and games vanished to be replaced with stuffed toys and such. \"Awww man..\" Bart said to himself as just then Marge and Lisa came in through the door much to his embarrassment. \"So Bart, I decided you needed to be punished so you'd learn a lesson about not messing with other people and I thought this would be as good a way as any.\" Marge explained while Lisa tried hard not to laugh although it was clear from her expression that Bart becoming a baby amused her to no end.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen Marge decided something which was...</div></span></div></div>",

She was already doll sized so Bart smiled and agreed before writing something in the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There. You should become a doll any second now.\" Bart said as Marge gulped and thought \"What have I done? I'm about to become a girls toy.\" Soon she did as Marge's body suddenly straightened up and began to turn plastic starting with her feet which fitted snugly into her new red high heels and pointed down so that they could be slipped in and out of them. Next her legs elongated before stiffening. Soon her butt and thighs swelled outward before hardening into plastic as her lower body become featureless except for a plastic belly button. Marge's waist pinched in even more than it did already as her boobs inflated like balloons until they where slightly bigger than her head. As the plastic raced towards Marge's neck she suddenly founds herself adopting a gormless looking happy grin as her long blue hair suddenly came down and now reached down past her large rear. Soon the plastic covered her face leaving Marge unable to move at all as her hair turned a bright shade of blonde. Finally her dress reshaped itself and changed colour until it became a pink 1950's housewife's dress. Marge was furious with herself for suggesting this and with Bart for doing it but there was nothing she could do as Bart picked her up and put her on the table then proceeded to laugh at her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh mom. This is just too priceless. Malibu Margie. I guess Lisa had a point about dolls promoting sexist stereotypes. Or should that be sexy stereotypes.

He then scooped Marge up put her on the table and then put the period at the end of the sentence in the book. This activated the TF. \"Well mom, your suggestion about clothes gave me an idea.\" Marge laughed nervously at this realising that knowing her messed up son it probably was a weird freaky idea.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe was right.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst Marge's dress turned white, then it grew longer and covered her shoulders.

However the TF was just beginning as Marge discovered when he butt, belly and breasts began to swell under her dress which itself grew to accommodate them. Soon Marge was an expectant looking bride and just as she was about to chew her son out for his choice of TF she shrank down to four inches tall and turned suddenly to plastic.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAll Marge could do was stand there and smile as Bart laughed his ass off and actually fell of his chair laughing. Marge was thinking: Man Bart is messed up. I *knew* Homer and I drank *too much* that night under the windmill at the crazy golf course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Bart recovered but by then he'd attracted the attention of someone else in the house who came in to see what he was laughing at.</div></span></div></div>",

Or failing that the library.\" Bart replied. \"No, I mean your other sister, I can't seem to find Maggie anywhere.\" Marge replied. \"I think I saw her in the back yard.\" Bart said trying to get Marge to go away as she was distracting him from his game. \"Wait a second, Bart where did you get that TV and gaming system anyway? Has your father being buying things without consulting me again?\" Marge asked annoyed. Bart decided to try and lie his way around the situation. \"I uh..won a contest at the mall.\" Bart stated as he continued to play. \"Oh really, what *kind* of contest?\" Marge asked. \"Burping.\" Bart replied self assuredly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDid Marge believe him or did she work out what he'd done?</span></div></div>",

Matters where made worse by the fact that Bart had slim to nothing in common with his other sister Lisa. Oh sure Lisa was great and he loved her but apart from Itchy and Scratchy and Krusty they hardly shared any interests at all. This left Bart rather alone and he'd always wanted a Simpson his own age who he could really get along with and play with.

That was a long setance BTW but heh what the hell, it's all I can salvage from this chapter.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe next morning, Lisa was to call her brother Bart to go to <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">college</span> School not college they are 8 and 10 years old remember. But his bed had not anyone, hmm yes me yoda me speak backwards like this. When hand up arse you have talk straight you cannot!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou know if I didn't know better I'd almost say the person who wrote this chapter was not a native english speaker. Hmm..back to the mess...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe entered into the room to see if his brother was hiding to make a joke. He wasn't. This entire chapter is a freakin joke. Even by English as a second langauge standards.<br>\r\nBart, it was actually in his bed, but now <span style=\"text-decoration:line-through\">half 2 cm tall</span>, and his sister could not see him. Or as we who are not half stoned say it ONE CM tall! Seriously, why say HALF OF TWO? It's a number!  A NUMBER, NUMBERS ARE UNIVERSAL! SAY ONE NOT HALF OF TWO YOU FOOL!<br>\r\nThen Bart...decided the story would get a lot better starting NOW!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSomething happened to banish the n00bness bad english and that something was...</div></span></div></div>",

But Lisa suddenly spotted Bart when she lifted up the bed covers to look for him and quickly realised that something had gone wrong. Put simply the wish had backfired on her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bart, just stay there. I've got to go do something. I'll be back..in a minute.\" Lisa said then dashed from the room and towards her own room. In seconds she was there and she picked up the book and wrote: \"Bart who had shrunk suddenly returned to normal like he was before Lisa wrote in the magic book.\" Lisa didn't hear anything so she dashed back into Bart's room and sighed with relief when she saw Bart or rather a Bart shaped mound under the bedspread. Bart crawled out of bed and looked strangely at Lisa.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Lisa, what happened? All of a sudden I woke up and I was small. I mean like really, really tiny man. Do you think it's got something to do with that weird tomb we ran into yesterday?\" Bart asked his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa smiled and said \"Well Bart, it might have. But your fine now right.\" Lisa stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uh yeah, I think so. I don't feel weird or ill or anything.\" Bart replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well we'd better get up and get ready for school. We don't want to miss the school bus after all.\" Lisa said then she began to walk out of the room. Bart shrugged and began getting dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa arrived back in her own room and looked at the book again. She wondered what to do with it. Maybe she could take it to school, maybe she should try again to make herself taller but this time choose her words more carefully.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa thought about what to do then decides to write...</div></span></div></div>",

They didn't pay much attention to Lisa as Homer was too busy eating and Bart had his back to her but as Marge turned to Lisa to ask her if she slept well she gasped and froze on shock.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"LISA! What happened to you? You\u2019re taller than Bart!\" Marge exclaimed causing both Bart and Homer to drop their spoons and Bart to spit his breakfast out. Bart just looked at Lisa who put her hands behind her back and twisted her heel before shouting: \"NO WAY! Mom! Lisa's taller than me!\" as if Lisa was actually doing something as opposed to something about her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I..I..Bart finish your breakfast!\" Marge said almost instinctively, not really being able to think of anything else to say as she was so surprised at her daughters sudden \"growth spurt\". Bart goes back to eating his breakfast muttering to himself clearly not happy. Homer just shrugs his shoulders and resumes hoovering his cereal into his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa decided to speak up at this point. \"Well mom, I guess I had a growth spurt..\" she said nervously while Bart said \"bullspit\" under his breath but loud enough so that Marge heard it. Lisa just laughed nervously knowing that Bart who had seen her previously upstairs realised that she couldn't have grown overnight as he had just seen her today at her normal height. Too bad the book doesn't change reality thought Lisa. Well maybe it can but you have to actually specify that it changes she realised. Marge meanwhile put her hand on Lisa's shoulder and asked if she was okay. Lisa nodded and said she didn't feel sick or ill so Marge just gave Lisa her breakfast and decided to send her too school with Bart.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa was relieved that Marge didn't make more of a fuss or take her to see the doctor. Not that the doctor could tell Marge how Lisa grew but maybe just that it wasn't natural and that would only worry her.

Lisa immediately noticed how her legs where now to large they permanently touched and as she rubbed her blobby belly she noticed that her fingers which had been chubby before had now taken on an exaggerated fat shape although somehow she was still able to bend them. Next her hands flew to her face where she found a double chin and podgy hamster like cheeks, as Lisa removed her hands from her face she inadvertently placed them on something unexpected. Her chest which had become larger and puffier along with the rest of her body now bore no resemblance to the flat featureless area it had once been. Finally Lisa's probing hands headed behind her and connected with her butt a lot earlier than she would normally expect to, Lisa groaned and guessed that her butt must now be several times the size it previously was. Having overcome her initial shock and surprise Lisa now all so noticed that her cloths, underwear, sandals and necklace had all grown with her and still fitted her perfectly or as well as they could for a girl her size anyway.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly it hit Lisa. Why did she gain all this weight anyway? She asked to be bigger not..fatter..D'oh! Lisa realised straight away that her request was too vague and obviously the magic book chose to interpret \"bigger\" to mean fatter and heavier. Not entirely unreasonable but not what she had originally intended all the same. \"Well I guess now I know I should be a *lot* more careful on how I word my writing in this book. After all if I'm not careful something terrible could happen.\" Lisa said more to herself than anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa then began to waddle across her room to her bedroom mirror and examined her body in the mirror. At first she found it funny and she estimated that she must weigh more than any child she'd ever seen at school or in Springfield. Then she started to examine herself critically, on the one hand she did look very cute like this but she was fat! Although at least if she stayed like this she could stop worrying about her weight which was a source of stress for her. Then again what would her family say? What would her mom and dad say? Of course with the book if she wanted she could make it so everyone thought she had always been like this. Heck if she wanted she could change the world so *everyone* was obese like she had become and no one would notice any difference. Then Lisa remembered her original intention with her first use of the magic book which was to make herself taller than her brother. But then what if the book just made Bart shorter instead of making her taller. Damn. Why did this have to be so complicated? Lisa thought about it and decided to focus on what to do about her weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually Lisa decided that...</div></span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span><div align=\"left\">Lisa waddled over to her bedroom door and shut it then she headed for her bed and climbed up onto it heaving herself up in the process. She lay down and began to think seriously about what to do next with the book. Specifically she was concerned with her current weight and if it was a good idea to stay like this. On the one hand unless she changed everyone so they where fat then she'd get teased for being this size but then she'd been teased at school about her weight or her butt before. At least at this size it wouldn't be something she had to worry about any more, after at Lisa's current size all the dieting and exercising in the world wouldn't make her thin and popular. That was the second major thing, she'd never really been a popular kid. Her brother often was for being the class clown but Lisa was mostly quite and well behaved. In addition many of the other kids found her enthusiasm for learning and school in general to be unsettling and uncool. There where no health concerns for even if Lisa did have health problems which with the magic book she would not unless she asked for them or the book somehow backfired. There where some positive reasons for staying at her current weight and appearance as well, Lisa often wanted to eat sweet things like desserts or sweets but found that she left a lot of it or didn't eat it because of concern about her diet. Those concerns would be very much irrelevant if she remained at the weight she was now, in fact surely she'd need to eat more because of the energy she'd use getting around. Her brother might make fun of her but Lisa dismissed this as she could always get back at him for it using the book or maybe even change Bart so he didn't make fun of her. The only thing that slightly worried Lisa is that she'd probably be bad at sports but apart from hockey and gymnastics she was fairly bad at sports anyway even before she magically gained all this weight.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa thought about it and quickly decided that she was going to stay fat and not use the book to slim down again. After all why bother? Unless she lost the book nothing could really go wrong and as long as she had it she could always change herself back to the old thin Lisa. Having made her mental decision Lisa heaving herself up from her bed and climbed down onto the floor before waddling across her room and examining herself in the mirror again. She had to admit there was still a certain comical novelty to seeing herself like this, she laughed quietly and said to herself. \"Well I guess now I know I'm never going to be really popular or good at sports..unless I change back.\" Then Lisa made a surprised face as having resolved one issue she suddenly remembered another. The entire reason that she'd become so fat in the first place was her vague wording of a sentence she wrote in the magic book about her being \"bigger\" than Bart. To be honest with all that had happened Lisa had forgot what she really meant by \"bigger\". She thought she must have intended to be older or maybe taller than her brother rather than much fatter but now Lisa realised that you had to word you writing in the book clearly and carefully in order to avoid mistakes or backfires.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout further delay Lisa waddled over to her desk again sat down carefully on her kneeling chair so as not to fall off and began to write in the book again. This time she wrote that reality would change so that the everyone including her family would think she had always been the size the was now and that her possessions, cloths and room would change as well to accommodate her. As soon as Lisa finished writing reality began to shift and no one remembered Lisa as the thin little girl she used to be only the obese child she had now become thanks to the books magic. Lisa immediately noticed that her desk and seat where now bigger as if designed or purchased for someone larger and her bed was bigger to. She got up and waddled over to her closet where she found her normal cloths except they where in a huge size that actually fit her now. Lisa now waddles back over to the desk and wonders what she should do next with the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa eventually decides to...</div></span></div></div>",

She sat down on her kneeling stool and picked up a pencil so she could write in the book. Lisa wrote down in the book that she would become the older sibling while her bratty brother Bart would become the youngest and her little sister Maggie would become the middle child. In addition Lisa wrote the reality would change to reflect this and no one except for her would remember anything different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa wanted to do this because she wanted a sister close to her age to play with and keep her company and because she was sick of Bart teasing her, bullying her and playing pranks on her because he was the oldest. Well now one way or another Bart was going to become a little baby. I guess he should have been nicer to his sister for all those years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Bart's room Bart was sitting on his bed reading a \"Radioactive Man\" comic book with a Squishee sitting on his bedside table. All of a sudden Bart began to feel funny. He put down the comic and began to shrink. At first he thought he was getting smaller and just shrinking but he soon realised from his proportions and the way he felt that he was rapidly regressing in age as books magic took full effect. Soon Bart had become a five-year-old and his cloths had shrunk to fit him but as Bart gasped he continued getting younger soon becoming a toddler wearing a red shirt and blue overalls. Bart was speechless as he finally stopped regressing after becoming a baby around the same age Maggie would normally be. His cloths changed into a diaper and a pacifier appeared in his mouth as Bart noticed how much baby fat he had at this age. That didn't last long though as Bart's mind began to change, he forgot everything he learned since he was two including school, potty training, skateboarding etc but he still knew how to walk and talk although as a baby would not a ten year old. Mostly Bart did not remember ever being ten as his room changed as well to fit his new baby self, the comic disappeared and all his toys turned into baby toys and stuffed animals. His bed became a crib, the Squishee turned into a bottle of milk for a baby and his desk became a changing table with fresh diapers and a diaper bin next to it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo the change was done at least for Bart. He was a baby now and the youngest newest addition to the Simpson family but what about Maggie and Lisa?</div></span></div></div>",

Maggie in her room began to age from a baby into a three-year-old, her room changed a bit but not much. Some of the toys changed, some of the posters changed but mainly her crib became a bed. Instead of wearing her usual blue baby grow Maggie's cloths now became a blue set of overalls with a blue shirt while her diaper became training pants. At first Maggie wondered what had happened but of course soon her mind changed to that of a three year old and she never remembered being younger. Maggie played with her toys happily oblivious to the fact she had aged by over a year.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIf only Lisa was that happy. In Lisa's room she was still in shock at being turned into a five-year-old and because she wrote it in the book she remembered that she used to be eight as well. Lisa put the pencil down and got off her kneeling stool then she waddled over to the mirror and examined herself. In the mirror instead of an obese ten or eight year old Lisa saw a five year old girl who was every bit as fat as Lisa had been as an eight year old although as she was smaller and younger now she weighed less. It was not weight that concerned Lisa though it was age. \"Wow look how young I've become.\" Lisa said to herself as she looked at herself in the mirror and noticed that although she still had her sandals, red dress and necklace she had clearly lost a lot of age, height and weight. Lisa realised she must be in kindergarten and when she looked around at her room everything confirmed that, it was just as her room had been when she was that age the first time. She noticed that she still had her saxophone but then she did get that even earlier in her life so it should still be here. Then a scary thought occurred to Lisa, if reality changed to reflect that she was five then did she still have the book? Surely as a five-year-old she wasn't allowed to go bike riding on her own which is how she had found the book in the first place.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa spun around and moved as fast as possible towards her desk where the noticed that...</div></span></div></div>",

Her thoughts kept coming back to a dream she occasionally had where she was super-strong, a pumped-up pint-size powerhouse who ran around punching out criminals and lifting national monuments with only one hand. The idea of possessing such strength in real life tickled her fancy. She was always being mocked for her intelligence, but who'd dare mess with a girl who could hurl you into space? She opened the magic book and wrote: <i>\"I wish I had superhuman strength.\"</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe magic went into effect the instant Lisa dotted the period. A rush of energy raced throughout her entire body. Grinning from ear to ear, Lisa flexed an arm and felt the power flowing through it. To her mild surprise, the flex also brought a slight bicep to the surface. The surprise she felt became considerably less mild when the bicep, along with the other muscles in her arm, began to rapidly expand! Her other arm followed suit, inflating with massive amounts of muscle. Her pectorals \u2014 <i>Great Buddha, I have PECS!</i>, Lisa thought in astonishment \u2014 expanded as well.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe growth process finished in less than a minute. Wanting to get a better look at her new self, Lisa hopped off the bed and headed for the mirror hanging on her closet door. Her eyes went wide at the sight of her reflection: She was immense! Her upper body was about three times as wide as before, with colossal arms that tapered down to the same little hands she always had. Even though she hadn't grown a single inch, she would most definitely describe herself as huge. She was even bigger than she was in her dream!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nUpon further observation, Lisa noted that despite the inhuman amount of muscle she now possessed, it wasn't the kind of hard, ripped muscle like her mother had had during her brief bodybuilding stint. The usual bulges of deltoids and biceps were clearly visible, but the bulges were gentle and smooth. Lisa smiled and flexed her cannonball-sized biceps. \"Not bad at all,\" she said aloud, pleased. A loud rip suddenly brought her attention to the fact that her dress was not designed to handle such musculature. Turning partway around, she saw in the mirror that a large tear reached halfway down her broad back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa groaned. She wanted to go out and test her strength, but not at the expense of public decency laws. She needed a change in wardrobe...</span></div></div>",

The fabric of her dress seemed to come to life, the top surging upward and over her massive shoulders as the hemline wrapped itself around her legs. She could feel the tear mend itself as back and front met, finishing the transformation from overly tight dress to comfortably snug, sleeveless leotard. A pair of skintight leggings sprouted from underneath the leotard, and stopped at about the length of a pair of shorts. A vertical blue stripe appeared in the center of the red outfit, widening to about a third of the width of Lisa's waistline. Blue gloves and boots, sporting a red trim, appeared on her hands and feet, and a stylized 'L' that appeared on her chest topped off the costume.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTurning back to the mirror, Lisa quickly eyeballed her new outfit. She had to admit, she looked pretty darn good. She also noticed for the first time that her legs had become noticeably more muscular, though not to the extremes of her upper body. Pleased with her appearance, she left her room and crept down the stairs. She had prolonged the test of her powers long enough, and she didn't want to forestall it any longer to explain her new physique to the family. Nevertheless, she was only halfway to the door when she heard a gasp from behind her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"<i>Lisa?!</i>\"</span></div></div>",

Once there he just about managed to waddle to the TV, which he just managed to turn on before his body expanded so much he couldn't reach any more. Lisa again watched from the hall doorway as Bart still gaining and bloating waddled ponderously to the couch and pulled himself up onto it where he continued expanding in every direction until he was about Homer's height but MUCH fatter and wider. Lisa giggled as she saw her brother fatten into a big bloated blimp right in front of her. \"Now lets see him play pranks on everyone and cause mischief.\" Lisa thought to herself as Bart carried on expanding until he was...</span></div></div>",

By now he was quite a sight with his shorts, shoes and shirt which had all grown with him stretched over his huge rounded bloated body which had fallen off the couch due to its sheer size and expanded across the better part of the TV room. Bart groaned and wiggled his now utterly useless hands and feet but all this did was cause his body to jiggle and move slightly. Lisa smiled then decided that it might be a good idea to move her brother since he was so large and right in front of the houses main front windows. She dashed upstairs, opened her desk draw, took out the magic book then wrote in some things about the house being bigger and Bart's room changing so it could accommodate a child his size. As soon as she finished the sentence everything changed, the house was bigger, with wider doorways, reinforced stairs and Bart's room although it still had all his toys, games and posters etc had become much larger as had his bed and cloths. Next Lisa decided to move Bart upstairs to his room for the moment so he could relax away from prying eyes while he got the gas out of his system. After she moved him she decided to make Bart ten again since she figured expanding Bart was her revenge so it didn't matter if he was or wasn't the oldest any more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart in his room began to expand again just getting bigger this time not fatter or more inflated. He lay on his bed swelling almost in a trance as he reached ten years old again he was now about twice his previous size and still just as fat and bloated. \"Aye carmuba\" Bart moaned as Lisa put down her pen and thought about what to do next.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat did Lisa choose to do?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Lisa thought about what it was possible to do with the magic book and then about all the times Bart had misbehaved and played pranks on her and other members of their family. Up to now her transformation of her brother had been unintentional or merely a response to his overly childish behaviour, more of a reaction than anything. Now however Lisa was starting to quickly see the true potential of this book, no longer would she have to put up with being bullied at school, or put up with unwanted attention from Milhouse or other boys she didn't like. Most of all she wouldn't have to put up with the antics of her bratty brother either although she obviously didn't intend on keeping him in his current state on a permanent basis. Still. Lisa couldn't help but think of all the ways Bart could be pranked or punished using the book and her certainly deserved it for the way he treated everyone especially her. It was bad enough that her brother was hyperactive, loud and non too bright but half the time he didn't even act like an older brother more of a bully than anything really. Well now Lisa realised she had an edge, one that Bart couldn't mach no matter how cunning his ideas or pranks. This suited her perfectly, Lisa always regarded herself as the morally and intellectually superior Simpson so it was only right that she had control of this powerful book. Now if her annoying brother got on her bad side then he'd soon discover that her overachieving mind was capable of coming up with far more than just the answers to math problems or test questions. Lisa put her imagination to work on ways she could torment or humiliate Bart using the books powers and soon some distinct possibilities began to stick out. One was shrinking Bart, this had obvious appeal, it put Bart in his place and it gave Lisa power over him. Another was changing him into an object for a while, maybe for once her brother would be some use to her instead of him taking advantage of her abilities. Lisa considered inflating Bart as well, maybe just with gas this time, she imagined the fun she could have with him all blown up.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa soon decided what to do and that was...</span></div></div>",

His upper body inflated as the fingers on his hands merged into one and he continued to inflated until he was a rubbery punch doll. Lisa walked over to the bed picked Bart up then put him on the floor, she smiled suppressing a giggle with her hand as Bart rocked backwards and forwards unable to do anything else now.

Bart carried on eating the muffin until he had finished it then as he reached for another one he noticed that his hand and arm had turned a dark blue colour. \"What the? Hey! What's going on! I'm blue!\" Bart asked confused about why he'd be suddenly blue instead of yellow. Just then Bart began to feel strange and his stomach rumbled causing him to put his hands on his belly. \"Uh, Lisa what did you do?\" Correctly guessing that his sister somehow had something to do with this bizarre occurrence. \"Me? I don't know what your talking about Bart. Hey, why are you blue anyway?\" Lisa replied pretending that she had no idea what was happening. Of course Lisa knew exactly what was happening and what was about to happen which was what made the situation so delicious. Bart got up from the table ignoring the muffins piled up on the plate and tried to walk towards the exit to the hallway. However Bart had already started to inflate and only got a few steps before he had to stop then he looked down and saw his tummy inflating under his orange shirt. \"Aye carumba!\" Bart yelled even more surprised than he had been when the changed colour earlier. Lisa just giggled and walked around Bart in circles which quickly started to irritate him but he had bigger problems as his entire body joined in with his inflation. Soon Bart became a big blue sphere who's feet didn't touch the ground and only his hands, feet and head were visible to prove he wasn't just a giant blueberry wearing his clothes. Bart was utterly helpless and could do nothing but what did Lisa decide to do?</span></div></div>",

After all she'd have a better chance of writing in the book correctly to turn them back and Bart was worried if he tried it again he'd mess up and something even worse would happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe/she didn't have long to think about it though as Lisa in his old body was clearly getting impatient. Did he tell Lisa what was really going on and ask for her help writing in the book to reverse the change?</div></span></div></div>",

Heh I wonder if anything happened to them.\" Said Lisa in Bart's body then grabbed Bart's hand and led her old body out of the room and towards the stairs. Bart followed mostly voluntarily he figured that the best thing to do for the moment was play along and act surprised at swapping bodies with his sister.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the body swapped kids arrived downstairs and headed into the kitchen where Marge and Maggie where. There was no sign of Homer though. Lisa and Bart both started to talk at once then Marge turned around and said \"Heh heh heh. One at a time. What's all this fuss about anyway?\" Lisa spoke up although Marge thought it was Bart for obvious reasons. \"Mom..I don't quite know how to put this but..Bart and I? Marge frowns then interrupts saying. \"What do you mean \"Bart and I?\" you *are* Bart.\" Lisa then continues \"Well that's the thing, I'm actually Lisa. Bart's over there.\" Lisa points to her old body and Bart nods. At first Marge thinks this is some kind of prank. \"Honestly Lisa, I mean I expected this kind of prank from Bart but I never thought you'd be involved in something so silly and mean.\" Bart then looks annoyed saying \"No. I'm Bart. She's Lisa in my body. This isn't a prank mom. This is real.\" Marge still looks unconvinced although she is starting to look worried. She is about to say something when Bart finally snaps, pulls up her dress, yanks down her panties and shows Marge her butt. Marge gasps as Bart says \"Heh would your precious goody two shoes Lisa do this? See? I told you this wasn't a prank.\" Marge begins to realise they really have switched as Lisa reacts in Bart's body by blushing and laughing nervously. \"Oh my poor babies. What happened to you? AND BART STOP THAT! Stop waving your sisters butt about!\" Marge said then realised how weird that sounded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart pulls her panties up and smoothes out her dress as Marge begins to ask the kids how this happened. They both say they just passed out suddenly Bart taking care not to mention the magic book. Marge decides to take them to see Dr Hibbert, at first he thinks it's a joke but then they tell him some embarrassing medical thing that they didn't tell one another and he realises they really have been switched. Apart from switching bodies though they seem fine.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon they arrive back home and Marge begins mothering them but for Bart this is inconvenient as he wants to go to his room alone and try to correct this whole body swapping mess. Or does he? Maybe they should stay like this for a while. After all it wasn't nearly as bad as Bart had imagined being a girl or maybe being a girl was effecting his mind. But surely it couldn't hurt to stay switched just for a few days or a week could it? Bart was curious but he really kinda wanted to undo this mistake he'd made with the book.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBart decided he would...</div></span></div></div>",

He decided that he would not use the book to switch back with his sister just yet. After all this was an interesting and unique opportunity to get to see life from a girls point of view so why not explore it for a while. If anything happened and he wanted to change back he could do it so long as he still had the book which he did.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Marge had finished making a fuss of her children and now wanted to say something important too them. Bart could tell from the look on her face. \"Er..kids..\" Marge began \"Listen I think you should probably not tell anyone about Bart being Lisa and Lisa being Bart if you know what I mean. Dr Hibbert won't tell anyone because he's a doctor and they aren't allowed to tell people about your medical problems unless you break the law. I'm pretty sure there's no law against body swapping though so we're in the clear but other people might think your a bit..\" Marge struggled to sugar coat it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Crazy?\" Bart interrupted and Marge nodded. \"Well I just think that you should try really hard to pretend that your still each other for the time being. I guess if this doesn't change then maybe we'll have to start calling you by your real names. Uh. This is all so crazy. It's just better this way right now kids. Trust me ok.\" Both the kids nods and make affirmation noises but then Lisa speaks up. \"Heh wait a minute, Bart can't play saxophone. What if someone wants him to play my sax?\" Marge thinks about it then says \"Well we'll just say you lost it or it got destroyed like your first one. I think lost would be better. After all they can't make us buy another or force you to play if you don't want to.\" Lisa then replies \"Fine. But what about grades? Bart isn't exactly..well..you know..he doesn't get good grades like I do.\" Bart interrupts looking smug \"Yeah but Lisa aren't you forgetting what happened that time we where both in third grade? I already know all the answers from 2nd grade. They don't change it you know.\" He says. \"Phew. That's luck. But I'm not sure if I'm up to acting like Bart. I mean I'm not a class clown or a prankster.\" Bart shrugs. \"Eh well. I guess you don't *have* to do that stuff. They'll probably just think I've finally straitened up started being good. But try not to get lots of A's and B's Lis. They'll probably think your cheating.\" Marge stands up and smiles. \"So it's settled then. We'll just keep this in the family and not tell anyone else for the time being.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMarge goes off to do housework and the kids flip on the TV and begin watching cartoons.

Bart begins looking around the room, it's full of Malibu Stacy toys and accessories and books. Bart notices Lisa's sax and takes it and puts it away in her closet, after all if it's supposed to be lost no sense in leaving it out where someone else might see it. Bart then looks at his sisters bookshelf. \"Man. My sister is such a nerd. I guess I'm gonna have to go get my own comics from my old room..\" Bart says to himself and just as he is leaving he meets Lisa in the doorway. \"Oh. I guess you want one of your books or your diary or something.\" He says still slightly weirded out that he is looking at what used to be his body although he knows it's Lisa. She nods and says \"You might as well go get your radioactive man comics I guess. But don't take them to school Bart, it'd look suspicious if \"I\" started reading boys comics.\" Bart nods and begins to realise that this is going to be harder than he thought pretending to be one another, sure on paper it's easy but his natural inclinations and interests go against what he must do in order to avoid being found out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo Bart and Lisa both exchange books and comics from their rooms. Then they realise they have to do each others homework. For Bart it is effortless because he's been in 2nd grade before and knows the answers but Lisa actually found Bart's homework more of a challenge than her usual 2nd grade stuff.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSome time later Marge calls the kids down for dinner they both come down to see Homer and Maggie already eating and Marge shepherds them to their chairs. They sit down and straight away Lisa is looking at her meal dubiously. \"Mom. I know I'm in Bart's body at the moment but that doesn't mean I want to eat meat!\" Lisa says to which Marge responds \"I don't know how long your going to be like this but I have to believe it isn't forever and when you switch back I don't want either of you to have eaten a strange diet that might harm your bodies. Bart's used to eating meat and he needs it just as much as Bart in your body won't be eating meat as it'd probably make you ill. Oh and no overeating and making the others body fat, that goes for snacks too. If you gain weight I'll make you work it off before you switch back.\" Lisa just looks at Marge then at the food and says \"Yes mom.\" realising that arguing is pointless. Oh well Marge is probably right, she thinks. It did make sense to eat the same food that their bodies normally ate even if they didn't like it. Marge's little threat about weight gain would probably stop Bart making her body fat which it would almost certainly occur to him to do sooner or later as a prank.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe rest of the evening was uneventful. They finished dinner, watched TV together and then go to bed. The next day the kids have to go to school and it's the first test of them passing themselves off as the other. Did it go well or did it go badly?</div></span></div></div>",

He walks across the room until he catches sight of himself in Lisa's mirror which causes him to become fully awake and scream. Then he stops when he remembers what happened and that he is supposed to still be in his sisters body. Then he hears some running footsteps and Lisa in Bart's body opens the door and runs into the room. \"Bart! What's wrong! Did something happen? Did you change again?\" She asks. Bart looks somewhat annoyed and says. \"No! I just..forgot for a second when I was getting out of bed. I'm fine. I guess. Well I'm not fine, I'm you. But you get the idea. No change.\" Lisa merely says. \"I see.\" Then backs out of the room and goes to get dressed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThey both get dressed in the cloths that match their bodies and then go downstairs for breakfast. Later at the breakfast table they are both eating the breakfasts that they would normally eat if they hadn't been body swapped but Homer and Marge notice that they look a little down and nervous. Homer looks at Marge who coughs and then he says. \"Look kids, I know this is weird. Like something out of some crappy movie staring Pauly Shaw but just remember that no one knows except for us and Dr Hibbert and he can't tell anyone because of his hippopotamus oath.\" Marge and Lisa look at Homer disbelieving that he thinks doctors take an oath based on a large African water mammal. Homer continues. \"So anyway the main thing is don't tell anyone and for gods sake don't watch anything by Ron Howard or that jerk who ruined the Terminator series.\" Lisa and Bart look at each other, Bart speaks. \"I guess that's the only advice we're going to get.\" He says and Lisa replies. \"That's creepy Bart, that's what I would have said.\" Before anyone can say anything else Marge points out the time and tells them to finish up so they don't miss the bus.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPretty soon the bus comes and the kids get on with the school bags and coats. Otto had only had three blunts the night before so his driving was actually pretty good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOtto runs down Hans Moleman while he is cross the road and throws him into the gutter. Nelson points out the window and says \"HA HA!\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWell his driving was ok. Not great but ok. Soon the school bus pulls up at the school and the kids get off wondering how Otto managed to avoid a more serious accident. \"Well Lisa are you ready for another day at good old Springfield Elementary?\" Lisa says to Bart pretending to be Bart who responds. \"Of course I am! What could be better than another day of school!\" The kids head to their lockers and as Bart is closing his locker Milhouse is suddenly there on the other side of the door. \"Oh hi. Milhouse, how\u2019s it going?\" Milhouse looks a bit surprised by the casual tone but replies. \"Uh ok I guess. So..um..do you wanna hang out at recess?\" Bart looks surprised at first but then remembers how much his friend likes Lisa. \"Well, I don't know Milhouse. We'll see.\" Bart says then smiles at Milhouse and walks off to Ms Hoover's class. Milhouse heads to Mrs Krabapple's class where Lisa is although of course he thinks it's Bart like everyone else, ironically he gets to sit next to Lisa in class without ever realising it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile Bart arrives in the 2nd grade class with Ralph, Ms Hoover and the other kids. What happens in class?</div></span></div></div>",

So far so good.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMs Hoover then began the lesson which was about early American history. Bart managed to answer quite a few questions mainly because she had been in second grade before and the questions on tests and topics didn't change so she already knew in advance what she would be asked. Towards the end of the class Ms Hoover actually asked \"Ok. Anyone *other* than Lisa Simpson?\" when Bart put her hand up yet again. Bart made sure to put her hand down and giggle nervously as that's what her sister would probably do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon the lesson was over and while Bart wasn't exactly enjoying it but at least it was a nice change from being the class clown. She wondered how Lisa was doing. I hope she doesn't get found out, she thought knowing that she would be exposed as well and her family would probably get into trouble as well. Bart filed from the classroom with the other kids and headed off to recess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThen she heard someone saying \"Heh, Lisa!\" Bart turned around and saw...</div></span></div></div>",

She turned around and sure enough looked into the eyes of Lisa who was of course still in her old body like she was in his. Man this was confusing. \"So uh..how is it going Lisa.\" Lisa asked and Bart replied \"Good I guess, how about you?\" Lisa shrugs then says. \"Well I guess Mrs Krabappel thought I was a little quite and well behaved but I don't think she suspects anything yet. I just hope we can find some way to fix this before someone finds out about it. It could get really awkward.\" Lisa says quietly. \"Yeah I guess. But hopefully everything will work out.\" Bart said trying to be optimistic. \"Er..I think we should probably go play with out friends now. After all if we hang out a lot together at school it might make people suspicious.\" Lisa said realising that mostly they played with different people so if they where going to act \"normal\" then that's what they needed to do. Bart and Lisa go off and play with the friends of the sibling they are in the body of during the rest of recess. Lisa was glad she had spent some time pretending to be a boy as \"Jake Boyman\", this allowed her to fit in and play their games quite well. Bart on the other hand had a little difficulty in getting used to skipping and hopscotch that the girls played, fortunately she was good enough not to arouse any suspicion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSoon recess was over and the children go back to class. Bart again managed to do well but then this was expected from Lisa so that was fine, she was actually starting to enjoy it just a little bit. It made her wonder how Lisa felt about school and when she was at school but then that was a no brainier, her sister loved school except for maybe some things like animal dissection in science and that time they'd tried to teach the kids creationism. Bart all so noticed that Ms Hoover wasn't exactly the most enthusiastic teacher which is something Lisa had mentioned before. The class eventually ended and the kids filed out into the corridor then headed to the cafeteria for lunch. Bart noticed that people didn't push or shove him as much now she was a girl. She noticed the cafeteria food tasted even worse than normal. I guess Lisa has a more sensitive sense of taste than I do thought Bart. It was probably true, Bart didn't bother that much about what she ate so much as when and how much. She managed to talk to Lisa in her old body briefly and she was doing fine but the only problem was that they had gym after lunch and one of them had to do something they didn't like.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat was it?</div></span></div></div>",

Lisa then placed the naked toddler on the empty changing table and quickly diapered him. Afterwards Homer stood up on the table and admired his crinkly attire with a happy smile. \"Mmmm...I love diapers\" he sighed feeling the front of his diaper with his hand, enjoying the crinkly sounds it made. He was so relaxed that he let out a muffled fart as he started to poop in his diaper, a large bulge forming in the back. \"Lisa I made a boom boom in my pants\" Homer said holding the back of his full padding with both hands while swaying from side to side and looking up at Lisa with a cute smile.

Maggie grew a pair of razor sharp teeth from the top of her gums that looked deadly enough to cut a person open. Lisa yelled in pain as soon as Maggie's teeth dug into the veins within her neck. She felt as if Maggie was sucking life out of her body and into her mouth. After a few moments, however, Lisa realized it wasn't her life energies that was being taken away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLisa felt that everything around her was getting bigger.

The nerve response of the bite caused Marge to trip onto the floor.<br>\r\nThe two of them then started to glow. Maggie's teeth proceeded to literally suck out Marge's age. Maggie quickly enlarged into a teenager, then a young adult while Marge shrunk. A few seconds later, Maggie freed her teeth from the depths of Marge's body.

She notices Stewie and speaks to him. \"Heh Stewie, you looking for mommy? What have you got there? A new toy?\" Lois asks thinking the ray gun is a toy as Stewie did construct it to look a lot like one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha! You wish! Now take this!\" Stewie responds before firing the ray at Lois who begins to transform becoming different people for a moment before switching to another person. She becomes most of the reoccurring characters from the show both male and female and some other people like political figures and actors. Stewie is enjoying this so he keeps firing the ray at her and Lois keeps transforming until he stops firing the ray then adjusts it and fires it again before Lois has chance to do or say anything.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat sort of change happened to Lois now?</div></span></div></div>",

This is an interactive dedicated to the transformation of characters from the Simpson's. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTF's can include but are not limited too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nExpansion.(WG, INF, ect.)<br>\r\nSize.(Shrink/Grow.)<br>\r\nAge.(AR/AP.)<br>\r\nInanimate.(Object TF.)<br>\r\nTG.<br>\r\nAnimal.<br>\r\nClothes.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nMost types of TF are allowed but there are a few rules.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNo killing characters.<br>\r\nNo sex/no vore.<br>\r\nNew chapters must add to the story and advance the plot in some way. One or two line chapters will be edited or removed unless they are extra options that could not fit in a previous chapter due to the limited number of choices allowed in an interactive on this site.<br>\r\nNew chapters must have at least something to do with the option that they where added too. No spam please.<br>\r\nPlease make an effort to actually describe what's going on rather than just saying \"Something happened, then something else happened. Then this happened.\" This is especially true for the transformations themselves, after all that's part of what makes an interactive great seeing other peoples takes on various TF's. No ending chapters without a good reason. If your going to put an end in the story be sure to tie up all or at least most of the loose ends before you do. Seriously, if it's an end let it be a natural end to the story arc not just BANG! END! For no reason.<br>\r\nLimited swearing please. Please keep to the age rating.<br>\r\nOther than that pretty much anything goes, so what are you waiting for? Get in there and transform some Simpson's!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNote: Most of the threads have a defined plot but the last thread the \"Random/Freestyle halloween story thread\" is for ad libbing/meandering/random story's that don't fit into the first nine threads. If you want to do something random but still Simpson's TF related please do it here not in the threads that have a defined plot that is going somewhere.</div></td>",
