Oh and don't forget, your rough drafts of your research papers are due next week! Don't procrastinate, or you'll forever risk a passing grade!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis couldn't care less about what Mr. Warnicke had to say, in fact, he couldn't care less about what a lot of people at North Jefferson High School had to say. All he cared about was that the school day was over, and he survived another week in spite of the seven agonizing hours a day of lecture. That last bell brought him bliss, as it meant he was no longer forced to sit around and be in the presence of douchey jocks, socially unaware nerds, and girls who're way too into themselves. See at North Jefferson High, there was seemingly no middle ground amongst the cliques; you have to fit in somewhere, except Travis didn't. He wasn't smart, wasn't athletic, wasn't rich, wasn't handsome, wasn't a lot of things, and that's the exact reason he hated school. He didn't hate the nerds because of what they were into; he hated them because he couldn't see himself hanging around them. He more so hated the fact that he could never bring himself to be a nerd, because that's just not who he was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis is a bit of an interesting kid. Since he's a bit of an outcast, he spends lots of time at home, which in turn makes him a creature of habit. He wakes up at the same time every day, eats the same breakfast every day, goes to the same classes every day, and does the same thing every night: plays <i>Fortnite</i> duos with his only friend Diego until about 11, lies about being tired so he can log off, masturbates to pretty girls' Instagrams, surfs 4chan, and then actually falls asleep. It's an enjoyable life for a 17 year old, but it could use a little life. The only problem is that it's senior year and the friend groups are well-established. There's no shot he's getting invited to anywhere now since nobody really wants to adopt him into their group. Since college is right around the corner though Travis doesn't sweat it too much, and knows that in a few months he can finally seize the opportunity to make some friends. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Trav, you doing okay?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh yeah, kind of just dozed off there for a second...\" replied Travis, caught off guard by his friend Diego.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Let's bounce already dude, I'm trying to get the fuck out of here as quick as we can. No reason to stick around,\" said Diego, clearly eager to go home.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Couldn't have said it better myself man,\" as Travis daps up Deigo. \"C'mon, I parked out the backside of school.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two seniors walk through campus, watching all the different friend groups interact on this Friday afternoon.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Broooo I wish we got that in to the party tonight!\" said Diego. He was clearly in the loop more than Travis was. \"Tori gonna be there which means Vanessa too which means we both could've gone to bone town!\" he rambled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah, cuz Tori and Vanessa know we even exist. C'mon dude, even if we did somehow get in, you know we wouldn't have even made eye contact with them let alone held a conversation\" explained Travis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean shit, you right, but you ain't gotta bust my dreams like that!\" replied Diego.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sorry man, I'm just trying to keep it real. Neither of us ever gonna be able to touch Tori or Vanessa. We just gotta wait till we find new babes in college.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...yeah... I hope you're right\" Diego muttered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis unlocked the car and both boys got in, unaware that this would be the day that their lives would change forever...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhile making the easy drive home, Travis ran into an unusual road closure that of course was normally never there. As he got closer and closer, he noticed the men standing by the cones pick them up, and wave the two through. Not thinking much of it, Travis proceeded his normal route, hitting nothing but green lights as there were seemingly no other cars in the vicinity.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Look man! Maybe this is a sign! Nothing but green lights, no traffic! I'm telling you, We're gonna get into this par---\" as Diego was cut off by a deafening crunch. The two boys were T-boned, but not by any ordinary car. It was a total set-up...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where am I...\" Travis thought to himself as he awakened. \"Jesus Christ my head hurts...\" Just then he heard what sounded like a voice come on over a speaker in the room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Mr. Brown and welcome to Dynamo Operations. Don't be alarmed. You are not dead. You are not even injured,\" the computerized, almost Siri-like voice said to him. \"You and your friend are merely our subjects for experimentation. An experiment that may change the world was we know it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck you mean I'm not injured? Where's Diego!? Where am I!?\" yelled Travis rather frantically.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWithout even addressing his concerns, the computer responded. \"Atop the desk you will notice a suit Mr. Brown. Please put the suit on and we can begin the Instantaneous Astral Projection Experiment.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis heard astral projection and his mood immediately changed from anger to one of bewilderment. He was an avid student of the topic, and tried with all his might to astral project, just to explore the possibilities, but come morning, nothing ever happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha Ha, very funny,\" he said is disbelief, \"I'm dreaming aren't I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The system detects that the suit has not been removed from the desk. Please put the suit on and we can begin the Instantaneous Astral Projection Experiment\" the speaker repeated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohohohoh okay, whatever you say Siri\" he mocked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis approached the desk and grabbed the folded suit from the desk. Upon first touching the suit he felt a static shock, but nothing more, and began to unravel it. To his surprise, the suit was very superhero looking, definitely not what he was expecting. It looked to be custom tailored, which drew even more curiosity out of him, and upon putting it on noticed that his observations were correct; the suit fit like a glove.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, what the hell kind of costume is this? I look like Danny Phantom!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you Mr. Brown. We selected you out of thousands of subjects, and believe that you are the one who will best fulfill the suit's capabilities.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Capabilities? What do you mean capabilities? Hey, what did you just say?\" he tried to interject.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What this IAP Suit will do is put your terrestrial body to sleep and awaken your astral one. Once you are in your ethereal form, the possibilities are endless. You will float through the world Mr. Brown, with the ability to go anywhere as anyone. Enjoy your time, your body will be safe in our facility for as long as you'd like us to house it. Farewell for now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah wait! What do you mean go anywhere as anyone? Like I can do some insidious shit and take over people's bodies? You're just gonna tell me some shit like that with no instructions? Da fuck kind of lab is this?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith no response, Travis realized it was a lost cause. There was only one button on the suit so he decided to press it and see what happens. He felt a much stronger shock this time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"SHIT!\" he exclaimed. \"Okay I guess this isn't a dream. WAIT WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT MY BODY!?\" Travis peered down and saw his lifeless body now collapsed on the ground. \"Wait, what the fuck? Is this shit for real?\" The excitement in Travis hit a climax as all of his lifelong dreams had finally come true. He could finally astral project, meaning he could for once be free from his boring life. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where should I go from here?\" He thought to himself.   <br>\r\n      </span></div></div>",

His astral form flew straight towards a wall and braced for impact, only there wasn't one. \"Okay this is going to take some getting used to\" he chuckled. Travis flew from room to room until he finally found Diego's. He too was listening to the speaker's instructions, only his sounded notably different. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Medina, you are the chosen one for this experiment. We have equipped you with the IAP 5150, specially designed to hunt down those who abuse IAP technology. Your first task is a Mr. Travis Brown who's stolen one of our suits. His soul could be anywhere at this point, and the only way to defeat him is to defeat his soul. With your IAP 5150, you can do just that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes, whatever you say Dynamo\" Diego replied in a trance like state.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man what the fuck up with him, he about to try and kill my ass? And why did they say I 'stole' the suit? They're literally the ones who gave it to  me\" Travis said to himself. \"Man this some real fucked up shit.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis watched as Diego headed for the suit which looked notably more equipped than his own. Built in was a tracking system, possession detector, soul defibrillator, and of course the instant astral projection. Seeing that Diego's suit was seemingly built to destroy Travis, and that he was in a hypnotic state, he decided that it would be best to fly away, but not before listening to the final message from the speaker.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mr. Medina, the reason for your task is to eliminate deviance with IAP. The purpose of Dynamo Operations is to provide people with a different sort of 'vacation.' People love to travel correct? And do things they've never done before. But how about be people they've never been before? With this though comes great responsibility, and obviously many will deviate. We need people like you to ensure that nothing malicious happens to those who become unconsensually possessed. Your friend Mr. Brown is one of those we worry about.\" said the Siri-like voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah it's definitely time to go\" muttered Travis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

He goes through all the walls at an alarming speed and before he knows it he's already back at his front door. He tries to knock only to see his hand pass right through, creating a bit of frustration for him. He phases through to see his family all doing their normal Friday routine. His father is preparing dinner in the kitchen, his mother is vacuuming the bedrooms, his younger brother Malcolm (15 years old) is playing video games, and his older sister Angelica (20 years old) was getting ready for a date with her boyfriend, Jason. Travis approached his dad and began to explain his situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay so I know you're not gonna believe me Dad, but I'm like a ghost now and Diego is trying to hunt me down and kill me and I don't know what to do now!\" he rambled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey hun? Do you know where the tumeric is? I need a little extra for the chicken\" said his father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Dad! DAD!\" he yelled, \"C'mon dad!\" to no avail. \"Mom! Jason! Angelica! Anyone!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis soon realized that he could not be heard while he was in this astral form.

Travis' father had an erratic work schedule and thus he can't rely on his car being at home. Travis floated over to her, seeing that she was still vacuuming the hallway and gave it his best bet. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty, here goes nothing...\" he said. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis braced himself and thrusted his spirit towards her at full speed. After just a few moments he saw the light return to his eyes. Admittedly a bit drowsy and disoriented, Travis began coming to. He was on the floor, assuming that he'd found himself there after the craziest dream of his life. At least he thought it was a dream, until he raised his hand to his head and caught a glimpse of his now well-manicured nails. He looked forward and saw huge breasts tucked comfortably into a bright red bra and blue v-neck t-shirt. He jolted up in pure disbelief, only to have his center of balance thrown off by the new weight on his chest. He slowly got himself up and tried walking forward, but found it practically impossible since your new feet were strapped into a pair of dainty heels. Travis tried slipping them off but couldn't quite figure them out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do girls deal with this shit? What is the purpose of this strap?\" he thought to himself. \"Guess I'm just gonna have to get used to them then,\" he said while brushing his new dirty blonde hair out of his field of vision. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis desperately wanted to explore this new body in an intimate manner, as he was always curious about the female body, however he knew he had a job to do, and he needed to do it. As much as he recognized his task at hand, his new found body had strong urges, and he wanted to fulfill them...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Travis do?</span></div></div>",

This is my mom! I gotta snap out of it.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs much as he wanted to fulfill his newfound urges he knew that he had a task at hand. Travis stumbled his way to his father in the kitchen, struggling mightily with the heels and not to mention his new breasts throwing off his center of balance.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dad... errr Honey... I mean.. umm\" he stuttered, trying to find the best way to convey his thoughts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are you okay sweetie? Do you need some water?\" his father replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah, I'm fine... It's just... I'm not your wife anymore\" Travis said, unsure of what his Dad would respond.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? Honey what's happening? Are we okay?\" Travis' dad began firing off questions, clearly worried that the line about \"not being his wife anymore\" implied a divorce.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh no, we're fine, we're great,\" Travis said. \"What I meant is that I'm a different person; it's me, Travis.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What are you talking about? Am I being pranked right now?\" he said in disbelief.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No just trust me. I don't know exactly how it happened, or why they chose me, but I can possess people now through like astral projection. Kind of like that monster does in <i>Insidious</i>... except I'm not a monster\" he explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah woah woah so let me get this straight. My son is currently inside my wife's body, controlling her every movement?\" his father asked, still very much so not believing what was happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You couldn't be more right Dad. I needed someone to possess so I could tell you this too. I didn't want you and Mom to be worried about me. As soon as I figure out how to get my normal body back, we'll be back together. Until then, I need to explore and figure things out.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And how do I know this isn't some prank huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis fired back really quick, prepared for his father's bewilderment. \"When I was 12 and we went to the Larson's house for Thanksgiving and you broke their vase, but we made an agreement to tell Mom and The Larsons that it was their dog.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my GOD! It is you!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah... I told you Dad. Now if you'll excuse me...\" Travis said, being cut off by his little brother, Jason. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's some people in suits here at the front door looking for Travis, is he home yet?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait what? You didn't let them in did you?\" Travis asked, suddenly very anxious about what could happen.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ummmm....\" Jason said, avoiding eye contact, for fear of reprimand for what he'd done. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then two Men in Black looking dudes walked in. \"Is there a Travis Brown here, we'd like to have a word with him.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis' mother's heart felt like it was about to beat out of his chest; he was so afraid of what these men may want. What does he do?</span></div></div>",

They were here; they were going to get him; they were going to kill him and his entire family! Glancing to the reflection of the fridge, Travis took in his mothers features... potentially for the last time. He noticed how his mother would never be caught being in this state in public. She was the captain of the home, the one who always took charge! Wiping the coming tears, he put on a bold face, before concentrating. At first nothing happened, all he saw in the mindscape was inky darkness all around. However, he heard a voice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"TRAVIS!\" Travis turned only to be smothered by a crying, and very upset female....namely his mother. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Momimsosorryfordoingwhatididididntrealizeyouweregoingtodisappearoranyth ingpleaseforgi-\" His mom just stops him, hugging him closer. \"I know dear, I know. I know all of it, what you're going through and what must be done\" His mother just hugged him again before stepping back, looking at him with a fierce expression. \"Travis, imagine being me. Imagine, becoming me, thinking like me, how I act, how I think. Close your eyes and concentrate\" Travis did as he was told, however, he didn't need to close his eyes. The reason his mom did that is because while Travis didn't understand his new power, inside his mind his mother had realized something about it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could essentially override someones spirit with his own. Now, the spirit of the person he overrode would have a base of Travis, but still be the other person. In short? Travis was about to take his mother out of existence, However, his mother knew the stakes, and would gladly give her life for his. After a while of keeping his eyes closed, Travis opened them, to find an empty landscape all around him. However, he felt.......different<br>\r\n<br>\r\n ---------------------------------------------- <br>\r\n<br>\r\nUp on the second story, in Travis' old room, his dad cracked his neck, stretching slightly before turning to the two possessed officers as well. With a simple command he instructed them to leave, leaving Diego to head downstairs and confront his wife..... or Travis. With a smile, he entered the kitchen, embracing his new lovely wife from behind, kissing her neck and asking how her day has been. This was a front, Diego didn't care much for Travis' mother, but he did enjoy her luscious body. His train of thought was immediately interrupted when his wife turned around, tears in her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is Travis really gone?\" She moans into his shoulder, voice full of grief. Instantly, Diego is much more on guard, but answers regardless. \"It seems they are trying to find him as well....he broke into government owned property....a federal offense they said.\" Diego buttered the story up waiting for a reaction from his wife, any at all to indicate Travis was around. \"I hope he is found soon... my poor baby....\" She whispers as she begins to walk down the hall. Diego might be in a state where he doesn't mind taking out his friend, but he can still appreciate an amazing ass. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore anything however, he closes his hosts eyes and uses an ability the suit he was given had, the power to detect another foreign soul in its wrong body. Diego felt the pulse go out, however, he didn't get a response.... until he felt it..... far away actually, and getting further!\" Fuming, Diego raged on the inside of his host. He was sure he had Travis! He knew he had to have come home! However....he was told of other 'customers' not acting as they should so, he should go check on that pulse he felt. Before however, Diego moved after his luscious wife, and before she could enter the room, embraced her, turning her to face him as he took advantage of her grief to feel her up, roaming his hands over here ass and thighs, before giving her a deep kiss. \"Don't worry sweetie, I'm sure Travis will be fine\" And with one simple memory wipe, Diego was gone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thanks honey\" Mumbled the wife, as she took refugee in the master bedroom, locking the door, before braking down crying. While Travis had secured his safety, it had come at a cost, his mothers soul, to be exact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Travis continue?</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Jesus Christ man, all I know is that I need to get far as FUCK away from Diego right now, this fucker sounds like he wants to kill me\" Travis thought to himself. \"If there's one place Diego will never look, it's be back at North Jefferson, he knows I hate that place\" he chuckled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis prepared himself and propelled through the roof, giving himself a bird's eye view of the city. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How did I never notice something like this while driving around? This must really be some hidden government tech shit..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could see his school from above and proceeded to find his way there, but not without hitting his fair share of proverbial road bumps. He wasn't quite completely coordinated with flight, so at first he was sort of all over the place. After some self calibration he got a hang of it, and in a much quicker than anticipated time, he arrived back at school. There was still some faculty members and students around here and there, lending Travis with the opportunity to grab his first body. Out of the people he saw lingering around, a few caught his eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFirst was Janice Kim, an Asian-American girl who was a grade below Travis, but because of her intellect was always in many classes with the seniors. She was a bit of a nerd in some ways and kept to herself for the most part, but Travis had his fair share of interactions with her. Perhaps she could help brainstorm with Travis about ways to foil Diego and Dynamo's master plan.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Janice huh? She's a real smart girl, she could definitely help me get through this situation..\" he thought to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was Mia Hart, the track-and-field girl who everybody knew as the \"try hard\" who got a scholarship to run at UCLA. She was still around campus since she just completed her solo training for the day. She's an extremely attractive girl, and her body is in peak physical shape, but a lot of guys avoid her because of her arrogant attitude, but she really couldn't care less since she really only cares about herself. Practically the only reason Travis was interested in possessing her was because he was curious about her, and wanted to get to \"know\" her if you know what I mean.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck... the things I would do to that girl if she wasn't such a bitch... I bet she looks great under those track shorts too fuck\" he said while hypnotized by her toned and tight ass bouncing up and down in her skin-tight bicycle shorts.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nLast was Mr. Warnicke, his 7th period psychology teacher. Mr. Warnicke was kind of a dick, but he was a smart dick, and much like Janice, he could help Travis out. Part of the reason Travis considered him too was because he wanted to prove Mr. Warnicke wrong.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This fucker always said, 'oh! aStRaL PRoJeCtiOn iSn'T ReAl.' Tell me this isn't real then fucker\" as he raised his ghostly middle finger at him in protest. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow all he had to do was decide who to take over. The genius Janice Kim, the athletic and bitchy Mia Hart, or Mr. Know-it-all Mr. Warnicke? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Fuck man, I know Janice and Mr. Warnicke will still be around come next week, they can help me out then. I NEED to get my own taste of Mia Hart,\" Travis said with an evil grin. He knew he had a task at hand, but a little leisure time exploring the possibilities of the IAP Suit wouldn't hurt anybody, right? Travis watched from above as Mia made her way from the school's track and into the girl's locker room; he followed close behind, forever thankful that his astral form was invisible to the human eye. He watched as Mia headed for her locker, and allowed her to start putting in her code to open it up; after all, he wouldn't be able to do so once he possessed her. In the mean time, he made his way through the rows of lockers to make sure she was alone in there, and sure enough she was. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank god this bitch stays so late for Track, otherwise this could be a lot more difficult\" he thought to himself. He waited around and acted upon his urges when he heard the click of the lock unlocking.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's go time.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis flew back to the row where Mia was standing, giving her time to pull her backpack and car keys out of the locker. He approached her from behind and raised his hand in front of his astral form, plunging it into her back. Mia immediately locked up, dropping her bag and keys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey! HEY! Somebody! Help!!\" Mia screamed in fear, but to no avail. Travis reached his other hand up and plunged it into her neck, silencing her vocal cords. Mia tried and tried with all her might, tears streaming down her face and veins popping out her neck, but not a sound to be heard. Travis lifted her up off the ground and brought her to the back row of lockers, just to be extra cautious in the event a janitor or someone walked in. Mia continued to try and scream, only leading to greater entertainment for Travis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God you really don't get it do you? I'm in control now, and this is just the beginning!\" Travis said rather maniacally. \"You're such a fucking bitch Mia, and somebody's gotta take you down a notch, and that somebody is me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then, Travis' heart sunk when he heard a reply; it was Mia, only he could hear her voice in his head. With Travis' astral presence slowly seeping its way into Mia's body, it was as though he was also growing closer to her soul. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Who are you??\" she asked frantically. \"Please, I'll give you whatever you want! Whatever you want, I promise! Just please stop whatever this is you're doing to me\" she begged.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you poor soul\" Travis replied, \"<i>you</i> are what I want.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No, ple...\" was all she could muster before Travis asserted his soulful dominance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Don't try and fight it, you're in good hands, I promise.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia's voice in his head grew weaker and weaker, screams becoming even more muffled as he dug himself deeper into her. He repositioned his arm from the middle of her back and moved it to match her right arm, almost like pulling it through a sweater, sliding his fingers into hers like a glove. He did the same with his left arm and followed it with climbing his lower body to merge with hers. Though his legs were larger than hers, his astral form melted in, merging himself with Mia's body like a perfectly tailored pair of pants. Last was to take over her consciousness; he slowly brought his head forward and all went dark.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter a few moments light returned to his eyes and Travis could feel himself laying on a cool concrete floor. He began to pick himself up only to be greeted by strands of long, luscious brown har entering his field of vision. He raised up his right hand to brush them out of the way, only to surprise himself with his now feminine, well-manicured hands. He raised both of them up and extended his arms in front of him, slowly opening and closing his fists, observing the new mechanisms of his host body. He ran his hands up and down his arms, indulging in the new sensations of his soft and hairless skin. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow I co-- wait is this my voice! I sound so weird now!\" Travis said aloud, quite obviously intrigued by Mia's voice coming out when he spoke. \"I mean *ahem* I'm Mia Hart, North Jefferson High's beloved pride of Track and Field hehe\" as he let out a flirty giggle. \"Wow Mia, can I just say you really do a great job of keeping this body in tip-top shape\" he said while looking down past her supple breasts, focusing on Mia's flat, toned stomach. \"I'm glad you're such a great sport about this, because trust me, this is just the beginning. There's a lot more to be done here.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"HEY!\" which caused Travis to jump. \"The locker rooms are closing, grab your stuff, and get out!\" yelled the janitor.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm sorry.. I was practicing hard for the 200M today and lost track of time.\" Travis replied, trying to do his best Mia impression.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, it's you Mia! Sorry for the outburst, there's been some kids loitering around here lately, probably dealing dope you know?\" the janitor explained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh believe me, I know! You know that junior Brad Faulkner? He deals to everyone!\" Travis told the janitor. Brad wasn't a drug dealer, but Travis fucking hated him so he figured now would be a great time to set him up. After all, all the faculty on the campus would believe Mia Hart, who would believe Travis Brown? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Really now? I'll be sure to have a talk with Mr. Pederson about that.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you sir! We don't need students like Brad polluting North Jefferson. Anyway, I'm going to get out of here, my parents are probably worried sick,\" Travis lied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes of course Ms. Hart, have a great weekend!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis collected Mia's--better yet, <i>his</i>-- belongings and headed out to the school parking lot. Along the way he couldn't help but observe the new way he walked. It was strange, because he didn't walk like this normally, but it was almost as though Mia's body could only walk one, specific way. His hips swayed more, almost like a model's strut down the runway, but he didn't try to fight it; he wanted to learn every little mannerism there was to Mia Hart. Soon he reached her car, threw his stuff inside and got in. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Whew, that was actually close, thank god I wasn't doing anything like this when he walked in,\" he sneered while finally taking the opportunity to grope Mia's boobs. He reached a hand down the front of his sports bra, allowing a soft moan to escape his new tender lips as he caressed her supple B-cup breasts, with the pleasure only intensifying as he focused on playing with her nipples. Each pinch and twist sent miniature waves of ecstasy coursing through his body, leading to moisture building up between his legs.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No wonder girls love when guys play with their tits! God I just want somebody to suck them\" Travis said aloud in the privacy of his new car. \"I need to get to this chick's house and cum already, and then maybe a second time too. And a third,\" he giggled, acknowledging the fact that his now feminine body could handle multiple orgasms. \"Oh and shower too, I could really use one.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis excitement was reaching peak levels and he needed to get to Mia's house ASAP. Luckily Mia had an iPhone with the touch ID and Hey Siri functions activated. Travis opened the phone and asked Siri to get him home. The directions said he was about 20 minutes away, but Travis was determined to make it in 10. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry Siri, but I need to see this bitch's body naked, it's gonna have to be quicker than 20 minutes\" he said to the phone, admittedly sounding a bit weird with Mia's voice. Sure enough, Travis' lead foot got him back in under 10. He grabbed her backpack from the back and burst through the door, bolting for the stairs, assuming that her room would be up there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey sweetie! How was school?\" her dad asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It was great, I got really sweaty at practice today so I'm gonna take a quick shower and be right back down for dinner!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Alrighty angel, sounds good\" her dad said. You could already tell this dude was going to tell a lot of bad \"dad jokes.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis made his way into her bedroom, being careful to close the door behind him. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohohoh here we are, the moment of truth...\" he said, still adjusting to the sound of Mia's voice coming out when he spoke. <br>\r\n    </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Travis made sure to be extra careful as to not be caught, because he intended on <i>throughly</i> enjoying Mia's body for the time being. He tried his best to learn the details of her life; her mannerisms, her lifestyle, her secrets. He took note of her bedroom, admiring its best attempt at being \"pinterest goals.\" Mia had a rather large, ornate tapestry wall hanging displayed on one wall, with a TV mounted and desk on the adjacent one.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I can already tell that she... <i>I</i> spend too much time on tumblr\" he said while rolling his eyes. Surrounding her window she strung some Christmas lights as decor, something all too cliche among high school girls. Travis walked over to them and plugged them in to provide some light, as the sunlight was quickly fading. With the little bit of extra light in the room, he noticed the edge of a notebook peeking out from behind a shelf on the desk. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do we have here huh? Is this a diary I see?\" he asked rather mockingly, almost as if he was awaiting a response from Mia. \"You know what, we'll save this for later, once my mind is a little more at ease,\" he grinned. With that, he placed the diary back on her desk and made his way towards the restroom in her room, being careful to place some towels at the bottom of the doorway to minimize any potential sounds. He locked the bathroom door, and essentially soundproofed the space. It was go time.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mia, I promise you're going to enjoy this,\" he said to himself in the mirror, trying his best to be as seductive and sultry as possible. He started simply by getting lost in her hazel eyes, as he was never given the opportunity when she was in control. He leaned over the counter a little bit, pouting her plump and full lips, sticking his tongue out, almost as though he was inviting a hard dick into it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh please Travis Brown! Please let me suck your cock\" he recited seductively with her voice, shimmying her shoulders to best display her budding cleavage in the sports bra. \"This really isn't doing me any justice\" he observed, as the elastic material of the bra compressed Mia's breasts tightly to her chest. Travis raised her right arm in the air, pulling the strap up and over, and following the same with the left arm, revealing her naked, supple breasts to his virgin eye.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... these... are amazing Mia\" he said in awe, slowly raising her hands up to appropriately feel them up. Her breasts were average sized, and very perky, with nipples very tender to the touch. Travis began to knead the perfectly standing breasts, leading to the earlier waves of pleasure re-coursing through his new feminine body. He gave each of her index fingers a lick for added lubrication, and was beginning to lose himself in the ecstasy, allowing her instinctual moans and cries to escape. He felt an intensity building, very similar to his male orgasms, yet this was much more impressive. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is this really how good it is every time Mia? I don't think I could ever go back to being a guy after this! And I haven't even touched your pussy yet! Wait,\" he said, realizing that it would only get better upon further examination. He readjusted his focus on the bathroom mirror and gazed at the naked female body looking back at him. He watched, almost in disbelief, as the beautiful Mia Hart obeyed his every command, and reached her hand down the waistband of her shorts and began to peel away the concealing athletic attire. Underneath Travis could see her hot pink underwear, sopping near the entrance from the natural juices being produced by her aroused vagina. He slid the shorts down to her ankles and kicked them off, leaving her in just in her wet panties. With Travis' excitement causing her heart to race, he began to remove her underwear, allowing himself to indulge in the real prize; her pussy. He reached down with her right hand just to touch the area around it, basking in the velvety feel of her erogenous skin. Mia did a great job of maintaining her hair, and must have shaved in the past 24 hours of so.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"My my Mia, you shouldn't have!\" Travis said aloud. \"Did you know I was going to possess you and finger fuck you? Is that why you shaved yourself?\" he laughed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith his left hand Travis reached down and began to separate the intricate lips protecting the entrance to Mia's vagina, though found it frustratingly difficult as everything downstairs was incredibly wet; almost dripping. Hesitantly, he inched his index finger closer to the actual entrance, and slowly pushed his way in, meeting little resistance. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You want this so bad Mia, look what you're body is telling me\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis joined the single index finger with the adjacent middle finger and began to properly finger Mia's pussy, causing his legs to quiver. He grabbed hold of the counter once again and kept at it, massaging the g-spot of her inner walls. Once he regained balance, he moved his free hand to his soft breasts, making sure to give appropriate attention to his hardened nipples. Travis was losing it, soon finding himself on the bathroom ground, as the shaking in his legs would not cease.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, I can't even stand up Mia, it's too good!\" he moaned. Travis continued to plunge her fingers in and out of her pussy, being met with unfamiliar thoughts in the process. Unlike his male orgasms, where he would focus on big titties and pussy, he now found his mind wandering towards big dicks, and his inclination to wanting one fucking his new tight pussy right now. As much as tried to fight it, he couldn't help it. It was so vivid; he could see the guy atop him, teasing his wet opening, sliding the cock along his wet slit. In his imagination, Travis begged for the guy to just insert it, pleading for him to take his virginity. He watched the mysterious dream guy stroke his dick along the opening, and just as he began to insert himself, Travis felt it hit. A female orgasm.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMia's back arched and bent, simultaneously gyrating her hips, sending Travis through pure nirvana. He was completely unaware of what noises he may or may not have been making in her body, instead focusing on the pure sensitivity while it struck. He could feel her pussy contract, tightening around the inserted fingers. He could feel a pulsating across every inch of her body. He could feel the dopamine released from his brain. He laid there in the after effects, breathing heavily, sitting in a pool of his own vaginal juices. He tried to get himself up, but his legs still spasmed and shook; instead, he recollected on the experience.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"That was absolutely incredible. I could do that all day every day, but what was with that vision I had?\" he thought. \"Why was I thinking about dicks? What the fuck... I'm not gay. Is Mia's anatomy affecting my psyche? Man I ain't gonna have no dick in me, that's for sure\" Travis picked himself off the ground and made his way towards the shower, turning it up to a warm and relaxing temperature to help him come down. He lathered up some of her body wash on a cloth and rinsed off her body, not prepared for the sensitivity of her skin after her orgasm. Because of this, the shower took a bit longer than expected, but nonetheless Travis came out refreshed and refocused. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"And her soaps smell amazing? Damn what's not to love about this body!?\" he squealed. He wrapped up his body with a towel, not quite used to covering his entire torso after a shower. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm is it time I open that diary of yours up now?\" he wondered.     <br>\r\n<br>\r\n            </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>As Travis walked over towards her desk he heard a faint buzzing in the background. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*bzzzz* *bzzzz*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"huh? who could this be...\" he wondered to himself. He looked at the screen and saw that it was one of Mia's friends, Tati. Tati was just like Mia in many ways. They both ran track; both took it very seriously; and both were way too into themselves. Match made in heaven right?<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"hey girl <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/cry.png\" alt=\"*Cry*\" title=\"Cry\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"> did you wanna go grab some dinner tonight? Me and Michael... aren't doing so well\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis grabbed the phone and quickly wrote back, not wanting to let this opportunity to hang with Tati pass by. \"omg what?? yess sis of course. are you on your way?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could see the text bubble pop up with the dancing ellipses, and soon he got his reply.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"yeah, if thats okay ? i'll leave right now.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"perfect, i'll see you in 15\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, this is gonna be interesting. My first real experience needing to act as Mia... I hope Tati doesn't suspect anything. Wait, she would never, body possession and all this shit isn't even supposed to be real!\" Travis thought to himself. \"Time to get ready...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Travis dropped the towel and felt the cool breeze brush against Mia's bare skin. He dug through a couple of her drawers to find something to wear; something that would be simple enough for him to put on, as bras were something all too foreign to him. After some rummaging he found a nice yellow tube top, perfect for the situation as it did not require a bra. He slipped it over Mia's dainty shoulders and felt a warming relief as it provided the support and comfort her breasts needed. He also loved how her nipples were quite identifiable in the top. \"A little flirty, a little attention grabbing, I love it Mia hehe\" he giggled while eying her chest in the mirror.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe continued his search and found a nice pair of jeans to match. He opened up the next drawer and grabbed the first pair of underwear he could find and slipped them on, finding them quite uncomfortable at first.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How do girls wear these? It's like I have a wedgie 24/7!\" he exclaimed. \"Damn does my ass look good though.\" The panties he picked were a similar yellow and revealed a lot of Mia's ass, really accentuating her curvaceous and toned bottom. He completed the outfit with the jeans, tightly lifting up and giving a sexy shape to her apple-bottom ass. Travis gazed in the mirror and danced around a little giggling at Mia's sight. \"I'm sorry but we gotta show this off Mia!\" he said while reaching for her phone to open snapchat. Travis hit the classic booty pop pose and snapped a pic. \"Ooooh, perfect! Wow she looks.... I look so great!\" With the push of a button it was uploaded onto her story for all of her snapchat friends to see. With that, he got a text from Tati, presumably her stating her arrival.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"i'm here! btw, loooove the snap you posted !! <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/inlove.png\" alt=\"*InLove*\" title=\"InLove\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\">\" she texted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"lol love you girl! i'm omw\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis grabbed Mia's purse and head out the door, ready for whatever the night would bring him.  </span></div></div>",

After all, he doesn't have access to any of Mia's secrets or memories. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey girl, what's new?\" Tati said as Travis opened the car door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh you know, same old\" he replied with a sly grin. \"You look really great!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Aww thank you! I could say the same to you girlfriend!\" she replied excitedly. Tati was the type of girl who always had tons of energy; it was probably best that she did a sport like Track. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Soooo... let's get to the good stuff, what's going on with Michael huh?\" Travis asked, trying his best to act as if he knew the details of their relationship.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know... he just wasn't the same today. After school I went over to his house and he was just being super aggressive and pervy! I don't know if he was just super horny or what but he's never like this. He's just.. just different today, like he's not even himself,\" she explained. She kept going on with the story but the last line really caught Travis' attention.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...like he's not even himself...\" resonated through his head, echoing, bringing up the notion that Diego had possessed Michael. Could that be possible? <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"...and you know... hey, are you good Mia?\" Tati stopped her story, seeing that Travis was zoned out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh, yeah... sorry, I was just thinking about all this homework I have to do later but fuck it right? hehe\" he giggled, trying to play it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah yeah girl,\" she said while rolling her eyes with a grin, fully aware that Travis hadn't heard a word she said. \"Anyway, we're here, whatcha wanna eat?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Umm, I don't know yet. Maybe we can walk around the mall quick and see what's up\" he replied.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I could go with that! And it looks pretty empty tonight, we shouldn't have to wait anywhere.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two girls got out of the car and started to head in towards the mall food court, eager to find something to eat. Tati was doing the usual girl thing where they dance because of how excited to eat they are. Travis had seen his sister do it too and could never quite understand why. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You know, I think I'm feeling some...\" Tati said before she suddenly grew quiet. Travis looked over at her and saw the very empty look on her face; Tati was utterly expressionless, something very uncharacteristic of her. No blinking, no eye movement, it was as if she had become a statue.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey... are you okay?\" he asked to no response. \"Hey, Tati?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nSuddenly she gasped, blinking and normal movement resuming. Tati glanced over at Travis and just stared at him, quite intensely. Travis had no idea what was happening, but what he did know is that Tati's current behavior was making him uncomfortable.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey are you okay? What happen....\" Before he knew it, Tati had wrapped her hand around Mia's dainty neck, beginning to suffocate Travis.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It is the orders of Dynamo to have you repent for what you have done Mr. Brown,\" Tati recited, scaring Travis as he was quite cognizant of what was now happening. It was Diego; Diego had just possessed Tati. \"You have violated Ms. Hart in unimaginable ways and must now pay.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis was freaking out about the whole situation and knew he really only had 2 options: Fight or Flight.  </span></div></div>",

Instead he wanted to use Mia's athleticism and physical fitness to his advantage. With Tati--or Diego in Tati's body--firmly latched atop him, Travis used Mia's fit and flexible legs to counter Diego. The two wrestled until Travis could finally get his feet in a position to kick Diego away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There's no point in fighting this Mr. Brown, the time is now. You must pay for your wrongdoings!\" Diego recited, sounding so odd in Tati's voice. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why are you talking so weird man?\" he asked, \"that's not you Diego\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Regardless of what you think of me Mr. Brown I can assure you that I am indeed Diego\" he replied, trying his best to regain the offensive on Travis. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis knew there was no point in trying to get through to Diego at the moment, so he seized the opportunity and made his escape, dashing straight out the mall and never looking back. He ran and ran, passing by intersection after intersection until he was a few blocks away.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Goddamn, thank god Mia is in such good shape! No way I could've made that escape in my normal body whew..\" he said to himself with a great sigh of relief. He briefly checked his surroundings to ensure Diego was no where to be found; this is when Travis knew he had to leave Mia's body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well it's only a matter of time until he finds me again... I guess it's time to say bye to Mia...\" he thought to himself. But who will be his next host?</span></div></div>",

He walked through the automatic doors and was greeted by one of the employees. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey there Welcome to... wait, aren't you that Mia girl?\" the employee asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Uhh yeah...\" Travis giggled, \"why do you ask?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well I run track for Roosevelt High and I've seen you at a couple meets.

He was obviously being overcome by the estrogen pumping through his borrowed veins. \"What time do you finish again?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll be done in about 15 if you wanna stick around?\" said Jeremiah, eager to go on this \"date.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Sounds good, if you need me I'll be in the homegoods section, come find me when you're done,\" Travis flirted back. With that Jeremiah returned to his shift, quickly trying to wrap up his last tasks so he could get his chance with Mia. The attention and desire was something Travis was all too unfamiliar with, though he enjoyed it. Although it was coming from a male, he enjoyed it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Why am I looking forward to hanging with this dude? Isn't it like gay?\" he thought to himself, thoughts shrouded with images of he and this Jeremiah kid hanging out. He wanted so badly to deny the urges, but he couldn't. He knew that he would risk getting caught by Diego, but he didn't care. All his body wanted now was to hang out with this hot Jeremiah guy. He had no idea what to expect, after all, Travis had barely gone on any dates while living as a male, what was he supposed to expect now that he was a beautiful girl? He paced around the store, waiting for what felt like an eternity until Jeremiah busted out from behind the \"employees only\" door. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith a flirtatious hesitation he reapproached Travis. \"Soooooo... are you ready?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think I'm ready as I'll ever be\" he replied. \"So what does a night with Jeremiah entail hmmm?\"</span></div></div>",

Put your number in my phone though yeah? You're pretty cute\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis couldn't believe what he had just said. Did he just call another guy cute? What was Mia's body doing to him? He knew that this was the right decision, and any more time spent in Mia would only result in more consequences.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe handed Jeremiah the phone and watched as he created the new contact.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'll text you later on, maybe something next weekend\" he continued to flirt, shocked by each word exiting his mouth.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'd like that, sounds like a plan,\" Jeremiah grinned, blushing hardcore. \"I'll see you then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis waved bye to the boy and continued on in the store, keeping his focus on the task at hand; exiting this body ASAP.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Man what was going on back there?\" he asked himself. \"Why was I flirting with that guy? Does that make me gay? Man what the fuck...\" What Travis was beginning to learn was that the physiology of whatever body he possessed would dictate his drives. Because he was in Mia, he subliminally longed for the male attention. As much as he wanted to deny himself these urges, he could not. \"I love pussy! I mean I haven't really seen much pussy but I know I love it!\" he pleaded with himself, though it was all to no avail as his borrowed female body craved nothing more than to be caressed by the male touch. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThrough all of his frantic panicking Travis eventually found a secluded part of the store that seemed perfect for his depossession attempt. He peered around to ensure that nobody was looking directly at him, but made sure that people would come to Mia's aid once he had fled her stolen flesh. He closed his eyes and began to relax, envisioning himself floating once more as a spiritual being. He could feel a tingling sensation begin in her legs, and fade until he felt light as a feather. The same thing began happening with his arms. After a few more moments of focusing he heard a loud thump.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n*THUMP*<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his eyes and saw Mia collapsed on the ground.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god. Hey! Somebody come help! This young lady just collapsed!\" yelled a random shopper. Many people began rushing to her side and Travis just watched from above. Huddled around were numerous shoppers, each trying their best to wake Mia up. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Miss!? Miss?! Are you okay?\" asked the man who first responded. Mia began to move her head and slowly open her eyes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Mia! Oh shit, Mia, are you alright?\" It was Jeremiah. He rushed over from his assigned area when he saw the commotion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... where am I?\" she said. \"And why am I at <i>Target</i>?\" She slowly raised her hands up to rub her head, clearly sore from both the fall and the fact that she had just been possessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey are you okay?\" asked Jeremiah.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Woah... who are you?\" Mia said rather disgustedly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You must've hit your head pretty hard. Here, lemme get you some ice\" Jeremiah responded, trying his best to help and not ruin his chances at a date with this girl.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait... aren't you that guy from Roosevelt high? The one who tries to peek in the Girls' locker room?\" she exclaimed. \"Get away from me!\" Mia half-pushed him away from the ground and got up under her own power, slowly but surely staggering to her feet.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Do you need any help getting to your car miss?\" asked a random shopper.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No no, I'll be fine\" she replied back, trying quick to get away from the groups of people.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis admired her beautiful ass one last time from above as she made her way out of the store. \"Man, I can't believe that was me just a few minutes ago... I was... hot!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOnce she was out of sight Travis refocused his efforts on finding Janice, as he knew that she could be the key to a lot of his problems. The biggest obstacle now though was just finding her, as he knew very little about her personal life. \"Where oh where could she be... hmmm... I wonder if she's with her friends at that one Boba place. I'm pretty sure they go there pretty frequently.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Travis began to fly to the town's most popular Boba shop, eager to find his next temporary home. When he arrived he couldn't find Janice around. He got an aerial view of the shop but there were no signs of her. Just when he thought he'd run into a dead end he heard the chime of the bell at the door; a small group of high school kids entered. The last one through the door was Janice Kim, following behind three others. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Bingo.\" Travis smiled. \"Just couldn't stay away huh?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe observed as the group of friends ordered their drinks and sat down at the table. They were having conversation and playing games and having a good ol' time. \"Ughh just hurry up already! I need to find some answers Janice!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhat does Travis decide to do?      </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Travis continued to monitor the boba shop, watching as Janice and her friends were having the time of their lives. He observed the two boys there, David and Edward, and couldn't help but laugh at their awkward flirtatious mannerisms and strange attempts to impress Janice and her best friend Ellie.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean I know I'm no lady's man but this can't be how you get pussy\" Travis scoffed to himself.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"... and you see at that point I knew I had the speech and debate tourney locked up!\" David boasted, leaving Janice and Ellie awkwardly giggling. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey I think I'm getting pretty tired for the night, is it cool if I use the bathroom and we get out of here?\" Janice asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yeah for sure, me and David gotta study for the academic decathlon anyway,\" replied Edward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God, these have gotta be some of the biggest nerds I've ever seen in my life... but they're also the best shot I got..\" Travis thought to himself. He watched as Janice excused herself from the table and made her way towards the restroom. Luckily for him, it was a single person bathroom, meaning there was no chance somebody could come in while he was possessing her. She opened the door and locked it behind her, with Travis following closely behind and phasing right on through. He didn't mean to be much of a pervert, but he couldn't help himself, concentrating his attention on Janice unbuckling her pants to use the restroom. He watched as she slid her pants and underwear to her ankles, and got himself a quick glimpse of the essence between her thighs, before quickly shifting his attention away while she relieved herself. Before much time had passed at all, Travis heard the toilet flush, meaning that now would be the time for possession. Although this was not his first time possessing somebody, as Mia was his \"test drive,\" he was still very nervous for his experience as Janice. The art of becoming somebody completely new was never something anybody could grow accustomed to. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Here we go... just relax, and let's do it,\" he said to himself, trying his best to motivate. As Janice finished washing her hands he inched his ethereal form closer and closer to her, preparing himself for a physical form once more. Just as Janice was about to reach for some paper towels, she felt a strange sensation begin to rush through her body. Travis could feel her mind begin to panic, and sensed her attempts at thwarting whatever entity was trying to take control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's... happening to me...\" she muttered, trying with all of her spiritual might to deny Travis. To no avail she could feel her body's tingling grow, as it spread throughout her being; soon she had no feeling in either of her legs, and her arms followed soon after. Much like what happened with Mia, Janice's pleading grew faint, as the deeper Travis inserted himself into her, the less control she retained.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Please... just please don't hurt me.\" She conceded, her voice fading into nothingness. Once again Travis merged his arms completely into hers; legs into hers; soul into hers. And once again Travis was met with a warm, familiar sensation; a sense of a physical vessel once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause this possession was not as forceful as his first, he did not awaken on the ground, but rather found himself completing what Janice had started. He looked around and found himself indeed inside the boba shop's bathroom, and indeed found himself inside an unfamiliar body once more. He adjusted the round frame glasses on his face and could see Janice Kim looking back at him. He tiled his head from side-to-side and watched as she did the same. Travis fixated his focus on her wonderful face, and it was here he began to truly notice how cute Janice was. The freshly-shaped eyebrows, the cute button nose, the pouty lips, Janice was by all means a very cute girl, yet nobody noticed since she was a \"nerd.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis took a couple deep breaths in, feeling the newfound weight on his chest rise and fall with each inhale and exhale. Janice had on a rather large coat so there was not much in terms to explore at the moment, though that did not stop him from giving his breasts a quick, flirtatious squeeze. Instead he fixed his attention on the sensation of water on his hands. He reached up and waved his hand in front of the paper towel dispenser, observing his new hands in the process. Because Janice was not into athletics, she could afford to have her nails done with no risk of them breaking. He looked on at her delicate feminine hands, taking time to open and close it fully. Her nails were done beautifully, coated with a smooth layer of light pink polish. Travis was careful to dry off his new manicured set, as not to damage them, and made his way out of the restroom to rejoin his new friend group.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahem, ahem.. hey I'm Janice\" he teased. \"I think that'll pass the test...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow what took you so long in there Janice? Boba run straight through you? haha\" David yammered, obviously still trying to flirt with Janice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ha. Ha. Very funny\" Travis replied sarcastically, being extra short with him. \"Can we get headed home now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah come on, I call shotgun though!\" David exclaimed, dashing towards the car in a playful way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs the group of friends walked towards the car, Travis felt a tap on his shoulder.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Jan, if you want you can sleep over tonight. With my mom out of town I could use some company,\" Ellie said.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ohohoh a sleepover huh? You know you could sleepover at my place too, my parents are out at that pharmaceutical convention,\" David snickered. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis knew that he was joking, but what would he say if he agreed to it?          </span></div></div>",

Travis could see why Janice never gave this guy a chance; he was really desperate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe group of friends drove off into the night, continuing their conversations for the most part.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You seem kinda quiet all of a sudden Jan, everything okay?\" David asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh.. Uh, yeah, everything is fine, sorry I'm just kinda tired I think. Thinking and stressing about going to college soon tires me out,\" Travis replied, trying to give his best Janice response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What do you even have to worry about? You're like the smartest girl in the school!\" Ellie reassured. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah.. just, I-I don't know\" he stuttered back, \"I guess starting the new life is just scary.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're all feelin' that Jan, you just gotta embrace it. And make the last of these days count,\" David replied, actually sounding quite sincere for once. They continued their discussion until they reached Ellie's house, Travis obviously doing a great job pretending to be Janice. The two girls said their good-bye's and headed in, eager to get some time away from the boys.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Geez could David be any more desperate?\" Travis asked Ellie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh c'mon Jan, he's a nice guy. Plus you're a cute girl! And smart! Of course he's gonna be into you, you're like the whole package\" she complimented back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean I guess\" he smiled and blushed back. \"Hey I'm gonna change and get ready for bed though, I'm super tired tonight.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yeah of course, if you need any extra clothes just let me know.\" Ellie responded, also trying to get ready for bed. The two girls tended to their nightly cleanses and changed into more appropriate clothing. Within no time at all they were comfortable and ready to sleep. There was one probing question that was on Travis' mind though, and he just had to ask Ellie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Ellie? Do you believe in astral projection?\" he asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"In what? Did you say astral projection?\" she questioned back. \"Like that thing from <i>Insidious</i>?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean I guess?\" he giggled back, finding her reference to <i>Insidious</i> erroneous.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I've heard stories about that, where people leave their bodies while they sleep... it just doesn't seem plausible to me though...\" she explained. \"Like somebody entering your empty body and resuming control? I think science would say otherwise.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well funny story Ellie... I'm not actually Janice...\" he confessed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"W-what do you mean?\" she hesitated back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ellie, it's me, Travis Brown. I'm controlling every aspect of your friend Janice right now\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the fuck is going on? What the hell are you talking about??\" she fired back, visible anger and concern growing in her face.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just let me explain okay?\" he said, trying his best to reconcile things between the two of them. Travis went on and on, telling Ellie about what had happened so far; he explained how he and Diego were driving home when all went wrong; he explained he used Mia Hart to feel human again; he explained why Janice would be a good, temporary host. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're telling me that you want me and Janice to help you take down this <i>Dynamo</i> thing because they're trying to kill you now? Why would they give you this suit thing if they just wanted to get rid of you?\" Ellie asked, obviously very confused with the whole situation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think they picked me as a test dummy... To see how people would act when given the powers, and they gave Diego the policing authority. I think they want to market this kind of stuff but the whole thing is so fucked! I'm telling you right now as somebody who has the power; nobody should have this power Ellie. So please, help me take these people down and help me get my body back\" he pleaded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHow does Ellie react?   </span></div></div>",

Like clockwork he got a response. He tapped on the <i>Snapchat</i> notification and opened it up, welcomed by a selfie of David captioned: Say Less <img style=\"\" class=\"emoteZ\" src=\"https://images.Writing.Com/imgs/writing.com/writers/e15/cool.png\" alt=\"*Cool*\" title=\"Cool\" border=\"0\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis continued walking down the sidewalk until a familiar car pulled up next to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey, little girl, you want a piece of candy?\" David joked in a funny voice. Travis playfully rolled his eyes with a smirk and got in the car, relieved that he wouldn't spend the night in the cold.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what happened between you two?\" he probed. \"It was such a fun night.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's just a long story, lots of girly details, I won't bore you with the details... What'd you and Edward end up doing?\" Travis responded back.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Edward bailed on me, said that he wanted to get some extra studying in. I know that we're nerds but like damn... He's a super nerd!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe two talked and talked the way back, not having many awkward instances like earlier. It was actually quite refreshing for Travis to see a more refined side of David. They pulled into the driveway and David escorted him inside, showing him around the house.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So over here is the living room, there's the kitchen, my room a.k.a. The Dungeon of Crusty Socks over there\" he laughed, making Travis grin with the stupidity. \"I didn't think you'd actually be coming over; I wasn't ready for this.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's totally fine. Hey, there was something I actually did wanna tell you. About me and Ellie's fight...\" he interrupted.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh. My. Gosh. Spill the tea sis!\" David joked once more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMeanwhile, Ellie was trying her best to calm down after the whole ordeal...<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Travis Brown living inside Janice!? That fucking pervert! He's probably seen her naked now! Oh I'm gonna fucking kill that boy!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*KNOCK* *KNOCK*</b> Ellie heard a swift but clear knock on the door. She walked downstairs and peered through the peephole, only to see two men in suits awaiting her answer. She slowly opened it up and questioned them.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How can I help you guys tonight?\" she asked. <br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Yes, hello ma'am, we work at Dynamo, a new research facility in town experimenting in a new.. vacationing industry per se... Anyway, have you encountered a Mr. Travis Brown recently? We are in a dire need to locate him. According to our data, his last activity blip occurred here at this residence.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Funny you say that, because he just stormed out. You know what, he probably went back to Janice's house! She lives at 1453 Lincoln St, not too far from here! He's such a pervert *ugh*, he probably went back there just to fuck around in her body!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you for your cooperation ma'am, we'll be on our ways to check it out, hopefully bring an end to his activities. If we have any further questions we'll be in contact.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -----------<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So you're telling me that you possessed Janice when she went into the bathroom at that boba place??\" David asked, obviously very intrigued by the whole notion. \"You know what, I think I read about this whole 'soul' thing recently in a <i>Scientific American</i> article. You're like living proof dude! Haha!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I kinda am hehe\" he blurted back. \"Anyway, I'm also being hunted by the same people who gave me this power, and I need someone smart like you to help me. There's gotta be some sort of tracker on me and it'd be real nice if you could disarm it David.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I think you came to the right guy Jan, I'm still gonna call you that, and I think I can help out... for a small favor\" David premised with an evil smile. \"If you blow me.\"   </span></div></div>",

Never did he think he'd hear a straight man ask for a blowjob from him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"C'mon man... I mean Jan,\" he pleaded, \"you're not a dude right now! Right now you're Janice, and all I know is that you're in my bedroom late at night and that usually only means one thing\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I'm a dude David! Don't you get that? This is like gay then!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah Travis, see that's the thing. The only thing 'male' about you is your mentality. Every cell, every inch of your physicality is female. And if you want me to help you out I want this small little favor in return. I'll be quick, I usually am,\" he joked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis couldn't believe what he was hearing. He never imagined in his wildest dreams that David would be so chauvinistic; he also never imagined that he'd need to suck a dick in order to stay alive.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Just close your eyes and let your instincts take over! Like I said, everything about you is female, whether you want to believe it or not!\" said David, beginning to give off rapey vibes. With his heart racing and not knowing how much time he truly had, Travis knew what had to be done. Maybe David was right, maybe Janice's body would be hardwired for this kind of thing. He closed his eyes, counted to three, and began to bring himself forward. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"There we go sweetie!\" said David all cheerfully. \"It'll all be done before you know it\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis had a little secret though; he'd never actually received head in real life, so he wasn't all too familiar on how this should go. Sure he'd seen his fair amount of porn videos, but that was like an overly sensationalized version that no real person could truly replicate. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Am I supposed to just put it in my mouth?\" he asked himself. \"What the actual fuck is happening... Fuck I can't even depossess Janice cuz I know she'll say no to him! Fuck man.. Fuck!\" Panic and nerves were surely getting the best of him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh and by the way, take off your jacket, c'mon, no girls suck dick looking like the Michelin Man! Aren't you hot anyway?\" David interrupted. With the comment Travis began to peel away Janice's coat, slowly revealing more of her feminine frame. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, Janice is always so covered up, she got some curves to her huh?\" David observed, working his eyes up and down Travis' borrowed body; the glare making him rather uncomfortable. \"You played with her titties yet?!?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis did his best to ignore all of David's insulting and degrading comments, figuring that maybe if he got started he'd shut up. He was right. With David standing beside his bed frame, Travis assumed the position on his knees. He took a deep breath in, gulped, and began to unzip David's jeans. As much as he wanted to avoid the sight, he could see the hard-on outline begging to be released from the tight grip of the pants. He reached his feminine hands just inside the zipper and pulled the dick free; he could hear David let out a quiet moan as if tension had been released; his member had been set free. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nStill concealed behind the fabric of his boxer briefs, Travis was face to face with a penis, a sight he never thought he'd see. He was quite glad it was not one of those monstrous cocks you see in pornos, thankful that David was Asian. Although it wasn't the biggest, it was still a penis, and Travis would have to live with himself the rest of his life knowing that he sucked off one of his high school classmates. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe reached one of her soft hands up through the opening in the leg of his bottoms and began to caress his shaft, immediately releasing David's moans and sexual tension. It was strange. Even though Travis detested the thought of what was about to happen, he was beginning to enjoy it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh god... was he right? Every part of me is female... I'm getting turned on aren't I?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could feel the butterflies in his stomach; his heart was absolutely racing. The familiar pulsating in his female parts returned. There was no denying it. Janice's body was turned on, and it wanted to please David to the fullest extent.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis continued to stroke the cock under the boxers, teasing David until it was time to consume his manhood. He pulled down the underwear and slowly pressed Janice's soft, full lips against the head of David's penis, causing him to erupt in pleasure.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"OhhhHHH--Fuck me.... Ah-Ahhh-ahhhh\" he moaned, reaching his hands to Janice's full head of hair, beginning to guide Travis through the process. He continued to make out with the tip, but it was clear David needed more. With a little bit of force behind him, Travis enveloped the shaft, sliding the tip and subsequent shaft down his dainty throat. He bobbed his head up and down, paying extra attention to swirl his tongue in the process. He could taste every intimate piece of David, warm salty juices beginning to slowly excrete out. With a free hand he reached up and cradled his balls, massaging them as though he was trying to milk David's manhood deep into his core.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"O-Oh god. I-I think I'm gonna cum\" he mustered out, making good on his promise that he'd be quick. Almost as if it were instinctual, Janice's body quickly deepthroated the cock as it began to convulse and contract. David firmly gripped the back of Janice's head and forced himself to the back of her throat, causing great amounts of gags from Travis. As he choked, David's semen began to squirt down the back of his throat, and Travis made sure to swallow every last drop. When the orgasm subsided Travis pulled himself away and gave the member a final kiss goodbye, almost thanking it for the experience. He had no idea what had come over him, but he didn't fight it. He just blew a man, and he enjoyed it with a certain lustful glee. In the moment, he wanted nothing more than to obey the masculine demands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReaching a hand up, he wiped away any residual cum from his mouth and tears from all the gagging. \"There you go David, you happy now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... that was incredible Jan, where did you learn something like that?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I-I don't know.. anyway...        </span></div></div>",

You still in there?\" As a response, 'Janice' gyrated her hips into David's reawakened cock, causing a few moans to slip out. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I'm here alright. Just thought I'd try to feel good\" he replied back. David gawked before pulling her body toward him, and with authority asked, \"Are you sure you want to get fucked by me?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeing within such close proximity to David, Janice's hormones went crazy, of course, helped by the fact Travis was curious. Janice pulled David into a deep kiss before looking him square in the eyes. \"I want you to fuck the shit out of my nerdy pussy Davie...and I need it now.\" With that settled, David slammed his hands onto the backside of Janice, helping to move the gyrating hips of the curvaceous nerd even more.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOutside the window however, Diego looked on, knowing his mission.... but maybe he could put it aside for a while.</span></div></div>",

I...\" she faltered, trailing off in both speech and consciousness; Ellie's eyes rolled back and body began to spasm, a scene Travis was all too familiar with. He watched in disbelief as her body stiffened, and then grew completely limp. Travis was frozen in fear, but knew he had to leave again quick. He jumped to his feet and dashed to the door, but not before being picked off by an almost superhuman Ellie.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Leaving so soon Travis? The sleepover is just beginning\" said the being housed inside Ellie. Diego had found him once again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What is wrong with you? You aren't the real Diego! Man what did they do to you in there?\" he barked back. \"If you were in my position you'd be doing the same thing!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah but you see Mr. Brown, I would not.\" Diego stated, with his regular voice. It was odd hearing the barotone voice come out of Ellie's pretty little mouth. \"I was brought about to stop the fools like you who were to abuse the IAP system! This enterprise is going to make millions and millions of dollars! But not as long as there are twerps like you looking to misuse the responsibility!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Diego continued his long running speech, Travis inched himself closer and closer to a desk lamp, thinking that it may be his only way out of this mess. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"You're far too sloppy Mr. Brown! You do know that the IAP suit we equipped you with has full logistical tracking! Every time you find a new body, and everything you do in that body we collect data on. There's no point in hiding, just surrender now and face the consequences!\" Diego concluded. He made a lunge towards the night stand area where Travis stood, only to be met with the lamp to the face. With one quick swing Diego, inside Ellie's body, was out cold, concussed on the bedroom floor. Travis grabbed Janice's bag and darted out of the house, running anywhere where Diego would not be. He got a few blocks away before becoming too exhausted, taking for granted the stamina bestowed upon him in Mia's body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"How are they tracking my spirit form? Whatever it is, I need to find it and shut it down ASAP\" he thought to himself, his mind racing a thousand miles per hour. He knew that for the time being there was no point in abandoning Janice's body, for wherever he would go, Diego couldn't be far behind. Travis had to make his mind up quick.       </span></div></div>",

Ellie Park, David Sim, or Edward Lee. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEllie Park was Janice's best friend. The two had known each other for many years, so possessing her would make talking to Janice very easy. Plus, Ellie was pretty cute, she just didn't know it. Since her priorities were school, school, and school, she didn't put much effort into her physical looks, but many of the boys at school could tell that she had it going on. Her clothes rarely flattered her figure, with outfits usually comprising of knee-length khaki skirts and blouses buttoned all the way up. The more Travis began entertaining the idea of borrowing Ellie the more he began to like it. \"Am I getting a ghost erection right now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDavid Sim and Edward Lee were two of the nerdiest boys in school, but the both shared one thing in common. They too were very good friends with Janice and thus had in's to communicate with her. After weighing in on being Ellie he really didn't want to go for one of these two, but perhaps being able to pee standing up again would be nice.</span></div></div>",

He braced himself, and thrusted his spirit at her at full speed.

She was too busy pouting and crying to really pay attention anyway. He slipped his way out of her clothes and slid the new dress up her curvaceous body. Travis truly couldn't believe what he saw when he looked in the mirror; he still hadn't gotten used to the fact that he could now be anyone he wanted, including incredibly hot women. Just then there were a couple loud bangs on the door. Diego and the men were here.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Excuse me ma'am, could you step out for a second, we just have a few questions we'd like to ask you\" stated one of the men.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh yes of course! I'm sorry, give me one second,\" Travis replied back, doing his best impression of a damsel in distress. He opened the door of the fitting room and stepped outside, greeting the men with his newfound female allure. He made sure to pull the neck of the dress down an inappropriate amount, hoping that his promiscuity could get him off the hook. \"What is it you fine men need from me hmm?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries ma'am we're just going to scan you down really quick and you can go about your day. You see we're looking for a <i>VERY</i> dangerous criminal, who has unprecedented powers. We need to stop him immediately, and we have been getting readings pointing to his presence at this mall,\" explained the bigger of the two men. He must have been the boss. Behind them stood Diego, though he had a different look to him. Almost like Bucky in the <i>Captain America</i> series; he was himself, but he wasn't really looking like himself ya know? Sorry for breaking the fourth wall there...<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe man pulled out what looked like one of those metal detector wands they used at high profile events, although this one looked way more high tech. \"Alrighty Miss if you could just spread your arms to the side and make a giant letter 'T' for me, we'll be done real fast.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis still stood there staring at Diego, starting to feel the pressure... showing his cleavage to these men clearly didn't do the trick. Maybe he'd get lucky and pass this little wand test; maybe his suit was high tech enough to hide his presence. He assumed the position and prayed for the best.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlmost instantaneously he set it off.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>*BEEP BEEP BEEP*</b><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"CODE 24! CODE 24! We found him!\" screamed the man. Travis was fucked. He knew that his only option at this point was to make an escape; he had to depossess this woman ASAP. Only problem is Travis has never done this before. He set all of his focus on becoming a ghostly figure again, trying to tone out the hectic surroundings. He could feel the woman's body get tackled, a sight surely unusual for those who had no insight as to what was going on. Regardless, he remained adamant in trying to escape. Just as he could feel himself disconnecting from her body, he felt a strange suction, almost as though his whole soul was being vacuumed up. He fought the sensation with all his might and freed himself from his host, now able to start his journey away from Diego and company. Travis tried flying away but found it too difficult as the previous vacuuming prevented him from doing so. Floating only a few feet above the woman's unconscious body and group of men, he could see Diego had pulled out a device meant to capture rogue spirits like Travis. It looked like some shit from <i>Ghostbusters</i>.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahh shit, just as I escape one problem I encounter another. And holy shit is this thing strong!\" Travis could feel himself being pulled, like an intense game of tug-o-war, with little chance of victory. He continued to fly upwards, out of the path of the vacuum, and Diego kept upping the power level.  He was being brought closer and closer, chances of escape diminishing. Travis looked down towards his imminent fate, preparing himself for harsh reprimands. It was then he noticed that on his suit there was a small subtle button, appearing to attach to some sort of propelling system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh I hope this shit does what I think it does!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that he slammed his had onto the button, activating his turbo mode. He rocketed himself out of Diego's jurisdiction, flying at hundreds of MPH out of the scene. He screamed and let out cheers of celebration as he was able to dodge a major bullet... for now. Only problem now is he had no idea how to deactivate turbo mode, meaning that he was now on a one-way trip to God knows where. That didn't really bother him though, as his new powers to possess people meant he could fit in anywhere he landed.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhere did Travis land up? </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>The blur of colors and lights around him came to an instant stop. At first, Travis thought something had gone wrong with the suit or him. After a little bit, his eyes adjusted, and he realized that he had ended up in a darkened room instead. He could tell it was a bedroom, but it didn\u2019t look familiar at all. That was somewhat worrying, but also reassuring as well considering that it might mean that he was nowhere near Diego and his goon squad.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe burble of conversation leaked through a set of doors across the room. Travis couldn\u2019t quite make it out, but it sounded about as familiar as the room looked. Drifting through the doors, his heart leapt into his throat. While the room hadn\u2019t been familiar, the sight of the towering metal structure covered with lights was, even if he had never seen it in person. He was certain that was the Eifel Tower, which meant that he had to be in Paris. He had traveled halfway around the globe within the span of only a few seconds.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nReturning to the room, Travis rubbed his mouth with the back of his hand. As enjoyable as all but being a ghost in Paris was, he was starting to miss having a body. His thoughts turned to heading out and seeing if he could find someone to posses. He was heading for the door when an electric tingle spread across his body. Before his eyes, his transparent suit and body started to change and shift. The formfitting suit became a slinky little red dress. His body became much more feminine as his hair lengthened. There was a bit of pain in his face as well, enough that he had to screw his eyes shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen he managed to open his eyes again, he jumped back in fright. The person standing before him did so as well. It took him several seconds to realize that he was looking at a mirror, and the person he was looking at was himself\u2026somehow. Rather than the familiar pasty face he should have been seeing, he instead had a striking young woman\u2019s face. With a frown, he tried to place why the face looked so recognizable. Like a clap of thunder, it hit him: it was the face of Tori Smith, the girl he fancied. From the look of things though, this was a version of Tori with the addition of few years.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt was both strange and thrilling to Travis, being in something like the body of his crush, the girl that didn't even seem to know he existed. He had no idea that the suit could do something like this, and didn\u2019t even care. In fact\u2026this seemed like the perfect time to try something he would never be able to do. His feminine doppelg\u00e4nger bit her lip as she reached up and cupped her breast. A moan escaped his throat from the sensation. It was so much better than he had been expecting.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSeveral minutes of further experimentation later, his breathing was fast and heavy. He took a bit of time to smooth his hair back into place and get any wrinkles out of his dress. He checked to make sure that the dangly earrings that came with the change weren\u2019t all tangled up in his hair. Satisfied, he was about to walk out the door, then another electric tingle went through his scalp. Darting back to the mirror, he saw that a nice little hat had appeared on his head, completing the outfit.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Travis admired the young woman staring back at him in the mirror, still in utter shock that he now, from head to toe, had the body of his long time crush Tori Smith. She reached a hand up and tilted her head back, running her nails down the soft angles of her feminine face. Travis gave himself a reassuring nod in the mirror and made for the door, ready to see what Paris had to offer. Just then a familiar electric tingle coursed through his new body, jolting him back a couple steps.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell is happening..\" he questioned, as he could feel his body shifting once again, this time back to a masculine frame. Tori's breasts absorbed back into the torso, and a familiar member could be felt regrowing between his legs. Within seconds he was himself again; pasty, chubby, normal... Travis Brown, reappearing in his school clothes from earlier and suit donned underneath.  <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wa--wait!\" he gasped looking around the room. \"How am I me again? I saw my body in the facility when I flew out.... Where did that sexy dress go? Where did my tits go?? UGhhh.. Fuck!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe rummaged around the room trying to reactivate the transformation, though nothing happened. After beginning to accept the fact that he maybe wouldn't be able to experience the city as a beautiful woman, he once again walked to the door. Gripping the knob he swung the door open and stepped into the hallway finding the source of all the previous conversation. Crowding the halls were all types of tourists, speaking every which foreign language imaginable. He couldn't make out what was being said, but he did hear some startling words...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Pu\u00f2 <i>possedere</i> le persone? che paura\" said one man to a colleague of his.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"\u00a1La <i>posesi\u00f3n</i> es obra del diablo!\" he overheard another man say.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Are they talking about.... nah it couldn't be me...\" he thought to himself. Travis doubted that he, just normal ol' Travis Brown could be the center of international news.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe shook his head and walked down the nearest stairway into the lobby, where the TV had the local news playing. Travis again couldn't make out anything being said, but the scene on the TV was easily recognizable. Although it was grainy, he knew what was happening. On the screen he could see the woman from the mall, being tackled by Diego and the DYNAMO goons. He watched the entire scene in disbelief, realizing that he was now an internationally wanted man. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"On pense qu'il peut aussi changer de forme. Si vous le voyez, veuillez contacter les autorit\u00e9s imm\u00e9diatement,\" said the newswoman. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"changer de forme..?\" he pondered. \"So that explains how I turned into that older Tori clone... And maybe that explains how I'm me again... I'm a clone of me!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis knew that this shapeshifting power from the suit would be the key to his survival, and he needed to learn more about it ASAP. If he stuck around any longer in his current form people may recognize him, so he darted for the nearest restroom to try it once more.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>While running to the restroom Travis took glances at the faces passing by, trying his best to remember one he could wear for the time being. Many of them too blurry for replication, but one stuck out clear in his mind. When he first got into the lobby he noticed a beautiful young woman, about mid-20s in age, whose attractiveness was burned into his mind. Her shoulder length, wavy brown hair, cascading in soft waterfalls down her head; her perfectly symmetrical face, accentuated by her full, voluptuous lips. In a nice form fitting dress, she looked like an absolute angel, each curve delicately highlighted. Simply put, she was stunning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBefore bursting into the restroom he peered to see if she was still in the lobby, but Travis saw nothing. He started walking through the door when he realized a major fuck-up he was about to commit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah shit... I have to go into the women's restroom...\" he worried to himself. He knew he couldn't go in the men's restroom and come out as a goddess; he had to sneak into what would be the correct bathroom. With that he slowly creaked open the adjacent door for the women's restroom, peering his head inside to see if anybody would catch him. With it appearing to be vacant, he darted for the closest stall, anxious to be out of any and all view. He rattled the stall with his violent entrance and sealed it shut.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"okay okay okay Trav you can do this\" he stuttered to himself. He'd never done something on command like this so he was understandably nervous. He closed his eyes, and just as he focused to depossess the woman at the mall, he focused now on becoming the woman from the lobby. Travis felt a slight tingle beginning to course and knew he was on the right path.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe familiar electric shock returned and he could feel his physicality truly begin to change shape. It started with his height; a sharp pain ran through his lower body as he shrunk a couple inches down to about 5'6\". He could feel his hips widening, and filling with generous amounts of tender muscle and fat. His cock slowly retracted until he had nothing but a tight slit between his thighs. His chubby stomach sunk inwards, revealing a flat toned abdomen, the source of much envy from other women. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*CRUNCH CRUNCH*<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AHHHhhhhhh\" he grimaced in silence, trying his best not to create any noise. It felt as though his ribs had broken, and perhaps they had, but he was left with a perfect hourglass figure. The sensations continued to run their course, next making a stop on his chest. His breathing got a bit difficult as the weight on his torso increased; filling to an A-cup.. B-cup... stopping at a perky C-cup, Travis was getting lightheaded. The twisting sensation returned in his face as his eyes swoll shut. When he was able to reopen them, he truly felt like a completely different person. He ran his fingers through some of the hair now tickling his neck, and sure enough it looked just as wavy and voluminous as the lady's earlier. He looked downwards at himself and as the same form-fitting dress upon his body; it was leaving little to the imagination. Just as quickly as he burst into the stall he jumped right out, welcomed in the mirror by the sight of this beautiful French doppelg\u00e4nger. With the same curiosity he used while exploring Tori he peered at this woman in the mirror. He probed at her pouty lips and admired the supple touch of her skin. He bounced up and down a couple times to feel her breasts move, the classic first action whenever a man first enters a woman's body. He gathered his attention away from the new facets of the body and refocused on what to do from here.        </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Travis sighed and composed himself as his body was struggling to get used to the form he had become. He slowly felt his healthy figure for a second feeling, taking in the strange pleasure of it all. He focused his mind to try to do what little research he could on his powers and the best way to do that was well practice. Travis decided to see if he could dematerialize back into a ghost and fly away to some place where he could collect his thoughts. Given he was being searched for in the hotel, he guessed this place was off-limits too. He focused hard for a second as a heavy pain ran through his chest. The familiar crunch could be heard for a second as he floats in the middle of the room, the body he had been using now gone, strangely returning to his old male form. \"What the fuck... why is there another me again there...\" he observed, questioning why he saw his own body passed out on the ground once more. Realizing he didn't have much time to ponder, Travis fled the hotel and tried to find a good place to hide and plan things out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe found another fancy hotel located nearby and snuck into a room where he could think about the situation he was in and what he could do to get out. He knew that he could be detected possessing someone and changing into someone else would only work for a bit before he was found out again so that wasn't a foolproof plan either. He plopped on the bed in disappointment, not before noticing there was a help button on the suit, possibly clueing him in to other things it could do.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis slowly lowered his hand and pressed the help button, immediately ringing out a voice in his head. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hello Travis, I am the AIS Astral Integration Suit. If you have pressed the help button please state what services you require,\" said a feminine voice. Travis looked around the room confused but quickly gathered his thoughts. <br>\r\n\"I need to know the powers and limitations of the AIS.\" he shouted, resulting in an equally quick response.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This AIS unit has several features such as allowing the users body to project it's consciousness to other locations, create close to if not realistic copies of one's self; to change and become others when need be, or possess living organisms of your intelligent level or lower. There are other powers but they are currently locked.\" Afterwards the voice goes silent again. Travis' excitement was piqued. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait so I can become anyone or anything I wish?\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nIt replies: \"Yes if you share a similar intelligence level.\" Travis smiled as he thinks on trying to become Tori. If he was in this terrible situation he was going to try to have fun... If only it actually worked. This time there was no cracking sound or odd lights or anything. He look at the suit and said. \"Hey why didn't I change or anything?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe got a response quickly. \"You must allow me further integration with you User, that way I can access your mind for the image and mental views better and without risk.\" Travis was okay with this; He gave the suit a quick yes and felt a shock go up his spine as the suit seemed to become a bit tighter and even grow up his head a little. \"Okay Travis Brown I have full accesses to your mentalscape and with it I can create any disguise you wish of any for race or gender.\" Travis smiled as he began to think of...Nothing. His brain was totally blank of any one who could help him get out of the situation he was in. He wanted to scream but he was afraid to alarm anyone when the suit spoke again.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Travis Brown with the further integration I have unlocked the ability to create whole new disguises and forms for you when need be.\" Travis looked confused.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the heck does that mean?\" The suit responded once more.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"It means I can shift a completely new identity for you created from scratch with no problems for you. Even if you lack the complete thought on what you want.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis looked excited so much he shouted: \"Sweet! With this I can handle Diego and fix everything! So mind if we give it a test drive?\" Travis asked AIS who responded with. \"Of course Travis Brown. Beginning process now.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis thought of the identity he had wanted to become, a tribal princess. As the thought was made Travis' body was consumed by surrounding lights, consuming his vision; the sound of cracks and breaks could be heard but no pain came to him this time around, as his figure shifted and changed. As the light show ended he found him self a bit shorter.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"What happened?\" He asked now shocked by a feminine but strong voice saying what he wanted to say. He rushed into the bathroom and find a mirror. looking back at Travis was a women with short hair reaching his ears, light tan skin covering toned muscles from years of work, a healthy bust line currently covered by a fabric bra and a number of tattoos on his arms and legs and a outfit seemingly ripped out from Xena warrior princess.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"AIS what is this?\" Travis asked still surprised by the voice he had. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAIS responded quickly. \"This form is the closest I could reproduce with out any form of relation to other living persons if you wish me to change certain features please say so Travis.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTravis shook his head. \"No no this is a good start hold on.\" For a second Travis tried to focus on how she would act. Suddenly, it seemed something came over him and he spoke out...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n \"Triana bored! Need to entertain self!\" Travis's new voice said. Walking out of the room her foot steps grew more heavy; her posture was much different as she walked upright, and though she had purpose. Shoulders level, back straight as she was about to walk out of the room. Luckily Travis took control again stopping his form just before things went too far. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay what the hell was that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAIS Spoke once more. \"The personality replicator was activated when you tried to act like her creating a near perfect personality to match.\" Travis was happy this could help a lot as long as he didn't lose control again. He walked back into the bathroom where he tried to think of what to change into next.</span></div></div>",

His body starts to move and shake as he tries to repeat something he had seen a few times online. His body started to do a simple tribe dance. Her actions were quick and fast if not a bit heavy in places. The body seemed to take control easily as the other personality went to work. \"Triana is ready to prepare for hunt! All shall fall to me!\" she said proudly as the dance continued for a bit. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThat is until a feeling of control returns, and he stumbles with a heavy thud. \"Okay that was fun but what else...\"  She then gets up to walk back into the bathroom.<br>\r\n <br>\r\nAs he stared back into the mirror it seemed that Triana had one last thing for him. \"Puny man is weak I don't need you.\" This shocked Travis back to himself right quick.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Okay... need to watch the personality stuff... also need to remember that they seem to know I exist in all of this.\" Travis looked into the mirror and tried to think of what would be the best option for this. There were plenty of people he could become to help this problem.  His brain tried to think of many forms that could work; AIS was giving him tastes here and there but they were only flashes. Suddenly a weird idea came to him; a disguise that could get him to a few places, or more specifically out of the hotel with out problems.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAIS's synthetic voice triggered again. \"An odd form to chose from but if you wish it.\" He had said nothing to trigger the suit but it worked without voice activation. Travis's body shifted and changed again. His hair grew out quickly changing to a bright blond; a vale appeared and covered his view as his body cracked and popped into a more feminine shape once again. This time rather than the tribal tats and loin cloth, Travis's clothes shifted into pure white dress reaching the floor. It seemed to be a beautiful wedding gown, covering his newly formed body. He didn't mind as his eyes seemed changed to a bright green color. He smiled at the image he saw in the mirror, but a thought came to his head as he looked back at the reflection.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\"Shit we are missing the most important part.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAIS's voice chimed in. \"I can form a boutique  of flowers if that is what we are missing Travis.\" He shook his head, noticing that he was indeed missing that, but figured he could worry about that later as he spoke again: \"No I'm missing a groom! The whole idea would be I would use it to leave, saying we spent the night here before heading home.\" Travis look more depressed as he saw his image sadden. It was always bad to see a sad woman in a wedding dress but AIS spoke again. \"A simple thing to fix Travis. All we need to do is for you to create a clone.\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis looked back to the mirror; an odd flash came over it as he asked. \"Wait can we do that?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe image in the mirror responded. \"Yes I believe I had informed you about this ability when you first activated the help feature.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nTravis scratched his chin for a second to think but then said: \"You might've... I guess the shock of hearing you and the suit's other powers kind of made me focus on other things.\"<br>\r\n <br>\r\nShe gave a small robotic chuckle after that but the mirror image gave no response as it stopped mimicking his actions. He coughed. \"So how do I do this cloning thing?\" The image started to move again. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"User Travis will need to focus on what he wishes the clone to look like. Since he is in a disguise form it should be a little easier for you to pick a matching form hopefully.\" AIS sounded a little passive-aggressive at the end of that sentence but Travis neither noticed nor cared as he began to focus on the body of the clone. In the end he decided to just make it a copy of him with a few differences like hair and eyes, just so they wouldn't be noticed for who he truly was. In seconds a copy of him in a tuxedo stood before him but his expression was dulled. He seemed to smile but like he was trying to force it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is it alright? Looks kind of brain dead.\" Travis said as AIS's mirror image flashed and spoke.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"The clone follows your mental orders as you wish Travis.\" Travis smiled as he put his plan in action.</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Travis tried to make the clone speak, almost telepathically, like a grand ventriloquist act. He focused on a conversation that felt appropriate and organic, something that could fool any and everybody.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey honey, you okay? You look a bit faint. Here, let me get you some water,\" uttered the groom clone before walking towards the bathroom of the hotel room.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit AIS! I love you! This is perfect, this is our ticket back to the states!\" he said gleefully to his AI system.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe suit calculated its response back: \"Watch it there Travis, you are a married woman you know\" it said with a sarcastic undertone. \"Allow me to arrange more appropriate attire for travels\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis stood there as the long, elegant gown began to quiver, slowly changing in both shape and color. The bottom half wrapped around his legs, like a boa constrictor slowly suffocating its prey. At first the sensation was quite uncomfortable, but it was quickly replaced with the familiar feeling of denim on his legs. Though much tighter than he was expecting, the jeans hugged his new figure in all the right places highlighting the luscious curves of his feminine body. His upper body was engulfed too, slowly transforming into a black bodysuit top complimented with an oversized flowy cardigan. The bodysuit was skin tight, and as one could imagine showed a lot of her supple flesh. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god... this outfit you threw together! I'm so goddamn hot!!\" Travis exclaimed while running his hands up and down the curves of this body.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"It's my pleasure. I added the oversized cardigan so that you personally may enjoy the endowments of the beautiful female anatomy, while also hiding to the outside world what you have. If not for the cardigan, the whole world would be attracted to the allure of your physicality, and we cannot have that now can we?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Absolute genius\" he responded back rather simply.       <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAnd with that Travis in his beautiful young bride disguise, and his wraith of a groom made for the airport, eager to dismantle Diego, his goons, and all of DYNAMO once and for all. He knew that it would be no easy task, but with his newly discovered powers, and deeper connection to his AI system, he could definitely do it. The duo hailed a cab and made it through the entire ride drawing no suspicion. The two held conversations with the driver about everything from the food they had \"eaten\" to the kiss they shared at the top of the Eiffel Tower. It was becoming to come very easy, which both intrigued yet frightened Travis. How did he find having a full conversation with himself so easy?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe couple waved their driver off and walked into the terminal, ready to finally get back home. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait! Shit... AIS, how am I--we supposed to get past security?? We have no passports! This couple I'm pretending to be aren't even real people!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No worries Travis, assembling travel documents now...\" the machine responded. Travis tightened his brows, confused how the suit would get him out of this. In the span of just a few moments he could feel something appear in his pocket. He reached a hand inside and pulled out an American passport.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Maryanne Kent...\" he read aloud, \"is that my name now?\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Yes Travis, and your husband's name is Trevor White. I couldn't care to generate a better name for this clone, so I just went with a variation of yours.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis let out a girly giggle to himself, knowing that this plan was almost foolproof. Although AIS made the impossible into reality, there was a part of himself that was still extremely anxious about what would happen when he reached the customs agent. It was as though he had PTSD from being caught once already; he was worried these people would be onto him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then Travis' dazed panic attack was interrupted by a heavily French accented: \"NEXT!\" He darted his head up and locked eyes with the agent, only further raising his already rapid heart rate.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"So what is the purpose of your travels hmmm?\" the agent asked.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"We're just traveling back home. Enjoyed our time in your lovely country but time to head back to reality you know?\" his clone Trevor stated.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe agent raised a suspicious eyebrow and snatched the two passports from their hands. He scanned through the pages which to Travis' surprise were filled with stamps from many different countries. The agent ran them under UV light and electronic scanners, and everything checked out. AIS had successfully created a Maryanne Kent and Trevor White. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Have safe travels you two, and congratulations on the marriage\" the agent said as he handed back the passports. Travis felt as though a literal ton had been lifted off his back. He wished a good day to the man and danced off on his way, arm in arm with his \"husband.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<i>*Attention. Attention. We are now boarding for flight 88. Again, boarding has begun for flight 88. Thank you*</i><br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis looked his partner in the eye and gave a nod, as though he was giving him a mental, \"we got this.\" They stood up from their seats and made for the airplane, prepared for what was to come next.... or were they...</span></div></div>",

This really must be some hidden government technology shit\" he giggled to himself. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis was still getting used to flying, so much of his first motions were incredibly uncoordinated, but naturally he got a hang of it. Flying at a speed much faster than he anticipated, he reached home in no time, landing himself on the doorstep and opening the door... or at least trying to open it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wait, what the...\" he questioned as his hand just phased through it. Travis wasn't quite adjusted to the fact that he no longer had his own physical form. He sent himself right in, only to find his family seemingly unfazed by his absence. His father was preparing dinner for the family, his mother was vacuuming the hallway, his brother Jason (15 years old) was playing video games, and his sister Angelica (20 years old) was getting ready to go on a date with her boyfriend; overall, it was just like any other Friday afternoon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Dad, you're not gonna believe this but... Dad!\" Travis exclaimed, noticing that his father paid no attention to him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey honey! Do you know where the turmeric is? I need it for the chicken tonight,\" said his father, clearly unaware of Travis' presence. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nQuickly it dawned on Travis that he no longer could interact with tangible objects, but he could also no longer physically interact with people in general.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Well shit... seems like the only way I can alert my family is if I possess one of them and use them as a medium for this...

I already know what it's like to be a dude...\" he thought to himself. \"Might as well go for Angelica and see what life is like on the other side,\" Travis said with a smirk. He floated his way through the ceiling and straight into Angelica's bedroom, where he found her getting ready for a date with her man, Dante. At the moment she was only in a bra and underwear, leaning over her dresser, picking out what she wanted to wear. It was a sight that felt so intrusive and wrong, yet Travis couldn't peel his eyes away. Watching her dig through the clothes, he could see the soft jiggle in her cleavage with each slight movement. He gazed at her full, bubbly ass as she bent further down to go through a lower drawer. The way her ass cheeks enveloped her tight panties revealing her golden-kissed skin; the way her toned legs moved like that of a super model walk; the way her breasts stood perky upon her chest. Travis needed to feel what it was like to have her allure. Yes, she was his sister, but once he was inside her there was no more Travis, just Angelica. Angelica would just be doing Angelica things then, and what is wrong with that?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe could hold back no more; the combination of his lust and curiosity pushed him to action. She continued to probe through her clothes looking for the perfect outfit for her date when suddenly she felt very... strange. She coughed a little to clear her throat and grabbed at her chest, noticing a sudden sensation of heartburn. Angelica stood up to grab some water on the nearby nightstand when she was struck with the lightheadedness. She collapsed onto the bed and felt a wave of cool numbness begin to course through her body. The room was spinning and her consciousness was slowly fading.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wha--what is happening..\" she groaned as she continued to grasp at her heart. She was growing increasingly weak and thus couldn't cry out to Jason or their parents for help. She was at Travis' mercy. He had begun the process simply by inserting his ghostly arm into her back, thinking that perhaps he could just faze in, though apparently there was more to it than that. He felt sorry for the pain he was inflicting upon her, though his own selfish attitudes were seemingly getting the better of him. He dug himself deeper into her, watching as her facial expressions turned to pure agony. He hadn't the faintest idea what he was doing, and unfortunately Angelica was the test dummy at his disposal. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe wiggled in pain on the bed as Travis maneuvered his spectral arm throughout her body trying desperately to gain full control of his sister's sultry, tight, fertile body. He shifted deeper and deeper to no avail, until he saw her right arm begin to twitch. After all his searching he could feel warmth again, and knew that he was finally on the right path. That warmth reinvigorated his previous aggression and he followed it vehemently, sliding his lost arm into a warm sleeve. When he moved his arm this time he got a very different result; Angelica moved her arm in every which was he told his arm to move! He'd done it, he knew how to possess her.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"pl--pl-please God, make this stop...\" Angelica cried and pleaded. With tears streaming down her face she was forced to watch in terror as she no longer had control of her own arm. To her, it moved at its own will. She stared at the slow twitches and gentle finger movements, gazing at her own body coming back to life, just this time under somebody else's control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis moved his other arm into her left arm, now having control of both appendages. Using his new arms, he propped his sister's body up against where the bed met the wall and began assuming his dominance over her helpless body. With her muffled cries in the background, he slowly merged his lower body into hers, and followed that with his torso. Travis' manly thighs melted into her tight, toned feminine ones, and he wiggled his toes, watching her dainty feet reflect his bodily commands. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAngelica's eyes darted around the room trying to catch a glimpse of who/what was doing this to her, but she had no hope. At this point it was pure silence coming out of her mouth. Tears were still falling, and the veins on her neck were strained outwards by her silent screams; there was nothing more she could do but fall co-pilot to her own body. With that, Travis slid his consciousness into her head, and everything went black.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis was awakened by a combination of a pounding headache and a cool breeze coming over his body. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh my god, what the hell kind of headache is this...\" he thought to himself, raising his hand to his temple to massage it out a little. He was a bit sensitive to the light peering into the room, so opening his eyes at the moment proved to be difficult. He sat himself up from the bed he laid upon nearly fell off, quite uneasy from whatever had just happened.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What the hell happened to me... all I remember was Angelica and then... wait.. Angelica!\" As though all the symptoms miraculously passed, he quickly turned his attention to the adjacent mirror, catching a glimpse that made his heart race. Instead of being greeted by the usual suspect, Travis Brown peering back at him in the mirror, he was now eye-to-eye with his sister Angelica. Like the scene from <i>Tarzan</i>, he lifted his arm and watched as Angelica in the mirror would do the same. He moved in closer and saw she did the same.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Holy shit... it worked!\" he screamed, allowing Angelica's voice to escape his mouth. \"Wait holy shit... is this what I sound like now??\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nJust then a knock came at the door.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey Angelica sweetie, you okay? I heard you yell something just now...\" asked their father.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh... uhhh.. nothing is wrong Dad, sorry! Dante just texted me something.. heh\" he nervously explained through the door. His heart was about to beat out of his chest. He couldn't believe what had happened. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe refocused his attention on the mirror and cupped Angelica's breasts. With an evil smile and seductive look in his eye, Travis was ready for this adventure. \"Oh Angelica, are we gonna have some fun tonight\" he giggled.</span></div></div>",

I bet if this 'Dynamo' place gave me some weird special powers, they gave Diego some too\" Travis thought so himself. \"And if there's one place I know Diego would go to test out his powers, it'd be that party tonight!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that Travis thwarted his astral self upwards through the ceiling of the Dynamo Operations facility, leaving his physical body behind, and found himself overlooking the tri-city area from a bird's eye view. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Huh... how could I have missed something like this? Has this building always been here? Heh, they must be on some real lowkey government shit...\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe serenity from above provided Travis with the atmosphere for brainstorming he needed, and ultimately narrowed down his candidates to a few people:<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe first person he considered to use his powers on was Tori Smith, his crush. Tori was a beautiful girl who moved to the tri-city area from Hawaii only a few years ago, but made many friends very quickly as she is an \"instagram model\" with thousands of followers. Of course she had an automatic invite to the party, so \"borrowing\" her would be the green light he needed, and possibly his ticket to reuniting with Diego. Along with that, Travis didn't need to look far for her house, as her constant postings on <i>Snapchat</i> and <i>Instagram</i> allowed many people to know the neighborhood where she lived. He'd always been curious what life would be like as a girl, so why not be someone who is as stunningly gorgeous as Tori?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNext was Tori's best friend, Vanessa Martinez. Vanessa is a half-Mexican, half-White girl who hands-down has the nicest ass on campus; there's rumors that a guy in her fourth period physics class came in his pants just from watching her walk up to the board. Much like Tori, guys drooled over Vanessa, and she loved every bit of attention she got. She too would be going to the party, and since she is Diego's crush, Travis knew that he'd be looking for her at the party. Plus, since Travis has always been such an outcast, it'd probably be fun to be the center of attention for once.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe last main option was Blake Rodgers, the quarterback of the football team. Blake was probably the biggest douchebag at school, but damn could he back it up. Not only was he destined for a Division 1 college, he was also bagging all kinds of pussy on campus. Travis especially loathed Blake because there were many rumors that he and Tori hooked up at a party junior year. Even though Tori barely even knew of Travis' existence, he thought highly of her, and got jealous if any other guy even said \"hi\" to her. He knew that if he wanted to get close to Tori, he'd have to possess Blake. Hey, maybe he'd get lucky at the party.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nOf course there are other options too, so what does he do?    <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

He was growing increasingly frustrated until he heard something that caught his attention:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n          <i><font class=\"size2\" style=\"\">\"Thought I'd end up with Sean, but he wasn't a match. Wrote some songs about Ricky...\"</font></i><br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Is that... Ariana Grande playing?\" he asked himself. \"Wait that must mean!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith lightning speed Travis flew towards the music, stopping himself at the closed bathroom door.  Muffled by the sounds of a running shower and the ventilation fan, he could vaguely hear a female voice singing along to the track.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Thank you, next! Thank you, next!\" she sang emphatically. \"I'm so fucking grateful for my ex!\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow, she isn't exactly the best singer... thank god she's smokin' hot\" Travis sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe slipped himself through the door to be met by a curvaceous and beautiful female silhouette, shrouded in steam behind the sealed shower curtain, dancing along to the beat of the music. Travis wasn't exactly a \"lady's man,\" so laying eyes on the nude feminine body in front of him was a rather exotic experience. Sure he watched a fair amount of porn, but seeing this more untouched and pure form aroused him to new heights. He gazed and admired at the fluidity of her movements; the way her hips gyrated and swayed, the way her shoulders rolled, the way she had a playful jiggle to her. Travis could barely contain himself, and was practically drooling at the opportunity to be this girl. He wanted so desperately to tear away the curtains so he could not only see her voluptuous ass and well-developed breasts, but also so he could speed up the process, but he knew he had to wait for the right opportunity. The feminine figure behind the curtain continued to dance and sing, taking her sweet time in the shower.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Come the fuck on already! Give me a little something to work with here!\" Travis begged. Just then, he saw his window of opportunity open. He watched as she reached a hand out of the shower, searching for some body wash to give her legs a lather. Travis knew this was the time, as her bent over posture provided him with the clear entrance he needed: her pussy. Because of the curtain, he could not see her tight opening, but he knew it was right there. He took a deep breath in and plunged his way towards the female frame, knocking the body against the shower wall as he forced himself in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ahhhhhhh.. mmhmmmmm.. ahhhhh!\" she half-screamed, half-moaned. Travis was unaware of it, but his ethereal form sliding in through her pussy acted as the biggest cock she had ever taken in her life, parting her vaginal lips and fulfilling the unknown needs of the heart of her femininity. He dug deeper and deeper into her warm opening until every bit of his astral self slipped in.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Oh go...ahhh mmmhmmm.. what's.. ahhh... hap.. happening to me\" she cried, finding it difficult to speak as her body was nearing climax. She threw her hands down to her pussy, trying to grab at whatever just made its way in, but there was nothing there. She ran her hands over her lower abdomen as her uterus felt uncomfortably full, only there was no bulging or bloating to be found. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBecause this was Travis' first host, he didn't really know what to do; he didn't really know how to go about possessing someone.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, so a brain controls everything right? Maybe I just kinda unplug her and plug myself in... sounds good. Okay. Cool,\" he said so himself, obviously nervous about what was about to happen. He continued to crawl himself through her warm crevices until he reached her spinal cord. Travis knew that this was the literal backbone of the nervous system, and tapping in here would be like taking the fast track to full on possession. He gingerly reached for the spinal cord, instantly zapping his conscious into every bit of her body; from the neurons of her brain, to the tips of her toes, Travis was now in control.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis immediately woke up to the sensation of warm water coursing over his body, and Ariana Grande blasting through the laptop speakers. His vision blurred water in his eyes and steam in the air, he reached up to turn off the shower, taking note in how petite and well-manicured his new hands were. He gasped in pure delight at the sight of the feminine hand; it worked! Travis actually could possess anybody he pleased. He stood himself up in the shower only to be thrown off by his new center of balance. Travis was much shorter now, and found his weight distributed much differently than his regular body. He reached his hands up and gave his new breasts a firm squeeze, providing the well-needed reassurance that this was indeed happening.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow my tits are nice!\" he exclaimed in excitement. \"Holy shit is that my voice!? Testing, testing. One two one two. Hello?\" he teased, observing how his voice was now a few octaves higher. \"Hi, Travis Brown here, and this is my new body\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe stepped out of the shower and began to dry himself off, rubbing the towel over all of his new unfamiliar parts. He reached up to the mirror and began to wipe off the steam revealing a distorted female face. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis rubbed and rubbed some more, and whose face did he see looking back at him?<br>\r\n   </span></div></div>",

It was beyond anything he could have imagined, as he was so used to seeing the musty ol' Travis Brown when he looked in the mirror, though now his eyes were being met by none other than the beautiful Tori Smith. He raised his right hand up and gazed as Tori mirrored him. He blinked and watched as she did the same. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"This is just so insane! I can't believe it actually worked!\" he stated in disbelief. As much as he wanted to revel in everything that was Tori's body, he knew everyone would be expecting her at the party, so he needed to get ready. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"I mean... we can still have some fun while I get ready, right Tori?\" he giggled in her voice. Looking like a goddess emerging from the gates of heaven, shrouded in steam, he opened the bathroom door and marched towards her bedroom. Travis, giddy with excitement, paid close attention to close and lock the bedroom door behind him, so nobody could possibly interfere with his activities. He directed his attention towards her full length mirror and dropped the towel, revealing her previously concealed divine body. Travis was in absolute awe as the most beautiful girl in the school was now flaunting her perfect body, all for his enjoyment. He first gave attention to her breasts, a soft handful each, heavy and warm with a gentle upsweep; perky with a natural teenage bounce, but still firm. He marveled in the light and creamy complexion compared to the tan skin on the rest of her body, with areola so perfect, about the size of a quarter, and provided a nice darker color for contrast. Topping them off were her tiny hard nipples, the centers for sexual pleasure, like little erasers just begging to be nibbled and sucked. Travis kneaded her supple breasts, losing himself in the sight of Tori Smith playing with herself. He could feel a pressure building downstairs, only now there was no erection, just lubrication. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Fuck I'm so horny,\" Travis moaned in Tori's body. He longed to continue with this exploration but knew he had to stop and get ready. Just then he heard her phone buzz. On her bed he could see the screen was lit up, clear that Tori had just received a notification. Travis picked up the phone and looked to see who it was... </span></div></div>",

I know Tori's gotta have some real hot clothes for nights like these\" he said devilishly, eying out her wardrobe. He walked across the room, practicing Tori's signature model strut, nearly tripping over his own feet in the process. \"Geez Tori, can't you just walk normal?\" he complained as though she could reply. He knew that if he was going to convince people that he was tori, he'd need to perfect her mannerisms.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis reached for the dresser and opened the top drawer, filled to the brim with her panties. \"Damn, how much underwear could a girl need??\" He dug through trying to find something that radiated sexiness, and at the bottom he found exactly what he was looking for. He pulled out a red lacy thong from Victoria's Secret, tags attached still and all. \"Ohohoh, were you savin' these for a special occasion or something? Don't worry, I'll be sure to get good use out of them\" he sneered.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis slowly slid the panties up Tori's long, alluring legs, over her hips, to their final position upon her bare apple-bottom ass. He turned around and gave a look at himself, jiggling her delicate ass in the mirror for show; tucking his fingers into the crevices where her cheeks met her thighs, he playfully toyed with her bouncy ass, lifting the cheeks and watching in amusement as gravity took control. \"Now Tori, you must have a matching bra for these panties right?\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe went to the drawer immediately below, and lo and behold he found the matching bra. \"Now we're talking...\" he snickered. Travis understandably struggled getting the bra on, as he had never dealt with one before, needing to strap it in the front and twirl it around to fit. He turned it the right way and slipped each of her breasts in, making sure to give each a squeeze before resuming. \"I know it might be the last time I can touch these for a few hours so I had to get it in. Hehehe sorry Tori\" Travis said playfully. He dug around the rest of her wardrobe and pulled out a nice red, revealing tank top and some daisy dukes to head to the party in. He put each on and gave himself one final look in the mirror. Now Tori didn't have the biggest boobs, but she was well-endowed, revealing a fair amount of cleavage in the top Travis decided to wear. Her shorts also showed the bottoms of her budding ass cheeks, a move that was well-calculated on Travis' behalf.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Going from no attention, to all the attention... Tonight should be fun,\" Travis said, winking at himself in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n*HONK HONK* <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hey pendeja! I'm here! Let's gooooo!\" Vanessa screamed from her car. Travis grabbed Tori's purse and headed out the door to meet her. He hopped in the car and was greeted by...             </span></div></div>",

With the fabric properly stretched, the outline of her panties was easily visible whenever she bent over or sat down. Vanessa and her leggings were enough to draw any man\u2019s (and some women's) lustful gaze... and Travis was definitely one of those men!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFollowing closely behind her as she waltzed over and re-entered the bathroom, she began texting someone on her phone before taking a few selfies in the mirror. At this point Travis began looking for an opportunity to dive in... and he soon got it. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa suddenly smirked, one filled with lust and mild amusement, before muttering softly to herself...<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u201cOh Blake... you <i>naughty</i> dog! I suppose <i>one</i> picture won\u2019t hurt?\u201d she giggled.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAt first Travis was confused, was she taking about <i>the</i> Blake he knew and loathed? Or someone else named Blake? He didn\u2019t have too much time to contemplate her words before she did something truly remarkable. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa went about setting her phone down on the counter and turned around so that her back faced the bathroom mirror, and coincidently Travis. He admired in aroused amazement as she proceeded to hook her thumbs into the waistband of her leggings and shimmy them down her bodacious thighs. This gave Travis an amazing view of her toned and well-filled ass (now only clad in lacy purple panties). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis was something most men could only dream of, but Travis was going to make it a reality, <i>his</i> reality. With a lust-filled smile of his own, Travis reeled back before shooting forwards. His target? Vanessa\u2019s asshole... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nVanessa herself had only just managed to pull the leggings down to her mid-upper thighs when she felt the sensation of an unfamiliar entity forcing itself upon her. Thankfully she managed to catch herself on the toilet, now bent over the said piece of plumbing. Though she did not mean to, she reacted quickly with quick with a soft, pleasureful whimper as she felt something BIG forcing its way into her tight asshole. Far larger than anything else that she\u2019d had in there... <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLetting out a subsequent series of moans and groans as the mysterious object filled every knook and cranny of her essence, Vanessa could only clench her rear tightly in hopes of stopping it. However she also secretly wished it wouldn\u2019t; it felt twice as pleasurable as anything she\u2019d felt before... and soon enough she was making that obvious with her words.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n\u201cUgh... ah!... oooh yesss!... OOooh! H-harder! O-oh fuck d-don\u2019t stop!... Oh GOD!\u201d <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShe helplessly cried as one of her hands slinked down to her panty clad crotch, where she began stroking her soaking slit through the fabric of her underwear. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nEventually however...</span></div></div>",

He'd never possessed anyone before, creating many nerves to arise.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow.. okay.. so is this kinda like how I imagine? Just fly into her? Shit, what if it doesn't work.. man this is probably still some fucked up dream, no way I'm about to become Vanessa... I mean, whatever though, let's see what happens..\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWith that brief inner monologue Travis prepared to become the beautiful and popular Vanessa Marquez. He watched as she weaved back and forth between her bedroom and bathroom, obviously still finishing up before the party. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Ah the make up, I like it Vanessa..\" he snickered to himself, \" it's go time\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThis time he followed her into her bedroom and waited for her to fixate her attention on something; all he needed was a split second. She dug around a drawer, turned on her TV, and closed her bedroom window, never really giving Travis the pause he needed. Just then she picked up her phone, the biggest mistake she could have made.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis floated right up to her, even going so far as waving his hands in front of her face, but drew no response. \"This bitch doesn't know what's about to hit her...\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Vanessa scrolled through her feed she was interrupted by a choking sensation.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"What's happening..?\" she gasped, struggling to both breath and speak. Travis wrapped one of his hands around her neck, tight enough to make speaking difficult, but not tight enough to suffocate her. Against her will he propped her head backwards, preparing her mouth for penetration. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"No.. oh my god.. n...\" she tried to muster out, before Travis began his entry. He streamlined his spiritual form to fit down her narrow passage, and forced his way down her throat to merge into her. Vanessa's eyes rolled back in her head and her body grew weak as Travis assumed his consciousness into her vessel. She went completely limp and collapsed onto the floor, posing little fight to Travis' assertion. After a few brief moments out cold, Vanessa slowly opened her eyes, only she was no longer Vanessa. Travis was.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Where the hell... what the hell.. MY VOICE?\" he cried. \"Holy Shit! It worked!\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe darted himself up and immediately tumbled, thrown off balance by his new anatomy. He collected himself and looked at his new body in the mirror, shocked by the Latina Barbie-doll looking back. He turned his head side-to-side and watched as she did too; he raised his hand and watched as she did too; he placed both hands on her breasts and watched as she did too.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Wow... I... I don't even know what to say right now..\" <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTravis continued to scan over his new body, enjoying all the new feminine sensations.   <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Hmmm I'd really like to get to know Vanessa more, but I know that people are expecting her to be at the party tonight...\"</span></div></div>",

The mirror itself was nothing special-- someone had left it sitting by the side of the street. But his reflection was something else-- a ghostly, nearly-transparent version of himself. This is what he'd always wanted it, and it seemed a shame to let the moment pass without a little admiration first....<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHis being brimmed with power, and not just the power to take over bodies, either. He could do it now....he could feel the ability right at his fingertips. He reached out for it and embraced it, letting the feeling wash over him with unbridled glee. His astral form shifted and morphed until he could feel that he was completely, totally different.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe opened his eyes to see that his wishes had come true. Heh. Wishes.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHe'd changed into the shape of a genie-- a kind of cross between a genie he'd seen on reruns of some classic tv show and a cute cartoon character he'd seen once upon a time. Purple hair spilled across a forehead with a horn sticking out of it, and his luscious body was barely contained in a tight brassiere and a flowing pair of baggy pants. It was better than he could have asked for. He looked so beautiful, so regal, he hardly had words for it.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo of course he had to have some fun with it. He started by sticking out his tongue and pulling down his eyelid with a single finger. The goddess in the mirror did the same and then giggled, overcome with laughter. He sounded cute this way-- cuter than he'd ever thought he'd be. With a mischievous glint in his eye, he danced back and forth on the tips of his toes. That looked too appropriate-- so he shifted to flapping his arms up and down like a chicken. That was much better.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut all of that fun was mundane...too mundane for him. The real reason he'd done this...the real reason this was so hot...was entrenched firmly between his legs. He reached down into his pants, his dainty new fingers dancing across the sensitive flesh of his new organ. He kneaded and  licked and plunged as deep as he could go, moaning softly as he went. It was better than he could describe, and worth every second he'd spent there.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAfter he was done, he pulled his hands out of his pants and contemplated his options. He could still go for some possession...or he could try experimenting further with this particular set of things...it was all so tantalizing.</span></div></div>",
