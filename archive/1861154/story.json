You shake your head in disbelief and turn the TV off. You head out of the door in desperate need for some fresh air. Fear of being the next victim in the long line of stringed out murders made the hairs on the back of your neck rise up. You have been known to have a criminal record for a few things, but never anything too serious. You start to walk through the busy streets of Japan until you bump into someone unsuspectingly.<br>\r\n\"I'm sorry, I should look where I'm going next time\", you mumbled as you looked up to see...  </span></div></div>",

He blankly looked at you as if trying to peace together a puzzle. His eyes got wide as if something snapped. \"Aren't you the one who robbed that one store?\" he said out of realization. Your cheeks began to get blood red as memories of your awful past has been brought up so abruptly. \"Yeah...that...that was me.\" Light began to smirk evilly as if he had something planned. Your eyebrow raised up in question as he began to chuckle silently to himself. \"You know\", he started, \"That Kira guy may just come after you now? He seems to have a thing for criminals.\" A chill ran down your spine as you have come to the conclusion that you were not the only one who had this thought. \"Tell you what, if you do something for me maybe I'll consider watching your back.\" Light said matter-of-factly. Considering maybe a \"guardian angel\" is what you needed, you took him up on his offer. The two of you walked to his house and entered his room, he seemed distracted by something but played it off like it was nothing. \"So what do you need me to do?\" You asked curiously. He chuckled once more as kicked his feet up on his desk. \"Well you can start by taking my shoes off.\" You questioned his tone of voice but did what you were told anyway. He was wearing tennis shoes that looked like they have seen their days. They were dirty and almost falling apart. The shoe strings went from a bright white to a filthy gray color. You untied his shoe laces and tugged the shoe off on his right foot. He cracked his toes and wiggled them around while letting out a sigh of relief. The stench was awful and his sock had a hole at the top of his big toe and one on his heel. \"Hey you should tell me what--\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>You give him a confused look before asking \"Why?\" As if somewhat offended by your question, he coldly said \"Because you agreed to be my slave, slave meaning you do as I say.\"<br>\r\nYou couldn't believe what you were hearing come from his mouth. \"When did I agree to be your--\" \"You agreed when you said you'd do something for me remember? Oh wait I forgot I never was specific when I said that. Well...it was implied anyway. Now it looks like you need some convincing there.\" He said as he leaned forward and pushed the shoe into your face. You tried to fight back but failed to make any contact with him. He was stronger than he looked, that's for sure. He placed his hand on the back of your head and pushed you further into the shoe. The smell filled your lungs and was actually making you sick. It smelled like sweat and garlic, and for the record that is a disgusting mixture. \"Come on! Really sniff those bitches! You like it?\" He said aggressively. You didn't like it whatsoever, and to be frankly honest you thought that you'd rather just be killed by Kira than sniffing this guys feet. He finally released your head and threw the shoe on the ground. Not only did he mess up your hair, but you felt sick to your stomach. He pushed his other foot into your face and simply said \"Now take the other shoe off. I hope your enjoying this as much as I am.\" A dark and twisted laugh echoed from the walls of his room as you untie his shoe laces and pulled the stinking shoe off. Before you knew it he was wiggling his socked toes in your face. \"How about you give those toes a whiff, I bet they smell great.\"</span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>\"Light...\" You started as you tried to move your head away from the stinky foot, \"I'm sure there is something else I can do. I could do your homework for month!\" Light simply lowered his foot and said \"I am the smartest person in my class...why would I need someone below my level to do my homework?\" Your face grew wide in disbelief as you felt humiliated, insulted, and scared at the same time. Light obviously showed how unpredictable and strong he was, if you defied him he could do anything to you. Before you knew it Light's big and second toe was wrapped around your nose cutting off all fresh air from entering your nostrils. Right before you opened your mouth to breathe in Light used the sole of his other socked foot to cover your mouth of any attempts to breathe in any fresh air. A cocky and sinister grin stretched across his face. You knew you had to breathe soon, and the only possible way was to breathe out of your nose. The way Light's foot was over your mouth made you unable to even open it. \"Come on now...breathe in those smelly toes. You can't hold your breathe but so much longer\", Light said with a evil grin. You realized you couldn't hold your breathe much longer, so you take your chances and breathe out of your nose as much as you can. The stench of his toes infiltrated your entire sense of smell, and it became so bad that a tear fell from your eye. A roaring laugh rose from Light's lips as he clinched your nose with his toes even harder. You tried to scream in protest but it was of no use as his other foot was still covering your mouth. This was literally torture for you, and now you wished that Kira would just simply kill you to take you out of your misery. He finally released your nose and took his other foot off your mouth letting you fill your lungs with the fresh air you never have appreciated so much before. Light put his index finger to his lip and said \"I wonder...what else could I do to you?\" </span></div></div>",

            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Light propped his foot up across his knee and began to run his index finger along the soles of his sock. \"Man these things are pretty sweaty, that's where you come in.\" Your eyebrow raised up in confusion. You knew this was going to end badly, but you figured if you do what he says then maybe he will set you free. He slowly let his foot fall on the ground and brought his face close to yours with a mischievous grin. \"You know what I want you to do little foot bitch?\" You flinched at the word '\"foot bitch\" wanting to protest against his statement, but you sat there silent waiting for your next task. \"I want you to suck all of the sweat and funk out of these socks, maybe if you do a good job at it I'll consider giving you some sort of reward. But of course it wont be anything big.\" He said evilly. And with that he leaned back in his chair and let out a relaxing sigh as he stretched his foot out in front of your face. You didn't know what to do from here, so you lightly grabbed his foot and stared at it for a few seconds. You refused to put his foot in your mouth, but you didn't have time to think of a plan of escape. He cleared his throat and you knew that he was getting impatient. You slowly let the tip of your tongue touch the tip of his toe and made a sour face. You barely touched his foot with your tongue and you could still taste something very bitter in your mouth. He sighed and mumbled \"Do I have to do everything?\" under his breath. With a quick jester he shoved his toes in your mouth. He wiggled them in your mouth a little bit, gagging you in the process. Tears ran down your face as you thought he was literally going to suffocate you. He boldly laughs and screams \"Come on, suck those toes like you mean it!\" His foot was going back and forth in your mouth until finally he took his toes out. Slobber and drool ran all over your shirt and the gray tip of his toes became soaked and wet in your saliva. He laughed and wiggled his wet toes before inserting them back into your mouth. The process repeated until he finally took them out once more. He checked his right foot out making sure you didn't miss a spot. With his left foot he pushed you down on the floor. As soon as the back of your head hit the soft yet hard carpet his wheeled his chair over you and placed his left foot firmly on your chest. \"Alright, now that you are in a more comfortable position, how about--\"</span></div></div>",

It took some effort, but once you finally had it off a flurry of sock lint came raining down on you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLight simply scrunched his bare toes around the sock you were holding in your hand and placed it firmly under your nose with his foot. \"How about you smell that for a bit?\" He suggested, obviously not giving you much of a choice. The heel of his foot was on top of your lip, so you decided smelling a sock was better than tasting a foot. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou inhaled the part of the sock where his toes go and felt a rush of green flood your face. \"Keep sniffing.\" He commanded above you. Each breathe you took in with your nostrils was torture. Pieces of lint were getting stuck in your nose hair, and while you tried to squirm, he simply rubbed his bare foot side to side over your nose, smothering you with his sock. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"Okay, that's enough sock sniffing for now. How about you sniff these toes instead?\" He teased by wiggling his toes right above your nose. You saw sock lint was attached to his foot, and the more he wiggled his toes the more sock lint fell off his foot and onto your face. \"But of course, sniffing between my toes would be too easy, now wouldn't it?\" Before you had time to ask any questions, he stomped on your chest with his other socked foot and you opened your mouth to scream in pain. While your mouth was open he stuffed the sock into your mouth, gagging you in the process. He placed his barefoot firmly over your face and leaned back in his chair. \"Much better.\"</span></div></div>",
