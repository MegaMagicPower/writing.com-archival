            "content":"<div class=\"\"><div> <span>Monster Physiology, hmm? Well, as the old saying goes, \"In order to kill a monster, sometimes you must become one yourself.\" As for what this sort of transformation power does exactly, it allows one to transform the user to take on the form of a monster, a creature that is often hideous and may produce fear or cause physical harm by either it's appearance or it's actions. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe word \"Monster\" derives from the Latin word \"monstrum\", an aberrant occurrence, usually biological, that was taken as a sign that  something was wrong within the natural order. The word connotes something wrong or evil; a monster is generally morally objectionable, physically or psychologically hideous, and/or a freak of nature. Sometimes, this sort of ability is also known as Monster Form, Monster Mimicry, or Monstrous Physiology.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMonster Physiology works as a physical superpower, due to using this ability will cause the user to physically change and alter their form into that of a monstrous creature, giving the user access to the following abilities listed below here:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Enhanced Condition or Supernatural Condition<br>\r\n---Enhanced Durability/Invulnerability<br>\r\n---Enhanced Endurance<br>\r\n---Enhanced Strength<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Fear Inducement<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Supernaturally Dense Tissue<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, having the ability to transform into a monster tends to have a few drawbacks. For example, you may lose sentience while you're in that transformed physical state, making you act more prone out of instinct. Second, transforming into a monster might be difficult, due to you possibly experiencing a painful transformation, feeling every part of your body, from your bones to your own flesh, tearing apart, rearranging, and repairing itself to fit your new intimidating physique. Also, you could cause widespread panic if you're seen by the public, even if you're trying to tell them that you're one of the \"good guys\".<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow, I understand that you're thinking that monsters take on various different forms throughout different types of media. So to counteract this problem, I will be setting up 3 different choices for various monsters; Science Monster Physiology, Cryptid Monster Physiology, and Mythical Monster Physiology. <br>\r\n</span></div></div>",

Interesting choice, despite he's somewhat fresh in the world of video game monsters, especially coming from a game that was recently released on Feb. 10th, 2015. However, that doesn't mean Goliath won't hesitate to tear it's enemies limb from limb!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow then, due to EVOLVE's gameplay, Goliath has 3 various heights, one for each stage of evolution it goes through; 8 feet tall at Stage 1, 16 feet tall at Stage 2, and an intimidating 30 feet tall at Stage 3. However, the larger he is, the stronger Goliath becomes, with Stage 1 being his weakest form and Stage 3 being his strongest form. But when it comes to transforming into Goliath, the transformation occurs if your heartbeat ever reaches 99 bpm(beats per minute), which is caused by anger or extreme stress. Once that happens, you'll start changing into Goliath and the only way to change back is from either slowing down your heart rate or if you fall unconscious due to exhaustion.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs Goliath, you have access to different natural weapons in your organic arsenal. Your bite and jaw strength is the equivalent of 13 crocodiles, as you are able to use your powerful muscles and sharp claws to tear your enemies apart, along with climbing up vertical walls with ease, using your claws like a set of hook-like spikes. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nDue to this amount of sheer strength, you're capable of hurling boulders at your opponent to deal heavy damage upon whoever was unfortunate enough to stand in the way, with the maximum range being 167 feet. Although Goliath is a bipedal monster, he is capable of doing a Charge Attack, where as Goliath, you will get down on all fours and sprint at your enemies, ramming them at sickening speeds, best used against multiple enemies who are lined up in a narrow area for maximum damage. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut it comes to the element of surprise or just being on the aggressive side of combat, Goliath is capable of perform these powerful locomotion jumps that have allow him to perform the Leap Attack, which have a range of 52 feet, thanks to the powerful muscles in Goliath's arms and legs. And speaking of surprises, when you want to have your enemies burnt to a smoldering crisp, Goliath's Flame Breath will do just that, allowing this monster to breathe out a fiery jet of hot skin and flesh-cooking flames, reaching an impressive 82 foot radius and spreads at 23 feet per second. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nOverall, Goliath is the type of monster that wants to get in your face, bite your head off, and burn your beyond any hope of recognition!  *Ahem* Anyway, now that we finally have things in place, let's get started, shall we?</span></div></div>",

His life was once a normal one, that is, until tragedy struck. What was once tragedy turned into rage in the man's eyes. And from his rage....a Monster was born.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n///<br>\r\n<br>\r\nA wise man once said \"Be careful when fighting monsters, lest you become one yourself.\" Your name is Dalton Rowe, and so far....you've become a monster yourself, aptly named \"Goliath\". Ever since that tragic incident 12 months ago, you've been on the run from Hunters who see you as a destructive beast, just as you quickly woke up in the middle of the night once more in cold sweat, doing your best to contain the monster inside you from clawing back out, heavily breathing from another nightmare.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeeling like you couldn't get any sleep, you decided to get out of bed inside your dorm. After all, you were currently enrolled in a school for the arts known as \"Gold Crown Academy\". Aside from the classes involving drawing, sculpting, music, and drama, Gold Crown Academy was best known for it's ballet program. After all, you were the ballet class's top pianist, despite that certain dark secret locked away inside you. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nShortly after making your way to the bathroom, you switched on one of the lights, turned on the water, and splashed some water onto your face to calm down your nerves, since you needed to stay calm in order to prevent having another \"episode\". <span class=\"clkhaki\">\"*sigh*....I can't believe it's been almost 5 months since the last time I've....changed.\"</span> You said to yourself, looking at your reflection in the mirror. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nYour appearance was that of a 19 year old guy, with an athletic appearance to your physique. Your hair was very short and was a mix between blonde and brunette hair, more commonly known as \"Dirty Blonde\" hair. Your eyes were a Jade Green hue, as you looked at your own reflection with those eyes, fully aware that your \"other half\" was trying to claw it's way out of the dark recesses of your mind, attempting to make you transform once again into the monster, Goliath.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nHowever, even if you do transform into Goliath, you fortunately have managed to somehow gain control of yourself while you're still in that monstrous form. After cooling your nerves down some, you went back to bed, despite having some slight trouble falling asleep for about an hour before finally getting some rest. 6 to 7 hours later, morning had arrived. Although you were still sleeping a bit, you then heard someone knocking on your door repeatedly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nReminding you that you still had a job to do at the ballet class, you woke up at a slow and groggy pace, walking toward the door to see who exactly is trying to get your attention. But when you finally reached the door and turned the knob to open it, you found that it was...</span></div></div>",

After all, as far as you can remember of your childhood, you and Rue were great friends, almost as if the two of you were siblings. Minus the continuous bickering, of course.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSo, in both curiosity and concern, you looked at Rue and asked, <span class=\"clkhaki\">\"What's the matter?

If you're upset, then I'm upset as well for your well-being.\" </span>You said, showing how much you cared about her, and that you weren't going to leave it there until you make her feel better.

Well, whether you've chose this power because you happen to be a fan of Venom or any of the other Symbiotes from the Spider-Man series or not, this is a power that should not be taken lightly.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAs for why I say this, it is because you, the user, have become a host to a physical being, allowing you to manifest this sort of power in the form of a symbiotic costume, granting you enhanced physical abilities, like superhuman strength and prowess, as well as enhanced regeneration and immunity. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThough like anything in life, there is a price to everything. You see, when you use said symbiote costume, there is a possible chance that the symbiote may take you over completely and/or driving you to the point of insanity. Other than that, both the symbiote and it's host may need each other to survive, as well as possibly needing to be at a mutual relationship on any degree. Plus, there might be a possibility that while using the symbiotic costume, you could be weakened by a certain power or substance, like sound waves or fire for a great example.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow then, enough about the pros and cons about Biological Symbiosis, let's talk about the abilities you can use at your disposal when using a symbiotic costume. As for what said abilities are, here's a list for you to see below this paragraph:<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Amorphous Physiology<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Camouflage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Dermal Armor<br>\r\n\t-Skin Hardening<br>\r\n\t-Supernaturally Dense Tissue<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Dimensional Storage<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Divided Mind<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-DNA Replication<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Elasticity<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Genetic Memory<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Goo Generation<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Knowledge Replication<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Life-Force Absorption<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Malleable Anatomy<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Natural Weaponry<br>\r\n\t-Claw Retraction<br>\r\n\t-Enhanced Bite<br>\r\n\t-Tentacle/Tendril Extension<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Organic Constructs<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Parasite Physiology<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Power Replication<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Power Suit<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Powered Structure<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Prehensile Hair<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Regenerative Healing Factor<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Shapeshifting<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Size Manipulation<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Symbiosis<br>\r\n<br>\r\n-Weapon Manipulation<br>\r\n<br>\r\nNow as for any known users for having a Biological Symbiosis, the most well-known users of this type of superpower are Venom, Carnage, and all the other Symbiotes from the Spider-Man franchise.

And now, the owner of this Interactive Story would like to begin with the following information and guidance:</span><br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlright then, ladies and gentlemen, here are the rules<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1. Female Characters only! That means no dating any male characters like Mythos or Fakir.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n2. No gross stuff<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3. No drugs, etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n4. No killing off the Main Character (that's you), or the girl of your choice.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5.If you have sex with the girl of your choice, please give us a warning.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n6. If you plan on giving the character a name, you must at least make it sound like an anime name, like \"Ash Krieg\" or some other name like that.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n7. Due to the girls in the anime being under the age of 18, I will be having the girls in Princess Tutu be AT LEAST 18 years of age. For good reasons, of course. The guys will be 18 years of age as well to balance things out.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n8. Just to add some variety, there will be an option to add new powers.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n9. I would like it if you had the dialogue you have for the characters in different colorations please, make things a little easier to read at times.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n10. Go into detail when writing and adding new chapters, don't just write down a single sentence or paragraph that says something like \"You fell in love with Ahiru and lived happily ever after.\"<br>\r\n<br>\r\n11. Have Fun!</td>",
